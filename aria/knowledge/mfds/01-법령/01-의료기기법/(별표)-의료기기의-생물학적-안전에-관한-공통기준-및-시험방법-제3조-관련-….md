2) 안전하게 사용된 이력이 포함된 기존의 전임상 및 임상 데이터가 생물학적 평가의 요구기준
을 충족하여 추가적인 동물실험이 비윤리적이라고 판단되는 경우. 원자재를 사용하기 전에 생
물학적 평가에 대한 데이터의 관련성을 평가하는 경우에는 기존 데이터에 대한 신뢰도 수준을 
반드시 고려해야 한다. 
제4항에서 언급한 일반사항과 다음의 사항을 고려하여 의료기기의 생물학적 시험이 시행되어야 한
다.
1) 시험은 완제품 또는 완제품과 같은 방법으로 처리된 물질에서 나온 대표적인 검체에 대해 
시행되어야 한다.
2) 시험방법의 선정 시에 다음 사항을 고려한다.
  ① 일반적인 사용조건에서의 의료기기와 인체접촉의 특성(nature)과 접촉의 정도, 시간, 빈도와 
상태
  ② 완제품의 물리ㆍ화학적 특성
  ③ 완제품을 형성하고 있는 화학성분 또는 화합물의 독성
  ④ 완제품에 용해물의 성분이 없는 경우와 용해물이 존재하더라도 잘 알려져 있는 물질이거나 
독성에 문제가 없는 경우에는 특정한 시험(전신에 대한 영향을 평가하는 시험)이 적용되지 않
을 수 있다.
  ⑤ 환자의 인체 크기에 대한 의료기기 접촉 표면적과의 관계
  ⑥ 문헌, 경험 및 비임상 시험에 근거한 정보
  ⑦ 의료기기의 사용 시 사용하는 사람의 생물학적 안전을 확보하는 것이 본 기준규격의 첫 
번째 목적이고, 두 번째 목적은 시험동물보호를 위하여 시험 시 사용되는 시험동물의 수와 
사용을 최소화 하고자 하는 것이다.
3) 의료기기 용출물을 제조할 때, 용출용매와 용출조건이 완제품의 특성 및 사용조건에 적합하
여야 한다.
4) 시험 시 적절한 양성 및 음성 대조군이 사용되어야 한다.
5) 생물학적 시험의 결과가 생물학적 위해요소(hazard)가 없음을 보증하지는 않는다. 따라서 생
물학적 평가 후에 의료기기의 임상사용에서 예상하지 못한 부작용을 자세히 관찰하여야 한다. 
6.2 초기 평가시험
6.2.1 세포독성(cytotoxicity)시험
본 시험은 세포배양 기술을 이용하여 의료기기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물에 의한 세포의 용
해(세포의 사멸), 세포성장의 저해, 군집 형성, 기타 세포에 대한 영향을 측정하는 시험이다.[제5
장(ISO 10993-5) 참조]
6.2.2 지연성 과민반응(delayed-type hypersensitivity)시험
본 시험에서 적절한 시험동물모델을 이용하여 의료기기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물에 대한 접촉
감작성의 잠재성을 추정하려면 과민반응시험을 이용해야 한다.[제9장(ISO 10993-10) 참조]
심지어 미량의 잠재적 용해물에 대한 노출이나 접촉조차 알레르기나 감작 반응으로 귀결될 수 있기 
때문에 이런 시험은 중요하다.
6.2.3 자극성(irritation)시험(피내반응 포함)
적합한 모델 내에서 피부, 눈 및 점막과 같은 적절한 적용 부위를 이용하여 의료기기, 원자재 및/


- 6 -
또는 이들의 용출물의 잠재적 자극성을 측정하려면 자극시험을 수행해야 한다. 이러한 시험들은 
노출이나 접촉의 경로(피부, 눈, 점막)와 접촉기간이 적절해야 한다.[제9장(ISO 10993-10) 참조]
의료기기 용출물에 대한 인체 조직의 국소 반응을 평가하려면 피내반응 시험을 수행해야 한다. 진
피 또는 점막에 대한 자극성의 측정이 부적절한 경우에 적용할 수 있다.(예, 의료기기가 이식되거
나 혈액과 접촉하는 경우)
본 시험은 용출가능액이 소수성인 경우에도 유용할 수 있다.[제9장(ISO 10993-10) 참조]
6.2.4 전신독성(급성)[systemic toxicity(acute)]시험
본 시험은 시험동물에 의료기기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물을 24시간 이내에 1회 또는 여러 
번 노출 시켰을 때 시험동물에 나타나는 잠재적 위해(harm)를 측정하기 위한 것이다. 본 시험은 
의료기기가 접촉될 때 독성 용해물 및 분해산물이 흡수될 가능성이 있을 때 적절하다.[제10장
(ISO 10993-11) 참조]
발열성시험은 의료기기 또는 원자재의 용출물 내에서 발열반응을 일으키는 매개물질을 감지하는 
시험이다. 단일시험으로는 엔도톡신 감염에 의한 발열반응인지, 매개물질에 의한 발열반응인지 구별
할 수 없다.
급성 전신독성시험은 아급성독성과 아만성독성 그리고 이식시험 방법과 함께 수행할 수 있다.
6.2.5 아급성 및 아만성 독성(subacute and subchronic toxicity)시험
본 시험은 의료기기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물을 24시간 이상에서 시험동물 수명의 10%(랫
드의 경우에는 최대 13주) 이내로 1회 또는 여러 번 노출 시켰을 때 나타나는 영향을 측정하기 
위해서 수행된다.
만성독성시험자료가 있는 물질이 아급성 및 아만성 독성을 평가하기에 충분한 경우라면 본 시험
이 면제될 수 있다. 시험을 면제하는 이유는 전반적인 생물학적 평가 보고서에 첨부되어야 한다. 
본 시험은 접촉경로와 접촉시간이 적절해야 한다.
아급성 및 아만성 독성시험은 제10장(ISO 10993-11)에서 제공된다.
아급성 및 아만성 전신독성시험방법은 아급성과 아만성 전신 및 국소 영향 평가를 위한 이식시험
방법을 포함하여 확대할 수 있다.
6.2.6 유전독성(genotoxicity)시험
체외 유전독성시험은 포유동물 혹은 비포유동물의 세포 배양 또는 다른 기법을 사용하여 의료기
기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물에 의한 유전자 변이, 염색체 구조 및 수의 변화, DNA 또는 유
전자 독성을 평가한다.
체외 시험 중 양성 반응이 나타날 경우, 체내 돌연변이 유발성시험을 수행하거나 원자재가 돌연
변이 유발성이라고 가정해야 한다.[제3장(ISO 10993-3)참조]
6.2.7 이식(implantation)시험
본 시험은 원자재 또는 완제품의 검체를 이식 부위 또는 적용하고자 하는 적절한 조직(특정한 치
과용 용도시험)에 외과적으로 이식하거나 배치하여 육안 및 현미경 관찰로 살아있는 조직의 국소
병리학적 영향을 평가하기 위한 것이다. 이런 시험은 접촉경로와 접촉시간이 적절해야 한다.
이식시험방법은 급성, 아급성, 아만성, 그리고 만성 독성시험의 요구기준을 만족하는 국소 및 전
신 영향 평가를 수행하기 위해서 확대될 수도 있다.
6.2.8 혈액적합성(haemocompatibility)시험


- 7 -
본 시험은 적절한 시험동물모델 또는 시스템을 사용하여 혈액 또는 혈액 구성성분에 대한 혈액 
접촉성 의료기기 및 원자재의 영향을 평가하기 위한 것이다. 
혈액적합성시험 중 하나인 용혈반응은 의료기기, 원자재 및/또는 이들의 체외 용출물에 의한 적혈
구 용해 및 헤모글로빈 방출 정도를 결정한다.
기타 특정 혈액적합성시험은 임상적 적용기간동안 의료기기 또는 원자재의 기하학적 구조, 접촉조
건과 유체역학적 요소를 모의하고, 혈액, 원자재 및 의료기기의 상호작용을 결정하기 위한 것이
다.[제4장(ISO 10993-4)참조]
6.3  추가적인 평가시험
6.3.1 만성독성(chronic toxicity)시험

경우에는 일반적으로 6개월) 1회 노출 또는 여러 번 노출시켰을 때 나타나는 영향을 측정하기 위
한 것이다. 이런 시험은 접촉경로와 접촉시간이 적절하여야 한다[제10장(ISO 10993-11) 참조].
만성 전신독성시험방법은 만성 전신 및 국소 영향 평가를 위한 이식시험방법을 포함하여 확대될 
수 있다.
6.3.2 발암성(carcinogenicity)시험
원자재 및 의료기기에 대해 아무런 정보도 없는 경우라면, 잠재적 발암성시험을 고려해야 한다. 
하지만, 발암성시험이 의료기기에 적절하다고 보기에는 힘들다.[제3장(ISO 10993-3) 참조] 발암
성시험은 의료기기 및 원자재 또는 이들의 용출물을 시험동물의 수명 중 주요기간 동안 1회 노출 
혹은 여러 번 노출시키거나 또는 접촉시켜서 종양 형성의 가능성을 평가한다. 이런 시험은 노출 
및 접촉의 경로와 시간이 적절하여야 하며, 수명 연구나 유전자변형 모델이 적절할 수도 있다. 본 
시험은 단일 실험적 연구에서 만성독성과 종양형성 여부를 모두 검사하기 위해 설계될 수 있다.
6.3.3 생식과 발생독성(reproductive and developmental toxicity)시험
본 시험은 생식 기능, 배 발달(최기형성), 태아기 및 출생 후 초기 발달에 대한 의료기기 및 원자
재 또는 이들 용출물의 잠재적 영향을 평가하기 위한 것이다. 생식/발생독성시험이나 생물학적 검
정법은 의료기기가 적용개체의 생식능력에 잠재적 영향을 줄 수 있는 경우에 한하여 시행되어야 
한다. 이 외에도 임신 중에 사용되는 의료기기 및 원자재에 대해서는 반드시 이와 같은 시험을 고
려해야 한다. 의료기기의 적용부위는 시험을 수행할 경우에 주요기준이 된다. 생식과 발생독성시
험은 제3장(ISO 10993-3)에 기술되어 있다. 
6.3.4 생분해성(biodegradation)시험
다음과 같은 경우에 생분해성시험을 고려해야 한다.
1) 의료기기가 생분해될 수 있도록 설계된 경우

있다고 표시되는 경우
분해율에 영향을 미치는 파라미터가 기술되고 문서화되어야 한다.


- 8 -
생분해성의 메커니즘을 반드시 기술해야 한다. 노출을 추정하기 위해서 분해율과 잠재적 독성 화
학물질의 방출을 결정하려면 이러한 메커니즘은 체외에서 시뮬레이션 해야 한다. 원자재의 생분
해성을 평가하려면 체내 시험이 필요할 수도 있다.
다음과 같은 경우에는 생분해성시험이 필요하지 않을 수도 있다.
1) 분해산물이 예측된 수량만큼 있고, 임상적으로 안전하게 사용된 이력을 지닌 것과 유사한 
비율로 생산되는 경우
2) 분해산물이 미립자일 때 이들이 임상적으로 안전하게 사용된 이력을 지녔거나 원래 목적대
로 사용 중인 물질 및 분해산물과 관련된 충분한 분해 데이터를 지닌 것과 유사한 물리적 상태
(크기 분포와 형상)로 이미 존재하는 경우
생분해성시험에 대한 일반적인 구성은 제8장(ISO 10993-9)에 제공되어 있다.
중합체, 세라믹스 및 금속에 대한 특정 체외 생분해성시험은 각각 제12장(ISO 10993-13), 제14
장(ISO 10993-13) 및 제14장(ISO 10993-15)에 기술되어 있다.
6.3.5 독성동태 연구(toxicokinetic studies)
독성동태학적 연구를 시행하는 목적은 독성이 있다고 알려지거나 혹은 독성이 알려지지 않은 화학
물질 중에서 흡수, 분포, 대사와 배설 등을 평가하는 것이다. 이런 연구는 생리학 기반의 약물동태
학 모델링을 이용하여 건강 위해요소(hazard)를 평가하기 위해서 대상(목표) 인체 기관(들)에게 
전달되는 노출량을 결정하는 데에도 도움을 줄 수 있다. 성, 연령, 종 및 노출량/노출 전반에 걸
친 시험 결과 추정도 가능할 수 있지만, 이를 실행하고 설명하려면 전문가의 정밀한 판단이 필요
하다.
의료기기, 원자재 및/또는 이들 용출물들의 용해물과 분해산물에서 흡수, 분포, 대사와 제거 과정
을 결정하기 위한 체내 독성동태학적 연구에 대한 필요성[6.3.4 및 제15장(ISO 10993-16) 참
조]은 체외 생분해성 연구로부터 나온 결과를 이용하여 고려되어야 한다.
의료기기의 생물학적 평가의 일부로서 독성동태학적 연구 시행 여부를 결정하는 경우, 의료기기
를 사용하면서 발생될 수 있는 잠재적인 분해산물과 용해물을 포함하여 완제품 및 그 화학적 성
분을 모두 고려해야 한다.(6.3.4 참조)
제2장(ISO 10993-2)에서 제공된 바와 같이 동물 복지에 관한 이유에서 뿐만 아니라, 발생될 수 있
는 분해산물을 측정하기 위해서라도 체외 실험(조직, 세포 균질 현탁액 또는 세포)에 의한 독성동
태학적 연구를 수행하기 전에 이론적 분해과정을 조사해야 한다.
다음과 같은 경우라면 독성동태학적 연구를 고려해야 한다.
1) 의료기기가 생체에 흡수되도록 설계되는 경우
2) 의료기기가 영구적으로 인체와 접촉하는 이식형 장치이며, 생분해성 혹은 심각한 부식이 알려
져 있거나 알려져 있을 가능성이 크고/크거나, 의료기기로부터 용해물의 이동이 발생하는 경우
3) 임상적 사용기간 동안, 잠재적으로 독성 또는 반응성인 분해산물 및 용해물의 상당한 양이 
의료기기로부터 신체 속으로 방출될 가능성이 크거나 그렇다고 알려진 경우
특정한 의료기기나 원자재로부터 나온 분해산물 및 용해물의 실제 또는 예상 방출 비율이 예전의 
유사한 경험에 대한 참고자료에 따라 임상적 노출 수준이 안전하다고 판단되었던 경우, 혹은 분
해산물 및 용해물과 관련된 충분한 독성 데이터나 독성동태학적 데이터가 이미 존재하는 경우, 
독성동태학적 연구는 필요하지 않다. 
원자재가 생분해되도록 설계되지 않는 한, 금속, 합금 및 세라믹으로부터 나온 용해물 및 분해산


- 9 -
물의 방출은 통상 너무 적어서 독성동태학적 연구가 필요하지 않다.
분해산물 및 용해물에 대한 독성동태학적 연구 설계는 제15장(ISO 10993-16)에 제공되어 있다.
6.3.6 면역독성(immunotoxicology)시험
ISO/TS 10993-20은 의료기기의 잠재적 면역독성을 정밀하게 참조하면서 개략적인 면역독성학
을 설명한다. 제품 원자재의 화학적 특성과 면역독성학적 영향을 제시하는 데이터를 기반으로 또
는 화학물질 중 어떤 것의 면역학적 잠재력이 알려지지 않았는지 여부를 기반으로 하여 면역독성
시험을 고려해야 한다.
7 생물학적 평가시험항목 선정 지침
  
평가는 관련 경험에 대한 연구와 실제 시험으로 이루어진다. 만일 설계 중인 의료기기의 특정 역
할에 대하여 동일한 역할로 사용된 이력이 있음을 증명할 수 있다면, 시험이 필요하지 않을 수도 
있다.
표 1은 의료기기의 접촉기간을 고려한 초기 평가시험을 나타내고, 표 2는 의료기기의 접촉시간을 
고려한 추가적인 평가시험을 나타낸다.
의료기기의 다양성 때문에 카테고리에 명시된 시험항목 전부가 필요하거나 적용 가능한 것은 아
니다. 시험항목 선정 시, 각 제품의 고유한 이점을 반드시 고려하여야 하며, 어떤 경우에는 카테
고리에 명시되어 있지 않은 시험이 추가적으로 필요할 수도 있다. 시험을 선택하거나 면제한 근
거를 기록하는 것이 필요하다.
8 시험방법의 보증
8.1 시험방법의 보증
생물학적 시험에서 사용되는 시험방법은 민감, 정밀, 정확하여야 한다. 시험결과는 실험실 내
(intralaboratory) 반복성과 실험실 간(interlaboratory) 재현성이 있어야 한다.
8.2 지속적인 보증
의료기기의 사용목적에 적합한 원자재임을 보증하는 것과 이에 대한 장기간에 걸친 지속적인 검
증은 품질관리를 통하여 이루어지게 된다.

방법을 반영해야 한다.
이에 대한 정보를 구하거나 확보하지 않고 동물실험을 수행하거나, 이러한 판단 및 대책을 이행
하지 않은 상태로 동물 실험을 수행하는 것은 본 장의 필수 요구기준에 부합하지 않는다.
주) 이 원칙과 본 장의 필수 요구기준은 다른 맥락에서 의료기기 원자재와 의료기기를 대상으로 
수행하는 동물실험에도 부합될 수 있다.
3.2 동물실험의 정당화


- 16 -
사람에서의 안전성을 보장하기 위하여 필요한 경우, 의료기기에 사용되는 원자재의 적절한 생물
학적 특성분석을 위한 동물실험이 인정될 수 있다.
기준규격의 목적에 비추어 다음의 경우에만 동물실험의 수행이 정당하다고 간주해야 한다.

없는 경우
d) 사용된 동물에게 가해지는 고통, 스트레스, 통증, 지속성 위해를 최소화하기 위한 다른 적절한 
방법을 확인하고 수행한 경우
3.3 동물실험 수행자의 자격
동물실험은 주어진 책임업무를 수행할 역량이 있는 사람에 의해 설계되고 수행되며 해석되어야 
한다.
동물실험은 수의학, 실험동물학, 동물사육 및 관리에 대한 전문지식이 있는 사람이 관여하여 설계
하고 수행해야 한다.
이러한 기준을 충족하기 위한 실험 수행자의 경험, 자격 조건, 교육 훈련(지속적인 전문성 개발을 
포함) 확보 방법을 상세하게 문서화해야한다.
주) 이 장에서 비록 객관적 기준을 제시하지는 않았지만, 동물실험 수행 시 적용된 방법이 사용된 
동물에 대한 세심하고 바람직한 행동이었음을 증명하는 것(예. 실험동물 수행에 있어 적절한 “관
리 체계”를 가졌음)은 상당히 중요하다. 
3.4 동물실험의 계획과 수행


- 17 -
3.4.1 일반사항
동물실험의 선택과 계획은 실험동물이 겪을 수 있는 통증, 고통, 스트레스 및 지속성 위해를 최소
화하면서 연구의 특정 과학적 목적을 충족시키기에 적절하여야 한다. 
3.2에 명시한 바와 같이, 동물실험은 필요한 정보가 시험검체의 특성분석에 필수적이나 다른 방
법으로는 그 결과를 얻을 수 없으며, 살아있는 동물을 사용하지 않는 적합하고 과학적으로 검증
된 실험방법이 합리적이지 않고, 실제적으로 없는 경우에만 실시한다.
대체, 감소, 개선방법을 합리적으로 최대한 고려한 후 동물실험을 수행하기에 앞서 시험책임자 및
/또는 시험의뢰자는 연구에 사용되는 동물복지와 관련된 비용을 최소화하기 위한 다른 대체, 감
소, 또는 개선방법이 없다는 것을 증명하고 문서화해야 한다.
주) 최종실험을 설계하고 수행하기 전에 실험디자인을 최적화하기 위하여 파일럿 실험(pilot 
study)이 요구되는 경우도 있다.
본 장에서 동물실험에 사용되는 각종 동물 종, 발달단계 또는 동물의 수를 충분한 정보를 바탕으
로 선택하라고 제시하거나 허용하는 경우 실험의 과학적 유효성을 보장하고, 동물의 통증, 스트레
스, 고통, 또는 지속성 위해를 최소화할 수 있는 방향으로 결정해야 한다. 그 결정의 근거는 문서
화한다.
3.4.2 재사용
개별동물을 위한 누적복지비용이 지나치지 않도록 할 필요성은 사용되는 동물 수를 최소화할 필
요성과 균형이 맞아야 한다.
일반적으로 한 동물을 한 종류 이상의 실험에 사용하지 않는다.
동물실험 과정에서 통증과 고통을 경험한 동물이나 이전 실험이 다음 실험의 결과에 영향을 끼칠 
수 있을 때는 동물을 재사용하지 않는다.
재사용은 과학적 목표에 부합해야 하며, 개별 동물에 대한 누적된 복지비용이 비합리적인 수준이 
되지 않도록 해야 한다.
모든 실험동물의 재사용 내용은 문서화해야 하며, 이 때 이전에 사용된 내용을 요약 정리하고, 이 
항목에 제시된 요구기준을 고려하고 이 기준이 충족되었음을 밝혀야 한다.
3.5 실험 방법 - in vitro 및 in vivo 실험 순서
동물실험의 타당성을 제시하고 동물실험을 수행할 때 유발될 수 있는 모든 통증이나 고통과 동물
실험의 양을 모두 최소화 할 수 있는 계층적 접근방식으로 실험방법을 수립해야한다. 특히, 적절
하며 과학적으로 검증된 합리적이고 실제적으로 사용가능한 in vitro실험을 수행하고 결과를 평가
하기 전에 불필요한 동물실험을 실시해서는 안 된다.
검체의 생체적합성에 관한 충분한 정보와 자료가 있어 타당하고 의미 있는 위험평가(risk 
assessment)가 가능하다면(예: 참고문헌 및/또는 자료 검색, 이전 스크리닝 실험결과, 검증된 in 
vitro 실험 결과, 이전 동물실험 결과 또는 기타 관련 증거) 동물실험을 수행해서는 안 된다.


- 18 -
실험 방법의 근거를 문서화한다.
3.6 동물 관리 및 사육
3.6.1 일반사항
가능하다면 반드시 목적에 맞도록 번식된 동물(purpose-bred animal)을 사용하고 그렇지 않은 
동물(non-purpose bred animal)을 사용할 때는 타당성을 구체적으로 제시해야 한다. 
목적에 맞도록 번식된 동물을 사용하지 않는다면, 사용동물의 출처에 관한 세부정보와 타당성을 
문서화해야한다.
높은 수준의 실험동물 관리 및 사육은 사용 동물의 복지를 증진시키고 동물실험의 과학적 유효성
을 촉진시킨다. 동물관리 및 사육방법은 최소한 국가 또는 국제기구가 발행한 동물 관리, 사육시
설 및 사육방법 가이드라인에 반드시 부합해야 한다.
관련 가이드라인이나 기준을 참고해야 하며, 기준준수 증거(또는 비준수 사항과 이런 부분이 사용
된 동물의 복지 및 얻어진 결과의 유효성에 미칠 영향에 대한 평가)를 설명하고 그 타당성을 제
시하며 문서화해야한다.
실험동물의 복지에 최선의 방안이 아니거나 실험의 과학적 유효성을 떨어뜨리거나 또는 실험결과 
값이나 결과의 해석에 부적절한 영향을 줄 수 있는 사육시스템의 요소는 모두 문서화해야 한다.
수의학, 사육, 동물복지, 또는 과학적 이유에서 단일 개체사육이 요구되는 경우가 아니라면 사회
성이 있는 종은 안정적이고 조화되는 쌍이나 그룹으로 사육해야한다.
쌍이나 그룹으로 사육하는 것이 불가능한 경우, 단일 개체 사육의 필요성과 그 기간에 대한 타당
성을 수의학, 사육, 동물복지, 과학적 측면에서 문서화해야한다. 또한 그 결정이 과학적 결과에 미
칠 영향을 평가하고 문서화한다.
관습과 관행 자체는 타당성에 대한 근거가 될 수 없다.
3.6.2 보정(Restraint)
동물실험을 수행할 때 동물을 보정해야 한다면, 보정의 정도, 기간, 방법은 과학적 목적 달성에 
부합하는 최소 수준이어야 하며 그 내용을 문서화한다.
3.6.3 외과적 절차
모든 외과적 절차는 동물을 마취한 상태에서 수행해야 하며, 수술 중 패혈증(intra-operative 
sepsis) 발생을 최소화하기 위한 외과적 원칙과 방법을 적용한다. 외과적인 패혈증 발생시 문서화
해야한다.
우수 임상수의학적 수행 절차(good contemporary clinical veterinary practice)에 따라 책임감 
있고 효과적인 진통제의 사용을 포함한 동물의 수술 전, 도중, 후 처치에 대한 적절한 규정을 구
비해야 한다. 사후 처방계획(regimen)은 문서화하여야 한다.


- 19 -
3.7 인도적 종점(Humane endpoints)
3.7.1 일반사항
인도적 종점은 다양한 우발적 상황을 대비하기 위하여 필요한 것으로 빈사상태 또는 다른 심각한 
복지 문제의 증상이 있는 동물에게만 적용되기 위한 것은 아니다.
 
실험동물의 유지와 관련된 모든 실험동물 복지와 관리조건은 자격을 갖춘 자가 최소 매일 1 회 
점검한다. 점검 결과와 조치사항은 문서화해야한다.
중대한 이상 복지상황이 예상될 때는 관찰일정을 강화해야한다.
동물실험 중 발생할 수 있는 복지문제를 최소화하기 위하여 적절한 지지(supportive)요법, 증상에 
따른 대증(symptomatic)요법, 그리고 특이(specific)요법을 구비해야 하며, 이는 검증된 수의사가 
직접 수행하거나 검증된 수의사의 지도를 받아 수행해야한다. 이와 같은 실험동물의 치료에 대한 
규정 및 해당 치료 등을 보류하였을 때 그 근거를 문서화해야 한다. 
고통 완화가 불가능한 중증 통증이나 고통을 보이는 동물은 즉시 안락사시킨다.
안락사를 제외한 실험동물의 죽음은 본 장의 요구기준을 충족시키는 데 필요하지 않으며, 의료기
기 원자재의 생체적합성을 결정하기 위하여 요구되는 동물실험 종점으로 인정하지 않는다.  
본 장의 요구기준을 충족시키기 위하여 실시된 동물실험 과정 중에 죽은 동물에 대해서는 관련 
세부정보를 문서화하고 보관해야한다. 이러한 사항은 모든 관련 개선방법의 확인 및 수행이 실패
했다는 것을 의미하기도 한다. 
3.7.2 안락사(Euthanasia)
동물실험 종료 시 행해지는 안락사 방법은 통증이나 고통 없이 빠르고 비가역적으로 의식을 잃게 
한 다음 바로 죽이는 것이어야 한다.
선택된 안락사 방법은 이 장에 부합되는 것을 설명하는 문서에서 자세히 설명하고 정당화해야 한
다.
적절한 장비를 구비하고 적절하게 유지ㆍ관리하며, 관련 작업자도 적절하게 교육시키고 기술적 
전문성을 구비해야 한다.
3.8 시험문서(Study documentation)
시험문서에는 동물실험 요구기준의 결정방법과 동물실험 수행방법을 자세히 기술하여야 한다. 본 
장의 요구기준을 준수하였다면 관련 기구에 제출한다.

미리 기술하고 문서화해야 하며, 이 때 다음사항을 상황에 따라 적절하게 포함시킨다.
a) 실험으로 달성하고자 하는 구체적인 기준규격의 요구기준과 과학적 목적


- 20 -
b) 연구 대상 원자재의 조성 및 알려진 특성과 사용 및 적용 용도에 관한 관련 정보
c) 동물사용의 근거와 타당성(3.2 참조)
d) 다음사항을 포함하는 시험문서

   2) 양성/음성 대조의 필요성 및 시험군의 크기를 포함하여 사용한 동물 종, 발달 단계, 품
종 및 동물 수에 대한 과학적 타당성(3.2와 3.4.1 참조)
   
   3) 사용한 실험동물의 유래와 건강상태; 목적에 맞도록 번식된 동물 외에 동물
(non-purpose bred animal)을 사용하였을 때는 타당성을 구체적으로 제시한다.(3.6.1 
참조)

3.9 실험결과의 유효성과 자료의 상호수용(Mutual acceptance)
실험 자료의 상호수용은 동물실험의 필요성을 크게 줄일 수 있으며, 적시에 윤리적으로 규제 결
정을 내리는데 도움이 된다. 가능하면 국제적으로 인정되는 원칙에 의거하여 실험방법을 정하며 인
정되는 품질보증시스템, 예를 들어 우수실험실기준(GLP, good laboratory practice) 원칙에 따라 실
험을 수행한다.

부록 A
(참조)
실험동물관리(기준규격)의 개발배경
A.1 일반사항
동물실험을 하지 않고 기준규격의 필수 요구 기준을 충족하는 것이 이상적이다.
적합한 대체실험 방법의 개발 및 검증, 규제기관의 수용에 이르기까지 본 장의 목적은 타당한 동물실험
을 통해 동물의 통증과 고통을 최소화하는데 있다.
A.2 인도적 동물관리 및 사용 원칙
동물실험을 계획하고 수행하는 자는 적절한 관리체계를 갖추어야 하며, 최선의 과학과 최선의 동물복지
는 서로 분리될 수 없는 것이라는 원칙을 준수해야 한다.
보다 구체적으로 동물실험 도중에 동물이 받게 될 통증과 고통을 절대적인 최소 수준으로 감소시키고, 
동물실험에 사용할 동물의 생산, 관리 및 사용과 관련된 복지비용을 파악하고 제거하기 위해 최선의 노력
을 기울여야 한다.
가장 정교하고 과학적으로 유효한 실험방법을 정하기 위해, 전문적 판단을 통해 상호 충돌되는 부분들
이 균형을 이루도록 한다. 동물복지 비용을 최소화하기 위하여 사용동물 수의 감소와 개선방법을 연속
적이 아닌 동시적으로 고려해야한다.
과학적으로 인정되는 다양한 전략을 바탕으로 가장 적절한 실험방법과 계획서를 선정해야 한다. 많은 
수의 동물을 사용하되, 보다 인도적인 종점을 채택하거나 보다 민감한 종의 동물을 적게 사용하는 것이 
가장 적절한 방안인 경우도 있다. 본 장에서 제시된 감소 및 개선 관련대책을 해석할 때는, 타당한 정보
와 전문적 판단에 기초하여 상호 충돌되는 부분들을 인식하고 균형을 이루도록 할 필요가 있음을 명심
해야 한다. 전문적 판단에 따라 최종결정을 내릴 수 있으나, 동물복지와 관련된 비용을 최소화하면서 과
학적 유효성을 보장하는 것이 중요하다.
그러므로 적절한 결정을 내렸다는 것을 증명할 때에는 검토한 방안과 중요하게 생각한 요소, 그리고 최
종 판단에 있어 투명성을 유지해야 한다. 전문적 판단을 내릴 때 시험자는 무엇을 했고, 그 이유는 무엇
이며, 어떻게 했는지를 관련문서로 타당성 있게 설명할 준비가 되어 있어야 한다.
A.3 대체(Replacement)
대체(replacement)는 일반적으로 살아있는 척추동물을 사용하는 대신, 지각이 없는 대체물로 대체한 실
험방법을 말한다. 의료기기에 사용되는 원자재의 생물학적 평가와 관련된 많은 부분에 적용할 수 있는 
검증된 대체 실험방법이 현재는 없다.
A.4 감소(Reducement)
감소는 명확한 과학적 목표를 달성하는데 사용되는 동물의 수를 필요한 최소수준으로 줄이는 것을 의미
한다. 불필요한 실험을 배제하는 것도 이에 포함된다(적절한 동물실험만 선택하여 수행, 중복실험의 요


- 22 -
구를 배제하기 위한 데이터 공유). 실제로 이렇게 하고자 한다면, 실험전략(실험을 수행하고 평가하는 
순서)과 개별실험의 설계를 고려해야 한다.
계층적 접근방식으로 실험전략을 수립한다. in vitro 스크리닝 실험을 통해 의료기기 용도로 적합하지 
않은 원자재를 파악할 수 있으며, 그에 따라 이런 in vitro 스크리닝 실험으로 확인성 동물실험을 배제
할 수 있다. 또한 한 가지 생물학적 특징을 평가하여 다른 특징을 예측할 수도 있으며(예, 강력한 피부 
자극제는 안 자극제일 가능성이 있다), 또는 파일럿실험 결과를 감안해 추가적인 동물사용의 필요성이 
배제되기도 한다(예, 토끼 한 마리에서 나타난 뚜렷한 안 자극 증거는 실험 원자재의 특성분석에 충분할 
수 있다).
통상적인 인식과 달리 대조군을 동시에 실험하는 것도 반드시 필요하다고 보기 어려울 수 있다. 동시 
대조군 실험의 타당성을 검토할 때는 공통 동시 대조군에 대비하여 다수 실험 원자재를 실험하여 사용동
물의 수를 줄이도록 해야 한다.
실험을 계획하고 수행할 때 자료 확보 및 통계분석 방법을 포함한 실험계획은 사용되는 동물의 수를 감
소시키는데 중점을 둔다.
과학적 목표달성을 훼손하면서까지 사용동물의 수를 감소시킬 필요는 없다(잘못된 결론을 도출하거나, 
그에 따라 더 많은 동물을 상대로 다시 실험할 필요가 생길 위험이 있음). 결과적으로 실험계획이 변경
되어(예, 보다 공격적인 계획서 및 덜 인도적인 종점) 동물이 입게 될 통증과 고통이 부당하게 커질 수 
있다면, 동물의 수를 감소시키지 않는다.
반면 적절하지 않은 경우에는 최대한의 통계적 정밀도를 보장할 수 있는 수준으로 동물의 수를 정하지 
않는다.
A.5 개선(Refinement)
개선은 동물실험에 사용되는 동물의 통증, 고통, 스트레스 또는 지속성 위해를 최소화하기 위해 취한 모
든 대책들의 집합이라 할 수 있다. 또한 동물의 복지를 개선하기 위한 조치들로 보다 긍정적으로 볼 수 
있다.
전문적 판단으로 과학적으로 유효한 각종 실험방법 가운데 가장 적절한 것을 선택할 수 있는 경우도 있
다. 과학적으로 유효한 결과를 생산할 수 있는 합리적이고 실무적으로 가능한 실험방법들을 선택할 때
는 가장 개선된 것을 추구한다. 관습과 관행 자체는 타당성을 제시하는데 적절하지 않다.
전문적 판단으로 가장 적절한 동물 종과 발달단계를 선정할 수 있다. 과학적으로 유효한 결과를 생산할 
수 있는 동물 종이나 발달단계를 선택할 때는 신경생리학적 민감성이 가장 적은 동물 종과 발달 단계
(이 경우에 통증과 고통을 느낄 수 있는 정도를 기준으로)를 선정한다. 관습과 관행 자체는 타당성을 제
시하는데 적절하지 않다.
동물실험 도중의 부정적인 복지문제와 부작용(예, 개입의 즉각적 결과, 이후 단계의 결과 또는 예측 가
능한 복잡한 문제)을 예측하고 가능하면 배제하며 인식하고 관리하기 위해 최선을 다해야 한다.
본 실험을 수행하기 전에 실험동물에 절차훈련(procedural training)을 하고 동물실험을 실시하면 동물
이 받는 스트레스를 최소화할 수도 있다.
동물실험 도중의 복지문제 징후를 파악, 기록, 해석하는데 도움이 되는 장애 지수 및 심각도 평가 시스


- 23 -
템이 다수 개발되었다. 의료기기에 사용되는 원자재를 평가하기 위한 동물실험에 이런 기법을 사용하는 
것도 고려해야 한다. 그 예가 부록 B에 정리되어 있다.
적절한 관찰일정과 문제의 발생을 조기에 감지하는 교육을 받고 그런 능력을 갖추었으며 적시에 구제 
조치를 적절하게 취하도록 허가를 받은 수행자를 구비하는 것이 중요하다.
A.6 인도적 종점(Humane endpoint)
인도적 종점은 적절한 종점을 조기에 적용하여 동물의 고통을 최소화하기 위한 것이다. 중대한 발병으
로 이어지는 종점보다는 준 임상적(sub-clinical) 종점이 바람직하다.
다음의 예와 같은 다양한 돌발적 상황에 대처하기 위한 인도적 종점이 요구된다.
a) 과학적 목표가 실현된 경우
b) 과학적 목표실현의 불가능이 확실한 경우(예, 중간에 발생한 문제 때문에 자료의 유효성이 크게 훼손
된 경우)
c) 복지비용이 실험수행의 필요성에 비추어 과도한 경우
그러므로 다양한 관점에서 볼 때, 인도적 종점은 빈사상태의 동물이나 동물복지차원에서 심각한 임상증
상이 관찰되는 동물로만 한정되어서는 안된다.
동물실험 도중 발생하는 복지문제의 관리를 위하여 적절한 지지, 대증, 특이적 처치요법을 미리 정하고 
구비해야 한다.
실험동물의 죽음(안락사에 따른 결과 이외)은 의료기기 원자재의 생체적합성 판단을 위한 동물실험의 
종점이 아니다. 상기 실험의 수행 도중 발생한 동물 죽음을 기준규격에 부합함을 증명하는 증거 문서에 
명확히 기록해야 하며 때로는 그런 죽음이 합리적이고 적절한 개선(refinement) 대책의 구비가 실패했
음을 의미할 수 있다.
A.7 동물 사육
A.7.1 사육 및 관리
실험동물의 신체/행동 요구사항을 충족시킬 수 있는 사육 및 관리 조건을 갖춘다.
사육 및 관리와 관련된 많은 요소가 실험동물의 복지를 훼손하거나 동물실험 데이터의 유효성을 손상시
킬 수 있다. 일반적으로 사육 및 관리 방식은 생리적 또는 행동적 욕구를 충족하지 못하여 동물이 받는 
스트레스를 최소화시킬 수 있어야 한다.
일반적으로 인정되는 업무방식을 따르지 않는 경우에는 그 타당성을 제시해야 하며, 그런 부분(예, 사회
성 동물 종의 단일 개체 사육, 동물 종에 맞는 환경조건 미확보)이 동물실험의 과학적 유효성에 미치는 
영향을 설명한다.
동물 사육과 관리에 관한 국가/국제기구 발행 지침이 많이 있으며, 일부는 참고문헌에 정리되어 있다.

A.7.2 환경 조건
다양한 환경 요소가 실험동물의 복지를 훼손하고 동물실험 데이터의 유효성을 손상시킬 수 있다.
동물실험을 계획할 때는 동물실험 데이터의 유효성이나 그 해석방식에 부정적인 영향을 줄 수 있는 환
경요소(예, 온도, 습도, 공기 품질)를 고려해야 한다. 실험을 진행하면서 이런 환경요소를 모니터하고 기
록하며, 결과를 평가할 때도 이런 부분을 고려해야 한다.
일반적으로 실험의 유효성과 재현성을 보장하기 위해, 일정한 온도조건에서 동물을 유지해야 하며, 미세
환경을 조작하고 관리하기 위한 대책을 적절하게 구비해야 한다. 극단적인 습도조건은 피해야 한다.
환기율과 상관없이 우수한 공기품질을 유지해야 한다. 이와 관련된 자료가 참고문헌에 정리되어 있다.
A.8 윤리성 검토
본 장에 제시된 요구기준은 동물실험과 관련한 국가 또는 지역의 독립적 윤리성 검토규정을 보완하기 
위한 것이며, 이런 규정을 대체하고자 하는 것이 아니다.

3 유전독성시험
3.1 일반사항
유전독성시험의 실시를 결정하기 전에 제1장(ISO 10993-1)과 원자재의 화학적 특성을 고려하여
야 한다. 모든 관련 요소들을 고려하여 시험 프로그램에 대한 이론적 근거와 타당성을 상세하게 기
록하여야 한다.
이 규격의 제1장(ISO 10993-1)은 전반적인 생물학적 안전성 평가 시험에서 유전독성과 관련된 
잠재적 위험성을 고려하여야 하는 경우들을 지적하고 있다 (제1장(ISO 10993-1), 표 1 참조). 그
러나 유전독성이 나타나지 않는 것으로 알려진 원자재로 만들어진 부분품 및 의료기기의 경우에
는 유전독성에 관한 시험을 실시하지 않아도 된다. 원자재의 조성을 검토한 결과 유전물질과 상
호 작용을 할 수 있는 물질이 완제품에 존재할 가능성이 있거나, 의료기기의 화학적 조성이 
알려져 있지 않은 경우에 유전독성시험이 제안된다. 이러한 조건에서는 의료기기나 원자재에 
대한 유전독성시험을 총체적으로 실시하기 이전에 화학적 조성의 공동작용(synergy)의 가능성을 
염두에 두고 의심스러운 화학적 조성에 대한 유전독성의 가능성을 평가하여야 한다.
의료기기의 유전독성을 평가하는 경우 일련의 체외시험을 연속적으로 시행한다. “3.2항 시험전
략”의 선택사항 1을 채택하는 경우에는 세 가지 시험을 시행하며, 선택사항 2를 채택하는 경우에
는 두 가지 시험을 시행한다. 유전독성시험을 시행할 때에는 최소한 두 종류 이상의 시험을 실
시하여야 하고, 유전독성영향의 종점(endpoint)을 서로 다른 두 종류 이상 관찰하여야 하며, 포유
동물 세포를 이용한 시험이 포함되어야 한다.
3.2 시험전략
3.2.1 선택 사항 1 (3.2.1.1) 또는 선택 사항 2 (3.2.1.2)에 따라 최초의 시험을 결정하고 이를 바
탕으로 유전독성 시험을 실시하여야 한다. 
3.2.1.1 선택사항 1
a) 세균을 이용한 유전자 돌연변이 시험 (OECD 471)과
b) 포유류 세포를 이용한 유전자 돌연변이 시험 (OECD 476)과
c) 포유류 세포를 이용한 염색체 이상 시험 (OECD 473)
3.2.1.2 선택사항 2
a) 세균을 이용한 유전자 돌연변이 시험 (OECD 471)과
b) 포유류 세포를 이용한 유전자 돌연변이 시험 (OECD 476) 중 특히 염색체 이상 시험과 유전
자 돌연변이 시험을 모두 다루기 위하여 군체(colony) 수와 크기를 측정하는 마우스 림프종 
시험(Mouse lymphoma assay)
3.2.2 3.2항에 따라 시행한 체외 유전독성시험이 음성인 경우 동물을 이용한 유전독성시험을 추
가적으로 시행하여서는 안된다.


- 30 -
체내 유전독성시험은 제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 따라 시행되어야 한다.
3.2.3 체외시험이 양성인 경우, 체내 돌연변이성 시험을 시행하거나 돌연변이를 나타내는 물질을 
추정하여야 한다. (3.2.4항 참조)
3.2.4 체내시험은 체외시험에서 밝혀진 가장 적절한 종점(endpoint)을 바탕으로 하여 선택하여야 
한다. 시험물질이 표적기관에(target organ) 도달하였음을 입증하여야 한다. 만약 입증하지 못한다
면, 체내 유전독성이 없음을 증명하기 위해 다른 표적기관(target organ)에 대한 두 번째 체내시
험이 시행되어야 한다.
일반적으로 사용되는 체내시험방법은
a) 설치류를 이용한 소핵시험(micronucleus test) (OECD 474) 또는
b) 설치류의 골수를 이용한 중기분석(metaphase analysis) (OECD 475) 또는
c) 포유류의 간세포를 이용한 비정기DNA합성(unscheduled DNA synthesis) (OECD 486) 
가장 적합한 것으로 결정한 시험 시스템의 타당성을 입증하고 문서화하여야 한다.
3.2.5 추가적인 정보를 얻기 위하여 유전독성의 조사에 다른 체내시험 시스템을 이용하는 경우에는 
이에 관한 이론적 근거를 제시하고 문서화하여야 한다.
3.3 검체(검액)의 준비
3.3.1 의료기기나 원자재의 유전독성을 평가하거나 총괄적으로 유전독성시험을 실시하는 경우 제
11장(ISO 10993-12)에 따라 검체(검액)를 준비하여야 한다. 시험은 용출물이나, 과장된 조건에
서 용출한 용출물, 또는 원자재/의료기기의 개별 화학물질에 대하여 실시하여야 한다. 최고의 
시험농도는 OECD 지침에 수록되어 있다. 과장된 용출조건을 사용하는 경우에는 이로 인해 화학
적 특성이 변경되지 않도록 주의해야 한다.
3.3.2 시험 시스템에 적합하고 의료기기나 원자재의 용출을 최대화할 수 있는 용매를 선정하여야 
한다. 용매의 선정에 관한 이론적 근거를 문서화하여야 한다.
3.3.3 해당되는 경우, 두 개의 적합한 용출용매를 이용하여야 하는데 하나는 극성 용매이고, 다른 
하나는 비극성 용매 또는 의료기기의 용도와 특성에 적합한 액체이다. 이 두 가지 용매는 모두 
시험 시스템에 적합한 것이어야 한다.
3.4 시험방법
3.4.1 체외 유전독성시험
일반적으로 시험방법은 화학물질 시험에 대한 OECD지침 (OECD guidelines for testing of 
chemicals)을 준용한다. 


- 31 -
관련 시험방법 : OECD 471, OECD 473, OECE 476, OECD 479, OECD 482
시험을 설계하고 선정할 때 항생제와 소독제와 같이 시험에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 물질이나 원자
재의 수를 고려하여야한다. 해당되는 경우 시험방법 선정의 타당성을 입증하고 문서화하여야 한다.
3.4.2 체내 유전독성시험
체내 유전독성시험의 시험방법은 화학물질 시험에 대한 OECD 지침에 따라 선정한다. 
관련 시험방법: OECD 지침 474, 475, 478, 483, 484, 485, 486
주) 최근에 유전독성시험 기법으로 형질전환 시험동물시스템이 개발되고 있다. 형질전환 시험동물
에 대한 참조사항은 참고문헌에 제시되어 있다.
4 발암성시험
4.1 일반사항
발암성시험의 시행을 결정하기 이전에 제1장(ISO 10993-1)과 원자재의 화학적 특성을 고려하여
야 한다. 시험의 시행에 대한 결정은 의료기기의 사용으로 인한 발암현상의 위해평가를 바탕으
로 타당성이 입증되어야 한다. 새로운 발암성 시험자료 없이 위해에 대한 평가와 관리를 적절하
게 수행할 수 있는 경우에는 발암성시험을 시행해서는 안된다.
주) 발암성의 사전선별을 위해 체외 세포형질전환시스템(In vitro cell transformation systems) 
을 이용할 수 있다. 국제 표준에는 아직까지 세포형질전환시험에 관한 설명이 수록되어 있지 않
다. 세포형질전환시험 시스템에 관한 추가 정보는 부록 A에 제시되어 있다. 
4.2 시험전략
4.2.1 발암성에 대한 위해를 배제할 수 있는 증거가 없는 경우, 발암성시험의 필요성이 고려되는 
상황은 아래와 같다.
a) 사람에게 사용 또는 노출에 대한 적절한 자료가 없고, 흡수기간이 30일 이상인 흡수성 원자재
와 의료기기인 경우
b) 인체 및/또는 체강(body and/or its cavities)에 삽입되어 30일 이상 영구접촉 또는 누적접촉
되는 의료기기와 원자재인 경우. 단, 적절한 인체사용 이력이 있는 경우는 제외
유전독성물질에 대한 발암성시험은 과학적으로 타당하지 않다. 유전독성물질의 경우에는 발암성의 
위험을 추정하고, 그에 따라 위험성을 관리하여야 한다. 
4.2.2 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 따라 만성독성시험과 발암성시험이 고려되고, 시험이 필요하다고 
결정된 경우 시험은 OECD지침 453에 따라 수행하여야 한다.


- 32 -
4.2.3 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 따라 발암성시험만이 고려되고, 시험이 필요하다고 결정된 경우 시
험은 OECD지침 451에 따라 수행하여야 한다.
4.2.4 의료기기의 발암성 시험은 한 가지 동물 종만으로도 충분하게 시험할 수 있다. 종의 선정에 
관한 타당성을 입증하고, 상세하게 기록하여야 한다.
주) 최근 형질전환 동물시험이 발암성시험용으로 개발되었으나 이 규격 제정 당시에는 의료기기에 
대해서 검증되지 않은 상태였다. 시험시스템에 대한 참조사항은 형질전환 동물시험에 관한 참고문헌에 
제시되어 있다. 
4.4 시험방법
4.4.1 발암성시험이 생물학적 안정성 평가의 일부로 필요한 경우에는 의료기기의 특성이 규명된 
용출물이나 화학물질을 이용하여 시험을 실시하여야 한다. 이식시험(부록 C 참조)의 실시에 관
한 타당성을 입증하여야 하며, 인체 위해성 평가에서의 역할을 기술하고 문서화하여야 한다.
4.4.2 이식시험의 이식부위를 선정하기 위해, 의료기기의 임상적용에서의 사용방법을 고려해야 한
다.
 
4.4.3 용출물을 이용한 시험은 OECD 451이나 OECD 453에 따라 발암성시험을 시행하여야 한
다. 
4.4.4 조직에 대한 평가는 이식조직과 주변조직뿐만 아니라 OECD 451이나 OECD 453에 제시되
어 있는 목록에 있는 조직들을 포함하여야 한다.
5 생식독성시험/발생독성시험
5.1 일반사항
5.1.1 생식독성 및 발생독성 시험의 실시를 결정하기 이전에 제1장(ISO 10993-1)과 원자재의 
화학적 특성을 고려하여야 한다. 시험의 시행에 대한 결정은 의료기기의 사용으로 인한 생식독성 
및 발생독성 위해평가를 바탕으로 타당성이 입증되어야 한다.
5.1.2  흡수성이 있는 의료기기 또는 용해물을 포함하는 의료기기의 흡수, 대사, 분포 연구에 대
한 적절한 자료가 있거나, 의료기기 또는 원자재의 용출물의 모든 성분이 생식독성이 없다고 밝
혀진 경우에는 생식독성시험이 필요하지 않다.
5.1.3 생물학적 위해 평가에서 생식독성 및 발생독성의 위해가 배제될 수 있다는 사실이 밝혀진다
면 생식독성 및 발생독성 시험은 시행하지 않는다.
5.2 시험전략
생식독성/발생독성에 대한 위해를 배제할 수 있는 증거가 없는 경우에는 생식독성/발생독성 시험을 


- 33 -
고려하여야 한다. 시험대상은 다음이 포함될 수 있다.
a) 배/태아 또는 생식조직과 직접적으로 지속접촉 또는 영구접촉하는 의료기기
b) 에너지 전달형 의료기기
c) 흡수성의 원자재 또는 용해물
시험이 필요한 경우에는 생식 및/또는 발생에 미칠 수 있는 영향과 관련된 초기 정보를 제시하기 
위하여 OECD 421로 시험을 시작하여야 한다. 시험의 결과가 양성인 경우에는 초기 위험성을 
평가하는데 유용하며, 추가적 시험의 필요성과 시기를 결정하는데 도움이 된다.
추가적 시험이 필요하다고 판단되는 경우에는 OECD 414, OECD 415 또는 OECD 416 가운데 
적합한 방법에 따라 시험을 시행하여야 한다.
5.3 검체(검액)준비

가능한 상태를 대표하는 형태로 시험되어야 한다. 
5.3.2 에너지 전달형 의료기기의 경우에는 동물의 전신에 노출시키는 것이 적합하다. 사람의 생식
기관에 반복 노출될 수 있는 경우를 적용시켜야 한다.
5.3.3 동물에게 사용하는 최대 투여량은 최대내성용량이거나 시험동물 모델의 신체적 제약에 의해 
제한된 용량이다. 이러한 투여량은 최대인체노출량(사람의 체중 [kg]당 투여량의 면적 및/또는 
질량)의 배수로 제시되어야 한다.
체내 시험은 제2장(ISO 10993-2) 시험동물관리에 따라 실시하여야 한다.
5.4 시험방법
5.4.1 1세대 (F1)나 또는 2세대 (F2)에 미치는 영향에 대한 평가는 OECD 414, OECD 415 또는 
OECD 416과 OECD 421에 따라 실시하여야 한다. OECD 지침은 의료기기에 대한 것이 아니므
로 아래의 수정된 사항들을 고려하여야 한다. 
- 투여량 (에너지 전달형 의료기기의 경우)
- 적용 경로 (이식, 비경구성, 기타)
- 용출 배지 (수성 및 비수성 용출물)
- 노출 시점 (가능한 경우, 기관형성[organogenesis] 동안 혈액의 상승된 수준)
주) 사람에게 사용하고자 하는 목적과 원자재의 특성에 따라 출생 전/후 시험을 제안할 수 있다.
5.4.2 다른 시험에서 도출된 정보가 남성의 생식기에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 잠재성을 나타내는 경
우에는 남성 생식독성에 관한 적합한 시험을 실시하여야 한다.


- 34 -
주) 최근에 체외 생식독성 시험시스템이 개발되었다. 이 시험방법은 생식독성과 발생독성의 사전
선별 시험방법으로 유용하게 사용될 수 있다. 체외 생식독성 시험시스템에 관한 참조사항은 생식
독성/발생독성 시험에 관한 참고 문헌에 수록되어 있다.
6 시험보고서
6.1 해당되는 경우 시험보고서에는 적어도 아래의 세부적인 사항들이 포함되어야 한다.
a) 사용목적을 포함하여 의료기기 및/또는 원자재에 관한 기술. (예: 화학적조성, 공정
(processing), 조절(conditioning) 및 표면처리)
b) 시험방법, 시험조건, 시험원자재와 시험과정에 대한 설명과 타당성 제시.
c) 정량한계를 포함한 분석방법에 대한 기술.
d) GLP(Good Laboratory Practices)를 준수하고 있음을 제시.
e) 요약된 내용을 포함하는 시험결과
f) 통계적 방법
g) 결과에 대한 해석 및 검토
6.2 관련 OECD지침에서 기술된 것보다 세부적인 내용들도 시험보고서에 포함되어야 한다.

세포 형질변환 시험시스템(Cell transformation test system)
세포 형질변환 시험시스템은 발암성을 사전선별 하는 데 이용할 수 있다.
체외 세포형질변환 시험에 관한 지침은 참고문헌[12]에 수록되어 있다. 세포 형질변환 시험시스템
에 관한 자세한 참조 사항은 세포형질변환 시험에 대한 참고 문헌에 제시되어 있다. 
2단계 세포 형질변환 시험으로 유전독성을 가지지 않은 발암물질을 검출할 수 있다는 증거들이 
일부 존재한다. 그러나 현 시점에서는 세포 형질변환 시험을 통해 유전독성이 없는 발암물질을 모
두 검출해내는 것은 불가능하다. 따라서 세포 형질변환 시험시스템이 설치류를 이용한 수명발암성
시험(lifetime carcinogenicity studies)의 대안으로 이용될 수 없다.

시험시스템에 관한 이론적 근거
B.1 유전독성시험(Genotoxicity tests)
유전독성시험의 주요 기능은 시험세포나 생물체를 이용하여 의료기기를 사람에 사용할 때 생식
세포(germ cell)를 통하여 다음 세대에 전달될 수 있는 유전적 변이를 일으킬 수 있는 잠재성을 
조사하는 것이다. 일반적으로 과학적인 자료들은 체세포의 DNA 손상이 암 발생의 치명적인 원인
이라는 가설을 입증해준다. 그러한 손상은 돌연변이를 일으키는 원인이 될 수 있고, 유전독성의 
활성을 검출해내는 시험은 발암을 유발시킬 잠재성이 있는 화학물질을 식별해낼 수 있다. 따라서 
일부 시험은 추정되고 있는 발암 활성을 조사하는데 유용하다. 
전통적인 독성시험에서는 시험 설계 과정에서 여러 가지의 적절한 변수나 종점(endpoint)을 관찰
할 수 있으나, 유전독성의 경우에는 이와 같지 않다. 일반적으로 유전학적 종점(endpoint)의 다양
성으로 인해 단일 시험시스템에서 유전학적 종점(endpoint)을 하나 이상 검출해내는 것은 불가능
하다. 
시험지침서에는 대략적으로 15개 정도의 서로 다른 시험방법들이 인용되어 있다. 이들 가운데서 
특정한 요건에 부합하도록 가장 적합한 방법을 선정하는 일은 수많은 요소들에 의해 좌우된다. 여
기에는 검출이 필요한 유전적 변이의 유형이나 시험시스템의 대사능력이 포함된다. 
가장 적절한 시험의 선정을 조화시키려는 시도가 계속 있어 왔음에도 불구하고, 특정 목적을 
위한 시험의 가장 좋은 조합(combination)에 대한 국제적 합의는 없다는 사실이 강조되어야 할 
것이다. 또한 비록 OECD 지침에는 수록되어 있지 않지만, 사용되고 있거나 개발 중에 있는 기타 
돌연변이 시험이 유용할 수 있다는 사실에 주목하는 것도 도움이 될 것이다. 의약품에 관한 
ICH/S2B 도 참고할 수 있을 것이다.
DNA와 상호작용을 하는 화학물질은 다양한 회복 과정의 영향 후에 유전자 수준에서 유전적 변
화를 일으킬 수 있고(예를 들어, 유전자 돌연변이 또는 점 돌연변이, 적은양의 결손, 유사 분열의 
재조합이나 미세하고 가시적인 다양한 염색체 변화와 같이), 유전독성시험방법은 이러한 각각의 
문제들을 조사하는데 이용할 수 있다.
물론, 현재의 단기 시험으로는 발암 과정의 모든 단계를 모방할 수가 없으며, 종종 최초의 단계 
즉, 다시 말해, 돌연변이 DNA 손상 또는 염색체이상 DNA 손상을 유도하는 능력이 발휘되는 
사건을 검출하는 데에만 이용하고 있다. 따라서 이들 과정의 주요 가치는 특정한 노출조건 하에서 
발암 과정의 최초의 단계를 유도하거나 또는 주로 유전독성의 기전에 의해 암을 일으키는 물질을 
식별하는 능력에 있다. 비록 단기 시험이 유용한 정성 정보를 제공해 준다고 하더라도 상대적으로 
단순한 단기 시험에 비해 발암성 과정은 복잡하게 나타나므로 발암 물질의 활동에 대한 해석에 특
별한 주의를 기울일 필요가 있다.
단일 시험으로는 포유류의 돌연변이 유발원과 발암물질을 만족스러운 수준에서 재현하고 정확하게 
검출할 수 있음이 입증되지 못했기 때문에 ‘일련의 시험’으로 적용하는 것이 과학적인 관행이다.

물질의 변이원성에 대한 최초의 정보는 염색체 손상과 유전자 돌연변이를 평가하는 시험방법을 
이용하여 얻을 수 있다. 이들의 각각의 종점(endpoint)을 조사하려면 각각의 독립적인 과정이 
필요하기 때문에 일련의 시험이 필요하다. 
B.2 발암성시험방법(Carcinogenicity studies)
장기간의 발암성시험의 목적은 적합한 경로를 통하여 시험물질을 다양한 투여량에 노출시킨 
이후나 노출시키는 동안 종양의 발생(neoplastic lesion)을 시험동물의 수명 기간 동안 관찰하는 
것이다. 이러한 시험을 수행하기 위해 신중한 시험설계와 기록, 전문적인 병리학 분석, 객관적인 
통계분석이 요구된다.
B.3 생식독성/발생독성 시험방법(Reproductive/developmental toxicity tests)
생식독성시험방법은 생식, 수정 능력 그리고 최기형성 분야를 포괄한다. 많은 물질들이 별다른 
독성의 징후가 없이 잠복하였다가 수정 능력과 생식에 영향을 미칠 수 있다는 사실이 밝혀졌다. 
수정 능력은 남성과 여성에게 영향을 미칠 수 있으며, 생식 능력이 다소 감소되는 것으로부터 불
임까지 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 
최기형성은 발생하고 있는 배아와 태아에 미치는 물질의 부작용을 말하는 것이다. 생식독성은 사
람의 건강과 중요한 관련이 있다. 생식독성의 모든 측면을 포함하는 조합시험이라는 개념의 시험
기법(the concept of combined tests)이 개발 중에 있으며, 성공할 가능성이 높을 것으로 보인다.

이식 발암성시험의 역할
C.1 개요
이식에 의해 유발되는 종양은 랫트를 이용한 시험에서 잘 알려져 있다. 이러한 현상을 ‘이물성 
발암’(foreign body carcinogenesis) 혹은 ‘고체 상태의 발암’(solid state carcinogenesis)이라
고 부른다. 현상은 다음과 같이 요약된다.
일반적으로 종양은 이식물 주변이나 또는 이식물 가까이에서 발생하는데 그 빈도수는 여러 가지 
요인들에 의해 좌우된다.
a) 이식물의 크기 (크기가 작은 이식물보다는 대체로 크기가 큰 이식물이 커다란 육종을 유발함)
b) 이식물의 형태 (원반 모양이 가장 효과적인 것 가운데 하나로 알려져 있음)
c) 이식물의 평활도 (표면이 거친 이식물이 표면이 매끄러운 이식물 보다 발암성이 낮음)
d) 표면적의 연속성 (세공이나 그보다 큰 구멍이 있는 이식물의 종양 발병률이 더 낮음) 
e) 어떠한 원자재의 경우, 원자재의 두께 (두꺼운 이식물이 육종을 많이 유발함)
f) 이식물이 조직에 남아있는 시간
같은 원자재라 해도 대부분 분말이나 나사, 다공성 원자재를 이식할 경우보다 필름이나 박판형태로 
이식하는 경우 종양을 일으키지 않거나 더 적게 일으킨다. [33], [34].
다른 한편, 동일한 동물의 시험 방법을 이용한 다수의 보고서들은 모양과 크기가 유사하더라도 서
로 다른 원자재는 종양 형성률에 차이가 있음을 보여주고 있다. 
기계학적 이해는 IARC 모노그래프(Monograph)에 요약되어 있다.[35] 
C.2 발암성 위해 결정에 대한 이론적 근거와 과정
고체 상태의 발암성이 세포와 원자재 상호작용에 의해 발생하는 간극연결부위의 세포간 연락
(gap-junctional intercellular communication)의 간섭현상과 관련이 있을 수 있다는 새로운 가설
이 제시되었고 이 이론은 가능성이 있는 것으로 보이나 사람에 대한 발암성 위해와의 관련성은 모
호한 것으로 여겨진다.
발암성의 위해에 대한 판단은 고체 상태의 발암성만을 근거로 결정해서는 안 된다. 고체상태의 발
암성 결과를 이용하여 발암성의 위험에 관한 판단을 내린 몇 가지 사례에서는 언제나 양성 돌
연변이 자료와 같은 근거자료들이 제시되어 왔다.
이식으로 발암성시험을 실시하는 경우에는 시험동물과 대조(모의시험)동물 모두에게 외과적 침습 
과정이 필요하다. 따라서 연구를 시행하는 데는 상당한 동물관리비용이 든다. 발암성시험에 대한 
방법론을 고려함에 있어서 사람에 대한 위해 관계가 모호할 때 이식에 의한 발암성시험을 요구하는 
것은 더 이상 타당하지 않은 것으로 간주되고 있다. 생물학적 안정성 평가에 미치는 영향을 결정
함에 있어 상당한 동물관리 비용을 수반하는 이식시험의 역할은 이론적으로 명확하게 입증되지

못하였다.
그러나 발암성시험이 필요하다고 간주되는 경우에는 (4.4.1 참조) C.3에 제시되어 있는 방법이 
이식에 의한 발암성시험을 해석하는데 도움이 될 수 있다. 그러한 시험을 시행하는 경우에는 
시험 설계의 필요성을 입증하여야 하며, 인체 위험성을 평가함에 있어 해당 시험의 역할을 설명
하여야 한다.
C.3 이식시험에 의한 발암성시험
이식시험에 의한 발암성시험을 수행하고자 할 때에는 다음의 방법을 준수하여야 한다.
1회 최대이식투여(MID)군으로 충분하다고 할지라도, 최대이식투여군과 부분투여군 (통상적으로 
최대이식투여량의 절반)을 포함하는 두 개의 군을 권장한다. 일반적으로 음성 대조군에는 폴리에
틸렌 (polyethylene) 이식물과 같이 잠재적 발암성이 부재하다고 입증된 참조 대조군이나 임상적
으로 허용될 수 있는 원자재의 형태와 비교 가능한 모양의 이식물이 삽입될 것이다.
설치류를 이용한 발암성시험에서는 의료기기나 원자재의 최대 이식 투여량을 적용할 수 있다. 가
능하다면, 이러한 투여량은 최악의 인체 노출량(체중 당 밀리그램으로 [mg/kg])의 배수로 표시
하도록 한다. 
이식투여량을 결정하는 질량 및/또는 표면적은 예상되는 임상적 노출을 초과한 것이어야 한다. 
투여량 선정에 관한 이론적 근거를 문서화하여야 한다. 해당되는 경우 고체 형태의 발암을 유발
할 가능성을 적절하게 고려하여 제6장(ISO 10993-6)에 따라 시험원자재를 적합한 이식물의 형
태로 만들어야 한다. (오펜하이머 효과 [Oppenheimer effect], 유전독성과 발암성시험에 관한

5 시험방법
5.1 일반사항
5.1.1 혈액과의 상호작용에 대한 시험이 필요한가의 여부를 결정하는데 그림 1을 참조한다. 혈액 
상호작용은 주요 측정 과정 또는 시스템을 근거로 하여 5개의 범주로 분류할 수 있다. 순환 혈액
에 접촉하는 의료기기와 이에 적합한 시험방법에 대한 예시는 표 4와 5에 나타나있다.
주) 시험의 선정에 대한 이론적 근거를 제시하여야 한다. 혈전증 시험은 의료기기의 특성을 규명
하기 위한 방법으로 자주 이용된다. 많은 경우 혈전증 시험 대신 혈액학 및 보체 시스템시험, 
혈소판시험, 응고시험을 조합한 시험을 실시한다. 이러한 경우 이론적 근거를 제시하여야 한다.
개별규격이 존재하는 의료기기의 경우에는 개별규격에서 정하고 있는 생물학적 평가 요건 및 
시험방법이 이 규격에서 제시하는 일반적 요건보다 우선시된다.
5.1.2 시험조건은접촉시간, 온도, 멸균상태, 유동상태등을포함한실제임상적적용에서의혈액과
의료기기의접촉조건을최대한재현할수있는모델과시스템을사용하여야한다. 기하학적형태가
정해진의료기기의경우, 시험매개변수(단위부피당농도)와노출되는표면적(㎠)의비율을평가하
여야한다.
혈액과접촉되는부분만을시험하여야한다.
선택된시험방법과매개변수는당시의최신기술에
따라야한다.
5.1.3 대조군을사용하여야한다. 대조군이생략되는경우에는이론적근거를제시하여야한다. 대
조군은가급적이미임상적으로사용되어지는의료기기또는특성이알려진참고물질을사용한다.


- 50 -
사용하는참고물질은음성및양성대조를포함하여야한다. 시험대상의료기기및원자재는제조
자및시험기관의품질관리및품질보증에부합하여야하고출처, 제조자, 등급및형태를밝혀
야한다.
5.1.4 의료기기의구성성분원자재에대한시험은사전선별시험의목적으로수행될수있다.
그러나이러한예비시험이완제품의료기기나의료기기부분품의모의사용조건에서의시험또는
과장임상사용조건에서의시험을대신할수는없다.
5.1.5 의료기기의실제임상조건을재현할수없는시험은임상에서사용하는동안에일어날수
있는혈액과의료기기의상호작용을정확하게예측할수없다. 예를들어단기체외혹은체내ㆍ
외순환시험으로장기간의혈액과의료기기의체내상호작용을예측하기어렵다.
5.1.6 사용목적이체내ㆍ외순환인의료기기는체내ㆍ외순환조건을통하여시험하고, 사용목적
이체내이식형인의료기기는임상사용조건이최대한재현된상태에서시험동물을이용한체내시
험으로한다.
5.1.7 제4항, 그림1, 표5와함께5.1.5항과5.1.6항의권장사항은5.2.1항에나열되어있는시험
선정의지침이된다. 전임상평가에대한지침은부록A에나와있다. 다음의절차가수행되어
야한다. :
1) 5개의 잠재적 혈액 상호작용 범주가 해당 의료기기에 적합한지 결정
2) 이러한 범주 내에서 반응에 대한 기존의 정보 평가 
3) 표 6 또는 표 7에서 적합한 시험 선정
5.1.8 혈액의수집및혈액에대한체외시험에사용되는1회용시험기구는시험결과와간섭현상이
없음을확인하여야한다.
5.1.9 앞에기술된방법으로선정되고임상적적용을모방하는조건하에서실시된시험의결과는의
료기기의임상적성능을예견하는데있어서적중확률이높다. 그러나종(species)간의차이및다
른요소들은이러한확률에대한제한요인으로작용할수있다.
5.1.10 혈액과의반응에있어서종간의차이가있으므로가능하다면사람의혈액을사용한다.
지속노출또는반복노출및영구접촉등에대한의료기기의평가를위하여시험동물모델을사용
한다면종간의혈액접촉에대한차이점을고려하여야한다.
사람과영장류동물사이의혈액성질과반응성은매우비슷한것으로보고되어있다. 영장류이외에
돼지, 송아지, 양과같은시험동물을사용했을때에도유용한결과를얻을수있다. 종간의차이가
유의하기때문에(예를들면혈소판부착, 혈전증및용혈반응은개과에서쉽게일어나는경향이
있다.) 모든동물시험의결과는주의깊게해석하여야한다.
사용된종및종의수는타당하여야한다.
주) 체내혈액적합성시험및의료기기시험에영장류를사용하는것은EU법및몇몇국가법에의


- 51 -
해금지되었다.
5.1.11 의료기기가항응고제를사용하지않는경우라면시험과정에서항응고제를사용하지않는다.
사용되는항응고제의농도와종류는혈액과의료기기의상호작용에영향을주므로그선택은타
당하여야한다. 항응고제와같이사용되는의료기기는임상적으로사용되는농도범위의항응고제와
함께평가되어야한다.
5.1.12 임상적으로허용된의료기기의변경은혈액과의료기기의상호작용및임상적성능에의영
향을고려하여야한다. 설계와형태의변화, 의료기기표면부분의화학조성변화또는의료기기
전체화학조성의변화, 조직결의변화, 표면의다공성, 기타특성의변화등이고려되어야한다.
5.1.13 시험결과의통계적평가를위해서충분한횟수의시험을한다. 몇몇시험방법의경우
시험과정중변이요인이존재하므로충분한횟수의시험을반복하여유의성을결정하여야한다.
또한혈액과의료기기의연장된접촉기간에걸친반복시험을통하여접촉시간에따른시험정보를
얻을수있다.
5.2
시험방법
5.2.1 의료기기및의료용원자제와혈액과의상호작용평가시험방법
권장되는시험들은의료기기의형태에기초하여표6과표7에따라구성한다.
시험은측정되는주요과정또는시스템에따라서다섯가지로분류된다.
1) 혈전증
2) 혈액응고
3) 혈소판
4) 혈액학
5) 보체계
이시험들에대한원리및과학적근거는부록B에있다.

- 53 -
5.2.2 비접촉형의료기기
일반적으로혈액과의료기기와의상호반응시험을요구하지않는다. 1회용시험키트는정확성을저
해할수있는원자재의영향을검증하여야한다.
5.2.3 체내ㆍ외연결형의료기기(external communicating devices)
표4와표5를이용하여특정의료기기유형에대해
관련된혈액상호작용범주를결정한후, 표
6에의해체내ㆍ외연결형의료기기의혈액상호작용평가에적절한시험방법을선택한다(5.1.6
참고). 시험평가되는개별의료기기에따라선정기준은달라진다.
5.2.4 체내이식형의료기기(implant devices)
표4와표5를이용하여특정의료기기유형에대해관련된혈액상호작용범주를결정한후, 표
7에의해체내이식형의료기기의혈액상호작용평가에적절한시험방법을선택한다(5.1.6 참고). 시
험평가되는개별의료기기에따라선정기준은달라진다.
5.2.5 시험분석의반응지표와한계(Indication and limitations)
면역측정법(Immunoassay)은사람혈액시험에는적절하지만일반적으로다른종의시험에는적
절하지않다. 사람혈액용시험키트는보통몇몇영장류를제외하고다른종과교차반응하지
않는다. 인위적요소가아닌시험검체에의한시험시스템의활성(activation)을측정하는것임을
확인하기위해시험시스템설계에주의를기울여야한다. 면역측정법의유효범위내에서측정하
기위해사람혈액의체외모의사용및체내ㆍ외순환모의사용의경우시험조건에따라반응물의
혈장수준을저ㆍ중ㆍ고수준의희석물로만들필요가있다. 시험되는검체의희석범위가측정됨
을확인하는데에도주의를기울여야한다.
부적절한원자재특성규명또는시험전검체에대한부주의한취급때문에혈액과의료기기의
상호작용평가에오차가생길수있다. 예를들면한종류의시험에만의존하거나시험중인원
자재또는의료기기와관련없는외래물질이들어간경우그러하다. 유속이느린환경(정맥)에
서사용되는원자재는유속이빠른환경(동맥)에서사용하는경우혈액과의상호작용이약간다
르게나타날수있다. 설계나유속조건이바뀌면원자재의체내혈액적합성도바뀔수있다.
5.3 시험유형
5.3.1 체외시험(In vitro tests)
체외시험을시행할때는적혈구용적(haematocrit), 항응고제, 검체채집, 검체의오래된정도, 검체
저장, 공기의순환및pH, 온도, 시험군대대조군의시험결과, 표면과부피의비율, 유체역학상태
(특히벽면전단율)등의변수를고려하여야한다. 수집후혈액의일부성질은급속히변하므로시
험은최소한의시간, 일반적으로4시간이내에시행되어야한다.
5.3.2 체내ㆍ외순환시험(Ex vivo tests)
사용목적이체내ㆍ외순환인경우(예: 체내ㆍ외연결형의료기기)는체내ㆍ외순환시험을시행하
여야한다. 체내ㆍ외순환시험은의료기기의사용목적이체내인경우(예: 체내이식형의료기기의)에
도유용하다. 그러나체내ㆍ외순환시험이이식시험을대체할수는없다.


- 54 -
체내ㆍ외순환시험시스템은혈소판침착, 색전형성, 피브리노겐침전, 혈전응집, 백혈구침착,
혈소판소모, 혈소판활성화등의관찰에유용하다. 혈류속도는도플러또는전자기혈류측정기를
이용하여측정한다. 혈류의변화는혈전및색전의생성정도및경로를나타낸다.
많은체내ㆍ외순환시험은혈액과의료기기의상호작용을관찰하기위하여방사성동위원소를
혈액구성성분에표지시켜분석하는방법을사용한다. 혈소판및피브리노겐은가장보편적으로
방사성동위원소를표지하여분석하는혈액구성요소이다. 방사선동위원소표지방법으로인한
혈소판의반응성변화는기술적인처리에주의를기울여최소화하도록한다.
체내ㆍ외순환시험을체외시험과비교하였을때의장점은자연상태의혈액을사용할수있어서
생리학적흐름의상태를제공하며, 챔버를바꾸어시험할수있어서여러원자재의평가가가능하
고, 몇가지시험에대하여실시간관찰이가능하다는점이다. 단점은시험마다혈액흐름의차
이가있고, 시험동물사이의혈액반응성의차이가있으며, 평가될수있는시간간격이상대적으
로짧다. 본시험에서는동일한시험동물을이용한양성및음성대조의사용이추천된다.
5.3.3 체내시험
체내시험은의료용원자재또는의료기기를시험동물에이식하여시험한다.
혈관패치, 혈관이식재, 보형물고리, 심장판막과순환보조의료기기등은체내시험을하는형태의
예이다.
도관의개방성은체내시험에대한성공혹은실패를가늠하는척도이다. 폐색율및혈전의질
량은이식된의료기기를제거한후측정한다. 의료기기에혈전이형성되어말단기관에색전을
형성하는현상은이식된의료기기주변기관에대한현미경검사뿐아니라세심한총체적검사를
통해측정하여야한다. 그리고주변조직및기관에대한조직병리학적평가가유용할수있다.
특히신장은이식된의료기기(심실보조장치, 인공심장, 대동맥보철이식물등)에서생성된혈전을
신동맥에서수집하는경향이있다.
시험을종료시키지않고평가하는방법이있다. 동맥조영법은이식조직의개방성혹은의료기
기에축적된혈전등을측정하는데사용된다. 방사선영상처리기법은다양한시간에서의체내혈
소판침착을관찰하는데사용될수있다. 혈소판의생존과소모는혈액과의료기기의상호작용및
신생내막(neointima)형성또는단백질흡착으로인한막형성(passivation)의지표로사용될수있다.
일부체내시험시스템에서원자재의특성이혈액과의료기기의상호작용을결정하는주요요소가
아닐수도있다. 흐름의변수, 유연성, 다공성, 이식물의디자인이원자재자체의혈액적합성보다
중요할수있다. 동일한원자재에대해서평가하는경우라도유속이낮은시스템에서와유속이높
은시스템에서의결과는상당히다르게나타날수있다. 이러한경우에는체내시험시스템결과가
체외시험결과보다중요하다.

부록 A 
(참조)
심장 혈관계 의료기기와 보형물에 대한 전임상 평가방법
A.1 일반적인 고려 사항
A.1.1 배경 
본 부록은 혈액과 심장 혈관계 의료기기의 상호작용을 평가하는 시험방법의 선정에 관련된 배경 
정보를 제시하고 있다. 본 장의 5항에는 시험이 필요한 경우와 특정한 의료기기에 적합한 혈액 
상호작용의 범주 그리고 비접촉형 의료기기, 체내ㆍ외 연결형 의료기기 그리고 체내이식형 의료기
기의 혈액-의료기기 상호작용을 평가하는 방법들에 대한 지침이 수록되어 있다.
A.1.2 분류
아래의 분류는 혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용에 관한 배경 정보로 제공된 것이다. 
1) 의료기기에 상당한 영향을 미치는 혈액과의 상호작용은 다음과 같다.(환자에게 바람직하지 
못한 영향을 줄 수도 있고, 주지 않을 수도 있음)
a) 혈액의 혈장 단백질, 지방질, 칼슘 또는 기타 물질들이 의료기기 표면에 흡착되거나 의료기
기 안으로 흡수됨
b) 혈소판, 백혈구 또는 적혈구가 의료기기의 표면에 점착되거나 의료기기 안으로 이들의 구성
성분이 흡수됨
c) 의료기기의 표면에 조직피막(tissue capsule)이나 또는 가내막(pseudointima)을 형성
d) 의료기기의 기계적 특성과 기타 특성의 변경
2) 사람 또는 동물에게 바람직하지 못한 영향을 미칠 가능성이 있는 상호작용은 다음과 같다.
a) 혈소판, 백혈구 또는 기타 세포의 활성이나 응고, 피브린 분해성 또는 보체경로의 활성화
b) 의료기기 표면에 혈전 형성
c) 의료기기의 관 표면에서 나온 혈전성물질 또는 기타 물질이 색전화하여 순환계 내의 다른 
곳으로 옮겨감.
d) 순환 혈액 세포가 손상되어 빈혈, 용혈, 백혈구 감소, 혈소판 감소 또는 혈액 세포 기능 변
화가 일어남.
e) 의료기기 인접 조직 및 세포의 손상
f) 의료기기 표면과 접촉해 있거나 인접한 조직의 내막 비대 또는 증식이 일어나 혈류를 감소
시키고 의료기기의 기능에 영향을 줌. 
g) 의료기기 표면 및 인접부위에 세균(박테리아) 또는 전염성 병원균이 점착하여 생장
A.1.3 동물시험과 체외시험의 장점과 한계 
동물 모델은 의료기기를 지속적으로 관찰하고, 중요한 변수가 있는 시험을 체계적으로 관리할 수 
있도록 해준다. 그러나 동물 모델의 선정은 비용, 특정 종의 이용 가능성 그리고 크기 조건에 의한 
제약이 있다. 조사자는 특히, 마취제, 항응고제, 혈전제 및 항혈소판 약품 그리고 항생제와 같은 
의약품에 대한 반응과 응고, 혈소판 기능 및 섬유소 용해와 관련하여 사람과 선정된 종사이의 생
리학적 차이 및 유사성을 염두에 두는 것이 중요하다. 반응에 대한 종 간의 차이, 반응에 대한 대
상개체의 차이 그리고 서로 다른 의료기기에 대한 다양한 반응으로 인해 단일 종에서 얻은 자


- 60 -
료는 신중하게 해석하여야 한다. 개코 원숭이와 같은 사람이외의 영장류는 혈액학 수치, 혈액 응
고 기전 그리고 심혈관계가 사람과 상당히 유사하다. 사람이외의 영장류의 또 다른 장점은 사
람을 위해 개발된 많은 혈전용 면역학적 탐침을 이들에게도 사용할 수 있다는 것이다. 이들 탐
침에는 PF-4, b-TG, FPA, TAT, F1+2가 포함된다. 개는 보편적으로 사용되는 종이며, 유용한 정
보를 제공해주고 있다. 그러나 개에게서는 의료기기와 관련된 혈전증이 사람에게서 보다 더 쉽게 
발생하는 경향이 있으며, 차이는 이러한 합병증을 평가할 때 장점이 될 수도 있다. 일반적으로 
돼지는 혈액학적 특성과 심혈관계가 사람과 유사하기 때문에 적합한 동물 모델로 간주된다. 
외과적 이식 과정이 결과에 미치는 영향을 염두에 두고 적합한 대조군을 포함시켜야 한다.
종 간에는 지혈과 혈액학적 인자 및 활성의 차이가 있기 때문에 가능한 한 사람의 혈액으로 체외 
시험을 실시하는 것이 바람직하다. 
혈전 형성은 동적 과정이다. 따라서 혈전증이 발생하는 동적상태(예를 들어, 혈액과 의료기기 상
호작용의 전단력)를 가능한 많이 모방하여 체외 시험을 실시하는 것이 바람직하다. 원자재와 의료
기기의 상호 작용을 평가하는 일부의 경우에는 정적 시험이 유용할 수도 있다. 
심혈관용 의료기기를 사용하는 환자들은 항혈전제나 항응고제를 투여 중일 수 있기 때문에 이러
한 조건을 체외에서 모방하는 것이 중요하다.
A.1.4 동물 시험에 관한 시험 방법
혈전증, 혈전색전증, 출혈과 감염은 기능이 향상된 심혈관용 보형물의 개발과 사용을 진보시키는
데 있어서 주요 방해 요인이다. 제한적으로(24시간 미만) 혈액에 노출되는 의료기기의 경우, 중요
한 측정 지표는 혈액학적 변수,  성능의 변수, 전반적인 혈전의 형성과 색전이 급성으로 발생 할  
정도와 관련이 있다. 지속노출, 반복노출, 영구접촉 (24시간 초과)의 경우에는 시간경과에 따라 혈
전과 혈전색전증, 순환 혈액 성분의 소진, 내피세포의 비대와 감염의 발생에 관한 정보를 얻을 수 
있는 연속적인 측정 기법이 중요하다. 앞에서 언급한 노출과 접촉의 범위는 용혈과 혈소판 기능을 
평가하는데 중요하다. 예를 들어, 혈전 형성은 외과적 기법, 다양한 시간에 따른 혈전 용해 및 
색전 현상, 겹쳐진 의료기기의 감염성, 노출된 표면의 변이 가능성(예를 들면 내막 비대와 내피화) 
등에 의해 많은 영향을 받을 수 있다.
혈액과 인공 표면(artificial surface)의 상호작용 결과의 범위는 전반적인 혈전과 색전에서부터 지
혈성분의 가속소모와 같은 미세한 영향까지를 포함한다 ; 지혈성분은 소모량이 상쇄되거나 고갈될 
수 있다. (상쇄되는 경우는 의료기기에 의해 소모되는 총 혈소판수가 미미하여 총 혈소판수 계수
에 영향이 없는 경우이고, 고갈되는 경우는 총혈소판수 계수에 영향을 줄 만큼 충분한 혈소판을 소
모할 정도로 의료기기 표면적이 큰 경우이다.)
A.1.5 체외시험에 관한 시험 방법
체외 시험은 상대적으로 저렴한 비용과 동물을 희생시키지 않고도 통계적 평가를 위한 충분한 
횟수의 시험을 가능하게 한다. 측정은 혈액학적 변수, 혈액역학적 변수와 성능 변수, 전반적인 
혈전의 형성과 보체활성의 급성정도와 관련이 있다. 체외 접근법은 의료기기 또는 원자재를 혈액에 
노출시키는 기간을 다양하게 함으로써 다양한 인자와 활성의 역학을 평가할 수 있도록 한다.


- 61 -
A.2 캐뉼러(Cannulae)
캐뉼러는 일반적으로 혈액 통로를 반복적으로 제공하기 위하여 하나 이상의 주요 혈관에 삽입된
다. 캐뉼러는 심폐 우회술 및 기타 과정에도 사용된다. 캐뉼러는 급성 또는 만성으로 시험할 수 
있으며, 일반적으로 동정맥 (AV) 션트와 같이 시험된다. 캐뉼러를 이용하는 경우에는 응고 또는 
보체계의 인자나 순환 혈액 세포의 농도가 약간 변한다. 다른 간접 혈액 경로 의료기기(4.2의 1) 
참조)와 같이 캐뉼러는 일반적으로 순환 혈액과 직접 접촉을 하는 의료기기만큼 시험할 필요는 
없다.(4.2의 2), 4.3 참조).
A.3 카테터와 가이드와이어(Catheters and guidewires)
캐뉼러에서 고려되는 대부분의 시험은 카테터와 가이드와이어 시험과 관련이 있다. 정맥계나 
동맥계에 있는 카테터의 배치와 위치는 혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용에 주요한 영향을 미칠 수 있
다. 반대편의 동맥 또는 정맥을 이용하여 대조 시험을 동시에 실시할 것을 권장한다. 혈전이 떨
어지지 않도록 주의하면서 카테터를 제거하여야 한다. in situ 평가는 혈전형성에 기여하는 내
피 또는 입구 부위의 손상 정도를 평가할 수 있도록 해준다. 일반적으로 도플러 (Doppler) 혈
액 유속 탐침이 혈관 조영기보다 유용한 정보를 제공해준다. 방사능 표지 혈액 성분에 대한 동
적 시험은 만성 카테터(chronic catheters)의 경우에만 권장된다.
A.4 체외 산소발생기, 혈액 투석기, 치료용 혈장교환기, 혈액에서 특정한 물질을 흡수하는 기기 
(Extracorporeal oxygenators, haemodialysers, therapeutic apheresis equipment, and devices 
for absorption of specific substances from blood)
심폐우회술에 대한 지혈반응은 급성이고 아주 클 수 있다. 노출 시간, 혈액과 공기와의 접촉, 
저체온증, blood-pump priming fluid의 성분, 혈액 흡입과 같은 다양한 변수들이 시험 값에 
영향을 미친다. 초음파 방사선 기법이나 비침습 기법을 이용하거나 체내ㆍ외(ex-vivo) 순환형혈
액 여과기를 주기적으로 교체하여 유출선 내의 색전을 검출할 수 있다. 산소발생기 통과 압력의 
감소 및 산소 전달율과 같은 성능 인자를 관찰함으로써 우회술을 진행하는 동안 혈전누적을 직접
적으로 평가할 수 있다. 심폐 우회술을 받은 환자에게서 선택적 알파(alpha) 과립 방출과 관련이 
있는 후천적이고 일시적인 혈소판 기능 장애가 관찰되어 왔다; 특히 일시적인 출혈 시간과 혈소판 
기능 및 방출에 대한 다른 시험들이 유용하다.
보체 활성은 혈액 투석기와 심폐우회장치에 의해 발생할 수 있다. 임상적으로 유의적인 폐울혈
(pulmonary leucostasis)과 기능 장애를 동반한 폐 손상이 나타날 수 있다. 이런 이유로 이런 
의료기기의 경우 보체 활성을 측정하는 것이 유용하다. 
치료용 혈액분리장치(Therapeutic aphoresis equipment)와 혈액에서 특정 물질을 흡수하는 의료기기
는 표면적 대 부피 비율이 높기 때문에 잠재적으로 보체, 응고, 혈소판 및 백혈구 경로를 활성화시
킬 가능성이 있다. 혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용에 대한 시험은 체외 산소 발생기와 혈액 투석기의 
원리와 동일한 원리를 따라야 한다.
A.5 심실보조장치와 인공심장(Ventricular-assist devices and total artificial hearts)


- 62 -
이들 의료기기는 다양한 혈액 성분에 상당한 변화를 일으킬 수 있다. 이런 영향을 일으키는데 도
움을 주는 인자들에는 혈액이 노출되는 넓은 표면적, 높은 유속, 교란된 흐름(분리된 흐름
[separated flow]과 난류[turbulence flow]와 같은)이 포함된다. 이런 의료기기의 시험에는 용혈
성, 피브리노겐 농도, 트롬빈 생성, 혈소판 잔류물과 활성, 보체 활성의 측정과 간ㆍ신장ㆍ폐ㆍ중
추 신경계 기능에 대한 면밀한 관찰이 포함된다. 평가에 있어 외과적 회복 단계의 세부적인 병리
학적 검사는 중요한 요소이다.
A.6 인공판막(Heart valve prostheses)
인공판막(prosthetic valves)을 평가하는데 있어서 침습적, 비침습적, 체외 유체역학적 시험이 중요하
다.
청진(auscultation)은 인공판막 기능장애를 선별하는 가장 효과적인 수단 가운데 하나이다. 2D와 
M 방식의 심장초음파검사는 초음파 방사선을 이용하여 심장의 영상을 조영한다. 서로 다른 음향 
임피던스 (acoustic impedances)를 원자재에 반사시켜 영상을 조영한다. 인공판막의 구조를 평가
할 수 있다. 기계적 보형물은 강력한 음향 신호를 방사하고, 일반적으로 폐색의 움직임을 선명하게 
조영해줄 수 있다. 그러나 영상의 질은 시험되는 특정 판막에 따라 달라진다. 심장초음파검사는 
조직유래 인공판막의 기능을 평가하는데 유용할 수 있다. 조직증식, 엉긴덩어리, 판막편이 두꺼워
졌는지 등을 알 수 있다. 전통적 도플러 심장초음파검사와 칼라 도플러 심장초음파검사를 이용하여 
역류를 규명하고 준정량하는 것이 가능하다.
혈소판 잔류물과 혈소판 응집 측정, 혈전증과 용혈 시험, 혈압과 혈류 측정, 판막과 주변 조직 
검시가 권장된다.
 
A.7 혈관 이식재(Vascular grafts)
다공성 원자재와 비다공성 원자재는 모두 동맥계나 정맥계 내의 다양한 위치에 이식할 수 있다. 
이식부위 선정은 대부분 보형물의 사용목적에 따른다. 이식재의 개방성은 직경이 클수록 그리고 
길이가 짧을수록 향상된다. 일반적으로 내부 직경이 4mm 이하인 이식재의 경우에는 길이가 직경
의 10배 이상(즉, 직경 4mm에 대해 길이 40mm)이 되어야 한다. 주기적인 혈관 조영과 일부 위
치에 있는 말초부위 맥박의 촉진(觸診; palpation)을 통해 개방성을 측정할 수 있다. 초음파 방사
선, MRI와 PET도 유용할 수 있다. 방사능 표지 혈소판에 대한 연속적 영상 관찰의 결과는 개코
원숭이에 이식된 비내피화 이식재의 표면적과 상호관련이 있다. 방사능 표지 혈소판으로 혈관벽
의 혈전 축적을 비침습적으로 조영할 수 있다. 혈소판 수치, 혈소판 방출 인자, 피브리노겐/피브
린 분해산물, 응고가 활성화된 종(activated coagulation species)의 연속적인 측정도 권장된다. 이
식재와 인접 혈관 분절에 대한 검시는 내피 보전성(endothelial integrity)과 증식 반응에 대한 형태
계량학적 연구에 유용한 정보를 제공해 줄 수 있다. 의료기기의 안전성을 평가하는 동안 말초 부위 
문합, 중앙 부위 문합 그리고 대표적인 중간형 이식재의 종단면과 횡단면에 대한 체계적인 평가가 
필요하다.
A.8 하대정맥필터(IVC filters), 스텐트, 스텐트형 이식재


- 63 -
이들 의료기기는 혈관 조영술과 초음파 방사선으로 시험할 수 있다. 혈관 이식재 평가(A.7 참조)에 
유용한 다른 기법들 또한 적합하다.

부록 B
(참조)
실험실 시험 - 원리, 과학적 근거 및 해석
B.1 일반사항
B.1.1 배경
이 부록에서는 5.2.1항의 시험의 원리와 과학적 근거를 설명한다. 세부적인 방법은 진단검사의학
과 임상병리의 표준교재에 제시되어 있다. 
B.1.2 체외 시험에 관한 원리
정적 시스템과 동적 시스템, 예를 들면 순환고리(circulatory loop)와 원심분리(centrifugation)시
스템이 사용된다.
B.1.3 시험조건
혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용을 체외평가하기 위한 시험에서, 항응고 처리된 정상인 또는 시험
동물의 혈액 및 혈장은 먼저 원자재 또는 의료기기에 표준화된 조건으로 노출시켜야 하고, 표준
화된 조건에는 시간, 온도, 유속이 포함된다. 노출된 혈액이나 혈장의 분취량은 노출시킨 이후에 
바로 시험하도록 한다. 노출조건은 의료기기의 사용목적을 근거로 하여야 한다. 
시험을 준비함에 있어 시험 전에 혈액 성분의 방출이나 혈액의 활성화가 일어나지 않게 해야 
한다. 그러나 적절한 조건은 시험하는 의료기기나 원자재 그리고 이들의 사용목적에 따라 결정된다.
B.1.4 분류
사용 중인 위치에서 체내ㆍ외 연결형(externally communicating) 의료기기와 체내이식형 의료기
기를 평가하는 경우에는 항응고제 처리된 용기에 혈액을 채취하며, 사전 노출 단계를 거치지 않고 
시험을 실행한다. 시험은 시험과정이나 시험 시스템에 따라 5.2.1항에 정의되어 있는 5가지 범주
로 분류된다 : 혈전증, 혈액응고, 혈소판, 혈액학, 보체계.
B.2 혈전증(Thrombosis)
B.2.1 일반사항
혈전증의 특성에는 적합한 순환 모델, 동물 모델 또는 임상환경에 적합한 체외(in vitro), 체내ㆍ
외(ex vivo) 및 체내(in vivo) 방법을 포함한다.
B.2.2 폐색율
폐색율은 의료기기를 사용하고 제거한 후에 시각적으로 측정한다. 이는 도관 내에서의 혈전 진행의 
심각한 정도를 측정하는 것이다. 폐색율을 측정하기 전에 혈전은 색전이 되거나 또는 제거되기 때
문에, 폐색이 없다는 것이 반드시 혈전 생성 과정이 없다는 것을 뜻하는 것은 아니다. 폐색은 혈전
뿐 아니라, 내피 비대, 특히 혈관 이식재 주변문합 부위의 내피 비대에 의해서도 발생할 수 있다.; 
폐색 진행의 특성을 규명하기 위하여 현미경 검사가 필요하다. 혈전이 덮여있는 표면적과 그렇지 
않은 표면적 측정은 상대적인 개념으로 사용될 수 있는 준정량적인 시험이다.


- 65 -
B.2.3 혈류 감소
혈류(속도 또는 부피)는 사용 후에 측정한다. 사용 전ㆍ후 또는 사용하는 동안 혈류를 측정할 수
도 있다. 이에 대한 이론적 근거와 해석은 B.2.2과 같다.
B.2.4 중량 분석(혈전 질량)
사용 중인 위치에서 의료기기를 제거한 후에 실시한다. 이에 대한 이론적 근거와 해석은 B.2.2과 
같다.
B.2.5 광학 현미경
본 기법을 이용하여 원자재에 대한 세포 밀도, 세포 응집, 섬유소 점착에 관련된 정보뿐만 아니라 
원자재나 의료기기에 나타나는 침전물의 배치 분포에 관련된 정보도 얻을 수 있다. 이 시험방법은 
준정량적인 방법이다.
B.2.6 의료기기 통과 시 압력 강하
이 시험은 사용 전ㆍ후에 시행한다. 이에 대한 이론적 근거와 해석은 B.2.2과 같다.
B.2.7 주사 전자 현미경 (SEM): Scanning electron microscopy
이에 대한 이론적 근거와 해석은 B.2.5와 같다. 이 방법은 시험하는 성분의 미세 구조에 대해 
보다 세부적인 정보들을 제공해 준다는 점에서 B.2.5의 방법보다 더 이점이 있다. 재현성의 정도
를 확실하게 하기 위하여 충분한 반복을 통해 정량적 결정을 내려야 한다.
B.2.8 항체 결합
피브린과 원자재에 대한 혈소판 점착을 현미경으로 정성분석 한 후, 피브린(피브리노겐) 또는 
혈소판 막 리셉터에 대한 표지된 항체를 측정하여 정량분석을 한다. 이러한 목적을 위하여 표지 
항체 결합 전에 비점착 혈액 성분을 제거하기 위해 노출 후 원자재를 세척한다.
B.2.9 의료기기의 회수 및 검사
이 방법은 이식된 의료기기에 대한 생물학적 반응을 평가하는데 있어 대단히 중요하다. 신중하고 
세부적인 시험방법을 통해 단백질성 침전물, 세포의 현미경적 특성, 세포의 크기 및 분포 상태를 
측정한다. 제안된 과정들은 출판되어 있다.
B.2.10 말초 기관의 검시
이에 대한 이론적 근거는 이식된 의료기기가 말초 부위에 미치는 영향을 평가하는 것이다. 이 영향은 
혈전색전증과 의료기기 구성 성분에 의한 색전이 포함된다.
B.2.11 조영 기법 - 혈관 조영술, 혈관내 초음파, 도플러 (Doppler) 초음파, CT, MRI
이 방법들 중에서 선정하여, 이식재나 기타 도관의 협착 정도나 개방성을 측정하고, 체내에서 작동
하는 동안 의료기기에 대한 혈전 점착을 검출한다.
B.3 혈액응고


- 66 -
혈액응고 시험은 천연(신선하고 항응고처리되지 않은)전혈과 항응고처리된 전혈(일반적으로 구연
산염화된), 혈소판 풍부 혈장 또는 혈소판 결핍 혈장을 이용한다. 대부분의 표준 응고 평가 방법은 
과다 출혈이나 응고 지연의 원인이 되는 임상적 응고 이상을 측정하기 위하여 설계되기 때문에, 
생체재료(biomaterial)가 유도하는 가속 응고를 측정하기 위하여 혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용 평가 
방법에 관한 방법을 적합하게 변형시켜야 한다. aPTT(activated partial thromboplastin time)에 
근거한 시험에 쓰이는 시약에는 고령토(kaolin)나 규조토(celite),  엘라직 산(ellagic acid)과 같은 
활성제가 포함된다. 그러한 활성제를 이용하는 시약은 원자재와 의료기기가 일으키는 응고의 
가속화를 가리는 경향이 있으므로 피해야 한다. 시험하려는 원자재를 활성제로 이용한다.; (시험
물질이 들어있지 않은)대조군이 포함되어야 한다.
관의 내표면이 시험원자재인 경우에는 평행 판 세포(parallel plate cell)와 같은 정적 챔버 또는 
폐회로 시스템(closed-loop system)에서 혈액을 원자재에 노출시킨다. 시험 표면에 대한 접촉 
시간을 미리 결정한 후에 표면과 혈액에 대한 시험을 할 수 있다.
B.3.1 부분 트롬보플라스틴 시간(PTT; Partial thromboplastin time)
PTT는 재석회화된 구연산염 첨가 혈장에 부분 트롬보플라스틴(partial thromboplastin)을 넣어주
었을 때 혈장이 응고하는데 걸리는 시간이다. 부분 트롬보플라스틴은 일반적으로 포유류의 뇌나 
폐로부터 나오는 균질한 현탁액이거나, 조직 트롬보플라스틴에서 용출된 인지질 현탁액이다. 표준
조건에서 원자재와 접촉했을 때 PTT가 단축되는 것은 접촉면의 혈액응고가 활성화되었음을 나타
내는 것이다. PTT가 길어진 것은 혈장내 응고 인자 Ⅰ (섬유소원), Ⅱ (프로트롬빈), Ⅴ, Ⅷ, Ⅸ, 
Ⅹ, Ⅺ, Ⅻ의 결핍을 암시하지만, Ⅶ 또는 ⅩⅢ 의 결핍을 암시하는 것은 아니다. 헤파린과 기타 항
응고제에 의해서도 PTT는 길어진다.
고령토나 규조토와 같이 다양한 활성제를 이용하는 부분 트롬보플라스틴 시약은 시판되는 상품을 
이용할 수도 있다. 이들 시약을 이용하는 시험은 활성화된 부분 트롬보플라스틴 시간 (APTT)이
라고 부른다. APTT는 활성제가 의료기기나 또는 의료기기의 부분 원자재가 일으키는 활성을 가
리기 때문에 혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용을 체외 평가하는데 유용하지 않다.
B.3.2 프로트롬빈 (Prothrombin)시간(PT)
이 시험은 프로트롬빈 인자와 부속 인자를 측정한다. 조직 트롬보플라스틴이 존재하는 경우, 응고 
시간은 프로트롬빈과 인자Ⅴ, Ⅶ, Ⅹ (피브리노겐, 피브린용해성, 항응고제 활성이 정상이라고 
가정함)에 의해 좌우된다. 프로트롬빈 시간(PT)이 길어졌다는 것은 일반적으로 프로트롬빈과 인
자Ⅴ, Ⅶ, Ⅹ, 또는 피브리노겐의 결핍을 나타낸다. 시험 키트는 시판되는 상품을 이용할 수 있
다.
B.3.3 트롬빈 (Thrombin) 시간(TT)
트롬빈 시간(TT)[38]은 트롬빈 용액을 첨가했을 때 혈장이 응고하는데 걸리는 시간이다.  피브리
노겐의 결핍(100mg/dl 이하), 피브리노겐의 질적 이상, FDP 또는 헤파린의 수준이 높아진 경우에 
트롬빈 시간(TT)은 길어진다. 이 시험은 체내이식형 의료기기를 평가하는 경우에만 유용하다.
B.3.4 혈전 생성
손상되지 않은 응고 시스템에 노출된 원자재는 인지질 존재시(B.3.1 참조) 혈전을 생성하는데 이

는 발색성 기질의 전환(conversion of a chromogenic substrate)에 의해 측정할 수 있다. 이 시
험방법은 전통적인 응고시험에 비해 변수가 훨씬 적다.
B.3.5 피브리노겐
이섬유소원혈증(dysfibrinogenaemia), 
무섬유소원혈증(afibrinogenaemia), 
저섬유소원혈증
(hypofibrinogenaemia)은 프로트롬빈 시간(PT), 부분 트롬보플라스틴 시간(PTT), 트롬빈 시간(TT)을 길게 
한다.
B.3.6 피브리노겐과 피브린 분해산물(Fibrinogen and fibrin degradatin products; FDP)
정상적인 생리학적 섬유소 분해 과정에서 FDPs X, Y, C, D, E가 혈장농도 2mg/ml 이하로 생긴다. 
분해반응 속도는 낮고, 순환계에서 FDPs를 제거하는 속도는 빠르기 때문에 FDP는 낮은 농도로 
유지된다. 플라스미노겐(plasminogen)의 활성이 증가되면 피브린과 피브리노겐의 병적인 분해가 
일어나 2mg/ml∼40mg/ml 또는 그 이상의 FDP를 만들어낸다. 이 시험은 체내이식형 의료기기를 
평가하는 경우에만 유용하다. 시판되고 있는 제품을 사용할 것을 권장한다.
B.3.7 특정 응고인자 검사법
표준조건에서 원자재 또는 의료기기에 혈액을 노출시켰을 때, 응고 인자가 현저하게 감소하였다는 
것은(예를 들어, 정상 또는 대조 수준의 50% 이하까지) 그 요소들이 흡착, 응고, 기타 기전에 
의해 가속 소모되었음을 나타낸다.
B.3.8 FPA, D-dimer, F1+2, TAT
FPA, D-dimer, F1+2 수준의 상승은 응고 기전이 활성화되었음을 의미한다. FPA와 F1+2는 프로
트롬빈이 트롬빈으로 활성화되었음을 나타낸다. TAT 복합체의 증가는 생성된 트롬빈과 순환하는 
항트롬빈 사이의 복합체 형성과 혈액응고가 활성화되었음을 의미한다. D-dimer는 F XIII에 의해 
가교된 피브린(F XIII cross-linked fibrin; F XIII는 피브린 안정화 인자)이 플라스민에 의해 분해
되어 생기는 분해산물이다(응고와 피브린용해). ELISA와 RIA를 사용할 것을 권장한다.
B.4 혈소판과 혈소판 기능
혈소판 현탁액을 준비하는 과정에서는 활성화를 예방하는 것이 중요하다.
B.4.1 혈소판 수치
혈소판의 핵심적인 역할이 출혈을 예방하는 것이므로 혈소판 수치를 측정하는 것은 중요하다. 의
료기기나 원자재에 의한 혈액 응고 또는 혈소판 점착과 혈소판 응집 그리고 혈소판 격리(예들 들
어, 비장 내에서의)에 의해 의료기기에 노출된 혈액의 혈소판 수치가 현저하게 감소될 수 있다. 
순환계에서의 혈소판 제거나 파괴가 가속화되어 체내이식형 의료기기를 사용하는 동안 혈소판 
수치가 감소할 수도 있다. 혈소판 수치는 EDTA 현탁 배지를 이용하여 측정한다.
채혈 기법은 재현성이 있어야 한다. 혈소판은 부적절한 채혈을 포함하여 다양한 조건 하에서 
지나치게 활성화될 수 있다. 정상적인 혈소판 반응을 입증하는 시험은 일반적으로 응집 측정기
(aggregometer)를 이용해 실시한다. 이러한 방법을 이용하면 반응이 감소된 혈소판 표본을 쉽게 
검출할 수 있으나 지나치게 활성화된 혈소판은 정상적으로 검출되지 않는다. 혈소판이 원자재나 


- 68 -
의료기기에 노출된 후에 과활성화된 경우에는 혈소판 응집 시험을 변경시켜서(혈소판 또는 응집
제의 농도를 적절하게 낮추어서) 이를 측정할 수 있다. 
B.4.2 혈소판 응집
지속적으로 
교반한 
PRP(platelet 
rich 
plasma)에 
응집제(예들 
들어, 
ADP, 
에피네프린 
[epinephrine], 콜라겐 [collagen], 트롬빈 [thrombin] 등등)를 첨가하여 혈소판 응집을 유도한
다. 혈소판 응집될수록 혈장은 점점 더 맑아진다. 광학 시스템(응집측정기)은 광 투과의 변화를 
검출하는데 사용되고, 기록계는 도식적으로 기준선으로부터 광 투과가 변한 정도를 나타낸다. 입자
성분, 증가된 FDP 또는 특정한 약품 (예들 들어, 아스피린, 비스테로이드성 항염증제)의 방출과 
혈소판 활성화에 의해 혈소판 응집이 지연되거나 또는 감소될 수 있다. 혈소판 응집은 이용하는 
약품에 따라 다양하게 나타나거나 또는 일부 동물 종에서는 나타나지 않을 수 있다는 사실에 주
의하여야 한다. 작용물질을 첨가하지 않아도 일어나는 자연 발생적인 혈소판 응집은 혈소판의 활
성화를 의미하는 비정상적인 상태이다. 혈소판 응집은 또한 WU/HOAK 방법으로도 자동 선별할 
수 있다.
B.4.3 혈액세포점착
혈액세포점착은 말초부위 색전 또는 하나 이상의 혈액학적 인자 활성화의 증거와 관련하여 원자
재의 혈액적합성을 측정하는 것이다.
Kuniki K-score와 같이 표면에 대한 세포의 점착을 측정하는 다양한 방법들이 설계되어 왔다. 
이 방법들의 대부분은 통제된 흐름이나 압력 조건에서 유리 비드 컬럼(a column of glass 
beads)을 통과하면서 정상적 전혈에서 제거되는 혈소판의 특정 비율을 관찰하는데 기초한다. 이 
원리는 유리 비드에 코팅된 중합체에 대한 기타 혈액세포의 정량에 적합하도록 변형되어왔다. 이
런 방법으로 연구한 결과 폴리(수산화에틸 메타크릴레이트)[poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate); 
PHEMA]로 코팅된 비드에 대한 개과 종의 말초 림프구와 다형핵 백혈구(PMNs)의 점착은 폴리스
티렌(polystyrene)과 기타 중합체로 코팅된 비드에 대한 점착보다 낮은 것으로 보고되고 있다. 이 
연구에는 고립성 림프구와 다형핵 백혈구(PMNs)가 이용되었다.
다른 방법으로 시험 표면에 대한 혈소판 점착을 직접 측정하는 방법이 있다. 표준화된 조건 하에
서 PRP(platelet rich plasma)나 혈액에 시험표면을 노출 시킨 다음 점착되지 않은 세포를 씻어
내어 제거한 후, 표면을 고정시키고, 주사 전자 현미경이나 광학 현미경 검사를 위한 준비를 한
다. 단위 면적당 점착 혈소판의 수치를 직접 측정하고, 형태(예들 들어, 확산된 양, 응집 형성의 
정도)를 기록한다. 51Cr(크롬)이나 111 In(인듐)으로 사전 표지한 혈소판을 대신 이용할 수도 있다. 
B.4.4 혈소판 활성화
특정한 원자재나 의료기기를 이용하는 경우 그로 인해 혈소판이 활성화될 수 있다.
어떤 원자재 또는 의료기기를 사용하면 혈소판 활성화를 유발할 수 있고, 이는 다음의 결과를 나
타낼 수 있다.
1) 
혈소판 
인자 
4(PF 
4), 
세로토닌(serotonin) 
그리고 
BTG 
(베타 
트롬보글로블린[Beta 
thromboglobulin])과 같은 혈소판 과립체의 방출
2) 변형된 혈소판 형태


- 69 -
3) 혈소판 미립자의 생성
활성화된 혈소판은 혈전형성성(pro-thrombotic)이다. 혈소판 활성화는 다양한 방법으로 측정할 
수 있다. ; 원자재나 의료기기에 점착된 혈소판의 형태에 대한 현미경 (광학 현미경과 전자 현미
경)검사, BTG, PF4, 세로토닌의 측정 및 유세포 분석기(Flow cytometry)를 이용한 혈소판 활성
화 평가(미립자 생성 측정, P-selectin 발현 측정, 또는 단클론 항체를 이용하여 활성화된 글리코
프로테인lb 및 llB/llla 발현 측정). 활성화된 혈소판의 다른 에피톱(epitope)들은 두 개의 항체를 
사용하여 유세포 분석기(Flow cytometry)에 의해 인식된다: 하나는 혈소판(GPlb or GP 
llb/llla)에 대해 특이적이고, 또 하나는 혈소판 활성(P-selectin)에 대해 특이적이다.
B.4.5 템플레이트 출혈 시간 (TBT: Template bleeding time)
표준 조건 하에서 표준 깊이와 길이로 피부를 절개하는데 멸균한 1회용 기구를 상업적으로 이용
할 수 있게 되면서 이러한 시험의 유용성과 재현성이 현저하게 향상되었다. 출혈 시간이 길어졌다
는 것은 혈소판 기능의 감소나 혈소판 수치의 감소를 나타낸다.; 혈소판 수치는 독립적으로 측
정할 수 있다 (B.4.1 참조). 제한적으로 인체에 접촉하는 몇몇 체내ㆍ외 연결형 의료기기
(external communicating devices; 예를 들면 심폐 우회로 관련 의료기기)와 관련하여 혈소판 
수치가 정상임에도 출혈시간이 길어지는 것이 관찰되어왔다. 이 시험은 몇몇 실험동물에 사용하기
에 적합하다. 체외 출혈시간 측정도 적절하다.
B.4.6 혈소판 기능 분석
전형적인 템플레이트 출혈 시간은 자동화된 방법을 위한 원리로 이용되어 왔다. 구경이 150 ㎛인 
콜라겐 필터를 통해 전혈을 흡입한다. 흡입이 완료될 때까지 혈소판은 점착되고, 응집된다. 혈압과 
온도가 표준화되고, 항응고요법(anticoagulation)는 이 시험에 영향을 미치지 않는다. 동물의 혈액
을 이용하는 경우 적합한 시험방법이다.
B.4.7 방사선 표지 혈소판의 감마 영상
이 시험을 위하여 감마선 방출이 높은 111In(인듐)을 이용할 수 있다. 본 방법을 통해 혈소판이 침
착된 의료기기의 부위와 침착된 양을 측정할 수 있다. 체내ㆍ외 연결형 의료기기(external 
communicating devices)뿐만 아니라 체내이식형 의료기기에도 유용한 시험법이다.
B.4.8 혈소판 수명 (잔존 혈소판)
환자의 혈액에서 혈소판을 채취한 후 51Cr이나 111In으로 표지를 한다. 검체에 존재하는 모든 연령
(ages)의 혈소판에 표지하는 이 두 시약은, 혈소판으로부터 지나치게 녹여서 분리하지 않고, 다른 
세포에 흡수되거나 혈전형성에 재사용되지 않는다. 수명 연구와 연관된 국소적 혈소판 점착을 평
가하는데 있어 111In(인듐)은 체표면 수치를 측정할 수 있고, 보다 적은 수의 표지 혈소판을 필요
로 하며, 강력한 감마방사체라는 장점을 지니고 있다. 혈소판 수명의 감소는 면역, 혈전 또는 
기타 과정에 의해 순환계로부터 제거되는 속도가 가속화되었음을 의미한다. 
B.5 혈액학
B.5.1 백혈구
L-selectin과 CD11b와 같이 증가된 백혈구 표지자를 평가하고, 백혈구 아집단(subgroup) 내의 


- 70 -
교란을 정량적으로 평가하기 위하여 유세포 분석기를 이용하고, 활성화된 백혈구 또는 의료기기 
표면을 현미경으로 검사하여 백혈구 활성을 측정한다.
B.5.2 용혈성
이는 증가된 혈장 헤모글로빈 수치로 인해 특히 중요한 선별 시험으로 간주된다. 만일 이 시험이 
적합하게 수행되면, 증가된 혈장 헤모글로빈 수치는 용혈을 의미하며, 이는 의료기기와 원자재에 
접촉 하는 적혈구 막의 취약성을 반영한다(부록 C 참조).
B.5.3 망상 적혈구 수치
증가된 망상 적혈구 수치는 골수에서 적혈구의 생성이 증가되었음을 의미한다. 이는 만성적인 혈
액 손실 (출혈)이나 용혈 또는 기타 기전에 의해 적혈구 양이 감소된 결과일 수 있다.
B.6 보체계 - CH50과 C3a, C5a, TCC, Bb, iC3b, C4d, SC5b-9
CH50의 감소는 전체 보체 소비량의 지표이다. 이들 보체 성분의 수준 상승은 보체계가 활성화되
었음을 의미한다. 일부 원자재는 보체를 활성화 시키고, 활성화된 보체 성분은 백혈구를 활성화 
시키며, 이로 인해 폐에서 보체 성분들을 응집시키고 격리시킨다.
체외 시험 후에 보체 분해 산물을 측정하면, 종 특이성과 기선 수준(baseline level)이 높다는 단
점이 있다. 전형적인 CH-50 방법은 사람, 소, 돼지 그리고 토끼의 혈청에 유용한 것으로 나타났다.
체외 보체 활성 측정에 대한 또 다른 기능적 방법은 기질 전환법으로 측정되는 C3-전환 효소나 
C5-전환 효소의 보체 생성이다.

부록 C
(참조) 
의료기기와 의료기기 구성 성분의 용혈성에 대한 평가
C.1 일반적 고려 사항
혈액과 의료기기의 상호작용에 관한 논문은 광범위하게 존재하고 있다. 그러나 신뢰할 만하고, 
재현 가능하며, 임상적 성능을 예측하는 방법은 소수에 지나지 않는다. 본 부록은 이미 알려져 
있는 용혈성 시험방법을 검토하고, 의료용 및 치과용 원자재와 의료기기의 특성을 규명하기 위
한 시험방법의 요건과 관련된 요소들을 논의하고자 한다.
C.2 용어 및 정의
본 부록에서는 다음의 정의를 적용한다.
C.2.1 항응고제
혈액 응고를 지연시키거나 예방하는 약품
예) 헤파린 또는 구연산염
C.2.2 교질 삼투압, 콜로이드 삼투압
단백질 또는 분자량이 큰 물질이 혈장의 삼투활성에 미치는 총체적 영향
C.2.3 적혈구 용적
주어진 검체의 전혈 중 적혈구의 용적율
C.2.4 용혈(haemolysis)
세포막이 파괴된 적혈구 또는 부분적으로 손상되었으나 세포막은 그대로인 적혈구에서 헤모글로빈이 
유리되는 것
C.2.5 음성 참고 물질(negative reference material)
고밀도 폴리에틸렌 또는 유사한 것으로 검증된 대체물질
C.2.6 농축 적혈구(packed erythrocytes)
1단위의 혈액을 원심분리하고 혈장 상층액을 제거한 후 얻은 성분
주) 수혈에 관한 적혈구의 특성 : 성분의 적혈구 용적율은 0.65에서 0.80이다. 농축 적혈구 1단위
에는 원래혈액 1단위의 적혈구 전체가 들어있고, 백혈구의 대부분이 들어있으며(약 2.5~3.0 × 
109 개), 혈소판의 양은 원심분리 방법에 따라 다양하게 들어있다.
C.2.7 세척 적혈구(washed erythrocytes)
전혈에서 혈장을 제거하고 등장액으로 세척한 후 얻은 적혈구 현탁물


- 72 -
주) 세척 적혈구는 혈장과 백혈구 그리고 혈소판을 대부분 제거한 후 얻은 적혈구 현탁물이다. 
잔류 혈장의 양은 세척 방법에 의해 좌우된다. 세척 이후 보관 기간은 가능한 짧아야 하며, 
1~6℃ 에서 24시간을 넘기지 않도록 한다.
C.2.8 전혈(whole blood)
선정된 기증자로부터 유래한 혈액으로, 항응고제인 헤파린이나 구연산염을 함유하고 있는 분리되지 
않은 혈액
C.3 용혈의 원인
C.3.1 기계적 힘 - 압력
적혈구 막은 반투막이다. 농도가 다른  두 용액이 반투막에 의해 분리되어 있을 때 압력의 차이가 
발생한다. 막이 수동 수송에 대해 불투과성일때 삼투압이 생긴다. 압력의 차이는 유리된 헤모글로
빈의 방출과 함께 적혈구 팽창과 세포막 파열을 유발한다.
C.3.2 기계적 힘 - 유동학 (레올로지; Rheology)
혈액의 유속, 전단력, 기타 힘에 영향을 주는 요소로 적혈구 막을 변형시켜 파열을 유발할 수 있다.
C.3.3 생화학적 인자
분자 수준에서의 막 구조 변경으로 적혈구 막의 탄력 특성과 강도가 변할 수 있다. 영양소나 
대사 에너지(ATP)의 결핍은 원반 형태로 미세 소수포를 가지고 있는 헤모글로빈의 손실을 유
발할 수 있다. 기타 화학물질, 세균 독소 그리고 pH와 온도에 의해 유도되는 대사 변화 등에 의
해 적혈구 막이 손상될 수도 있다. 이런 변화는 예상한 삼투압보다 낮은 삼투압에서 막을 파열시
킬 수 있다. 적혈구 막이 파열되는(삼투압 취약성) 압력을 측정하기 위한 시험을 실시하여야 한다.
C.4 용혈의 임상적 중요성
C.4.1 독성 효과
자유 혈장 헤모글로빈의 수준이 높아지면 신장이나 또는 기타 기관에 스트레스를 줄 수 있는 진
행이 시작되거나 독성 효과가 유도될 수 있다. 자유 혈장 헤모글로빈(free plasma haemoglobin)
의 농도는 적혈구의 손상을 측정하기에도 편리할 뿐 아니라, 기타 혈액 성분 손상의 간접적 지표
가 되기도 한다.
C.4.2 혈전증(Thrombosis)
혈관 내 용혈은 인지질을 유리시켜 혈전을 촉진할 수 있다. 용혈로 인해 임상적으로 적혈구 수치
가 현저하게 떨어지는 경우에는 뇌와 기타 기관 또는 조직에 영향을 줄 수 있는 빈혈과 산소운반
능력 감소현상이 발생한다.
C.5 용혈에 대한 적합/부적합 평가 결정
용혈은 표면 에너지, 표면 형태 그리고 표면의 화학적 성질과 같은 물질의 특성과 시간의 작용이
다. 용혈은 또한 전단력, 세포벽 상호작용, 흡수된 단백질 층의 특성, 흐름 안정성, 공기유입(air 


- 73 -
entrainment), 혈액의 출처ㆍ수명ㆍ화학적 변수에 의한 작용이기도 하다. 이런 변수들은 원자재와 
의료기기 사이의 잠재적 용혈성을 비교하기 위하여 적절하게 조절되어야 한다. 용혈을 평가하기 
위한 방법의 범위는 단순한 모델에서 고도로 복잡한 모델까지 다양하다. 흐르는 혈액에 대한 특정 
체외 평가모델 및 체내 평가모델이 알려져 있다. 잠재적 용혈성은 절대적 측정보다는 특정 시험실
에서 동일한 모델로 시험하여 의료기기 또는 원자재를 상대 비교한다. 체내 조건 하에서는 측정할 
수 없는 매우 낮은 수준의 혈장 헤모글로빈의 양을(예들 들어, 혈장 헤모글로빈이 합토글로빈
[haptoglobin]과 결합되거나 인체에서 급속히 제거되는 경우) 체외 시험방법으로 측정할 수 있다. 
또한 체내 시험 환경에서 용혈을 나타내는 지표로써 유산염(lactate) 탈수소 효소와 합토글로빈의 
측정을 고려할 수 있다.
모든 의료기기의 이용과 관련해 허용될 수 있거나, 허용될 수 없는 용혈의 보편적인 양을 규명하는 
것은 불가능하다. 의료기기가 용혈에 미치는 영향은 외과적 시술에서의 외상에 의해 단기간에 
가려질 수 있다. 의료기기는 상당한 양의 용혈을 일으킬 수 있지만, 생명에 치명적인 상황에서 
가능한 유일한 조치이다. 직관적으로, 혈액 적합성인 원자재는 비용혈성이다. 사실상 많은 의료
기기가 용혈을 일으키지만, 이들 의료기기의 임상적 혜택은 용혈과 관련된 위험성을 능가한다. 
따라서 의료기기가 용혈을 일으키는 경우에는 의료기기가 제공하는 임상적 혜택과 임상적으로 
허용될 수 있는 용혈의 한도를 확실하게 하는 것이 중요하다. 허용 기준은 위험성과 혜택 평가의 
일정 형식을 바탕으로 정당화되어야 한다. 다음의 질문들이 그러한 평가를 위해 제안된다.
1) 환자에게 얼마동안 의료기기를 노출 시키는가?
2) 원자재나 의료기기가 일으키는 용혈 정도는? 의료기기가 환자에게 노출되어 있는 시간 내내 
계속해서 용혈을 일으키는가? 의료기기를 제거한 후에도 용혈이 지속되는가?
3) 치료조건에 대해 이용할 수 있는 다른 방법들의 혜택과 위험성은 무엇인가?
4) 알려진 치료법의 용혈 특성은 무엇인가? 문제의 의료기기와 다른 치료법을 비교하는 방법은 
무엇인가?
5) 시험 의료기기는 다른 형태의 치료법과 비교하여 얼마나 효율적인가? 보다 효율적인 의료기기가 
사용하는 동안 더 많은 용혈을 유발할 수도 있지만, 이런 추가적인 효율성은 환자에게 보다 큰 
혜택을 제공할 수도 있다.
C.6 용혈성 시험 - 일반적 고려 사항
C.6.1 방법
C.6.1.1 일반사항
적혈구의 손상을 평가하기 위하여 체외 시험을 이용한다. 직접적 방법은 적혈구와의 화학적, 물리적 
상호작용에 의한 용혈을 측정한다. 간접적 방법은 시험검체의 용출액에 의한 용혈을 측정한다. 이
외에도 의료기기의 구조 및 사용목적에 따른 영향, 그리고 혈액 역학적 요소를 평가하기 위해 동
적 시험을 고려하여야 한다.
가장 간단한 형태로, 많이 희석된 적혈구 현탁액과 시험원자재가 접촉을 하는 경우 (시험 시작 시
에 측정할 수 있는) 총 헤모글로빈에 대한 상청액에 유리된 헤모글로빈의 비율로 기록한다[즉, 
(유리된 헤모글로빈 농도/총 헤모글로빈 농도) × 100%]. 만일 시험의 시작 단계에 존재하던 모


- 74 -
든 적혈구가 파괴되면, 용혈성이 100%이다. 많이 희석한 적혈구 현탁액을 의료기기 시험에 사용할 
수 없는 경우에는, 용혈지수의 표준화에 있어서 적혈구용적률(haematocrit)과 기타 요소들을 설명
하여야 한다.
각각의 실험에서는 최소한 전혈 헤모글로빈 농도와 혈장 헤모글로빈 농도 또는 상청액 헤모글로빈 
농도를 측정할 수 있어야 한다. 혈장에 있는 헤모글로빈의 농도는 전혈 헤모글로빈 농도보다 훨씬 
적다. 전혈 헤모글로빈의 정상 범위가 11000mg/dl에서 18000mg/dl 인 반면에 유리된 혈장 헤모
글로빈의 체내 농도는 일반적으로 0mg/dl 에서 10mg/dl이다. 이런 이유로 용혈 시험을 실시하는 
동안 나타나게 되는 광범위한 헤모글로빈 농도를 측정하기 위하여 다양한 방법들을 이용되어 왔
다.
관행에 따라, 세 가지 분석 방법을 혈액 헤모글로빈 (Hb) 농도를 측정하는데 이용해 왔다.
주) 연구자들은 의료용 원자재나 용액에 들어 있는 화학물질이 적혈구 취약성을 변경시키고(예들 
들어, 포름알데히드 또는 글루탈알데히드와 같은 정착제에 의해), 헤모글로빈을 침전시키거
나(예들 들어, 구리 또는 아연 이온에 의해) 헤모글로빈의 흡수 스펙트럼을 변경시킬 수 
있는(예들 들어, 폴리에틸렌글리콜 또는 에탄올에 의해) 부작용을 일으킬 수 있음을 인식하여
야 한다.
C.6.1.2 전혈 헤모글로빈 농도 측정
C.6.1.2.1 시안메트헤모글로빈 (Cyanmethaemoglobin) 방법
첫 번째로 전형적인 방법인 시안메트헤모글로빈 검출법은 ICSH(International Committee for 
Standardization in Haematology)에 의해 발표되었다. 시안메트헤모글로빈 (헤모글로빈시아나이
드; HiCN) 분석법은 1차 참조 표준 (HiCN)을 이용할 수 있으며, 자동화되어 쉽고, 편리하다는 것
이 장점이다. 이 방법은 Hb를 산화시켜 540nm에서 넓은 흡광영역을 가지는 헤모글로빈시아나이
드를 형성하는 것이다. 세정제와 같은 적혈구 용혈제를 이용하여 적혈구에서 Hb를 방출시키고, 
단백질 침전에 의한 혼탁도 (540nm에서의 유사 흡광을 나타내어 간섭을 일으키는 원인)를 감소
시킨다. 총헤모글로빈 농도의 경우, 혈장으로 인한 스펙트럼 간섭이 가장 적으며, 검체의 흡광도
를 HiCN 표준 용액과 직접 비교할 수 있다.
이 범위 내에서 HiCN의 흡광 영역이 넓기 때문에 수동 또는 자동 검출용 협대역 분광 광도계뿐만 
아니라 단순한 필터형 광도계도 이용할 수가 있다. HiCN 참조 표준을 이용하면 이 방법을 이용하고 
있는 모든 시험실 간에 비교가 가능하다. 시아나이드 용액을 이용하는 경우 가장 큰 단점은 잠재
적으로 인체에 위해할 수 있다는 것이다. 시아노 시약들은 독성의 노출 경로가 다양할 뿐만 아니라 
산성화 되어 HCN을 방출한다. 또한 시약과 제품의 폐기에 상당한 주의를 기울여야 하고 많은 
비용이 필요하다.
C.6.1.2.2 산화헤모글로빈 (Oxyhaemoglobin) 방법
총헤모글로빈 농도를 측정하는 두 번째 전형적인 방법은 오늘날 그다지 널리 사용되지 않고 있다. 
산화헤모글로빈 방법은 수산화암모늄을 처리하는 동안 형성되는 HbO2를 분광광도계로 검출하는 
것이다. 또한 희석한 탄산나트륨 용액에서 산화헤모글로빈을 정량하는 방법이 이용되기도 하였다. 


- 75 -
안정적인 참조 물질을 이용할 수는 없으나, 원래 검체의 총 헤모글로빈이 혈장에도 존재하는 비율이 
측정에 필요한 전부이기 때문에 이는 중요하지 않다. 어느 경우든 단기 표준은 신선한 혈액 검체에
서 준비하여야 한다.
C.6.1.2.3 철분 농도 측정법
총 헤모글로빈의 농도를 측정하는 세 번째 전형적인 방법은 용액의 헤모글로빈 철분 농도를 측정
하는 것이다. 먼저 일반적으로 산이나 회화법(ashing)을 이용하여 Hb에서 철분을 분리시킨 다음에 
광도를 측정할 수 있도록 색상을 발현시키기 위하여 삼염화티타늄(TiCl3)또는 시약과 합성한 삼염
화티타늄으로 적정한다. 본 방법은 일상적인 연구에 이용하기에는 너무 복잡하기 때문에 거의 이용
되지 않고 있다.
C.6.1.3 혈장 또는 상청 헤모글로빈 농도 측정법
C.6.1.3.1 직접 광학 기법과 부가적인 화학적 기법
수많은 다양한 요인들 (예들 들어, 전통, 사용의 용이함, 폐기 화학물질의 처리, 표준 용액의 이용
가능성)로 인해, 현재 용혈에 대한 지표로 혈장 헤모글로빈을 측정하는 데에는 약 20개의 방법이 
이용되고 있다. 그러나 그 중 어느 방법도 폭넓게 인정받지는 못하고 있다. 평가 방법은 두 개의 
커다란 범주로 분류될 수 있다. 하나는 직접 광학 기법 (즉, 미분 분광 광도계[derivative 
spectrophotometry]를 이용하거나 직접적으로 415, 541 그리고 577nm에서 산화헤모글로빈 흡
광 피크를 측정하는 것을 이용하는 방법)이며, 다른 하나는 부가적인 화학적 기법 (즉, 벤지딘 같
은 발색제나 과산화수소와 같은 시약들과의 화학적 상호작용 또는 시안메트헤모글로빈의 형성을 
근거로 헤모글로빈을 정량하는 방법)이다. 모든 분석은 수동이나 자동으로 실행할 수 있다.
헤모글로빈의 
농도를 
측정하는데 
가장 
널리 
이용되고 
있는 
방법은 
테트라메틸벤지딘
(tetramethylbenzidene)과 같은 벤지딘 유도체의 산화에서 과산화수소에 의한 촉매 작용을 근거
로 하고 있다. 착색된 산출물 (600nm에서 흡광도 측정법으로 측정되는)의 형성 비율은 헤모글로
빈의 농도와 정비례한다. 이 방법의 장점은 자동화되어 있어 용이하며(상업적 장비), 잠재적 독성
을 제거하고 환경적으로 불안전한 시아노 시약들을 사용하지 않으며, 1차 참조 표준인 HiCN
에 대응하여 Hb 표준세트를 이용할 수 있다는 것이다. 평가의 측정 한도 (5.0 mg/dl 정도로 낮
은 측정한도)는 헤모글로빈 시아나이드 방법과 유사하다. 주요 단점은 벤지딘 염료를 이용하기 때
문에 건강에 대한 잠재적 위험이 여전히 있으며, 시약과 산물의 폐기에 비용이 많이 든다는 점이
다. 더욱이 이 방법의 동적 범위는 낮은 것 (5 mg/dl에서 50mg/dl)으로 보고되고 있고, 칼슘 킬레
이트 항응고제 (예들 들어, 구연산염, 수산염, EDTA), 알부민, 또는 과산화수소의 산화에 간섭을 
일으킬 수 있는 기타 비특정 혈장 성분에 의해 반응 억제가 일어날 수도 있다(40%정도).
이러한 이유들로 인해, 하보(Harboe), 크립스 (Cripps) 또는 타우리어 (Taulier)가 제시한 비교 
가능한 민감도 및 재현성을 가진 방법들과 같은 직접 광학 방법이 대체방법이 될 수 있다. 그러나 
앞에서 언급했던 바와 같이 헤모글로빈과 스펙트럼에 화학적으로 유도된 변형이 생기면 일부 헤모
글로빈에 대한 평가가 무효화될 수도 있다. 더욱이, 혈장 배경간섭(background interference)은 
헤모글로빈의 스펙트럼도 변형시킬 수 있기 때문에 이를 보정할 필요가 있다. 연구자는 혈장 
헤모글로빈 평가에서 이러한 한계를 인식하고, 적합한 기법을 이용하고 있는 지의 여부를 확인하
여야 한다. 여기에는 시험 상청액에 침전물의 존재여부를 평가하는 것과 검출된 광학 스펙트럼(예들 


- 76 -
들어, 400nm에서 700nm)을 분리된 산화헤모글로빈의 광학 스펙트럼과비교하는 것이 포함된다.
C.6.1.3.2 면역네펠로메트릭 (Immunonephelometric) 방법
면역네펠로메트릭 방법의 근거는 상업적으로 이용 가능한 항체를 이용하여 네펠로메트리
(nephelometry) 장치로 혈장 헤모글로빈을 측정하는 것이다. 이 방법은 일상적인 검사를 위한 것
이며, 광학기법과 유사하고 상관관계가 좋은 방법이다.
C.6.2 혈액과 혈액 성분 보관
이 항에는 미국 혈액 은행 협회(American Association of Blood Banks)와 유럽 이사회(Council 
of Europe)가 인증한 사람의 혈액을 보관하는데 가장 좋은 방법이 제시되어 있다. 일반적으로 
원자재와 의료기기는 임상적으로 적용될 때의 조건(예들 들어 적절한 항응고제 선택, 최소한의 
혈액방부제 사용, 적합한 혈액 pH)을 모방하고 있는 혈액을 사용하여 시험하여야 한다.
항응고 용액은 채혈 시 응고를 방지하고, 일정기간동안 적혈구의 보관을 위하여 개발되었다. 
이 용액들은 모두 구연산나트륨, 구연산 그리고 포도당을 함유하고 있고, 일부 용액들은 추가적으로 
아데닌, 구아노신, 만니톨, 자당(sucrose), 소르비톨 그리고/또는 인산염을 함유하고 있다. 헤파린은 
혈액보관에는 사용되지 않지만, 종종 임상에서 의료기기에 노출되는 환자들을 위한 항응고제로 
사용된다.
구연산은 칼슘과 결합하여 혈액의 응고를 방지한다. 적혈구는 저장되는 동안 포도당을 대사 시킨다. 
Embden-Myerhoff 혐기성 해당과정(anaerobic glycolysis cycle)을 거쳐 대사된 각각의 포도당으
로 인해 ADP가 인산화(phosphorylation)되어 ATP 두 분자를 생성한다. ATP분자는 적혈구
가 막 수송 기능 및 막 탄력성을 유지하는데 필요한 에너지를 보충해준다. 이런 기능들을 위해 필
요한 에너지는 ATP가 ADP로 전환되면서 방출된다. 보관 기간을 연장하기 위해서는 항응고액에 구
연산을 첨가하여 알칼리성을 유도하여야만 한다. 이는 4℃에서 적혈구를 보관하기 시작할 때 고농도
의 수소 이온을 적절하게 제공하기 위함이다. 보관 기간 동안에 산도가 증가하면 해당율(rate of 
glycolysis)은 감소된다. 아데노신 뉴클레오티드 (ATP, ADP, AMP)는 보관 기간 동안 고갈되는데, 
항응고액에 아데노신을 첨가하면 대체 AMP/ADP/ATP가 합성될 수 있다.
적혈구 농축액이 마련되면 포도당과 아데닌의 상당 부분은 혈장에 의해 제거된다. 세포가 과도하게 
농축되지 않는 경우에는 혈장을 제거하여야만 적혈구의 충분한 생존력이 유지될 수 있다. 보통의 
CDP (citrate phosphate dextrose) 아데닌 적혈구 농축물의 적혈구 부피율은 0.80보다 크지 않아
야 한다. 혈장의 90%이상이 제거된다고 하더라도 현탁 배지나 첨가 배지를 추가하면 적혈구의 생
존력을 유지시킬 수 있다. 세포막을 안정화시키고, 용혈을 방지하지하기 위해서는 만니톨이나 자당
을 이용하는 반면에 생존력을 유지하기 위해서는 염화나트륨, 아데닌, 그리고 포도당이 필수적이다. 
혈액 생성물을 보관하기에 적합한 용기는 혈액 생성물의 질을 측정하는 다양한 방법으로 평가되
었다. 적절한 항응고제가 들어있는 혈액 생성물 용기는 정적인 조건 하에 1℃∼6℃ 사이의 온도에
서 똑바로 세워 보관한다. 미리 정한 시간 간격마다 보관된 생성물의 질과 생존력을 평가하기 위
하여 무세포(cell-free) 혈장 헤모글로빈의 양을 측정한다. 일주일에 한 번씩 가볍게 섞어주면 보
관된 생성물의 질이 향상될 수 있다. 혼란을 일으키는 다른 요인들이 없는 경우에는 용기에 보관
하는 것에 대한 평가는 간접적으로는 적혈구 대사로 생긴 이산화탄소를 내보내는 용기의 투과성


- 77 -
을 평가하는 것이다.
C.6.3 혈액을 취급하는 사람들의 보호
앞서 쓰여진 과정들은 잠재적으로 오염되어 있을 수 있는 사람의 혈액을 채혈하고, 취급하며 
연구하고 있는 사람들을 위하여 필수적인 것이다. 잠재적으로 오염됐을 수 있는 원자재에는 
혈액/ 체액/ 생성물들과, 혈액 또는 체액과 접촉을 했거나 또는 하고 있는 장치, 그리고 혈액 
유래 감염을 일으키는 미생물 배양에 사용된 물질이 포함된다.
C.6.4 채혈(정맥 절개)
정맥을 절개한 피부 표면이 100% 무균임을 보증하는 것이 불가능하다고 하더라도, 정맥 절개 
부위를 준비하는 것과 관련된 엄격하고 표준화된 과정이 있어야 한다. 특히 정맥 천자에 앞서 
피부 표면을 건조하게 하기 위하여 살균용액을 사용하고, 정맥 절개용 바늘을 삽입하기 이전에 피
부 표면에 더 이상의 접촉이 없도록 하는 것이 중요하다.
세균에 의한 오염을 방지하기 위하여 밀폐 용기 시스템 (즉, 공기가 들어가지 않는 것)이 가장 널리 
이용되고 있다. 바늘을 뺀 후에는 검체를 담은 용기의 고무마개에 있는 바늘구멍을 완전히 밀봉시
켜야 하며, 그렇지 않은 경우에는 냉각을 시킨 이후에 부분적으로 진공 상태를 만들어 오염된 공
기를 빼내도록 한다.
주) 진공관을 이용하는 경우에는 약간의 용혈이 일어날 수도 있다.
오픈된 시스템에서 채혈을 하는 경우에는 공기 중에 노출되어 오염이 될 수 있어 무균 상태로 
간주되지 않는다. 세균에 의한 오염은 용혈을 일으키는 것으로 알려져 있다.
C.6.5 종의 선정
가장 이상적인 용혈 시험은 사람의 적혈구를 가지고 실시하는 것이다. 그러나 몇몇의 요인들로 인
해 사람의 적혈구로 시험 하는 것은 어렵거나 불가능하다. 일부 국가들에서는 사람 혈액의 공
급을 제한하고 있으며, 혈액은 사람에게 수혈을 하기 위해서만 보관하여야 한다. 동물과 사람 기
증자의 건강에 대한 기준도 또한 고려되어야 한다. 모든 혈액의 ‘보존 기간’은 한정되어 있으므로, 
적시에 사람의 혈액 세포를 얻는다는 것이 한층 어려울 수 있다. 동물의 적혈구를 사용하는 경우
에는 동물 종들 사이에서도 막 안정성이 서로 다르기 때문에 전체 헤모글로빈 성분을 얻기 위하여 
100% 용혈을 보증하는데 주의를 기울여야 한다. 음성 대조군이 최소한의 용혈을 일으켜야 시험
원자재의 활성이 감추어지지 않는다. 토끼와 사람의 적혈구 용혈 특성은 유사한 것으로 보고된 반
면에, 원숭이의 적혈구는 보다 민감하며, 기니피그의 적혈구는 보다 덜 민감한 것으로 보고되어 있다.
C.6.6 용혈성에 대한 평가 - 혈액 또는 혈액 성분에 대한 체외 노출, 체내ㆍ외 순환 노출, 체내 노
출
체외 노출, 체내ㆍ외 순환 노출, 체내 노출조건으로 의료기기 또는 원자재를 노출시켜 용혈성을 
평가할 수 있다. 체외 조건은 의료기기뿐만 아니라 원자재를 평가하는데도 이용한다. 하나 이상의 
원자재를 함유하고 있는 의료기기는 체내ㆍ외 순환 조건 및 체내 조건을 이용하여 평가한다.
체내 또는 체내ㆍ외 순환 평가는 동물 모델이나 임상 시험을 하는 동안 가능하다. 다음에 따라 시


- 78 -
험을 설계하는 경우에는 정당성을 입증할 수 있다. 첫째, 허용된 용혈 수준을 가지고 있고 판매되
고 있는 의료기기를 참조 대조군으로 하여 시험 의료기기와 비교한다. 두 번째, 임상적으로 유
의한 용혈의 결과로 시험 대상을 평가한다.
체내 또는 체내ㆍ외 순환 시험의 목적은 의료기기의 잠재적 용혈성을 규명하는 것이다. 선행 
연구로 체외 시험을 시행할 수 있고, 신선하거나 시일이 지난 사람의 혈액 또는 사람이외의 
종의 혈액을 이용할 수 있다. 체내에 사용될 의료기기와 관련된 일반적인 방법은 임상적 용도를 
모방한 조건을 이용하여 혈액을 의료기기를 통해 재순환시키는 것이다. 이런 조사 후에 체내ㆍ외 
순환 모의시험을 시행하는데, 체내ㆍ외 순환 모의시험은 동물모델에서 몇몇 의료기기에 대해 
시행하거나, 제한되고 통제된 조건으로 사람에게 시행하여야 한다. 의료기기의 크기와 용도는 
시험의 설계에 영향을 준다. 
C.6.7 직접 접촉 방법 대 간접 접촉 방법
이용해야 하는 용출 조건은 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 요약되어 있다. 일부 시험방법은 적혈구
와 직접 접촉을 하는 의료기기를 평가하는 반면에 이외의 방법들은 적혈구에 노출되는 용출액의 
준비를 설명하고 있다. 사용하게 될 조건과 의료기기 자체를 근거로 시험방법을 선정하여야 한다. 
상승된 온도를 이용하는 경우에 고려하여야 하는 한계 조건은 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 요약
되어 있다.

적 반응을 평가하기 위해 설계되었다.
주) 다음문헌은본장의적용을위해필수적이다. 발행연도가있는문헌은그발행연도의문헌만
적용된다. 발행연도가없는문헌은그문헌의최신판(개정내용포함)이적용된다.
ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices — Part 1: Evaluation and testing within
a risk management system
ISO 10993-12, Biological evaluation of medical devices — Part 12: Sample preparation and
reference materials
2 정의
본 장에서는 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 설명된 정의 및 다음의 정의가 적용된다.
2.1 배양 용기(culture vessels) 
유리 배양용기, 플라스틱 배양 플라스크 또는 플라스틱 다중 배양판, 마이크로타이터 플레이트
(microtitre plate) 등 세포배양에 적합한 용기를 말함
주) 포유류 세포에 이용하기 적합하고, 조직 배양 등급(grade)의 요건을 충족하고 있다면 이 용기
들은 호환하여 사용될 수 있음
2.2 양성대조물질(positive control material)
본 장에 따라 시험할 때 재현성 있는 세포독성반응을 일으키는 물질
주) 양성대조의 목적은 시험시스템이 제대로 작동하고 있다는 것을 입증하기 위함이다. 오르가노
틴(organotin)으로 안정화된 폴리우레탄(polyurethane)은 고형 검체 및 용출물에 대한 양성대조
물질로 사용되고 있으며 페놀 희석액 또한 용출물에 대한 양성대조물질로 사용되고 있다. 또한 
다른 순수 화학물질도 시험 시스템의 성능을 입증하기 위해 사용될 수 있다.
2.3 공시험액(blank)
시험검체와 동일한 조건과 방법으로 용출한 것으로 시험검체가 들어있지 않은 용출 용매


- 87 -
주) 공시험액을 사용하는 목적은 용출용기, 용출용매, 그리고 용출과정에 의하여 교란될 수 있는 
영향을 평가하기 위한 것이다. 
2.4 음성대조물질(negative control material)
본 장에 따라 시험할 때 세포독성반응을 일으키지 않는 물질
주) 음성대조는 세포의 기본적인 반응의 정도를 결정하기 위해 사용된다. 합성 고분자에 대해서는 
고밀도 폴리에틸렌, 치과재료에 대하여는 알루미늄 옥사이드 세라믹이 음성대조물질로 사용되고 있
다.
2.5 시험검체(test sample)
생물학적 또는 화학적 시험 및 평가의 대상이 되는 원자재, 의료기기, 의료기기의 일부분, 구성요
소, 용출물 또는 용출물의 일부
2.6 약 80 % 증식정도(subconfluency)
세포가 배양 용기(culture vessels)의 약 80 % 정도 증식된 상태, 즉, 대수증식기(the 
logarithmic phase of growth)의 말기
3 검체 및 대조군 준비
3.1 일반사항
시험은 다음 두 가지 중 하나로 수행해야 한다.
1) 의료기기 시험검체의 용출물 및 / 또는
2) 의료기기 시험검체 그 자체
검체 준비는 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 따른다.
각 시험에는 음성 및 양성 대조군이 포함되어야 한다.
3.2 검액(용출물)의 준비
3.2.1 용출의 원리
용출조건은 임상적 사용조건을 재현하거나 과장하여 잠재적인 독성학적 위해요소(hazard)를 결정
할 수 있도록 하되, 임상 적용 시 예상되지 않는 융합, 융해 화학적 구조의 변화 등의 큰 변화가 
없어야 한다. 특정 원자재(예, 생분해성 물질)의 특성으로 인하여, 용출 과정 중에 화학적 구조가 
변형될 수도 있다.
주) 용출된 물질들의 농도와 시험 세포에 노출되는 양은 계면의 면적, 용출물의 부피, pH, 화학적 
용해도, 확산율, 몰삼투압 농도(osmorality), 교반, 온도, 시간 및 기타 요소들에 의해 좌우된다. 
환자에게 적용될 때 최종적으로 2 가지 이상의 구성요소를 섞어서 사용하는 의료기기의 경우(예. 


- 88 -
골 시멘트), 용출 전에 최종 상태의 의료기기를 세척하지 않는다. 시험 검체를 세척하면 의료기기
에 존재하는 잔류물을 감소시키거나 제거할 수 있다. 시험 검체가 멸균 환경에서 사용되는 것이
라면, 화학 성분 용출시 멸균된 시험 검체를 사용한다. 
3.2.2 용출용매(extraction vehicle)
용출용매는 시험 검체의 화학적 특성을 고려하여 선택하고, 그 선정 근거를 제시하고 기록해야 
한다. 포유동물세포를 이용한 시험은 다음의 용매 중 하나 또는 그 이상을 사용한다.
1) 혈청(serum)을 첨가한 배양액
2) 생리식염수
3) 기타 적절한 용매
용출용매는 용출의 목적에 맞게 선정하고, 극성 용매와 비극성 용매 모두를 사용하는 것을 고려
하여야 한다. 용출용매로 혈청을 첨가한 배양액이 선호되는데, 이는 혈청을 첨가한 배양액이 극
성 및 비극성 물질을 둘 다 용출할 뿐만 아니라 세포의 성장을 지원하기 때문이다. 혈청을 첨가
한 배양액 외에, 특별히 극성물질(예. 이온 화합물)을 용출하기 위해서는 혈청이 없는 용매를 사
용할 수 있다. 다른 적합한 용매로는 정제수와 DMSO(디메틸 설폭사이드; dimethyl sulfoxide)
가 있다. DMSO는 0.5% (부피율;volume fraction) 농도 이상이 되면 선정된 평가 시스템에서 
세포 독성을 나타낸다. 혈청을 포함한 배양액에서 용출한 것과 비교하여 DMSO로 용출하는 경우 
더 많이 희석되므로 세포에 노출되는 용출물질의 농도는 낮아질 수 있다.
주 1) 다양한 혈청(예. 태아 및 소/송아지 혈청, 신생 송아지 혈청)이 사용될 수 있고 세포의 종류
에 따라 혈청을 선택한다.
주 2) 혈청/단백질이 용출된 물질에 어느 정도 결합하는 것으로 알려져 있으며 이 사항을 인식하
는 것이 중요하다.
3.2.3 용출 조건 
3.2.3.1 용출은 화학적으로 불활성인 멸균된 밀폐 용기 내에서 무균기법으로 제11장(ISO 
10993-12)에 따라 시행한다.
3.2.3.2 아래에서 제시된 경우를 제외하고는, 다음 1)∼4) 중 하나의 조건에서 용출이 이루어져야
하고 의료기기의 특성 및 사용 방법을 고려하여 적용하여야 한다.
1) (37±2) ℃에서 (24±2) 시간
2) (50±2) ℃에서 (72±2) 시간
3) (70±2) ℃에서 (24±2) 시간
4) (121±2) ℃에서 (1±0.2) 시간 
위에 기술된 용출조건은 의료기기나 원자재의 위험평가를 위해 잠재적인 위해요소(hazard)를 측
정하기 위한 것으로 관례적인 방법에 근거하였다. 다른 조건, 예를 들어 임상적 사용동안 발생할 


- 89 -
수 있는 용출을 재연하거나 잠재적 위해요소(hazard)를 적절하게 측정하기 위하여 37℃에서 보다 
짧거나 길게 용출할 수 있는데, 이때는 근거를 제시하고 기록해야 한다. 이식되지 않으며, 정상 
피부나 정상 점막에 단기간 접촉하는 의료기기(예, 총 접촉시간이 4시간 이하인 경우)는 1)에서 
3)항의 조건에서 4시간 이상 24시간 이하로 용출할 수 있다.
(37±1)℃이상의 온도는 배양액의 혈청과 다른 요소들의 화학조성과/또는 안정성에 영향을 끼칠 
수 있기 때문에 혈청을 첨가한 배양액은 1)에 주어진 조건에서만 사용한다.
유리전이온도 이상에서는 용출 용제의 조성이 변할 수 있기 때문에, 중합된 시험검체의 경우에 
용출 온도가 유리전이온도를 초과하지 않도록 한다.
3.2.3.3 용출물을 세포에 적용하기 전에 여과시키거나 원심분리 또는 기타 다른 방법으로 처리한
다면 이러한 자세한 내용을 근거와 함께 최종보고서에 기록해야 한다(9절 참조). 용출물의 pH조
정에 대한 사항을 기록한다. pH조정과 같은 용출물의 조작은 시험결과에 영향을 미칠 수 있으므로 
피하는 것이 좋다.
3.3 직접접촉법을 위한 검체준비
3.3.1 시험 검체 형태
 
다양한 형태, 크기, 또는 물리적 상태(액체, 겔, 고체 등)를 가지는 검체는 변형 없이 세포독성 시
험에 사용할 수 있다.
고체상태의 검체는 적어도 한쪽 면이 편평한 것이 선호된다. 그렇지 않은 경우에는 검체의 표면
을 편평하게 만들어야 한다. 
3.3.2 시험검체의 멸균
3.3.2.1 시험검체의 멸균을 고려하여야 한다. 
3.3.2.2 멸균된 의료기기로부터 시험검체를 준비하는 경우 시험의 모든 과정동안 무균기법으로 
다루어야 한다.
3.3.2.3 일반적으로 비멸균 상태로 제공되지만 사용 전에 멸균을 해야 하는 의료기기로부터 시험
검체를 준비하는 경우, 시험검체는 제조자가 추천하는 방법으로 멸균하고 시험 과정동안 무균적
으로 다루어야 한다.
시험 전 검체 준비과정에서 멸균방법 또는 멸균시약이 의료기기에 미칠 수 있는 영향을 고려한다.
3.3.2.4 사용상 멸균이 요구되지 않는 의료기기의 시험검체는 제공된 대로 시험하고 용출 및 시험
을 하는 동안 무균적으로 다루어야 한다. 세포 배양 동안 미생물에 의한 오염을 막기 위하여 시험 
검체를 멸균할 수 있다. 그러나 멸균과정동안 시험 물질의 특성이 변해서는 안 된다. 


- 90 -
비멸균 시험검체를 사용할 때, 오염은 잘못된 세포독성시험 결과를 가져올 수 있으므로 세균에 
의한 오염을 검사한다.
3.3.3 액체 시험검체
액체 시험검체는 다음 중 하나의 방법으로 시험해야 한다.
1) 직접 침착법(direct deposition) 또는
2) 생물학적으로 비활성이고 흡수성인 기질(matrix)에 의한 침착법
필터 디스크(filter disc)가 비활성 흡수성 기질로 사용하기에 적합한 것으로 알려져 있다.
3.3.4 흡수성 시험검체
흡수성 시험검체의 경우에는 시험 중 배양용기 내에서 배양액을 흡수하는 것을 방지하기 위하여 
시험검체를 시험 전에 배양액에 흠뻑 적신다.
3.4 대조군의 준비
대조군은 시험검체와 같은 과정으로 준비할 수 있는 것으로 선택한다. 
4. 세포주(cell lines)
인증된 곳에서 공급하는 세포주를 사용한다.
주) 추천할 만한 세포주로는 American Type Culture Collection CCL1(NCTC clone 929), 
CCL 163(Balb/3T3 clone A31), CCL 171(MRC-5), CCL 75(WI-38), CCL 81(Vero), CCL 
10[BHK-21(C-13)], V-79 379A 등이 있다.
특정한 민감도가 필요한 경우, 반응의 재현성과 정확성을 입증할 수 있는 때에만 초대배양세포
(primary cells cultures)와 세포주 및 생체조직에서 직접 얻은 기관형적 배양 세포(organotypic 
cultures)를 사용하여야 한다.
세포주를 
저장하는 
경우에는 
DMSO(디메틸 
설폭사이드;dimethylsulfoxide)나 
글리세롤
(glycerol)과 같은 동결 방지제가 들어있는 해당 배양액에 넣어 -80 ℃ 또는 그 이하의 온도에서 
저장해야 한다. 장기간 저장 시(몇 달∼수 년)에는 -130 ℃ 이하에서만 보관하도록 한다.
마이코플라스마(mycoplasma)가 없는 세포만을 시험에 사용한다. 사용 전에 보관된 세포주가 마
이코플라스마에 오염되지 않았음을 적절한 방법으로 확인하여야 한다.
계대수에 따라 시험의 민감도(sensitivity)가 다를 수 있기 때문에 세포를 정기적으로 점검하는 것


- 91 -
은 중요하다[예. 형태, 배가시간(doubling time), 표준염색체수(modal chromosome number)].
우수 세포 배양 기준(good cell culture practices)을 사용한다(참고문헌 [5] 참조). 
5. 배양액(culture medium)
배양액은 멸균된 상태이어야 한다.
혈청을 포함하거나 포함하지 않은 배양액은 선택된 세포주의 성장요건에 적합하여야 한다.
배양액에는 항생제가 첨가될 수 있으며, 이러한 경우 분석에 잘못된 영향을 미치지 않아야 한다.
배양액은 유효성이 검증된 저장조건에서 보관해야 한다.
주) 배양액의 안정성은 그 조성과 보관 조건에 따라 달라진다.
배양액의 pH는 7.2 ∼ 7.4를 유지하여야 한다.
6. 저장 세포주(Cell Stock)의 배양준비
선택된 세포주와 배양액을 사용하여 시험을 마칠 수 있도록 충분한 세포를 준비한다. 저장된 세
포를 꺼내어 배양하려는 경우, 동결보호제가 있다면 제거한다. 사용하기 전에 세포를 적어도 한번
은 계대 배양한다.
세포를 계대 배양 할 경우, 해당 세포주에 적절한 방법을 이용한다. 즉, 세포를 효소를 사용하여 
분리하거나 기계적으로 분리하여 다시 현탁한다.
7 시험방법
7.1 시험 세트 수
시험은 각각의 검체와 대조군당 적어도 한 번에 세 개의 세트를 시험한다.

다.
콜로니형성시험((colony-forming assay)에서는 저밀도 세포를 사용해야 한다.
7.2.4 시험 전에 배양된 세포가 배양용기에 부착되어 자란 정도가 배양용기 면적의 80 %이상인지
와 세포의 형태를 현미경으로 관찰한다.

proliferating cells)]는 시험을 시작하는 시점에서 계대한다(seed).
7.2.5 다음의 조건으로 시험한다.
1) 용출물 원액과/또는

대안으로, 제한적 용해도를 갖는 물질이 존재한다고 알려져 있거나 예상되는 경우, 시험검체의 용
출 비율을 다양화하여 용출 용매에 희석해야 한다.
단층배양세포를 사용하는 경우 배양용기로부터 배양액을 제거하고 용출물 또는 희석한 용출물을 
각각의 용기에 분주한다.
현탁된 세포(suspended cell)를 사용하는 경우 세포현탁액을 준비한 후 즉시 용출물 또는 희석한 
용출물을 첨가한다.
7.2.6 물과 같은 비생리적 용출용매를 사용할 경우, 그 용출물을 배양액으로 희석한 후, 생리적으
로 가장 적합한 농도에서 시험하여야 한다.
주) 액체 용출물을 희석하여 사용하는 경우에는 농축배양액(예:2×, 5× 농축배양액)이 권장된다.
7.2.7 같은 종류의 용기에 별도로 공시험액, 음성 및 양성대조를 둔다.
주) 적절한 경우, 신선한 배양액을 대조군으로 시험할 수 있다.
7.2.8 선택된 특정한 시험법에 따라서 적절한 시간 동안 각 용기를 “7.2.3항”의 조건으로 배양한
다.

용기에 피펫으로 분주한다. 각각의 용기를 수평방향으로 천천히 회전시키면서 용기의 표면에 균일
하게 세포를 분배한다.
7.3.3 배양액에 대하여 선택된 완충시스템에 적절하도록 탄산가스 배양장치를 사용하고 또는 사용

cells)]는 시험을 시작하는 시점에서 계대(seeded)할 수 있다.
7.3.5 배양액을 제거한 뒤 신선한 배양액을 각각의 용기에 분주한다.
7.3.6 각각의 용기 중앙의 세포층에 각 시험검체를 조심스럽게 올려놓는다. 검체가 세포층 표면의 
약 10 분의 1을 덮도록 한다. 
세포층 표면에 대한 검체 표면의 비율을 다르게 사용하고자 하는 경우에는 그 타당성을 제시하여
야 한다.
검체를 올려놓을 때 세포에 물리적 충격을 줄 수 있는 불필요한 움직임이 일어나지 않도록 주의한
다. 예를 들어, 불필요한 움직임으로 세포의 일부가 이동될 수 있다.
주) 적절한 경우, 세포를 넣기 전에 검체를 먼저 배양용기에 넣을 수도 있다.
7.3.7 음성 및 양성대조 물질을 위한 배양용기(replicate)를 준비한다.
7.3.8 선택된 특정한 시험법에 따라서 적절한 시간동안(최소 24시간) 각 세포가 담긴 용기를 
“7.3.3항”의 조건으로 배양한다.
7.3.9 “7.5항”에 따라 세포독성을 결정하기위해 화학물질/염색시약을 넣기 전에 상층 배양액을 
제거한다.
7.4 간접접촉법에 의한 시험
7.4.1 한천확산시험(Agar diffusion test)
7.4.1.1 본 시험은 세포독성의 정성평가를 위한 것이다. 이 방법은 한천층을 통해 확산될 수 없거
나, 한천과 반응할 수 있는 용해물에는 적절하지 않다. 한천확산시험법을 이용하여 세포독성을 평가

하는 경우 근거를 제시해야 한다.
7.4.1.2 시험을 위해 연속적으로 저어준 세포 현탁액을 충분한 수의 용기에 피펫으로 분주한다. 
각각의 용기를 수평방향으로 천천히 회전시키면서 용기의 표면에 균등하게 세포를 분배한다.
7.4.1.3 배양액에 맞게 선택한 완충시스템(보통, 온도 37 ± 1 ℃, 탄산가스를 사용하거나 사용하
지 않고)에서, (37 ± 1) ℃에서 생장곡선의 대수적 증식기(logarithmic phase) 말기에 세포가 배
양용기에 부착되어 자란 정도가 배양용기 면적의 80 %이상(subconfluency)이 될 때까지 세포를 
배양한다.
7.4.1.4 시험을 시작하기 전에 배양된 배양용기에 부착되어 자란 세포가 배양용기 면적의 80 % 
이상인지와 세포의 형태를 현미경으로 확인한다.
7.4.1.5 용기에서 배양액을 제거한다. 혈청이 포함된 신선한 배양액에 녹은 한천을 섞어, 최종 한
천의 농도가 0.5 %에서 2 %가 되도록 만든다. 이를 각각의 용기에 적절한 부피만큼 피펫으로 분
주한다. 포유동물의 세포성장에 적절한 한천만을 사용한다. 한천과 배양액의 혼합액은 액체상태이
어야 하며, 포유동물 세포에 적합한 온도여야 한다.
주) 다양한 분자량 및 순도의 한천 사용이 가능하다.
7.4.1.6 각각의 용기 내에 있는 고형화된 한천층 위에 검체를 조심스럽게 올려놓는다. 검체가 세포
층 표면의 약 10분의 1을 덮고 있는지 확인한다. 
세포층 표면에 대한 검체 표면의 비율을 다르게 사용하고자 하는 경우에는 그 타당성을 제시하여야 
한다.
흡수성이 있는 검체는 한천의 탈수현상을 막기 위해 배양액에 미리 적신 후 한천 위에 올려 놓는
다.
7.4.1.7 음성 및 양성대조군 시험을 위한 배양용기(replicate)를 준비한다.
7.4.1.8 “7.4.1.3항”의 조건으로 24∼72 시간동안 용기를 배양한다.
7.4.1.9 한천에서 검체를 조심스럽게 제거하기 전과 후에 세포독성을 결정하기 위해 세포를 검사
한다. 
생체염색제(vital stain), 예를 들어 뉴트럴레드를 사용하면 세포독성을 검출하는데 도움이 될 수 있다. 
생체염색제는 검체의 배양 전 또는 후에 첨가할 수 있다. 만일 염색제를 배양 전에 첨가하면 배양
세포를 빛으로부터 보호하여 염색제의 감광반응으로 야기되는 세포의 손상을 방지하여야 한다.
7.4.2 필터 확산법


- 95 -
7.4.2.1 이 시험은 세포독성의 정성적 측정을 위한 것이다.
7.4.2.2 충분한 수의 배양용기를 준비하여 0.45 ㎛의 기공크기를 가지는 표면활성제가 처리되지 
않은 필터를 각각의 용기에 넣고 계속 저어준 세포현탁액을 분배한다. 각각의 용기를 천천히 회전
시키면서 필터표면에 균등하게 세포를 분배한다.
7.4.2.3 배양액에 맞게 선택한 완충시스템(보통, 온도 37 ± 1 ℃, 탄산가스를 사용하거나 사용하
지 않고)에서 생장곡선의 대수적 증식기(logarithmic phase) 말기에 세포가 배양용기에 부착되어 
자란 정도가 배양용기 면적의 80 %이상(subconfluency)이 될 때까지 세포를 배양한다.
7.4.2.4 용기로부터 배양액을 따라낸 다음 필터를, 세포가 자란 면이 아래가 되도록 하여, 고형화 
된 한천층 위에 놓는다. (“7.4.1.5항” 참조)
7.4.2.5 검체를 필터의 세포가 없는 면(윗쪽)에 조심스럽게 올려놓는다. 액상 용출물은 필터위에 
반응성이 없는 고리(ring)를 놓은 후 그 고리 안에 액상용출물을 놓아 필터 밖으로 흐르지 않게 
한다.
7.4.2.6 양성 및 음성대조에 대하여 동일한 방법으로 필터를 준비한다.
7.4.2.7 “7.4.2.3항”에 기술된 동일한 조건으로 2 시간 ± 10 분 동안 세포가 담긴 용기를 배양한
다.
7.4.2.8 필터로부터 검체를 조심스럽게 제거하고 한천표면으로부터 필터를 분리한다.
7.4.2.9 적절한 염색을 통해 세포독성을 결정한다.
7.5 세포독성의 결정
7.5.1 세포독성을 정성 또는 정량적 방법으로 분석한다. 세포독성 평가로는 정량적 평가가 선호된
다. 정성적 방법은 선별적 검사 목적(screening purpose)에 적합하다. 
1) 정성적 평가
세포화학적 염색법을 이용하여 세포를 염색한 뒤, 세포형태, 액포 생성, 분리, 세포용해 및 세포막 상
태 등의 변화를 현미경으로 검사한다. 일반적 세포형태에서 변화한 정도를 시험보고서에 서술적으
로 또는 수치적으로 기록해야 한다. 표 8과 9는 시험원자재의 등급을 매기는데 유용하다.


표 8 용출물 세포독성의 정성적 형태학적 등급 

| 등급 | 반응도 | 배양세포의 상태 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 없음 (None) | 세포질내 과립(intracytoplasmic granule)의 분리, 세포 용 해 없음, 세포성장의 저해 없음 |
| 1 | 아주미약 (Slight) | 세포의 모양이 둥글게 되고, 느슨하게 부착되어 있으며, 세 포질 내 과립이 소실되었거나, 형태에 변화를 보인 세포가 20 %를 넘지 않음. 때때로 용해된 세포가 존재하고; 약간 의 성장 저해가 관찰됨. |
| 2 | 미약 (Mild) | 세포의 모양이 둥글게 되고, 세포질 내 과립이 소실된 세포 가 50 %를 넘지 않고, 광범위한 세포 용해는 보이지 않음. 세포의 성장 저해가 50 %를 넘지 않음. |
| 3 | 중증도 (Moderate ) | 세포의 모양이 둥글게 되었거나 용해된 세포가 70 %를 넘지 않음. 세포층이 완전히 파괴되지는 않았으나 50 % 이상의 성장 저해를 보임 |
| 4 | 심함 (Severe) | 세포층이 거의 또는 완전히 파괴 됨 |

 
표 9 한천 및 필터 확산 시험, 직접 접촉시험에 대한 반응 등급 

| 등급 | 반응도 | 반응 부위(zone)에 대한 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 없음 (None) | 검체의 밑 부분이나 주변에 세포의 이상 및 탈색이 발견되는 부위(zone)가 없음 |
| 1 | 아주미약 (Slight) | 검체 밑에 약간의 변형되거나 퇴화한 세포가 있음 |
| 2 | 미약 (Mild) | 세포의 이상 및 탈색 부위(zone)가 검체의 바로 밑에 한함 |
| 3 | 중증도 (Moderate) | 세포의 이상 및 탈색 부위(zone)가 검체의 주변 1.0 cm까지 확장 |
| 4 | 심함 (Severe) | 세포의 이상 및 탈색 부위(zone)가 검체의 주변 1.0 cm 이 상까지 확장 |

평가 방법 및 평가 결과를 시험 보고서에 기록해야 한다.
표 8과 9에 따라, 반응도가 2등급 보다 큰 경우( > 2 ) 세포 독성이 있는 것으로 간주한다.
2) 정량적 평가
세포사멸, 세포의 성장저해, 세포의 증식 혹은 군집형성 등을 측정한다. 세포의 수, 단백질의 양, 
효소의 분비, 생체염색제(vital dye)의 분비, 생체염색제(vital dye)의 감소 또는 다른 측정 가능한 
변수를 객관적으로 정량한다. 객관적 측정결과와 반응을 보고서에 기록한다.
세포 생존율이 30% 이상 감소되면 세포독성이 있는 것으로 간주한다. 다른 절사점(cut-off 
points) 및  시험군 대 대조군의 허용 비율를 포함하는 다른 기준을 사용할 경우, 교체된 세포주
나 다층 조직 구성체(multi-layered tissue constructs)에 대한 정당한 근거를 제시해야 한다. 이 
- 96 -

- 97 -
기준은 정당한 근거를 제시하고 문서화되어야 한다. 
부록 A부터 D까지에서 설명하는 시험 방법은 용출물의 세포독성에 대한 정량적 측정법으로 사용
될 수 있다.
주) 시험법 A와 B는 국제 유효성 확인 연구(international validation studies)에서 제시된 화학 
물질과 국제 라운드로빈 시험(international round-robin test)에서 제시된 의료기기에 대해 적합
하다고 입증되었다. 세포독성 물질의 경우, IC50 값(종점(endpoint)의 50%에 해당하는 영향을 줄 
것으로 생각되는 억제농도)을 계산하여 세포독성 영향의 등급을 결정한다. 부록 C와 D는 세포독
성의 정량적 측정에 폭넓게 사용되는 시험법들을 설명한다. 
세포 독성을 측정하는 특정한 방법에는 영시간(zero time) 또는 기준(baseline)을 위한 세포배양 
대조군이 필요할 수도 있다.
7.5.2 시험검체가 시험시스템 또는 측정에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 물질을 분비하게 되면 시험결과
가 무의미 할 수 있으므로 평가방법은 신중하게 선택하여야 한다.
주) 포름알데하이드(formaldehyde)를 분비할 수도 있는 원자재는 세포의 생존력을 평가할 때에만 
신뢰성 있게 시험될 수 있다.
7.5.3 반복시험(replicate) 결과간의 차이가 명백한 경우, 그 시험은 부적절하거나 유효하지 않다. 
이러한 경우에는, 시험을 반복 수행 하거나 다른 시험 방법을 사용해야 한다.
7.5.4 만일 음성, 양성 및 다른 대조군(표준물질, 배양액, 공시험물질, 시약 등)이 시험시스템에서 
예상되는 반응을 나타내지 아니하면 전체 시험을 반복한다.
8 시험보고서
시험보고서는 아래의 사항을 포함하여 작성한다.
a) 시험 기관의 명칭과 주소
b) 시험을 수행한 사람의 이름
c) 시험의 시작 및 종료 일자
d) 검체에 대한 설명
e) 세포주에 대한 설명 및 세포주 선택의 타당성

- 98 -
9 결과의 평가
시험결과의 전체적인 평가는 주어진 시험자료에 근거하여 결정할 수 있는 능력을 가진 자가 하
여야 한다. 세포독성 자료는 다른 생체적합성 자료 및 제품의 사용목적을 고려하여 평가해야 한다. 
세포독성시험의 결과를 해석할 때는 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 나오는 의료기기의 분류를 참고한다.
세포독성이 나타난 경우, 다음의 추가 평가를 수행할 수 있다. 
a) 추가 시험(혈청의 존재/부재, 배양액내 혈청의 양 변경)
b) 적절한 경우, 용출물 분석(예, 멸균 및 다른 제조 공정에서의 잔류물)
c) 희석액의 농도에 따른 반응 분석
d) 용해물 성분에 대한 화학적 특성
e) 다른 시험방법
모든 세포독성 영향이 중요할 수 있다. 그러나 세포독성이 나타났다는 것은 잠재적인 체내 독성
(in vivo toxicity)에 대한 기초적 표시로서 그 세포독성 자료에만 근거하여 해당 의료기기가 주어
진 임상적 적용에 적절치 않다고 결정할 필요는 없다.

뉴트럴 레드(Neutral red uptake, NRU) 세포독성 시험
A.1 일반 사항
다음의 시험 방법은 참고문헌[1]의 부록 C 중 이 시험과 관련된 부분에 기초하여 기술한다. 
A.2 시험방법
A.2.1 기본 절차
BALB/c 3T3 세포를 96-well 플레이트에 분주(seed)하고, 반 증식된 단층(semi-confluent 
monolayer)을 형성하도록 24 시간[∼ 1 배가시간(doubling time)] 동안 배양한다(세포 유지와 
배양 절차에 관한 더 상세한 정보에 대해서는 참고자료 [5] 참조). 그 후 다양한 농도로 준비한 
시험 물질에 노출시킨다. 24 시간 노출시킨 후, NRU는 처리한 농도별로 측정하여 시험 대조군의 
결과와 비교한다. 용출물이 세포에 세포독성 영향을 나타낸다면, 각각의 처리한 농도(즉, 시험한 
화학물질의 농도)에 대해 각각 세포 증식 저해 비율을 계산한다. IC50(NRU를 50 % 감소시키는 
농도)은 농도-반응으로 계산되며, 용출물의 희석 비율로 표현된다. 용출물 원액을 100 % 용출물
로 지정한다.

A.2.2.3.3 신생송아지혈청(newborn calf serum, NBCS) 
중요사항 - 태아송아지혈청(foetal calf serum, FCS)을 사용해서는 안된다. FCS는 세포 내에 액
포(vacuoles)를 형성하기 때문에,  O.D.를 크게 감소시킨다. 
NBCS의 로트 다양성 때문에, 한 로트(lot)로 3T3 세포에 대한 증식 자극 특성을 검사(20 ∼ 25

- 20 mM HEPES 
완성된 배양액은 4 °C에서 보관하고 2주 이상 보관하지 않는다.
혈청 단백질에 의해 시험 물질의 독성이 마스킹(masking)될 수 있기 때문에, 시험검체 처리용 배
양액 내의 혈청 농도는 5 %까지 줄인다. 혈청이 없으면 세포 성장이 현저하게 감소되기 때문에, 
혈청이 완전히 배제될 수는 없다.

— 0.4 g NR 염료 
— 100 ml H2O

600 g에서 원심분리기로 분리한다(NR 결정을 제거하기 위함). NR 배양액에 결정이 없다는 점을 
보장하는 한, 대체 절차(예, millipore 여과)를 사용할 수도 있다. 분주(aliquots) 해놓은 NR 배양

A.2.3 시험 방법 


- 103 -
A.2.3.1 일반사항 
일반적인 세포 배양 방법에 대해서는, 참고문헌 [1]의 부록 C 참조
A.2.3.2 시험의 품질 확인(I); 양성 대조군(positive control, PC) 
양성 대조군은 매 세포독성 시험마다 포함되어야 한다. 
충분한 사용 이력이나 실험실내 및 실험실간의 반복 시험에 의해 보증된 많은 화학물질 중, 라우
릴황산나트륨(sodium lauryl sulfate, SLS, CAS # 151-21-3)이 가장 빈번하게 시험된 것 중 하
나이다. 그래서 양성대조군(PC)으로 권장한다. 라우릴황산나트륨(SLS)을 다음과 같이 4개의 농도 
단계로 시험하도록 권장한다; 0.05 ㎎/㎖; 0.1 ㎎/㎖; 0.15 ㎎/㎖; 0.2 ㎎/㎖. 
경험적 평균값(historical mean)인 SLS의 IC50(Spielmann 외 공저, 1991[10]) 값은 0.093 
mg/ml다. 
95 % CI (신뢰구간)는 0.070 mg/ml 에서 0.116 mg/ml 이다. 
SLS에 대한 IC50이 95 % CI 이내인 경우, 시험은 허용기준을 충족시킨다. 
양성표준물질(positive reference materials)과 음성표준물질(negative reference materials)을 
사용하도록 권장한다[예, ZDEC와 ZDBC 폴리우레탄은 일본의 Food and Drug Safety 
Center(Hatano Research Institute, Ochiai 729-5, Hadanoshi, Kanagawa 257)에서 구입할 수 
있음(3.2 및 3.4 항 참조)]. 
A.2.3.3 시험의 품질 확인(II); 공시험액(blank)
아무 처리하지 않은 공시험액에서 얻은 광도(NRU의 OD540)의 절대값(공시험액에 비례하지 않음)
은 well 당 분주한 1×104 개 세포가 시험기간 2 일 동안 정상적인 배가 시간(doubling time)에 
기하급수적으로 성장했는지 여부를 나타낸다.
공시험액의 평균 OD540이 0.3 이상(≥ 0.3)인 경우, 시험은 허용기준을 충족시킨다.
세포분주의 오류(cell seeding errors)를 검사하기 위해, 공시험액은 용출 조건(A.2.2.4.6 참조)하
에서 처리하고, 96-well 플레이트의 왼쪽(열 2) 및 오른쪽(열 11)에 처리한다(열 1과 열 12를 사
용해선 안 된다; 플레이트 상에서의 배치에 대해서는, 참고문헌 [1]에 있는 부록 E 참조). 
공시험액의 왼쪽 및 오른쪽 평균이 전체 공시험액의 평균값과 15 % 이상 차이가 나지 않을 경우, 
시험은 허용기준을 충족시킨다. 
또한 세포수가 일정하다는 것을 확실히 하기 위해, 위상차현미경(phase contrast microscope) 하
에서 각 플레이트(plate)를 검사하여 세포분주의 오류(cell seeding errors)에 대한 검사를 수행할 
수도 있다. 현미경 평가에서는 공시험액의 2 개열이 필요 없다.
A.2.3.4 농도-반응(concentration-response) 대한 품질 확인 


- 104 -
농도-반응으로부터 도출된 IC50은 최소한 NRU의 10 %와 90 % 저해 사이의 두 가지, 또는 가능
한 경우에는 세 가지 반응으로 입증한다. 이 경우가 아니고 농도 증가 계수(concentration 
progression factor)가 쉽게 감소될 수 있는 경우, 그 실험을 불합격 처리하고 더 작은 증가 계수
(progression factor)로 이를 반복한다.

넓은 범위, 즉, 하프로그(half-log, 1/2 로그) 간격을 포함하는 일정한 비율(constant factor)로 원
액을 희석시켜서 검체 용출물을 8개 농도로 시험한다. 검체 용출물의 최고 농도에서 세포의 생존
율 감소가 30 % 이하인 경우, 그 물질은 세포독성이 없고, 추가적인 본 시험이 불필요하다고 간주
된다.
A.2.3.5.2 본시험 
Range finder로부터 추정된 농도-반응 곡선의 기울기에 따라, 주요 실험의 농도 시리즈에서 희석
/증가(dilution/progression) 계수는 더 작아야 한다.(예, 
6of 10 = 1.47 ) 전혀 세포독성이 없는 
농도(non-cytotoxic) 및/또는 100 % 세포독성을 일으키는 농도를 피하여, 단계적 효과가 있는 
최소 3개 지점에서 관련 농도 범위(10 %와 90 % 영향 사이)에 걸쳐 수행한다. 
A.2.3.6 시험 절차 
중요사항 - 동결 보존하던 세포(stock)를 해동하여 사용할 때, 시험에 사용하기 전에 적어도 2 ~ 3 
회 계대 배양한다.
표 A.1은 시험 절차의 순서도를 나타낸다. 
1 일차 
— 배양액 내에 1 × 105 세포/ml의 세포 현탁액을 준비한다. 멀티채널 피펫(multichannel 
pipette)을 이용하여, 100 μl 배양액을 96-well 조직 배양 마이크로타이터 플레이트(96-well 
tissue culture microtitre plates)의 주변부의 well에 분주한다(= 공시험액, 참고문헌 [1]에 있
는 부록 E 참조). 남은 well에는, 1 × 105 세포/ml의 세포 현탁액 100 μl를 분주한다(= 1 × 
104 세포/well). 가능하다면, 시험할 검체 용출물 당 1개의 플레이트(plate)를, 양성대조군
(positive control, PC)용으로 1개 플레이트와 음성대조군(negative control)용으로 1개의 플레
이트를 준비한다. 
— 반증식된 단층(half-confluent monolayer)을 형성하도록 세포를 24 시간 동안(5 % CO2, 37 
°C, 90 %를 초과하는 습도) 배양한다. 이 배양기간 동안에 세포의 회복과 부착 및 대수증식기
(exponential growth phase)로의 성장이 이루어진다.
— 마이크로타이터 플레이트(microtitre plate) 전반에 걸쳐 세포 성장이 상대적으로 고르다는 것


- 105 -
을 확인하기 위해 위상차 현미경 하에서 각 플레이트를 검사한다. 이 검사는 실험적 오류를 확
인하기 위해 수행된다. 
2 일차 
— 24 시간 배양한 후, 세포로부터 배양액을 제거한다.
— Well에 적절한 농도의 검체 용출물, 음성대조군, 양성대조군 혹은 용출용매(vehicle)(공시험액)
를 포함하는 배양액 100 μl를 첨가한다. 
— 24 시간 동안(5 % CO2, 37 °C, 90 %를 초과하는 습도) 세포를 배양한다. 
3 일차 
24 시간 처리한 후, 세포분주의 오류(cell seeding errors)와 대조군 및 검체를 처리한 세포의 증
식 특성을 확인하기 위해, 위상차 현미경 하에서 각 플레이트를 검사한다. 시험 검체 용출물의 세
포독성 영향으로 인한 세포의 형태상 변화를 기록한다. 그러나 이 기록을 세포독성의 최대 허용가
능 용량(HTD: highest tolerable dose)을 계산하거나 기타 정량적 측정을 위해 사용해서는 안된
다. 대조군 세포 이상 증식 특성은 실험에 오류가 있다는 것을 가리키며, 이는 실험을 취소할 수 
있는 근거가 될 수 있다.
NRU 측정은 Ellen Borenfreund(Borenfreund and Puerner[3])의 측정을 기초로 한다. NR을 리
소좀/엔도솜(lysosomes/endosomes) 및 살아있는 세포의 액포(vacuoles) 속에 흡수하는 것은 세
포 수와 생존율에 대한 정량적 표시로 사용된다. 
— 미리 데운 PBS 150 μl로 세포를 헹군다. 부드럽게 두드려서 헹군 용액을 제거한다. 100 μl 
NR 배양액을 넣고, 5 % CO2의 습한 대기 속에서 3 시간 동안 37 °C에서 배양한다. 
— 배양 후, NR 배양액을 제거하고, 150 μl PBS로 세포를 헹군다.
— PBS를 완전히 따라내고 압지로 빨아들인다blot). (선택적으로, 플레이트를 뒤집어서 원심기로 
분리한다.)
— 공시험액을 포함한 모든 well에 150 μl NR 탈리 용액(NR desorb)(에탄올/아세트산)을 첨가한
다.
— 세포로부터 NR가 용출되고 상등액(homogeneous solution)을 형성할 때까지, 마이크로타이터 
플레이트(microtitre plate)용 교반기 위에서 10분 동안 플레이트를 빠른 속도로 교반한다. 
— 공시험액을 기준으로 사용하여, 마이크로타이터 플레이트(microtitre plate) 판독기내에서 540 
nm의 파장으로 결과적으로 착색된 용액의 흡광도를 측정한다. 농도-반응에 대한 추가 분석과 
IC50 계산을 하기 위해 적절한 파일 형식(예컨대, ASCII, TXT, XLS)으로 실측치(raw data)를 
보관한다. 


A.2.4 데이터 분석 
 
NRU로 표현된 세포 생존율은 시험농도 당 6 개 세트의 평균 NRU 값을 이용하여 시험 검체 용
출물의 각 농도별로 계산한다. 이 값을 모든 공시험액 값의 평균 NRU와 비교한다(단, 공시험액이 
허용기준을 충족한 경우). 그 후에 상대적인 세포 생존율을 검체를 아무처리 하지 않은 공시험액
에 대한 백분율로 표현된다. 가능하다면, 시험한 각 화합물의 8개 농도값은 세포 생존율을 완전히 
억제하는 때까지 아무런 영향이 없는 범위에 걸쳐 있어야 한다. 
표 A.1 3T3 NRU 세포독성 시험 흐름도 

| 시간 h | 절차 |
| --- | --- |
| 00:00 | 96-well 플레이트에 분주: 1×104 세포/100 μl DMEM 배양액/well 배양 (37 °C/5 % CO /22 ~ 24 시간) 2 ↓ |
| 24:00 | 배양액 제거 ↓ |
| 24:00 | 처리 배양액(100 μl)내에 시험 검체 용출물을 8개 농도로 처리 (아무 처리하지 않은 공시험액 = 처리 배양액) 배양(37 °C/5 % CO /24 시간) 2 ↓ |
| 48:00 | 세포 형태 변화에 대한 현미경적 평가 처리한 배양액을 제거 150 μl PBS로 한번 세척 100 μl NR 배양액 첨가 배양(37 °C/5 % CO /3 시간) 2 ↓ |
| 51:00 | NR 배양액 제거 150 μl PBS로 한번 세척 150 μl NR 탈리 고정액(desorbing fixative)을 첨가 (에탄올/아세트산 용액) ↓ |
| 51:40 | 플레이트(plate)를 10분간 교반 ↓ |
| 51:50 | 540 nm에서 NR 흡광도(즉, 세포 생존율) 측정 |

검체 용출물의 최고 농도(100 % 용출물)에 대한 상대적 세포 생존율이 대조군의 70 % 미만인 
경우, 50 % 세포 생존율 억제(즉, IC
50
)를 나타내는 시험 화학물질(test chemical)의 농도는 농도
-반응으로부터 결정된다. 이는 다음 중 하나를 적용하여 시행할 수 있다.
— 수동 그래픽식 맞춤 방법(manual graphical fitting method) 
   대부분의 경우 농도-반응 함수는 관련 범위 내에서 거의 선형이 될 것이기 때문에, “X = 로그
(log)”와 “Y = 프로빗(probit)” 눈금으로 된 확률지(probability paper)를 사용하도록 권장한
다. 세미로그(Semi-log) 종이도 사용할 수 있다. 
또는 
- 106 -

- 107 -
— 농도-반응 데이터에 대한 적절한 비선형(non-linear) 회귀분석 절차 (Hill  함수1) 또는 로지스
틱 회귀분석(logistic regression)이 많이 사용된다.
1) Hill 함수는단조롭고S자형모양이며, 많은농도-반응곡선을나타내기에적합한모델이다.  


- 108 -
   추가적인 계산을 위해 IC50을 사용하기 전에, 적합도를 검사한다. 
검체 용출물의 최고 농도(100 % 용출물)에 대한 상대적 세포 생존율이 대조군의 70 % 이상(≥ 
70 %)인 경우, 그 검체는 세포독성이 없다고 간주한다.

C.2.2.4.2 배양액(Media) 
탄산수소나트륨(sodium bicarbonate)으로 완충된 MEM에 아래와 같이 첨가하여 사용한다(MEM 
내에서의 최종 농도를 기준으로 산정된 값임): 
(A) 냉동용 
— 20 % FCS 
— 7 % ~ 10 % DMSO 
(B) 일상적인 배양용 
- 10 % FCS 
- 4 mM 글루타민(L-glutamine) 또는 글루타맥스(glutamax)
- 100 IU/ml 페니실린(penicillin)
- 100 μg/ml 스트렙토마이신(streptomycin) 
완성된 배양액은 4 °C에서 보관하고, 2 주 이상 보관하지 않는다.
C.2.2.4.3 MTT 용액 
MTT는 첨가제와 페놀레드가 들어있지 않은 MEM에 1 mg/ml 농도로 신선하게 제조한다. 용액은 
주사기 필터(기공 크기 0.22 μm 이하)로 무균 여과하여 살균시킨다. 용액은 제조 당일에 사용한
다. 
C.2.2.4.4 검체 용출물 준비 
검체는 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 따라 용출한다. 
C.2.3 방법
C.2.3.1 일반사항
일상적인 세포 배양 방법에 대해서는, 참고자료 [1]의 부록 C 참조 
C.2.3.2 시험의 품질 확인(I); 양성 대조군(positive control, PC)과 음성 대조군(negative control, 
NC) 
양성 및 음성 대조군은 매 세포독성 시험마다 포함되어야 한다. 양성 및 음성 참고물질, 예를 들
면, ZDEC 및 ZDBC를 권장한다[ZDEC와 ZDBC 폴리우레탄은 일본의 Food and Drug Safety 
Center(Hatano Research Institute, Ochiai 729-5, Hadanoshi, Kanagawa 257)에서 구입할 수 
있음]. 
C.2.3.3 시험법의 확인(II); 공시험액 
아무 처리하지 않은 공시험액에서 얻은 광도(OD570)의 절대값은 well 당 분주한 1×104개 세포가 
시험기간 2 일 동안 정상적인 배가 시간(doubling time)에 기하급수적으로 성장했는지 여부를 나
타낸다. 
공시험액의 평균 OD570이 0.2 이상(≥ 0.2)인 경우, 시험은 허용기준을 충족시킨다.


- 118 -
세포분주의 오류(cell seeding errors)를 검사하기 위해, 공시험액을 96-well 플레이트의 왼쪽(열 
2) 및 오른쪽(열 11)에 처리한다(열 1과 열 12를 사용해서는 안 된다; 플레이트 상에서의 배치에 
대해서는, 참고문헌 [1]에 있는 부록 E 참조). 
공시험액의 왼쪽 및 오른쪽 평균이 전체 공시험액의 평균값과 15 % 이상 차이가 나지 않을 경우 
시험은 허용기준을 충족시킨다. 
또한 세포수가 일정하다는 것을 확실히 하기 위해, 위상차현미경(phase contrast microscope) 하
에서 각 플레이트를 검사하여 세포분주의 오류에 대한 검사를 수행할 수도 있다. 현미경 평가에서
는 공시험액의 2 개 열은 필요 없다.
C.2.3.4 시험 절차 
중요사항. 동결 보존하던 세포(stock)를 해동하여 사용할 때, 시험에 사용하기 전에 적어도 2 ~ 3 
회 계대 배양한다.
표 C.1은 시험 절차의 순서도를 나타낸다. 
냉동 보관된 상태의 세포를 배양한 후 1 일차  
—효소(트립신/EDTA)를 이용해 배양 플라스크로부터 세포 배양액을 분리해내고 세포 현탁액을 
원심분리기로 분리한다(200 g, 3 분). 분리해낸 세포를 배양액으로 다시 풀어주고, 이 세포 현
탁액을 1 × 105 세포/ml의 밀도로 준비한다. 멀티채널 피펫(multichannel pipette)을 이용하여 
96-well 조직 배양 마이크로타이터 플레이트(96-well tissue culture microtitre plates)의 주변
부의 well 속에 배양액(공시험액)만을 100 μl 분주한다(= 공시험액, 참고자료 [1]에 있는 부록 
E 참조). 남은 well에는 1×105 세포/ml의 세포 현탁액 100 μl을 분주한다(= 1×104 세포
/well). 
—반증식된 단층(half-confluent monolayer)을 형성하도록 세포를 24 시간 동안(5 % CO2, 37 
°C, 90 %를 초과하는 습도) 배양한다. 이 배양기간 동안에 세포의 회복, 부착, 대수증식기
(exponential growth phase)로의 성장이 이루어진다.
—마이크로타이터 플레이트(microtitre plate) 전반에 걸쳐 세포 생장이 상대적으로 고르다는 것을 
확인하기 위해 위상차 현미경 하에서 각 플레이트를 검사한다. 이 검사는 실험적 오류를 확인하
기 위해 수행한다.
2 일차 
—24 시간 배양한 후, 세포로부터 배양액을 제거한다. 
—Well 당 적절한 농도의 검체 용출물 또는 음성 대조군, 또는 양성대조군이나 공시험액을 넣은 
배양액 100 μl를 첨가한다. 최소한 4가지 다른 농도의 시험 검체(item) 용출물이나 양성 대조군
의 용출물을 시험한다. 사용된 최고 농도는 100 % 용출물을 사용하며, 기타 농도는 단일 대수 


범위(single logarithmic range) 이내에서 적절히 간격을 두어 사용한다. 음성대조군은 100 % 
용출물만으로 시험한다. 공시험액(blank)으로는 배양액을 사용한다.
— 24 시간 동안(5 % CO
2
, 37 °C, 90 %를 초과하는 습도) 세포를 배양한다. 
3 일차 
24 시간 처리한 후, 세포분주의 오류(cell seeding errors)와 대조군 및 검체를 처리한 세포의 생
장 특성을 확인하기 위하여 위상차 현미경 하에서 각 플레이트를 검사한다. 시험 검체 용출물의 
세포독성 영향으로 인한 세포의 형태상 변화를 기록하되, 이 기록을 세포독성의 정량적 측정용으
로 사용하지는 않는다. 대조군 세포의 이상 증식 특성은 실험에 오류가 있다는 것을 가리키며, 이
는 실험을 취소할 수 있는 근거가 될 수 있다.
플레이트를 검사한 후, 플레이트로부터 배양액을 조심스럽게 제거한다. 용출물 내에 있는 환원성 
화학물질 또한 MTT를 감소시켜서 거짓 음성 결과를 초래할 수 있기 때문에, 이는 중요한 단계
다. 그 후 MTT용액 50 μl(C.2.2.4.3 참조)을 각 시험 well에 넣고, 플레이트를 37 °C 인큐베이터 
내에서 2 시간 동안 추가로 배양한다. 그 후 MTT용액을 제거하고, 이소프로판올(isopropanol) 
100 μl를 각 well에 넣는다. 이 플레이트를 흔들고 난 후, 흡광도를 측정하기 위해 이를 570 nm 
필터가 장착된 마이크로타이터 플레이트(microtitre plate) 판독기로 옮긴다.(기준 파장 650 nm)

살아있는 세포의 수가 감소하면 결국 샘플 내 대사 활동이 감소된다. 570 nm에서 측정된 광도와 
같이, 이러한 감소는 형성된 청-보라색 포르마잔(formazan)의 양과 직접적인 관련이 있다. 공시험
액과 비교하여 생존력의 감소를 계산하려면, 다음과 같은 방정식(C.1)을 이용한다: 
      Viab. % =
100 ×OD 570e
OD 570b
  OD570e는 시험 검체의 100 % 용출물에 대해 측정된 광도의 평균값이다; 
  OD570b는 공시험액에 대해 측정된 광도의 평균값이다. 
Viab.% 값이 낮을수록, 시험 검체(item)의 잠재적인 세포독성은 더 높아진다. 
생존율이 공시험액의 70 % 미만(≺ 70 %)으로 감소되는 경우, 이는 잠재적으로 세포독성이 있는 
것이다. 시험 검체 용출물의 50 %로 시험한 경우 용출물 100 %로 시험한 것과 비교하여 생존율
이 최소한 같거나 더 높아야 한다; 그렇지 않을 경우 시험을 반복한다.

(관련규격: ISO 10993-6:2007)
1 적용범위
본 장에서는 의료기기에 사용되는 생체재료(biomaterials)의 이식 후 나타나는 국소적 영향을 평
가하는 시험방법에 대하여 기술한다.
본 장은 다음과 같은 물질에 적용된다.
1) 고체이면서 비생분해성
2) 분해성이며/또는 흡수성
3) 비고체(예: 다공성 물질, 액체, 페이스트 및 미립자)
시험시편은 원자재의 생물학적 안전성을 평가하기에 적합한 동물 종 및 적합한 부위에 이식한다. 
이러한 이식시험은 해당 시험시편의 기계적 또는 기능적 부하(loading)의 성능을 평가하거나 결정
하기 위한 것은 아니다. 본 시험방법은 손상된 피부조직에 국소적으로(topically) 사용되는 의료기
기에 대한 국소적인 조직반응을 평가하는 데 적용될 수 있다.
국소영향은 임상적 사용이 허용되고, 생체적합성이 입증된 의료기기에서 사용되는 물질을 대조물
질로 하여 시험시편에 의해 유발된 조직반응을 비교 평가한다. 본 시험방법의 목적은 의료기기/생
체재료를 이식한 후 나타나는 원자재의 최종적인 통합(integration) 또는 흡수/분해를 포함하는 
조직반응의 이력과 진행상황의 특징을 규명하기 위한 것이다. 특히 분해성이 있고 흡수가 가능한 
물질의 경우에는 물질의 분해 특징과 그 결과로 나타나는 조직반응을 측정해야한다. 
본 장에서는 전신독성, 발암성, 최기형성(teratogenicity) 또는 돌연변이 유발성 문제는 다루지 않
는다. 다만, 국소적인 생물학적 영향을 평가하기 위하여 수행하는 장기간의 이식연구에서는 이러
한 특징에 대한 견해를 얻을 수 있다. 이식방법에 의한 전신독성시험은 본 장에서의 요건을 충족
할 것이다. 
주) 다음 문헌은 이 규격의 적용을 위해 필수적으로 필요한 것이다. 발행연도가 있는 문헌은 그 
발행연도의 문헌만 적용된다. 발행연도가 없는 문헌은 문헌의 최신판(개정내용 포함)이 적용된다.

본 장에서는 1장, 2장, 11장, 15장(ISO 10993-1, 10993-2, 10993-12, 10993-16)에서 정한 
용어의 정의와 다음의 사항을 적용한다.
2.1 분해(degradation)
물질의 분해 
[ISO 10993-9:1999, definition 3.1]
2.2 분해 산물(degradation product)
물질이 화학적으로 분해되거나 변질되어서 생성된 산물
[ISO 10993-16:1997, definition 3.1]
2.3 생체재료(biomaterial)
신체의 조직, 기관 또는 기능을 평가, 처치, 수복 또는 대체하기 위해 생물학적 시스템과 상호접
촉(interface)하여 사용하는 물질
[European Society Biomaterials Conference Ⅱ에서 발췌] 
3 이식시험에 대한 공통사항
3.1 일반사항 
시험계획의 수립은 각각의 동물사용과 연구에서 모든 관련 정보를 도출할 수 있도록 자세하게 준
비하여야 한다(제 2장, 10장, 15장, ISO 10993-2, 10993-11, 10993-16 참고).
동물을 대상으로 하는 모든 연구는 정부가 인정하는 기관이 승인한 시설에서 수행하여야 하고 실
험동물 복지 문제를 다루는 모든 해당 규정에 따라서 수행하여야 한다. 이러한 연구는 비임상시
험관리기준(GLP) 또는 인정된 다른 품질 보증 시스템에 따라 수행하여야 한다. 뿐만 아니라 제 2
장(ISO 10993-2)에 나오는 요건을 준수해야 한다.
이 조항은 부록 B, C 및 D에서 설명하고 있는 시험방법에 적용해야 한다.  
 
3.2 이식을 위한 시편의 준비
시험검체 및 표준물질 또는 대조물질의 준비는 제 11장(ISO 10993-12)을 따라야 한다. 이식시
료의 크기와 모양을 기록으로 남기고 그것을 사용하는 정당성을 입증해야 한다. 다양한 이식부위
에 대한 시험시편은 부록 B, C 및 D에 설명되어 있다. 물리적 특성(예: 형태, 밀도, 경도, 표면)은 
시험물질에 대한 조직의 반응 특성에 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 이러한 물리적 특성은 기록으로 남겨
야하고 반응의 특징을 규명할 때 고려해야 한다.


- 130 -
각각의 이식시편은 완제품에 사용되는 것과 같은 방법으로 제조, 공정, 오염물질의 세척 및 멸균
을 해야 한다. 또한 이런 사항들을 연구문서에서 확인할 수 있어야 한다. 최종 준비 및 멸균을 한 
다음에는 이식시편을 무균적으로 취급해야 하고, 이식 전 또는 이식을 하는 동안 오염이 되거나 
손상되지 않도록 주의하여 취급해야 한다. 
조직공학 의료제품에 지지체(scaffold)로 사용되는 물질의 경우에는 증식된 세포가 포함된 완제품
(final preparation pre-populated with cells)을 시편으로 사용하지 않는 것이 바람직하다. 왜냐
하면, 이러한 제품의 세포 구성성분에 대한 동물의 면역반응과 동물에 대한 그 세포의 반응이 국
소조직반응 결과에 영향을 줄 수 있기 때문이다.
 
복합재료(composite materials, 예: 골시멘트, 치과재료)의 경우, 구성성분을 사용 전에 혼합하여 
이식 전에 경화시킬 수 있다. 그러나 사용부위에서 바로(in situ) 중합하여 사용하는 의료기기의 
경우에는 사용부위에서 중합이 일어날 수 있도록 삽입하여야 한다. 특수한 유형의 연구에서는 다
른 절차를 이용할 수 있다. 이용된 절차에 대해서는 기록으로 남기고 그 정당성을 밝혀두어야 한
다.
비고체 
물질(분말 
포함)은 
이식 
후에 
국소적 
영향을 
시험하기 
위하여 
끝이 
열려있는
(open-ended) 원통형 튜브에 넣어서 시험하기도 한다(튜브로 사용할 물질의 선택에 관해서는 제 
11장 참고). 시험물질을 준비할 때는 제조자의 지시사항에 따르고, 튜브의 외부 표면이 시험물질
로 오염되지 않도록 주의를 하면서, 튜브의 끝부분까지 시험물질을 삽입하여야 한다. 만약 오염이 
발생하면, 그 검체는 이식하여서는 안 된다. 튜브 내에 기포가 생기지 않도록 주의하고, 튜브 내
에 삽입된 시험물질의 표면 끝부분과 튜브의 끝부분이 고른가를 확인한다. 
주 1) 이런 목적에는 폴리에틸렌(PE), 폴리프로필렌(PP) 또는 폴리테트라플루오로에틸렌(PTFE) 
튜브가 흔히 이용된다. PE 튜브는 고압증기멸균하면 변형될 수 있다. PTFE 튜브는 마이크로톰
(microtome)으로 절단하기가 어렵다. 따라서 절단하는 동안 튜브가 조직블록에 남아있어야 하는 
경우에는 동일한 크기의 PE 튜브나 PP 튜브를 대신 사용하는 것이 나을 수도 있다.
평가를 할 때는 해당 조직반응을 임상적 사용이 허용되고 생체적합성이 입증된 유사한 시편이나 
물질의 반응과 비교하여야 한다.
주 2) 자세한 지침 내용은 제 11장(ISO 10993-12) 참고
대조군의 형태 및 특히 표면 상태와 같은 물리적 특성은 이식시험 시편의 특성과 가능한 유사해
야 하며, 만약 차이가 있는 경우에는 그 차이를 설명하고 근거를 밝혀야 한다. 시험물질이 튜브에 
담겨 있다면, 대조군을 동일한 원자재의 튜브에 들어 있는 상태로 사용해야 하며 튜브의 직경도 
같아야 한다. 선택한 대조군 막대(rod) 또는 튜브를 기록하고 선택의 근거를 밝혀야 한다.
4 시험방법 및 일반사항
4.1 조직 및 이식부위


- 131 -
시험검체는 해당 의료기기의 의도된 임상적 사용과 가장 관련성이 높은 조직에 이식해야 한다. 
검체 수, 대상 조직 및 이식부위를 선택한 근거를 기록으로 남겨야 한다. 다양한 이식부위에 대한 
시험방법은 부록 B, C 및 D에서 제시되어 있다. 다른 이식부위를 선택할 경우에는 부록 B, C 및 
D에 나오는 시험방법에 적용된, 일반적인 과학원칙을 지키고 그 근거를 밝혀야 한다.
주 1) 치과사용을 위한 특별한 시험은 ISO 7405를 참고할 것
분해성/흡수성 물질의 경우 계획한 이식기간이 끝나는 시점에 해당 이식부위를 식별할 수 있도록 
적절한 방법으로 표시해야 한다. 비침습성 영구 피부 표식시기(permanent skin marker)와/또는 
시편 위치가 표시되는 템플릿(template)을 사용할 것을 권장한다. 어떤 경우에는 이식부위의 위치
를 표시하기 위해 적절한 음성대조군을 이용할 수도 있다. 예외적으로, 해당 조직에 대한 처리절
차의 영향을 평가하는데 모의수술(sham surgical)절차를 이용할 수도 있다. 이런 경우에는 과학
적 근거를 제시해야 한다.
주 2) 흡수가 가능한 시험시편의 이식부위를 식별하기 위한 표식으로 비흡수성 봉합사 또는 피부 
페인트를 이용할 수 있다. 
4.2 실험동물
동물보호와 사육환경 등 실험동물과 관련된 모든 내용은 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)을 따라야 한다. 
일반적으로 마우스, 랫드, 햄스터 또는 토끼와 같은 작은 실험동물을 이용하는 것이 선호된다.
보다 큰 동물을 사용하려면, 시험에서 사용하는 생체재료의 특별한 과학적인 고려사항으로 정당
화하여야 할 것이다.
제 2장에 나오는 원칙에 따라 동물 종을 선택하여야 하며, 이식시험 시편의 크기, 동물 당 이식시
료의 수, 해당 동물의 예상수명과 관련된 시험의 예상 지속기간 및 생물학적 반응과 관련하여 잠
재적인 종 차이 등을 고려해야 한다(부록 B참고).
단기시험의 경우, 설치류나 토끼가 흔히 사용된다. 장기시험의 경우에는 설치류, 토끼, 개, 면양, 
산양, 돼지 및 상대적으로 수명이 긴 기타 다른 동물을 이용하는 것이 좋다.
분해성 물질로 동물실험을 하고자 할 때, 실험 시작 전에 in vitro 분해(degradation) 연구에서 
얻어진 관련 정보를 검토해야 한다. 생분해성 물질의 경우에는 보다 큰 동물을 대상으로 연구를 
시작하기 전에 예상 분해율을 측정하기 위해 설치류를 이용한 예비시험(pilot study)을 실시해야 한
다.
종과 연령, 성별 및 계통이 동일한 동물의 동일한 해부학적 부위에 동일한 조건으로 시험물질 및 
대조물질의 시편을 이식해야 한다. 동물에 삽입된 이식시료의 수와 크기는 동물의 크기와 해부학
적 위치에 근거하여 정한다. 가능하다면 표준 대조군(reference control)과 시험시편은 동일한 동
물에게 이식한다.


- 132 -
그러나 이식 후 나타나는 국소영향을 이식에 의한 전신독성시험의 일환으로 연구한다면 대조군과 
시험검체를 동일한 동물에 적용하여서는 안 된다.
 
4.3 시험기간
시험기간은 임상적으로 노출되는 시간으로 결정하거나 생물학적 반응이 안정화 단계(steady 
state)에 도달할 때까지 또는 그 이후까지 계속되어야 한다. 시험기간은 타당한 근거를 바탕으로 
설정되어야 한다.
비분해성 물질과 비흡수성 물질의 경우 일반적으로 단기반응은 1 주에서부터 4 주까지를 평가하
고, 장기반응은 12 주 이상의 시험으로 평가한다. 이식한 물질에 대한 국소적인 생물학적 반응은 
물질의 특성 및 수술 외상에 대한 반응에 따라 달라진다. 이식부위 부근에 있는 조직의 형태는 
수술 이후의 경과시간에 따라 달라진다. 이식 후 첫 2 주 동안은 수술 자체에 의한 반응과 이식
으로 인해 유발된 조직반응을 구별하기 어렵다. 동물의 종과 수술 후 외상의 중증도에 따라서 근
육과 결합조직에서는 9 주에서 12 주 후에 세포 수가 안정화 단계(steady state)를 유지하는 것
을 볼 수 있다. 골조직에 이루어진 이식에서는 이보다 더 오랜 시간이 지나야 안정화 단계
(steady state)를 관찰할 수 있다. 일반적으로, 분해성 물질을 평가하기 위해서는 흡수가 일어나
는 시점 또는 그 이후까지 실험을 해야 한다.
분해성/흡수성 물질의 경우에는 시험기간 선정 시 시험제품의 추정 분해시간을 고려하여야 한다. 
부록 A에 분해성/흡수성 물질에 대한 일반적인 고려사항이 제시되어 있다. 동물실험을 시작하기 
전과, 검체 평가를 위한 시점을 결정하기 전에 분해에 걸리는 시간을 측정하여야 한다. 이러한 측
정은 in vitro 조건에서 실시한 실시간(real time) 또는 가속된(accelerated) 분해시험으로 할 수 
있으며, 특수한 상황에서는 수학적 모델화 기법으로 수행할 수 있다. 일반적으로, 분해성 물질을 
평가하기 위해서는 흡수되는 시점 또는 그 이후까지 시험을 계속해야 한다. 분해성 물질에 대한 
평가는 부분적으로는 물질의 분해율에 따라 달라진다.
국소조직반응에 대한 평가는 다양한 시점에서의 이식시편 분해과정과 관련하여 이루어져야한다.
- 분해가 전혀 일어나지 않거나, 최소한으로 일어나는 경우, 일반적으로 이식 후 1 주에서 12 주
에 평가될 때
- 분해가 일어나고 있을 때
- 안정화 단계(steady state)에 도달하고 조직 재건이 이루어진 때 또는 분해가 거의 끝난 때
이식시료의 완전한 분해 및 흡수 또는 정상적인 조직 구조 및 기능으로의 완전한 회복이 나타나지 
않는다면, 수집된 전반적인 자료가 해당 이식시료의 이식 후 나타나는 국소적 영향을 규명하기에 
충분할 수 있다.
주) in vivo 분해의 경우에는 비교적 긴 기간이 필요하다.(간혹 1 년 이상 걸림) 예정된 연구기간 
동안에 이식물질의 분해가 완료되지 않을 경우에는 관찰기간을 늘리기 위하여 동물을 추가적으로 
이용하는 것이 좋다.


이 장에서는 제10장(전신독성시험)의 전신독성에 대하여 설명하지는 않지만 이식을 이용한 전신
독성시험으로부터 본 시험을 충족시키는 정보를 얻을 수 있다. 
장기적인 이식시험의 경우에 일반적으로 인정되고 있는 관찰 기간을 표 10에 나타내었다.
각 동물은 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)에 따라, 각 시점에 안락사 시켜야한다. 특정상황에서는 전신마
취와 회복을 반복하여 연속적으로 시료를 채취하는 것도 허용된다. 그러나 그 근거를 밝히고 기
록으로 남겨야 한다.

4.4 수술 및 시험조건
수술은 전신마취상태에서 시행해야 한다. 다른 형태의 마취방법을 이용할 경우, 그 근거를 밝혀야 
하고 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)에 나오는 요건을 따라야 한다. 피하, 근육내 또는 골이식을 위한 특
수한 삽입 또는 이식절차는 부록 B, C, D에 각각 나타내었다.
동물 당 이식시료의 수와 관찰기간 당 동물의 수는 부록 B, C 및 D에 설명되어 있다. 평가 대상
인 최종 개수의 시편이 유효한 결과를 도출할 수 있도록 충분한 수의 이식시료를 삽입해야 한다. 
수술기법은 이식결과에 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 수술은 무균상태에서 시행해야 하며, 이식 부위
에 남는 외상을 최소화하는 방법으로 수행되어야 한다. 수술 부위의 털은 클리핑(clipping), 면도 
또는 다른 기계적인 수단으로 제거하여야 한다. 적절한 소독제로 노출되는 피부부위를 소독해야 
한다. 이식시료나 수술한 표면이 털과 접촉하지 않도록 주의를 기울여야 한다. 수술 후에는 무균
상태를 유지하기 위해 주의를 기울이면서, 봉합을 하거나 수술용클립(wound clip)을 이용하여 수
술부위를 닫아야 한다.
시험기간 동안 정기적으로 동물의 건강상태를 관찰하고 기록하여야 한다. 수술이후 시험기간 동
안 각 동물을 적절한 간격으로 관찰하고 이상소견(국소적, 전신적 이상 및 행동이상 포함)이 발견
된 경우에는 기록으로 남겨야 한다. 또한 이러한 소견이 얻어진 결과에 미칠 수 있는 영향을 시
- 133 -

- 134 -
험보고서에 기술하여야 한다. 
건강상태가 좋지 않아 보일 경우에는 적절한 간격을 두고 체중을 측정해야 한다. 수술 후에 진통
제를 사용할 경우에는 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)에 나오는 요건을 따라야 한다. 
실험기간이 끝나면 마취제를 과량투여하거나, 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)에 나오는 원칙에 따라 기타 인
도적인 방법을 이용하여 실험동물을 안락사 시킨다.  
4.5 평가
4.5.1 일반사항
시간경과에 따른 생물학적반응을 육안 관찰과 조직병리학적 관찰로 평가한다. 시험검체에 대한 
반응을 대조검체나 수술대조군(sham operated site)의 반응과 비교한다.
주) 부록 E와 참고문헌에 등급 체계의 예시를 명시하였다. 
조직과 이식시료 간의 상대적인 움직임에 대한 영향을 최소화하기 위하여 각 이식시료에 대하여 
동등한 부위에서 대조군과 시험검체를 비교하여야 한다. 
원통형 시료는 양쪽 끝의 중간부분을 평가하고, 흠이 있는 원통형 이식시료의 경우 편평한 
끝 표면과 홈 사이의 중심부분이 평가하기에 적당하다. 
각 시험종료 시점(end points)에 대하여 부록 B, C 및 D에 정의된 것과 같이 충분한 수의 검체
를 평가하여야 한다. 이 검체들은 최소한 3 마리의 다른 동물로부터 회수되어야 한다.
4.5.2 육안관찰에 의한 평가
각각의 이식 부위에서 정상 구조의 변화를 검사하여야 한다. 이런 검사에는 Tilney의 인접하고 
있는 림프절(regional draining lymph nodes)에 대한 평가도 포함된다[32]. 평가시에는  저배율 
렌즈를 이용하는 것이 좋다. 혈종, 부종, 피막형성 및/또는 추가적으로 발견된 조직반응의 정도와 
특징을 기록한다. 이식시료의 존재, 형태 및 위치(분해성 물질의 잔여물 포함)를 기록한다. 육안사
진을 문서에 포함한다.
이식부위를 검사하는 것 이외에 동물이 건강이상 징후 또는 이식시료에 대한 반응을 보일 때는 
적절하게 부검하여 육안적 관찰을 하여야 한다.
4.5.3 이식시료의 회수 및 조직샘플의 수집
인도적인 방법으로 동물을 안락사 시킨 후, 국소적인 조직병리학적 반응을 평가하기위하여 이식
시료를 영향 받지 않은 인접조직과 함께 충분히 채취한다. 관찰한 부위에서 대상물질이 명확히 
나타나지 않으면(분해성 및 흡수성 물질) 이식부위로 예상되는 모든 부위의 정상조직을 몇 밀리


- 135 -
미터씩 포함시켜 채취부위를 확대한다. 비분해성 이식시료의 경우에는 육안병리적으로 이상이 있
는 림프절을 수집한다. 분해성 이식시료의 경우에는 가능하다면 림프절을 채취하여야 한다. 왜냐
하면 림프절에 대한 평가는 분해성 물질의 이동을 입증하는 데 중요하기 때문이다.
  
주 1) 모든 시편의 배수림프절 위치를 찾는 것이 항상 가능하지는 않다. 
동물의 건강상태가 좋지 않거나 육안 병리적인 소견이 있는 경우, 또는 시험계획서상 전신독성을 
평가하는 경우에는 기타 다른 기관을 적절하게 채취하여야 한다. 
조직학적 평가를 위하여 채취한 조직샘플을 고정, 삭정(excision), 포매(embedding), 박절 및 염색
을 포함한 적절한 절차에 따라 처리한다. 필요하다면 이식시료에 대한 방향성, 절편의 수, 절단모양
을 기록한다.
전통적인 기술을 사용할 때 고정액을 처리하기 전 또는 후에 조직 외피를 벗기고 이식시료 및 조
직베드의 상태를 기록해야 한다. 이식시료와 조직의 경계면이 파손되지 않도록 주의를 기울여야 
한다. 
이식시료와 접촉하는 조직면을 관찰할 때는 이식시료를 포함하는 전체 조직 외피를 강화플라스틱
에 포매하는 방법이 사용된다. 조직시편을 준비하기 위해서는 적절한 박절기술 및 연마기술이 요
구된다. 조직을 플라스틱에 포매하는 기술이 조직과의 접촉면을 크게 변화시키지 않는다는 것을 
입증하여야 한다. 
주 2) 연조직에 이식된 부드러운 이식시료의 경우, 조직샘플의 처리과정(processing) 중 이식시
료를 제거하지 않고 할 수 있다. 
4.5.4 현미경적 평가
조직학적 평가에 이용되는 점수화방식은 영향을 받은 부위의 범위를 정량적(예: 마이크로미터로) 
또는 반정량적(semi-quantitative)으로 고려해야 한다(부록 E참고). 이식시료의 방향, 절편의 수 
및 절단모양을 기록해야 한다.
이식시료의 크기와 관련하여 절단방향을 기록한다.
평가하고 기록해야 하는 생물학적 반응의 변수는 다음과 같다.
- 섬유화/섬유 피막(마이크로미터 단위의 층)과 염증의 정도
- 조직형태학적 변화로 인한 변성
- 이식시료와 조직접촉면에서의 염증세포의 종류(즉, 다형성 핵 호중성 백혈구, 림프구, 형
  질세포, 호산구, 대식세포 및 다핵세포)별 수와 분포형태
- 괴사의 존재, 정도 및 유형 
- 혈관 형성, 지방 침윤, 육아종 형성 및 골 형성과 같은 조직 변화
- 분해된 물질 잔류물의 분절화 그리고/또는 잔해의 존재, 형태, 위치와 같은 물질 변수
- 다공성 그리고 분해성 이식시료 시험시 조직 침윤성장(tissue ingrowth)의 상태와 양


- 136 -
조직학적 이상반응은 현미경사진을 첨부하여 기록한다. 
분해성/흡수성 물질의 경우에는 중간 또는 거의 완료된 분해시점에서 분해성 이식시료의 일부 잔
류물이 검사한 조직샘플 중에 있어야 한다. 그 밖에도, 정상적인 구조로의 회복여부를 평가하는 
경우에는 표식이나 템플릿으로 표시된 대표적인 이식부위를 평가하여야 한다. 
골에 삽입한 이식시료의 경우에는 조직과 원자재간의 경계면이 특히 중요하다. 이식시료 근처에 
있는 골의 양과 골 접촉부위 뿐 아니라 중간에 끼어있는 비석회화 조직의 존재 유무도 평가한다. 
골 흡수 또는 새로운 골 형성 유무가 있는 경우 그 사항을 기록한다.
4.5.5 반응의 평가
참고문헌 [17], [18], [25] 및 [26]에 정량적인 점수화방식의 예시가 소개되어 있다. 반정량적
(semi-quantitative) 점수화방식의 예시는 부록 E에 설명되어 있다. 그 밖에도, 다른 점수화방식
이 참고문헌에 포함되어있다.

분해성 및 흡수성 물질의 이식기간과 조직반응에 대한 일반사항
분해성 물질에 의한 조직반응은 비흡수성 고체 물질에 의한 반응과는 다를 것으로 예상된다. 비흡
수성 물질과는 대조적으로, 분해성 물질의 안정화 단계(steady state)는 이식시료가 완전히 분해
되고 흡수된 다음에야 확보된다는 점에 주의해야 한다. 안정화 단계가 될 때까지 분해되는 물질과 
주변조직은 계속해서 상호작용을 한다. 따라서 일반적으로 분해단계에서 만성 염증반응이 관찰될 
수도 있으나, 국소적인 조직구조는 이식시료의 분해 이후 정상으로 돌아온다. 그러므로 일반적으
로 “생체적합성”으로 판단되는 잔존하는 경미한 조직반응을 판단하기 위해서는 원자재의 분해기
간 만큼 긴 이식기간이 필요할 수 있다. 분해는 지속적인 과정이고 산성의 분해산물이 "폭발"하듯
이 방출될 가능성이 있기 때문에, 잔류하는 이식시료와 그 분해산물에 대한 국소적인 부작용반응
을 평가하기 위해서는 중간 분해 단계에서 조직반응을 평가할 필요가 있다. 
in vivo에서의 실시간 분해는 조직반응에서 완전한 분해나 안정화 단계에 도달하기까지 더 긴 시
간이 필요할 수 있다. 그러므로 이식 후 늦게 나타나는 현상을 모의로 나타내기 위해서는, in 
vitro에서 미리 분해된 물질(예를 들면 50% 중량 감소 또는 50% 기계적 강도 감소)을 이식하는 
방법을 고려할 수 있다. 그러나 이러한 실험적 연구(exploratory study)는 원자재의 실시간적인 
in vivo 분해 특성을 완전하게 규명하기 위한 다른 이식시험을 대신할 수는 없다. 
이 부록에 나오는 조항은 약물을 천천히 방출하기 위한 운반체, 조직공학 의료제품의 분해성 지지
체(scaffold) 또는 비분해성 이식시료의 흡수성 표면코팅과 같은 분해성 물질의 국소영향을 평가
하는데도 적용된다.

이식시료를 설치류, 개, 산양, 면양, 돼지 또는 토끼의 골에 이식한다. 이 실험동물 중 2장(ISO 
10993-2)에 따라 한 종을 선택한다. 종 간의 차이가 골의 생리기능에 중요하므로 이식시술 시행 
전에 
고려하여야 
한다. 
그 
밖에도, 
골질(quality)은 
같은 
종의

목적성 
사육 
동물
(non-purpose-bred animal)들 사이에서도 서로 다를 수 있으며, 적합한 실험동물을 가려내고 시
험결과 해석을 위해 골밀도 검사가 필요할 수도 있다. 어떤 동물을 선택하더라도, 그 선택의 근거
를 밝히고 기록으로 남겨야 한다.
D.4.2 이식부위
해부학적으로 동일한 부위에 대하여 대칭적으로 각각의 시험검체와 대조군의 이식시료를 이식한
다. 시험검체를 대조군과 평행한 반대편에 둔다. 이식시료의 움직임이 최소가 되는 이식부위를 선
택한다. 각각의 이식기간에 대하여, 최소한 시험시편 10 개, 대조시편 10 개를 평가해야 한다. 비
분해성 대조검체는 한 시점에서만 평가할 수도 있다. 이러한 경우 그 근거를 밝히고 기록으로 남

실험동물의 크기, 체중, 연령 및 선택된 이식부위 선정시, 이식시료가 삽입되더라도 시험부위에 
병리학적 골절에 대한 위험이 없도록 한다. 어린 동물일수록 뼈의 끝 부분(골단) 또는 미성숙 뼈
를 피하여 이식하는 것이 중요하다.
D.5 이식방법
생리식염수를 주입 및 흡입(suction)하면서 천천히 간헐적으로 드릴링하여 뼈를 준비한다. 이는 
과열로 인한 국부조직의 괴사를 방지하기 위함이다.
이식시료의 직경과 이식시료를 삽입하기 위한 뼈의 구멍이 잘 맞도록 하여 섬유소 조직이 내부에
서 성장하는 것을 방지하는 것이 중요하다.

허가여부를 결정하는 방법을 기술한다.
인체에 접촉하지 않는 에틸렌옥사이드(EO) 멸균 의료기기(예: 체외진단 의료기기)는 본 기준에 포함
되지 않는다.
주 1) 이 규격은 에틸렌글리콜(EG)의 허용한도는 규정하지 않는다.
주 2) 다음 문헌은 이 규격의 적용을 위해 필수적이다. 발행연도가 있는 문헌은 그 발행연도의 
문헌만 적용된다. 발행연도가 없는 문헌은 그 문헌의 최신판(개정 내용 포함)이 적용된다.

2 정의
 
본 장에서는 제1장(ISO 10993-1) 및 제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 설명된 정의와 다음의 정의가 적
용된다.
2.1 모의 사용 용출법(simulated-use extraction)
이 규격의 요건을 따르는 용출법은 의료기기를 일상적으로 사용하는 동안 환자 또는 사용자에게 
전달되는 잔류량 수준을 평가하는 방법으로 물로 용출하여 제품의 실제 사용에서의 조건을 모방한
다.
2.2 완전용출법(exhaustive extraction)
일련의 용출과정에서 에틸렌옥사이드(EO) 또는 에틸렌클로로히드린(ECH)의 양이 처음 검출된 양
의 10% 미만일 때까지 또는 검출된 누적 잔류량이 분석적으로 유의하게 증가하지 않을 때까지 


- 152 -
용출한다.
주) 잔류물의 완전한 용출(the exhaustive nature of residual recovery)을 증명하는 것은 불가
능하기 때문에 “완전용출법”을 위와 같이 정의한다.
3 필요조건
3.1 일반사항
주) 이 규격의 한계기준 도출에 관한 정보 및 활용과 관련된 기타 중요 배경 정보 및 가이드라인
은 참조용 부록에 정리되어 있다.
본 절은 에틸렌옥사이드로 멸균된 의료기기에 대한 에틸렌옥사이드의 최대 허용 잔류량을 명시
하고 있다. 의료기기 멸균에 에틸렌옥사이드(EO)가 적합한지 결정하려면, 정상적인 제품에 잔류
하는 에틸렌옥사이드(EO), 에틸렌클로로히드린(ECH), 에틸렌글리콜(EG)의 환자에 대한 영향(위
험)이 최소 수준이여야 한다. 또한, 이 규격의 내용과 상관없이 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균방법을 채
택한 경우, 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물 노출을 최소화해야 한다. 에틸렌옥사이드로 멸균된 의료기기
에서 에틸렌 클로로히드린이 검출될 경우 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대한 최대 허용 잔류량도 명시
하고 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드는 3.3.5.2와 부록 G, 에틸렌클로로히드린은 3.3.5.3과 부록 H에 나타
낸 바와 같이, 국소 영향(예. 자극)을 고려하여 허용접촉한계(TCL, tolerable contact limit)를 제
시하였다. 에틸렌글리콜에 대해서는 한계 기준을 규정하지 않았는데 이는 부록 I에서 제시된 바와 
같이 허용수준 계산값이 의료기기에서 발생할 수 있는 수준보다 더 높기 때문이다. 하지만 에틸
렌글리콜과 같은 고삼투압성 화합물은 정맥 투여될 경우 급성 용혈 및 혈역학적 반응이 발생할 
수 있다. 의료기기의 에틸렌글리콜 멸균은 고삼투압성 용액을 생성시킬 것으로 예상되지 않는다. 
에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린의 분석방법은 3.4를 참조한다.
이 규격의 기준에는 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에서 지정된 생물학적 시험의 요구사항도 고려되어야 
한다. 에틸렌옥사이드로 멸균되는 의료기기에 대한 시험 중 제9장(ISO 10993-10) 및 제3장(ISO 
10993-3)에 특별히 주의를 기울여야 한다. 개별적으로 설계된 의료기기 각각의 에틸렌옥사이드 잔
류물은 출고 시점을 기준으로 하여 제1장(ISO 10993-1)의 기준에 따라 평가한다.
의료기기의 생물학적 평가 결과는 전신 영향을 막기 위해 3.3항에 명시된 한계치보다 엄격한 
한계를 요구할 수도 있다. 
3.2 의료기기의 분류
의료기기를 환자에게 적용할 때 환자에게 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드(EO) 및 에틸렌클로로히드린
(ECH)의 일일 최대량을 설정하기 위해 의료기기를 환자접촉기간에 따라 분류하여야 한다.
의료기기를 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에서 제시된 세 가지 접촉기간에 따른 분류 중에 한가지로 분류한
다.


- 153 -
1) 제한접촉(limited exposure) : 24시간 이내에 1회, 수회 또는 반복적으로 사용하거나 접촉하는 
의료기기
2) 지속접촉(prolonged exposure) : 24시간 이상 30일 이내에 1회, 수회 또는 반복적으로 장기
간 사용하거나 접촉하는 의료기기
3) 영구접촉(permanent contact) : 30일을 초과하며 1회, 수회 또는 반복적으로 장기간 사용하거
나 접촉하는 의료기기 
의료기기 또는 원자재가 2개 이상의 접촉기간 분류에 해당되면 보다 엄격한 시험 및/또는 평가기
준을 적용한다. 반복 노출 의료기기에 대한 분류를 할 때는 잠재적인 누적효과와 이러한 노출이 
지속되는 시간을 염두에 두어야 한다.
주) 이 규격에 적용되는 “반복 노출”은 동일한 의료기기를 반복적으로 사용함을 의미한다(예, 투
석기 카트리지).
3.3 허용한계
3.3.1 일반사항
각각의 의료기기에 대하여 접촉으로 인하여 환자에게 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드 또는 에틸렌클로
로히드린의 최대 허용량이 다음의 한계치를 초과하여서는 안 된다.
영구접촉 및 지속접촉 의료기기의 한계치는 일일 전달양의 최대 평균치로 나타나 있다. 이 한계
치는 최초 24시간에 대해 추가적인 제약을 수반하고, 영구 접촉 의료기기의 경우 최초 30 일에 
대해 추가적인 제약을 수반한다. 이러한 제약은 환자접촉기간 초기에 환자에게 전달될 수 있는 
에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린의 양에 제한을 두는 것이다. 잔류물에 대한 우려가 있는 
제품을 동시에 여러 개 사용하는 경우에는 한계치를 비례적으로 하향 조정하거나, 우려되는 노출 
기간 가운데 일부기간 동안만 제품을 사용한다면 한계치를 비례적으로 상향 조정하는 것을 고려
해야 한다. 동반 노출 인자(CEF, concomitant exposure factors)와 비례 노출 인자(PEF, 
proportional exposure factors)는 제16장(ISO10993-17)에 정리되어 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드에 
대한 허용 한도(allowable limit) 설정 절차는 부록 G에 제시되어 있고, 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대
한 허용 한도(allowable limit) 설정 절차는 부록 H에 제시되어 있으며, 에틸렌글리콜의 허용 한
도(allowable limit) 설정 관련 배경 정보는 부록 I에 제시되어 있다.
3.3.2 영구접촉 의료기기
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드의 일일 평균량은 0.1 ㎎/일을 초과해서는 안 된다. 부가적으로, 
최대 에틸렌옥사이드 가스의 양은 다음을 초과해서는 안 된다.
- 최초 24시간 이내 4 ㎎
- 최초 30일 이내 60 ㎎
- 일생동안 2.5 g
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌클로로히드린의 일일 평균량은 0.4 ㎎/일을 초과해서는 안 된다. 부가적으로, 
최대 에틸렌클로로히드린의 양은 다음을 초과해서는 안 된다.


- 154 -
- 최초 24시간 이내 9 ㎎
- 최초 30일 이내 60 ㎎
- 일생동안 10 g
3.3.3 지속접촉 의료기기
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드의 일일 평균량은 2 ㎎/일을 초과해서는 안 된다. 부가적으로, 최
대 에틸렌옥사이드의 양은 다음을 초과해서는 안 된다.
  
- 최초 24시간 이내 4 ㎎
- 최초 30일 이내 60 ㎎
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌클로로히드린 일일 평균량은 2 ㎎/일을 초과해서는 안 된다. 부가적으로, 
최대 에틸렌클로로히드린의 양은 다음을 초과해서는 안 된다.
- 최초 24시간 이내 9 ㎎
- 최초 30일 이내 60 ㎎
3.3.4 제한접촉 의료기기
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드의 일일 평균량은 4 ㎎을 초과해서는 안 된다.
환자에 전달되는 에틸렌클로로히드린의 일일 평균량은 9 ㎎을 초과해서는 안 된다.
3.3.5 표면접촉 의료기기 및 이식형 의료기기의 허용접촉한계(TCL, tolerable contact limit)
3.3.5.1 개요
허용접촉한계(TCL)은 에틸렌옥사이드인 경우에 평방 센티미터 당 마이크로그램 단위로 나타내고, 
에틸렌클로로히드린은 평방 센티미터 당 밀리그램 단위로 나타낸다. 평방 센티미터 단위는 환자-
제품 간의 접촉면의 면적이다.
주) 이 항의 취지는 제품에서 유출된 에틸렌옥사이드나 에틸렌클로로히드린으로 인한 국소 자극 
방지를 위한 것이다.
3.3.5.2 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계
표면접촉 의료기기 및 이식형 의료기기의 인체 접촉 표면에 대한 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계
(TCL)는 10 μg/cm2을 넘지 않거나 제9장(ISO 10993-10)에 규정된 바와 같은 무시할 수 있는 
수준의 자극을 보여야 한다.
3.3.5.3 에틸렌클로로히드린 허용접촉한계
표면 접촉 의료기기 및 이식형 의료기기의 인체 접촉 표면에 대한 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용접
촉한계(TCL)는 5 ㎎/cm2을 넘지 않아야 하거나 제9장((ISO 10993-10)에 규정된 바와 같은 무
시할 수 있는 수준의 자극을 보여야 한다.


- 155 -
3.3.6 특수 상황
여러 개의 의료기기를 동시에 사용하는 조합형 의료기기 시스템에서는 각각의 의료기기에 대한 
한계치를 적용한다.
인공수정체(IOL, intraocular lens)의 에틸렌옥사이드가스 잔류량은 렌즈당 0.5 ㎍/일을 초과해서
는 안되고 렌즈당 1.25 ㎍을 초과해서는 안된다. 다른 안과 제품의 비례 배분 한계 기준은 인공
수정체의 질량을 20 mg으로 하여 제품의 질량에 근거하여 정한다. 염소를 함유한 점탄성 재료로 
만든 안과용 제품의 에틸렌클로로히드린 수준의 수용성을 평가할 필요가 있는데, 안 독성(ocular 
toxicity)을 유발하는 에틸렌클로로히드린 수준은 해당 에틸렌옥사이드 수준보다 약 4배 더 크다.
환자와 헌혈자의 혈액 수집에 사용되는 혈액 세포 분리기의 에틸렌옥사이드 최대 허용 용량은 10 
㎎이고, 에틸렌클로로히드린의 최대 허용 한도(allowable limit)는 22 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 한다.
혈액산소발생기 및 혈액분리기의 에틸렌옥사이드 가스 최대 허용 한도(allowable limit)는 60 ㎎이
고, 에틸렌클로로히드린의 최대 허용 한도(allowable limit)는 45 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 한다.
심폐우회술(cardiopulmonary bypass)에서 사용되는 제품의 최대 허용 한도(allowable limit)는 
에틸렌옥사이드가 20 ㎎이고 에틸렌클로로히드린은 9 ㎎이다.
체외 혈액정제세트에 대한 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린 한계치는 위에 기술된 지속접촉 
및 제한접촉 분류에 적용시킨다. 그러나 일생동안 허용 가능한 에틸렌옥사이드가스의 양을 초과
할 수 도 있다.
정상 피부에만 접촉하는 드레이프의 최대 허용접촉한계는 에틸렌옥사이드의 경우 10 μg/cm2, 에
틸렌클로로히드린의 경우 5 ㎎/cm2 이거나 또는 제9장(ISO 10993-10)에서 제시하는 바와 같이 
무시할 수 있는 수준의 자극을 보여야 한다.
주) 공통된 기준과 차이를 보이는 일부 제품의 에틸렌옥사이드 기준설정 근거는 부록 F를 참조한
다.
에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물 분석에 이 규격을 적용하는 과정이 담긴 순서도가 부록 C에 제시되어 있다.
3.4 에틸렌옥사이드(EO) 및 에틸렌클로로히드린(ECH) 잔류량 측정
3.4.1 일반사항
3.4.1.1 절차
3.3항에 부합하는지 여부를 결정하는 과정은 검체로부터 잔류물 용출, 잔류량 측정, 제품의 접촉표면 
결정, 데이터 분석 및 해석으로 이루어져있다.
주의사항 - 화학물질과 용매(solvent)를 사용할 경우에는 가스 배출구(hume cupboard)가 확보된 
실험실을 이용하여야 하며, 적절한 보호 장구를 착용하여야 한다. 분석을 시행하기 전에 각각의 


- 156 -
화학물질에 대한 물질 안전 정보를 검토하여야 한다. 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 의료기기를 사용하는 
의료분야 종사자는 잔류물 노출에 대비한 주의 조치를 적절하게 취해야 하며, 산업안전보건법에 
따라 이와 관련한 기준을 적용할 수 있다.
3.4.1.2 에틸렌옥사이드(EO)
에틸렌옥사이드는 인체표면에 자극을 주며 반응성이 매우 강한 인화성 가스이다. 여러 상황에서 
유전자변이를 유발할 수 있으며, 태아독성 및 태아기형발생의 특성을 가지며 남성생식기능에 
부작용을 일으킬 수 있으며 인체의 여러 기관계(organ system)에 손상을 줄 수 있다. 시험동물의 
발암성시험에서 에틸렌옥사이드 가스의 흡입은 백혈병, 뇌종양, 유방암 등의 종양을 일으켰으며, 
섭취 또는 피하투여의 경우 접촉한 부위에서만 종양이 발생하였다. 작업장에서 노출시 높은 발암
율과 사망률을 나타낸다는 보고가 있었으나 최근 여러 연구에 의하면, 상관관계가 매우 미약함
을 알 수 있다. 참고문헌 [177], [178], [181]을 참조한다. 1994년에 IARC(International 
Agency for Research on Cancer)는 작용 메커니즘에 근거하여 에틸렌옥사이드를 인체 발암물
질(클래스 1)로 재분류했다. 참고문헌 [75]를 참조한다.
3.4.1.3 에틸렌클로로히드린
에틸렌클로로히드린은 인체표면에 자극을 주고, 급성독성을 가지며, 독성을 유발할 수 있는 정도
의 양이 피부를 통하여 쉽게 흡수될 수 있다. 약한 유전자변이 잠재성이 있고, 태아독성 및 태아
기형발생의 특성을 가지며, 폐, 신장, 중추신경계 및 심혈관계를 포함한 기관계에 손상을 줄 수 있다. 
시험동물에서의 발암성 시험결과는 음성이었다.
3.4.2 잔류량 측정
검증된 용출 및 측정 방법으로 에틸렌옥사이드가스의 양을 측정하며, 필요한 경우 환자에 전달
되는 에틸렌클로로히드린의 양을 측정한다.
부록 K.4.2 또는 K.4.7에 제시된 방법으로 에틸렌클로로히드린을 측정하였는데 검출되지 않았다면 
더 이상의 모니터링은 필요하지 않다.
주) 충전 칼럼(packed column) 대신에 모세관 칼럼(capillary column)을 사용하는 많은 기체 크로
마토그래피(gas chromatography) 방법은 일회 검체 주입으로 에틸렌옥사이드, 에틸렌클로로히드
린, 에틸렌글리콜 결과를 얻을 수 있다.
에틸렌옥사이드의 정량, 그리고 필요한 경우 에틸렌클로로히드린의 정량을 위한 적절한 용출방법 
선택에 관한 원리는 환자에 대한 노출량을 평가하여 3.3항의 요건에 부합함을 보이는 것이다.
완전용출에 의한 잔류량의 결과가 요건에 적합하다면 모의사용용출에 의한 평가가 필요하지 않
으며 적용되는 한계치는 3.3항과 같다. 완전용출법을 사용할 때 3.3항에서 최초 24시간 및 최초 
30일에 대한 한계치에 특별히 주의하여야 한다.
에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 잔류물의 분석 방법이 많이 개발되었으며, 일부는 참고문헌에 정리되어 있
다. 하지만 멸균 의료기기의 구성 원자재와 제조 방법이 너무 다양하므로, 참고문헌에 제시된 방
법으로 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물 수준을 분석할 때 여러 가지 문제가 발생


- 157 -
할 수 있다. 그러므로 분석학적으로 타당하고 밸리데이션된 분석방법(즉, 정확성, 정밀성, 선형성, 
민감성, 선택성이 증명된 방법)을 사용한다. 부록 A에는 기체 크로마토그래피 방법과 관련한 일
반 밸리데이션 기준이 정리되어 있다.
3.4.3 검체(product sample) 및 공시험 검체(sample "blank")의 샘플링(sampling)
3.4.3.1 검체의 채취
잔류량 분석을 위하여 사용되는 검체는 대상 의료기기를 대표할 수 있는 것으로 선택하여야 한다. 
검체를 선택할 때는 부록 D에 기술된 다양한 요소를 고려해야 한다. 이러한 요소가 의료기기 부분
품의 초기 잔류물 수준뿐만 아니라, 잔류물 분해속도에 영향을 주기 때문에 가공 처리한 적재물에
서 검체를 꺼내어 실험실로 보낼 때에는 이러한 요소를 고려하여야 한다. 멸균이 종료된 직후에 
검체를 꺼내어 멸균장소에서 멀리 떨어진 실험실로 옮기거나, 차후의 분석을 위해 실험실에 저장
해 두는 것은 검체의 잔류량과 나머지 제품의 잔류량의 상관관계 분석에 어려움을 줄 수 있다. 또
한 검체의 통기 상태와 관련한 영향을 무시할 수 있는 정도로 검체를 적재물에서 취하고 취급할 
수 없다면, 계절별로 검체통기와 적재물 통기 사이의 관계를 확립하기 위한 실험을 실시해야 한
다.
멸균완료제품에서 꺼낸 시험검체의 경우 실험실의 통풍율 조건에 따른 영향을 최소화하고 통제하
기 위하여 주의를 기울여야 하며(D.1.5항 참고), 시험자 및 분석자의 안전도 보장하여야 한다. 검
체는 분석일 까지 또는 검체를 되찾아와서 즉시 냉동시킬 때 까지 멸균완료 제품과 함께 보관한다. 
통제된 통풍 지역에서 검체를 꺼내는 것과 용출을 시작하는 공정 사이의 시간 간격을 최소화하여야 
한다. 분석이 지연될 때는 검체를 밀봉하고 냉동상태로 보관하고 운반하여야 한다. 검체는 드라
이아이스가 포함된 상태에서 익일 배송 서비스로 가능한 신속하게 운송하여야 한다. 드라이아이
스는 운반과정 동안 및 실험실에서 개봉할 때까지 운반 용기 안에 존재하여야 한다. 다른 방법으
로 원하는 통풍 기간을 거친 멸균완료제품에서 직접 채취한 시험검체는 즉시 적절한 용출용액 또
는 헤드 스페이스 바이알(head space vial)로 옮기고 밀봉하여 분석실험실로 운반한다. 대안으로 
용출을 하여 용출액을 실험실로 보내 분석할 수 있다. 용출액이 물일 경우, 도착할 때까지 저온상
태(<10 ℃)를 유지하며 운반한다. 또한, 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리콜로 가수분해 되었는지 측
정하는 시험을 실시해야 한다.
검체를 환기 장치가 구비된 곳에 놓고 포장을 제거한다. 검체는 제품 라벨에 있는 사용 전 지시
사항에 따라 준비한다. 용출은 검체의 포장을 제거한 후 또는 사용 전 준비가 완료된  후에 가능한 
한 신속하게 시작하도록 한다.
3.4.3.2 공시험검체(Sample “blank”)
동일한 유지시간(retention time)을 가진 검체의 다른 성분이 잔류물로 측정되지 않음을 보증하기 
위해 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 검체에 적용된 것과 동일한 공정을 거친 비멸균검체의 용출물에 이러한 
방해물질이 존재할 가능성을 공시험검체로 평가해야 한다. 공시험검체에서 용출한 물질이 기체 
크로마토그래피 분석에서 유지시간(retention time)이 겹치거나 충돌할 수 있는 경우 분석물
질 피크(peak)와 방해물질 피크(peak)를 분리하기 위해 크로마토그래피의 조건을 변형하거나, 다
른 분석기법을 적용하여야 한다.

3.4.4 검체/용출용매의 비율
의료기기 또는 이들의 대표적인 부분의 잔류물 용출에 사용되는 용출용매의 부피는 검출 감도를 
유지하면서 용출효율을 극대화하기에 충분하여야 한다. 용출용매의 최적 부피는 의료기기 검체의 
특성 및 크기에 따라 결정한다. 그러므로 분석 감도를 최대화하려면, 검체의 크기와 용출 방법에 
따라 용출 용액을 최소 수준에서 사용해야 한다. 흡수성이 강한 원자재로 구성된 의료기기의 경
우 또는 충전재에 의해 잔류물이 용출되는 경우 증가된 용매부피를 반영하여 검체/용출용매의 비
율을 설정해야 한다. 어떤 경우에도 검체/용출용매의 비율이 검출 감도에 영향을 주어서는 안 된다.
 
3.4.5 용출시간 및 조건
용출의 목적은 의료기기의 실질적인 사용조건에서 환자에게 전달될 수 있는 가장 심한 조건을 가
정하여 수행하는데 있다. 제한 접촉에 대하여 1일을 기준으로 하고, 지속 접촉에 대하여는 1일부
터 최대 1개월까지를 기준으로 하며, 영구 접촉에 대하여는 1일, 1개월부터 일생까지를 기준으로 
한다. 아래에 기술된 완전 용출은 영구접촉 의료기기에 대하여 유용하다.
3.4.6 제품의 용출
3.4.6.1 개요
의료기기의 에틸렌옥사이드가스 멸균 후 잔류량 결정을 위해 사용되는 용출 방법에는 기본적으로 
두 가지가 있다. 하나는 기준 방법(reference method)인 모의사용용출법이며, 다른 하나는 특별
한 경우에 선택적으로 적용되는 완전용출법이다. 용출방법은 의료기기의 사용목적에 근거하여 선
택한다. 제시된 용출방법의 예는 부록K에 있다.
선택된 용출방법은 제품의 사용목적에 있어서 환자에게 최대로 영향을 미칠 수 있는 조건을 나타
내며, 분석을 용이하게 진행하기 위해서나 잔류물 농도를 최소화할 수 있는 방식으로 용출해서는 
안 된다.
용출온도 및 시간은 3.2항과 3.3항에 기술된 바와 같이 환자에게 노출되는 양상과 의료기기와 
환자와의 접촉시간에 따라 결정된다. 용출온도는 제11장(ISO10993-12)을 참조한다.
분석자는 특정 의료기기에 있어서 모의사용용출시 상대적으로 큰 부피로 용출될 수 있다는 사실을 
주의한다. 이런 경우, 이 규격에 따라 실험할 때 잔류물의 검출 한계가 유의하게 증가할 수 있다.
크기가 작은 의료기기는 적절한 크기의 용기에 넣고 용출해야 한다. 의료기기가 너무 커서 전체
를 용출시킬 수 없는 경우, 결과의 신뢰성을 보장하기 위해 의료기기 구성품 중 이를 대표할 수 
있는 몇 가지 부분을 용출할 필요가 있다.
이러한 대표적 부분에 대한 선택은 두 가지 방법 중 한 가지를 선택한다. 몇 개의 다른 원자재를 
이용하는 경우에 의료기기 전체 질량에서 각 부분의 질량에 비례하게 선택하거나, 가장 잔류물이 
많은 부품 중 하나를 선택한다. 다른 방법은 잔류물의 양과 관련하여 최악의 경우를 대표하는 부
분품 중 하나를 선택하여 평가하는 것이다. 선택된 방법에 대해 유효성을 검증해야 한다.
3.4.6.2 모의사용 용출법(기준 방법)


- 159 -
수성 용매를 사용한 모의사용 용출법은 기준방법으로서 3.3항에 명시된 한계치와 직접적으로 비
교할 만한 시험결과를 나타낸다. 이러한 한계치는 환자에게 전달된 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클
로로히드린의 양으로 나타나 있다.
의료기기를 일상적으로 사용할 때 환자 또는 최종 사용자에게 노출될 수 있는 잔류물 수준을 평
가해야 하므로, 모의사용조건에서의 용출이 요구된다. 모의사용용출은 환자에게 최대로 영향을 미
칠 수 있는 조건하에서 시행되어야 한다.
예를 들어 많은 혈액접촉의료기기와 비경구 의료기기는 혈관 또는 체액관에 물이 채워지거나 분
출되어져서 이 물질들에 의해 용출될 수 있다. 한 번 사용할 때 걸리는 최대시간과 동일시간 
또는 이를 초과하는 시간 (또는 전체 용출을 보증할 수 있는 시간)동안 검체를 용출하여야 하
고, 가장 실제 같은 모의용출이 가능한 온도에서 용출하여야 한다.
정상적인 사용과정에서 환자 또는 사용자에게 전달되는 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린의 
양을 결정하기 위하여 수용액을 사용한 모의사용용출(simulated use aqueous extraction)과정
이 사용된다.
주) 정상적 사용조건을 모방하였을 때 용출되는 에틸렌옥사이드(또는 에틸렌클로로히드린)의 양은 의
료기기에서 용출된 총 잔류량과 비슷하지 않을 수 있다.
물(참고문헌[92])은 모의사용용출에서 잔류 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린(에틸렌옥사이
드의 가수분해가 예상되는 경우, 에틸렌글리콜) 회수를 위한 용출용매로 통상적으로 사용된다. 이
러한 물은 검체 자체를 용해하는 것이 아니라 검체로부터 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물을 용출하는데 
사용된다. 만일 의료기기에 액체를 채워서 기구의 실제 사용을 모방하고자 한다면 공기방울이 생
기지 않도록 하여야 한다. 사용 시 인체와 전체 또는 부분적으로 접촉하는 제품은 37 ℃(체온)에
서 용출하고, 사용 시 직접적으로 인체 접촉이 없는 제품(예, 피하 주사기)은 25℃(실온)에서 용
출한다. 제11장(ISO 10993-12)을 참조한다. 분석을 바로 시행하지 않는 경우 용출물을 검체로부
터 분리하여 폴리테트라플루오르에틸렌 재질이 입혀져 있고, 격벽이 있는 뚜껑이 달린 용기
(PTFE-lined, septum-capped vial)에 밀봉하여 보관한다. 표준용액 또는 용출물이 담긴 용기는 
남은 윗부분이 전체부피의 10%이하이어야 한다. 용출물을 수 일간 냉장 보관할 수는 있으나(부록 
F) 용출용매로 물을 사용하였을 경우 보관하는 동안에 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리콜 또는 에틸
렌클로로히드린으로 변환되지 않도록 주의를 기울여야 한다(참고문헌 [35]). 검체를 물로 용출
하였을 때, 분석자는 분석장소에서 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리콜 또는 에틸렌클로로히드린으
로 변환될 가능성을 평가하여야 한다.
3.4.6.3 완전용출법(허용 대체방법)
3.4.6.3.1 개요
완전용출법은 대체방법으로서 유용한 정보를 제시한다. 이 방법의 결과는 환자가 받을 수 있는 양 
이상을 나타내는 경향이 있으며, 이러한 용출은 투여량에 대한 시간의 개념을 배제하였으므로 잔
류량의 측정치가 환자에게 노출된 첫 날 또는 첫째 달에 전달된 것이라고 보증할 수 없다. 그러
나 3.3항에 나타나 있는 한계치에 부합하고 완전용출에 의하여 시험된 제품에 대한 잔류량이 


- 160 -
기준에 적합할 경우, 더 이상 모의사용용출을 시행할 필요가 없다. 완전용출법을 사용할 경우 3.3
항에 명시된 최초 24시간 및 최초 30일에 대한 한계치에 특별한 주의를 기울여야 한다. 
완전용출법은 의료기기에 있는 잔류물 총량을 회수하기 위한 것이다. 에틸렌옥사이드가스 잔류량의 
결정방법은 열을 가하여 용출한 후에 용출용액에 대해 헤드스페이스 가스분석(headspace gas 
analysis)을 수행한다; 용매에 대한 헤드스페이스 가스분석(headspace gas analysis)을 수행하고 
용매의 크로마토그래피를 수행하거나 전자 포착 검출기(electron capture detector)와 같은 보다 
민감한 GC검출기로 측정되는 에틸렌옥사이드의 브롬모히드린 유도체를 준비한다.
3.4.6.3.2 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물
에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물의 용출을 위하여 여러 가지 용출용매가 사용되어 왔다. 부록 K.4.3에 제시
된 열흡수 후에 헤드스페이스 가스분석(headspace gas analysis)은 용출용매를 사용하지 않는 
방법의 한 예이다. 이런 경우 헤드스페이스 방법은 검체로부터 전체 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류량을 회
수하기 때문에 완전용출로 간주된다. 그러나 헤드스페이스 가스분석(headspace gas analysis)방
법은 대형의료기기나 복합의료기기를 그대로 시험하려고 하는 경우에는 적절하지 않다. 분석자가 
에틸렌옥사이드 총량의 회수를 위하여 폴리메틸메타크릴레이트(Poly-methylmethacrylate)와 같
은 고분자물질의 잔류량을 분석하는 경우, 헤드스페이스방법을 적용할 때 주의를 기울여야한다.
용매를 이용한 용출과정에서 용출용매는 의료기기 또는 부분품의 구성성분에 따라 적절한 것을 선
택한다. 검체로부터 에틸렌옥사이드를 완전회수하기 위해 검체를 용해시키는 용액을 사용하는 것
이 바람직하고 또한, 이 과정에서 간섭물질이 용액에 들어가지 않도록 해야 한다. 이러한 용출방법
과 헤드스페이스 가스분석(headspace gas analysis)을 결합한 방법은 부록 K.4.4에 기술되어 있
다. 이러한 방법을 이용한다면, 검체로 부터 함께 용출된 간섭물질과 에틸렌옥사이드를 분리할 수 
있다. 여러 가지 용출 용매는 실험실간 비교 실험을 통해 평가되어왔다.(참고문헌 [112], [113], 
[114])
완전용출법을 실시하는 경우에 검체를 분석함에 있어서 하나 이상의 과정을 이용하여 정량적 회
수를 검증하는 것이 바람직하다. 에틸렌옥사이드의 잔류량이 비교적 소량인 의료기기의 경우에
는 일반적으로 사용되고 있는 방법으로는 상대적으로 오랜 시간동안 용출하더라도 그 소량을 
용출할 수 없을 수도 있다.
3.4.6.3.3 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물
일반적으로 의료기기로부터 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물을 용출하는 용매로 물이 사용되며, 에틸
렌옥사이드 잔류량 분석방법과 유사한 방법을 사용한다.
3.4.7 결과 분석

4.1 일반사항
에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린의 기준에 부합하는 제품은 이 규격을 충족시킨다고 판
정한다. 잔류물 확산 운동에 대한 충분한 시험 자료가 있다면, 제조 과정과 용도, 원자재의 
유사성을 근거로 원자재들의 품질 보증 시험을 위해 의료기기를 분류할 수 있다. (부록 D 참
조)
멸균된 제품들을 출고하는 경우에는 4.2항과 4.3항에 제시된 두 가지 방법 가운데 하나를 이용
하여야 한다.
4.2 잔류물 소실 곡선 자료가 없는 제품의 출고
제품에 대한 소실 곡선 자료를 이용할 수 없는 경우에는 제품이 이 규격을 충족시키고 있고, 자료
가 부록 K에 서술되어 있는 적합한 과정에 따라 실시된 시험에서 얻어진 것이며, 3.3항에서 제시
된 에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린의 요건에 부합하고 있다면 제품을 출고할 수 있다.
4.3 잔류물 소실 곡선을 이용한 제품 출고 과정
소실 곡선은 제품 또는 유사제품군이 3.3항에 따른 잔류량 한계치에 도달하는데 걸리는 멸균 후 
시간을 추정하는데 사용된다. 제품은 사전에 결정된 멸균 후 시간과 실험에 의해 결정된 조건에 
따라 시장에 출고하여, 목표 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류량 수준이 보증될 수 있도록 하여야 한다. 부
록 D에 기술된 제품 통풍과 관련하여, 제품 통풍 시 통풍온도가 다를 경우에는 연간 다른 시점
에 격리 저장하여 통풍시킨 멸균제품의 축적된 데이터(pooling data)를 종합하여 고려한다. 소실 
곡선을 만들기 위해 실험데이터를 수집할 때에는 제품의 재멸균 및 근처의 다른 에틸렌옥사이드 
멸균 의료기기의 존재도 고려하여야 한다.
만약 다른 시기에 측정된 최소 세 개의 멸균 로트에서 데이터를 모았다면, 통제된 조건에서 제조
되고 멸균된 제품의 출고는 ISO 11135-1에 서술된 바와 같이 수행될 수 있다. 
대부분의 원자재와 의료기기에서 소실된 에틸렌옥사이드는 1차 반응 속도, 다시 말해 “(ln[EO]) α 
(멸균 후 시간)”을 따른다. 실험으로 측정된 멸균 후 시간에 따른 에틸렌옥사이드 농도의 자연로그
의 플랏(plot)은 직선을 나타낸다. 평균 회귀 직선이 최대 허용 잔류량과 교차할 때의 멸균 후 시
간을 근거로 출고하여야 한다. 이러한 접근법은 충분한 양 (멸균한 횟수)으로 멸균되지 않은 제품
인 경우 또는 소실 곡선 자료를 수집하는 동안 사용할 수 있다. 다양한 대체 방법도 있는데, 예를 
들어 소실 곡선을 정하고 이를 통해 잔류물 한계 기준이 충족된 시점 이후에 검체를 시험한다면, 
소실 곡선의 내삽 방식(interpolation)으로 멸균 이후 제품 출고를 결정할 수 있다.
소실 곡선의 특성을 확립하기 위하여 동일한 제품에 대한 자료를 최소한 세 군데에서 충분한 수의 
시점마다 수집하여 회귀 분석을 하면 제품의 허용 잔류량 한도에 관하여 계산된 95% 이상 예측
한도 (prediction limit; Lp)에서 제품을 출고할 수 있을 것이다.

부록 D에 수록된 멸균 공정 변수가 변경된 경우에는 제품 잔류량을 심사하여야 한다. 이러한 
심사에서 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류량의 수준이 증가된 것으로 나타난 경우에는 허용할 수 있는 제
품인지 확인하기 위하여  잔류물 소실 곡선을 새롭게 작성하여야 한다. 이러한 심사에서 에틸렌옥
사이드 잔류량의 수준이 감소된 것으로 나타나는 경우에는 소실 곡선을 새롭게 작성하는 것을 고
려하여야 한다.

어가 나타내는 피크 면적 반응은 피크 높이 측정보다 더 정확하다.
에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린 표준물질 준비 절차의 예가 부록 J에 정리되어 있다.
B.2 밸리데이션된 기체 크로마토그래피 방법의 기준
B.2.1 공통
에틸렌옥사이드의 용출물을 정량적으로 분석하기에 적합한 방법은 다양하다. 에틸렌옥사이드를 측
정하기 위해 완전용출 후 기체 크로마토그래피(GC)를 하는 몇몇 과정이 발표되어 왔다. 아직 발
표되지 않은 산화에틸렌 잔류량 측정 방법들도 다수 존재할 것이고, 의료기기의 다양성으로 인해 
발표된 방법들도 모든 의료기기에 적합한 것은 아니다. 따라서 이 규격에 설명되어 있는 인증된 
참조 방법들과 비교하여 평가하고, 분석적으로 조사한 방법들은 이용 가능하다. 
분석학적으로 타당하다는 것은 3.3에 제시된 잔류물 한계 기준과 관련하여, 분석하고자 하는 의료
기기의 에틸렌옥사이드 농도를 측정하기에 충분한 정확성(accuracy), 정밀성(precision), 선별성
(selectivity), 직선성(linearity), 견뢰성(ruggedness), 민감도(sensitivity)를 분석하는 방법을 갖추
고 있으며 분석 대상 의료기기에 적용할 수 있다는 의미이다.
에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물 수준을 평가하는 많은 분석 방법들이 검토되었으며

(참고문헌 참조), 분석 방법별 자세한 사항은 참고문헌을 참조한다. 분석 방법 밸리데이션과 관련
한 권장 기준은 다음과 같다.
B.2.2 정확성(Accuracy)
정확성은 시험방법으로 확보한 시험 결과가 참값과 가까운 정도를 의미한다. 정확성은 참값 대비 
백분율로 나타낸 측정값인 회수율로 표현한다. 시험방법을 적용해 측정한 값과 기지의 값(known 
value)을 비교한다. 기지의 값은 순도를 알고 있는 분석 대상 물질이나 첨가된 검체(spiked 
sample)로부터 계산된다.
검체에 첨가된 분석대상물질의 기지량의 회수율(%)로 첨가된 검체(spiked sample)의 정확성을 평
가할 수 있다. 하지만 에틸렌옥사이드의 경우에 이런 정확성 평가 방법을 적용하기란 매우 어렵
다. 이 화합물이 휘발성을 갖기 때문이다. 그러므로 측정값의 평균을 참값으로 나누어 정확성을 
나타내며 신뢰구간도 표기한다. 회수율(%)은 다음과 같이 계산할 수 있다.
R =
R o×100

규정된 범위를 포함하는 최소 3개 농도에 대하여 시험방법의 전체 조작을 최소 9회 반복 분석하
여 정확성을 평가한다(즉, 3개 농도 각각에서 3회 분석).
B.2.3 정밀성(Precision)
B.2.3.1 개요
정밀성은 동일 분석 조건에서 여러 차례 측정할 때 데이터 값의 근접성(분산정도)를 의미한다. 정
밀성은 반복성, 실험실내 정밀성(intermediate precision), 재현성 등 3개 요소로 구성된다.
B.2.3.2 반복성(repeatability)
반복성은 규정된 범위를 포함한 표준물질 농도에 대하여 최소 9회 분석하여 평가할 수 있다(즉, 
3개 농도에서 각각 3회 분석). 위의 B.2.2에 기술된 정확성 평가에서 확보한 데이터를 반복성 평
가에 활용할 수 있다.
반복성은 식 A.4에 규정된 바와 같이, 피크 면적의 상대 표준 편차(분산 계수)로 계산할 수 있다.
에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린의 % RSD는 규정된 범위에서 5%를 넘지 않아야 한다. % 
RSD는 A.4.2에 기술된 바에 따라 계산한다.
B.2.3.3 실험실내 정밀성(intermediate precision)
실험실내 정밀성은 시험방법의 정밀성에 미치는 여러 가지 요인에 대한 영향을 확인하여 평가한

다. 변동 요인으로는 시험일, 시험자, 장비 등이 있다. 이런 요인을 각각 평가할 필요는 없다. 시
험방법 확립을 위해 검토했던 자료를 활용하면 된다.
최소한 B.2.2의 정확도 평가와 같이 2개의 별도 상황에 대하여 데이터로 시험 방법의 중간 정밀도
를 평가한다. 표준 편차, 상대 표준 편차(분산 계수), 신뢰구간을 보고해야 한다.
B.2.3.4 견뢰성(ruggedness)/재현성(reproducibility)
시험방법의 견뢰성(ruggedness)은 각각 다른 실험실, 다른 시험자, 다른 장비, 다른 시약 로트, 
다른 분석 시점, 다른 분석 온도, 다른 시험일 등 다양한 조건에서 동일 검체를 분석하여 얻은 시
험 결과의 재현성 정도를 의미한다. 견뢰성(ruggedness)은 일반적으로 분석 방법의 다양한 절차 
및 환경 변수가 시험 결과에 영향을 미치지 않는다는 것으로 나타낸다. 실험실 사이, 그리고 시험
자 사이의 일반적으로 예상되는 조건 변화에 따른 시험 결과의 재현성이다.
개별 실험실에서 밸리데이션을 할 때는 새로운 칼럼이나 새로운 방법을 사용하므로, 시험자, 시험
일, 시험장비 등을 다르게 한 조건의 조합으로 견뢰성을 평가할 수 있다.  일반적으로 실험실내 
정밀성이 확립된 경우에는 재현성을 요구하지 않는다. 이러한 경우에는 실험실간 연구는 중요하지 
않다.
B.2.4 직선성(linearity)
직선성은 분석 대상 물질의 농도와 분석 결과 사이의 상호관계를 의미한다. 사용한 표준물질 범위
에 걸쳐 직선성을 확립해야 한다. 최소 5개 농도에서 표준물질 농도와 피크 면적 또는 피크 높이
를 회귀 분석한다.
기울기와 절편의 재현성과 함께, 교정 데이터의 직선성을 평가한다. 표준 곡선의 최소 상관 계수
는 0.95여야 한다.
B.2.5 분석방법 검출 한계(Method detection limit, MDL)
B.2.5.1 개요
분석 방법 검출 한계는 합리적인 신뢰도로 검출 가능한 가장 적은 양을 의미한다. 농도를 알고 있
는 분석 대상 물질이 함유된 검체를 분석하고 분석 대상 물질을 신뢰성 있게 검출할 수 있는 최
소 농도를 파악해 검출 한계를 정할 수 있다.
분석방법 검출 한계를 정하는 방법이 많다. 아래에 제시된 것 이외의 다른 방법도 가능하다.
B.2.5.2 시그널-노이즈 기반 MDL(MDL based on signal-to-noise)
농도를 알고 있는 분석 대상 물질이 함유된 검체의 측정 시그널과 공검체의 시그널을 비교하고 
분석 대상 물질을 신뢰성 있게 검출할 수 있는 최소 농도를 정하여 시그널-노이즈 비율을 결정한
다. 일반적으로 시그널-노이즈 비율이 3:1은 되어야 한다.
B.2.5.3 반응의 표준 편차 기반 MDL(MDL based on the standard deviation of the response)
예상되는 MDL 근처 농도로 분석 대상 물질 표준물질을 만들고 7번 시험하여 표준편차를 구한다.


- 171 -
MDL = s x t
(B.2)
s : 표준 편차
t : 99% 신뢰수준에서 n-1 자유도의 student t값
B.2.6 정량한계(Quantitation limit, QL)
B.2.6.1 개요
정량한계는 일반적으로 농도를 알고 있는 분석 대상 물질이 함유된 검체를 분석하고 분석 대상 
물질을 적합한 정확성과 정밀성으로 정량할 수 있는 최저 수준을 구하여 정한다.
정량한계를 정하는 방법이 많이 있다. 아래에 제시된 것 이외의 다른 방법도 가능하다.

농도를 알고 있는 분석 대상 물질이 함유된 검체의 측정 시그널과 공검체의 시그널을 비교하고 
분석 대상 물질을 신뢰성 있게 정량할 수 있는 최소 농도를 정하여 시그널-노이즈 비율을 결정한
다. 일반적으로 시그널-노이즈 비율이 10:1은 되어야 한다.
B.2.6.3 반응의 표준편차 기반 정량한계(QL based on the standard deviation of the response)
정량한계를 다음과 같이 나타낼 수 있다.
QL = 5 x MDL

의료기기 내에 함유된 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물 분석에 
본장을 적용하는 가이드라인과 흐름도
(Flowchart and guidance for the application of this part of ISO 10993 
series of standards to the determination of EO and ECH residuals in 
medical devices)
C.1 배경
에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 의료기기의 생물학적 평가에 기준규격을 적용하는 것에 관한 가이드라인을 
설명한다. 이 부록에서는 주로 적용방법을 다루지만, 기준규격의 다른 부분에 대한 가이드라인도 
일부 제시한다.
본 장은 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물의 허용 한도 기준 설정과 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 제품이 허용 한도 
기준에 부합함을 증명하는 분석 절차에 관한 기준을 규정한다. 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 의료기기에서 
에틸렌클로로히드린이 발견된 경우에는 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물의 최대 허용 한계 기준도 규
정한다. 에틸렌글리콜에 대해서는 노출 한도 기준을 정하지 않았는데, 위해 평가에서 에틸렌옥사
이드 잔류물을 관리한다면 생물학적으로 의미 있는 에틸렌글리콜 잔류물이 존재할 가능성은 없는 
것으로 나타났기 때문이다. 환자에게 가해지는 용량은 허용 한도 기준과 본장에 부합함을 보여 주
는 기준 방법을 정하는데 토대가 된다.
본장의 요구 기준 충족 이외에도 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 제품은 기준규격의 다른 부분에서 제시된 
생물학적 시험 기준을 충족해야 한다.
치료 방법의 생명 구조 특성 때문에 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 의료기기의 사용과 관련한 위해-유익성
분석이 유의미하게 달라져야 하는 경우도 있다(예, 중요한 외과 시술). 3.3에 규정된 노출 한계 기
준은 중요도가 떨어지는 상황에서의 위해-유익성분석 결과를 바탕으로 한다. 그러므로 지정 한계 
기준을 충족하기가 불가능한 치명적인 상황에서는 한계 기준의 완화가 가능하다.
이 부록에는 흐름도가 포함되어 있는데, 이 문서의 적용에 필요한 단계를 이해하는데 도움이 될 
것이다. 이 흐름도는 의사 결정 포인트를 보여 주며, 이 문서에 다른 대안들이 제시된 경우에 적
절한 조치를 선택하는 가이드라인도 제시해 준다. 일부 가이드라인은 접촉 특성, 접촉 기간, 사용 
빈도, 특수 상황(예, 3.3.6 참조), 의료기기 크기 등 다양한 요소에 근거하여 이 문서를 다른 제품
에 적용하는데 실질적인 도움이 될 수도 있다. 본문에서 흐름도의 내용을 보다 자세하게 설명한
다. 또한 표 C.1은 다양한 카테고리의 의료기기에 대한 허용 한도 기준을 간단히 정리한 것이다.
3.4항에는 에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물의 분석에 관한 기준이 제시되어 있으며, 
분석 절차는 부록 B에 기술되어 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물 분석을 위한 용출 조건은 부록 E에 


제시되어 있다. 적절한 모의 사용 용출 절차의 개발에 관한 가이드라인은 C.3에 정리되어 있다. 
이를 바탕으로 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 제품을 대상으로 한 모의 사용 용출 절차를 적절하게 개발하
고 그 근거를 문서화할 수 있을 것이다.
분석 실험실은 제품 제조업체와 긴밀하게 협력하여 모의 사용 용출 작업 조건이 예정 용도를 대
표하는 것임을 증명할 수 있어야 한다. 접촉기간 동안의 가장 엄격한 카테고리를 감안해 제품 카
테고리를 정했다고 가정하여 제품 사용 상황을 모의해야 하며, 접촉조직과 접촉 온도도 모두 고려
해야 한다.

C.3 모의 사용 용출 과정
C.3.1 용출 용매
에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물의 모의 사용에 따른 용출시에는 물을 사용한다([92] 참조).
C.3.2 용출 온도
사용 시에 인체와 전체 또는 부분적으로 접촉하는 제품은 37 ℃에서 용출하고, 사용 시에 직접적
인 인체 접촉이 없는 제품(예, 피하 주사기)은 25 ℃에서 용출한다. 제품을 37 ℃에서 용출할 때, 
에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리콜로 전환되는지 평가한다.
C.3.3 용출 시간
용출 시간을 정할 때 권장 또는 예상 제품 사용 시간 범위를 최대한 합리적이고, 최악의 경우를 
감안해 검토한다. 또한 데이터를 수집하여 C.3.2의 제품 사용 온도에서 에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌
클로로히드린이 제품에서 용출되는 속도를 평가하는 것도 도움이 된다(4.4.6.2). 이 데이터와 기타 
관련 데이터를 평가하여 적절한 용출 시간을 결정한다. 최소 용출 시간은 1시간이다.
C.3.4 용출
사용 전에 제품 전처리가 요구되는 경우, 전처리 작업을 한 후 용출한다. 용출 시에 제품을 채우
는 경우, 기포가 생기지 않도록 한다. 정해진 온도에서 정해진 시간 동안 물로 용출을 한다. 유체
(예, 혈액, 투석액)를 순환시켜 사용하는 제품의 경우, 실제 사용 상황처럼 물을 순환시켜 용출한
다. 혈액이 제품에서 환자로 되돌아간다면, 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물이 체내에 잔류한다고 가정해야 
한다. 이런 이유로 제품에서 환자로 이동하는 혈액을 모의한 물은 재순환시키지 않는다. 지정 조

제품 잔류물에 영향을 주는 요소
(Factors influencing product residual)
D.1 멸균 공정 변수
D1.1 개요
멸균 공정 변수는 ISO 11135-1에 규정되어 있다. 그러나 에틸렌옥사이드 노출 제품 중의 잔류물
을 적절하게 분석하려면, 잔류물 성분에 영향을 미치는 변수에 대해 알고 있어야 한다. 에틸렌옥
사이드 역학을 제대로 이해하면, “최악의 경우”의 분석을 통해 유사 제품군을 정해 분석하는 것도 
가능할 수 있다. 유사 제품군을 파악한다면(즉, 크기와 용도, 조성, 포장, 에틸렌옥사이드 노출, 수
분 함량, 환경 조건 노출이 유사한 제품), 각각의 품목을 분석할 필요성이 배제될 수 있다. 잔류물 
함량에 영향을 주는 변수는 다음과 같으며, 이를 바탕으로 “최악의 경우”에 해당되는 대표 검체를 
선택하여 분석할 수 있다.
D.1.2 원자재 조성
원자재에 따라 에틸렌옥사이드의 흡수, 유지, 방출 능력이 큰 차이를 보인다. 에틸렌옥사이드가 
에틸렌클로로히드린으로 전환될 수 있는 경우, 서로 다른 원자재로 만든 2개의 유사한 의료기기
은 잔류물 분석표가 크게 다를 수 있다. 예를 들어 유리 염소 이온의 발생원을 함유하는 재료는 
에틸렌클로로히드린 농도가 매우 다양할 것이다.
마찬가지로 서로 다른 2개 원자재로 구성된 단일 의료기기도 정확한 분석을 위해서는 2개의 원자
재에 대한 대표 검체가 필요할 수 있다. 일반적인 제품 사용을 모의하려는 경우에는 조성과 크기
가 특히 중요하다.
D.1.3 포장
포장 재료도 에틸렌옥사이드 기체와 기타 잔류물의 침투와 소산 능력이 매우 다양하며, 이는 다시 
에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물 수준에도 영향을 줄 수 있다. 포장 밀도와 운송 용기의 밀도도 변동성
을 유발하는 요인일 수 있다.
D.1.4 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 주기(cycle)
제품이 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출되는 공정 조건도 잔류물 수준에 영향을 준다. 기체 농도, 노출 시
간, 온도, 사이클 유형(즉, 순수 에틸렌옥사이드 또는 에틸렌옥사이드 혼합물), 습도(공급 용수의 
품질 포함), 재배출 및 공기 세척, 그리고 멸균에서의 제품 및 적재 밀도 또는 제품 적재 구성 등
이 있다.
D.1.5 통풍 (aeration)
제품 중의 잔류 에틸렌옥사이드는 통기 온도, 적재 밀도와 구성, 기류, 적재 패턴, 통기 대상 제품 
표면적과 통기 시간 등에 따라 달라질 수 있다. 통기 온도가 10℃ 증가할 때마다 통기율이 대략 


- 181 -
두 배가 되는(통기 시간은 1/2로 감소) 재료도 일부 있다.
멸균기에서 제품을 꺼낸 다음에 제품 중의 에틸렌옥사이드 함량에 따라, 습도, 온도, 기류 같은 
요소가 에틸렌클로로히드린 형성에 영향을 줄 수 있다.
시험자는 제품 보관 조건과 다른 실험실 조건에서 검체를 보관할 때, 계절에 따른 통기율 편차를 
알아야 한다. 제품이 통기 동안 보관될 가능성이 있는 곳의 최저 온도와 유사한 조건에서 시험하
기까지 검체를 보관할 필요가 있는 경우도 있는데, 이런 상황은 경험을 통해 결정한다.
D.1.6 검체 회수
멸균 공정을 완료하고 멸균 적재물에서 분석용 제품 검체를 채취할 때는 주의해야 한다. 또한 제
품 검체나 그의 용출물을 멸균 작업 장소에서 멀리 떨어진 실험실로 보낼 때도 주의해야 한다. 이
런 경우에 검체의 잔류물 함량과 나머지 적재물의 잔류물 함량 사이의 상관관계를 정하고자 할 
때 오류를 범할 가능성이 높으며, 이런 조건 사이의 관계를 실험을 통해 정해야 한다.
D.2 관리 변수 (Controlling variables)
잔류물 확산 역학에 관한 충분한 실험 증거를 바탕으로(예, 특정 제품 범위의 포장물에서 에틸렌
옥사이드 기체의 소산 속도), 재료, 제조 공정, 용도의 유사성에 의거해 제품 그룹을 정하여 QA 
시험을 적용하는 것도 가능하다. 이런 분류 시스템이 제대로 효과를 발휘하려면, 위에서 언급한 
변수들을 관리해야 한다. 변수를 관리하지 않으면, 분석한 검체에만 적용할 수 있는 잔류물 수준 
데이터만 얻게 된다.

잔류 에틸렌옥사이드 분석을 위한 용출 조건
(Extraction conditions for determination of residual EO)
이 규격에 따라 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류량을 측정하고 입증하는데 필요한 용출 조건은 3.4항에 제시
되어 있다. 
표 E.1에는 실험을 용이하게 실행할 수 있는 필요 용출 조건이 제시되어 있다.
구체적인 모의 사용 및 완전용출 방법은 3.4.6.2와 3.4.6.3을 참조한다.
에틸렌옥사이드를 측정하는데 적합한 용출 방법을 선정하는 것과 관련된 지침 원리는 본 규격의 
인체 노출에 관한 필요요건에 부합하는지 여부를 보이기 위해 가능한 한 제품사용을 모의하여 
환자에게 투여되는 양을 평가하는 것이다. 어떠한 용출 조건을 사용하는 지와는 상관없이 지속 노
출 범주에 속해 있는 의료기기는 의료기기가 제한 노출 범주의 잔류량 요건에도 부합하여야만 
하며, 또한 영구 접촉 범주에 속해있는 의료기기도 마찬가지로 지속 노출과 제한 노출 범주의 잔
류량 요건을 만족시켜야 한다는 사실에 주목하는 것이 중요하다. 완전용출법으로 시험된 제품의 
잔류량이 이들 요건 내로 나타나는 경우에는 더 이상 모의 사용 용출법을 시행하지 않아도 된다.
표 E.1 권장 용출 조건

| 의료기기 접촉기간 (4.3절 참조) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 영구 접촉 (> 30일) | 지속 노출 (24시간~30일) | 제한 노출 (< 24시간) |
| 완전용출법 | 모의 사용 용출법 | 모의 사용 용출법 |

2.2에 규정된 완전 용출 절차를 크거나 복잡한 제품에 적용하기란 불가능할 것이다. 이런 경우에
는 제품 가운데 대표 부위를 용출하고 그 결과를 전체 제품에 외삽할 필요가 있다. 3.4.6항을 참
조한다.
모의 사용 용출이 가능하지 않거나 타당하지 않은 일부 예외적인 상황에서는(예, 가운이나 드레이
프 같이 크기가 크며 표면 접촉성 제품), 예를 들어 참고문헌 [154]의 “사용별 노출” 항목에 기
술된 전달 감소율 방식을 사용해 중량 또는 표면적 비례 방법으로 환자에게 전달되는 에틸렌옥사
이드 용량을 추정할 수 있다.

이 규격에서 제시된 기준의 배경
(Rationale for the provisions of this part of ISO 10993)
F.1 공통
이 부록에서는 접촉 기간에 근거하여 의료기기 중에 존재하는 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 잔류물의 허용 
한도 기준 설정의 근거를 제시한다. 또한 에틸렌옥사이드, 에틸렌클로로히드린, 에틸렌글리콜 한
계 기준 설정의 근거를 설명한다.
F.2 특수 상황
F.2.1 일반사항
생명을 구조해야 하는 치료방법 특성 때문에 위해-유익성분석이 유의미하게 달라져야 하는 경우
도 있다(예, 중요한 외과 시술). 지정 노출 한계 기준은 중요도가 떨어지는 상황에서의 위해-유익
성분석 결과를 바탕으로 한다. 그러므로 제16장(ISO 10993-17)은 각각의 상황을 감안하여 허용 
한도 기준의 조정을 허용한다. 지정 한계 기준을 충족하기가 불가능한 치명적인 상황에서는 한계 
기준의 완화가 가능하다. 마찬가지로 특정 상황에서의 위해를 감안하여 필요하다면 허용 한도 기
준의 강화가 필요할 수 있다.
본장을 만들 때 제품 자체의 한계 때문에 3.3절의 허용 한도 기준을 적용하기 어렵거나 3.3의 용
량 수준이 적용되지 않는 것으로 나타난 인체 대상 실험 데이터가 있는 6가지 특수 상황이 파악
되었다. 이런 인체 데이터 중 하나가 환자의 인공수정체(IOL, intraocular lens) 노출과 관련된 것
으로, 이들 제품의 잔류물 기준을 수정할 필요가 있다. 이외 에도 헌혈자와 환자 혈액 수집에 사
용되는 혈액 세포 분리기는 여러 차례 사용될 수 있으며, 헌혈자와 환자는 에틸렌옥사이드에 민감
해지는 것으로 나타났다. 이런 감작 가능성을 최소화하기 위하여 이들 제품의 에틸렌옥사이드 허
용 한도 기준을 낮추어야 한다. 심폐우회 장치나 혈액 분리기 또는 산소발생기로 혈액을 처리할 
때, 의학적 이득이 위해보다 더 큰 것으로 파악되었고, 이들 제품의 허용 단기 한계 기준을 정할 
때도 이런 부분을 고려했다. 체외 혈액 정화 장치인 경우, 장기 사용에 따라 일생 동안의 최대 용
량 기준이 초과될 가능성이 있으며, 이 부분도 고려해야 한다. 완전한 피부와 접촉하는 드레이프
인 경우, 전신 독성은 없는 것으로 예상되며, 허용접촉한계(TCL)나 자극 시험 기준을 충족하면 
환자 안전이 적절하게 보장되어야 한다.
F.2.2 인공수정체(IOL, intraocular lens) 한계 기준
인공수정체를 포함한 눈에 사용되는 이식성 제품들의 잔류물 한계 기준은 0.5 μg 에틸렌옥사이드
/렌즈/일이다. 이 한계 기준은 영구 접촉 기준을 바탕으로 하지 않는데, 영구 접촉 기준은 평생 동
안 일일 평균 용량이 0.1 ㎎(100 μg)/일이다. 이 경우는 영구 접촉 최대 노출량이 일일 접촉량을 
초과하지 못하는 특수한 경우이다. 에틸렌옥사이드에 따른 안 조직의 자극 반응을 방지하기 위해 
이런 수준의 기준이 필요하다. 참고문헌 [43], [116], [117], [143], [164] 참조). 다른 안과 제


- 184 -
품의 비례 배분 한계 기준은 인공수정체의 질량을 20 ㎎으로 하여 제품의 질량에 근거해 정한다.
이 문서에 규정된 바에 따라 안과 제품을 상대로 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물을 관리한다면, 유의미한 
양의 에틸렌클로로히드린이 존재할 가능성은 적다. 하지만 염소를 함유한 점탄성 재료로 만든 안
과 제품은 그렇지 않을 수 있다. 참고문헌 [43], [115], [116], [117]에 의하면, 안과 독성을 유
발하는 에틸렌클로로히드린의 수준은 해당 에틸렌옥사이드 수준보다 약 4배 더 크다. 이런 제품
과 관련하여 에틸렌클로로히드린 수준의 적합성을 평가할 때는 이 부분을 고려해야 한다.
F.2.3 헌혈자 또는 환자 혈액 수집에 사용되는 혈액 세포 분리기
최대 허용 에틸렌옥사이드 한계 기준은 10 ㎎/제품이다. 최대 허용 에틸렌클로로히드린 한계 기준
은 22 ㎎/의료기기를 넘지 않아야 한다. 이들 제품은 성분채집술(apheresis collection)에 사용된
다. 이 한계 기준은 제품이 개별 헌혈자나 환자를 상대로 여러 차례 사용되는 것을 감안하여 정하
였다.
이 경우에 5개 제품이 동시에 사용된다는 기본 가정은 약간 보수적으로 보였다. 합리적으로 예상
되는 최악의 경우로써 2개 제품만을 가정한다면, 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF)는 0.2에서 0.5로 증가
된다. 그에 따라 허용 한도 기준은 10 ㎎ 에틸렌옥사이드(10.5 ㎎을 버림처리)가 된다. 식 F.1과 
F.2를 참조한다.

(F.2)
F.2.4 혈액 산소발생기 및 혈액 분리기
이들 제품의 노출 한계 기준은 24시간 동안 에틸렌옥사이드가 60 ㎎이고 에틸렌클로로히드린이 
45 ㎎이다. 이들 제품은 심장 수술 같은 매우 중요한 수술 작업에 사용된다. 일생동안 환자는 1
회 또는 2회 정도 이 수술을 받는다. 이들 제품은 1일 이내의 기간 동안 사용되므로, 기본 의료기
기 활용 인자(UTF) 0.2는 너무 보수적으로 보인다. 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF) 1.0이 보다 합리적
이라 할 수 있다. 이 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF)에서 허용 한도 기준은 에틸렌옥사이드가 21 ㎎, 
에틸렌클로로히드린이 45 ㎎으로 증가된다. 식 F.3과 F.4를 참조한다. 에틸렌옥사이드 한계 기준
은 이들 제품에서 에틸렌옥사이드를 제거하는 제조업체의 능력을 감안한 것이다. 이런 상황에서 
에틸렌옥사이드 한계 기준을 3배 더 완화할 수도 있다.

(F.4)
1일 이하 사용 가정: 44.8 ㎎/d x 1d = 44.8 ㎎/제품
F.2.5 심폐우회술(cardiopulmonary bypass procedures)에 사용되는 제품
이들 제품의 노출 한계는 에틸렌옥사이드의 경우 24시간 동안 20 ㎎이다. 이들 제품은 심장 수술 
같은 매우 중요한 수술 작업에 사용된다. 일생동안 환자는 1회 또는 2회 정도 이 수술을 받는다. 
이들 제품은 1일 이내의 기간 동안 사용되므로, 기본 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF) 0.2는 너무 보수
적으로 보인다. 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF) 1.0이 보다 합리적이라 할 수 있다. 이 의료기기 활용 
인자(UTF)에서 허용 한도 기준은 에틸렌옥사이드가 21 ㎎으로 증가된다. 에틸렌옥사이드 한계 
기준은 다소 큰 이들 제품에서 에틸렌옥사이드를 제거하는 제조업체의 능력을 감안한 것이다. 이
런 상황에서 에틸렌옥사이드 한계 기준을 3배 더 완화할 수도 있다. 에틸렌클로로히드린 한계 기
준을 적용한다.

(F.5)
주: 이들 제품의 경우에 20 ㎎/d로 반올림한다.
1일 이하 사용 가정: 20 ㎎/d x 1d = 20 ㎎/제품
F.2.6 체외 혈액 정화 장치
이 제품은 몇 년 동안 여러 차례 사용된다. 이들 제품의 허용 한도 기준을 정할 때는 혈액 정화에 
따른 이득을 고려한다. 환자가 사용하는 각 제품의 최대 허용 한도 기준은 매월 13개 제품을 사
용한다고 가정하고 30일 동안 최대 허용 한도 기준의 1/13을 최대 허용 한도로 하여 설정했다. 
즉 에틸렌옥사이드는 4.6 ㎎이고 에틸렌클로로히드린은 4.6 ㎎이다. 일생 동안 최대 허용 에틸렌
옥사이드 용량 2.5 g을 초과할 수 있는데, 다만 매 사용 시의 에틸렌옥사이드 허용 한도 기준인 
4.6 ㎎은 충족해야 한다. 또한 일생 동안 최대 허용 에틸렌클로로히드린 용량 10 g을 초과할 수 
있는데, 다만 매 사용 시의 에틸렌클로로히드린 허용 한도 기준인 4.6 ㎎은 충족해야 한다. 일생 
동안의 에틸렌옥사이드 용량 기준인 2.5 g을 초과하려면, 혈액 정화를 받는 환자는 매월 13차례
에 걸쳐 4.6 ㎎ 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출될 필요가 있고, 이런 노출이 3.5년 동안 계속되어야 한다. 
마찬가지로 말기 신장질환 환자가 약 14년 동안 노출되어야 평생 동안의 에틸렌클로로히드린 노
출 한계 기준을 초과할 수 있다.


- 186 -
에틸렌옥사이드의 경우
- 평생 용량 2.5 g = 2,500 ㎎
- 매월 체외 혈액 정화 장치 13개 사용에 따른 최대 허용 에틸렌옥사이드 용량은 60 ㎎이다.
- 그러므로 이 제품 사용 시에 최대 허용 평생 에틸렌옥사이드 용량에 도달하려면 2,500 ㎎/(60 
㎎/월) = 42개월, 즉 약 3.5년이 걸린다.
에틸렌클로로히드린의 경우
- 평생 용량 10 g = 10,000 ㎎
- 매월 체외 혈액 정화 장치 13개 사용에 따른 최대 허용 에틸렌클로로히드린 용량은 60 ㎎이다.
- 그러므로 이 제품 사용 시에 최대 허용 평생 에틸렌클로로히드린 용량에 도달하려면 10,000 
㎎/(60 ㎎/월) = 167개월, 즉 약 14년이 걸린다.
F.2.7 완전한 피부와 접촉하는 드레이프
완전한 피부와 접촉하는 드레이프는 최소 수준의 위해로 환자에게 이득을 제공한다. 감염성 인자
가 환자에게 전파되거나 환자로부터 전파되는 사태를 최소화하기 위해 외과용 드레이프를 사용하
며, 그에 따라 수술 이후의 감염증 감소에 기여한다. 완전한 피부와 접촉하는 의료기기는 전신 독
성을 유발하지 않는 것으로 나타났다. 에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용접촉한계
(TCL)값은 국소 독성 영향을 기반으로 한다. 그러므로 에틸렌옥사이드 허용접촉한계(TCL)값 10 
μg/cm2과 에틸렌클로로히드린 허용접촉한계(TCL)값 5 ㎎/cm2 또는 제9장(ISO 10993-10)에 따라 
시험할 때 무시할 수 있는 수준의 자극은 완전한 피부와 접촉하는 드레이프의 한계 기준으로 적절하다.
F.3 3.4절의 근거
F.3.1 공통
3.4절의 주요 부분 각각에 대하여 일반적인 근거와 배경 정보를 설명한다.
F.3.2 제품 용출
에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 잔류물 관리에 있어서 핵심 변수는 환자나 사용자가 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 
제품 사용에 따라 노출될 수 있는 용량이다. 이러한 환자 또는 사용자 용량을 평가하기 위해, 정
상적인 제품 사용 상황을 모의한 용출 절차가 요구된다. 제품을 물로 채워 용출하는 간단한 방법
도 있지만, 지속적으로 용출 용액을 흘려주는 방법을 포함하여 보다 복잡한 모의 기법이 요구되는 
경우도 있다. 완전 용출 방법으로 제품에 존재하는 잔류물 전체를 분석하여 요구 기준에 충족함을 
보여 준다면, 제품 사용을 모의한 시험은 필요하지 않을 수도 있다.
마지막 용출액 중의 분석 대상 물질 함량이 검체의 첫 용출액 중에 존재하는 분석 대상 물질 함
량의 10 % 미만이 될 때까지 용출을 계속해야 한다는 개념이 완전 용출의 용어정의에 포함되어 
있다. 하지만 잔류물이 매우 적은 제품이나 매우 느린 속도로 잔류물을 방출하는 검체와 같이, 첫 
용출액 중의 분석 대상 물질 함량이 매우 적은 경우에는 이 개념을 적용할 수 없다. 이런 경우에
는 분석 불확도를 감안할 때 여러 용출 단계를 거쳐 용출된 분석 대상 물질의 누적 총량이 느리
게 증가할 때까지 용출을 계속해야 한다.


- 187 -
F.3.3 분석방법
F.3.3.1 에틸렌옥사이드 용액의 안정성
자체적으로 안정성 실험을 실시하여 에틸렌옥사이드 잔류물 표준물질의 유효기간을 정해야 한다. 
밸리데이션된 안정성 유효기간의 마지막 날에 최초 농도의 지정 백분율 이상이어야 유효한 표준
물질이라 할 수 있다. 아니면 모든 표준물질을 매일 만든다.
K.4.4에 기술된 에틸렌옥사이드 방법을 여러 실험실이 참여하여 비교 연구할 때(참고문헌 [140] 
참조), 에틸렌옥사이드 표준물질의 에탄올 용액을 상대로 안정성 실험을 실시했다. 25 μg/㎖, 50 
μg/㎖, 100 μg/㎖ 농도의 에틸렌옥사이드 표준액을 만들고 냉장 온도와 40℃에서 보관했다. 이 
용액을 최대 6주 동안 여러 시점에 분석했다. 50 μg/㎖과 100 μg/㎖ 표준액은 40℃에서 2주 보
관 시에 에틸렌옥사이드 농도가 최초 농도 대비 70% 수준까지 감소했으며, 냉장 온도(5℃)에서 
보관했을 때는 60일까지 모든 표준물질이 최초 농도 대비 10% 수준의 안정성을 나타냈다.
F.3.3.2 에틸렌클로로히드린 용액의 안정성
여러 실험실이 참여한 에틸렌클로로히드린 비교 연구 이전에, 11개 실험실이 에틸렌클로로히드린 
표준물질의 안정성 실험에 참여했다. 1개 실험실에서 에틸렌클로로히드린 수성 용액을 조제하여 
모든 참여 실험실에 배포했다. 접수한 이 용액을 냉장 보관했다. 여러 시점(예, 도착 즉시, 도착 
이후 1주, 2주, 3주, 4주, 8주, 12주 시점)에 다양한 칼럼을 사용하여 이 용액을 분석했다. 첫 2
주 동안은 유의미한 농도 변화가 나타나지 않았다. 결국 냉장 보관 시에 최소 14일 동안은 에틸
렌클로로히드린 표준액이 안정하다는 결론을 내렸다.
F.3.3.3 표준 곡선의 선형성
4.3절의 한계 기준에 부합하는데 필요한 여러 농도 범위에 걸쳐 이 규격에 기술된 절차를 적용할 
수 있어야 할 것이다. 분석방법 정밀도, 검출한계, 정량한계, 검량선의 선형성을 밸리데이션해야 
한다.
F.3.4 3.4.7.1절, 데이터 분석 및 해석의 근거
데이터를 적절하게 처리하여 제품 잔류물 수준을 계산하고 이를 통해 환자의 노출 용량을 구할 
수 있어야 한다. 그래야 4.3절의 기준에 부합함을 판단하고 제품을 출하할 수 있다.

에틸렌옥사이드 허용 한도 기준 설정
(Establishment of allowable limits for EO)
G.1 공통
제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 기술된 방법을 토대로 에틸렌옥사이드의 제한, 장기, 영구 허용 흡입량
(TI, tolerable intake) 값을 도출했다. 다양한 노출 경로별로 별도의 허용 흡입량 값을 계산하지 
않았다. 이렇게 계산한 에틸렌옥사이드 허용 흡입량 값을 허용 한도 기준과 제품 한계 기준값으로 
전환하고, 개정 전 본장의 한계 기준과 비교했다. 제한 노출 카테고리인 경우, 허용 흡입량(TI)값
과 이 문서에 제시된 평가 방법으로 도출한 해당 제품 한계 기준을 수용했다. 장기 및 영구 접촉 
카테고리인 경우, 허용 흡입량(TI)값과 이 문서에 제시된 평가 방법으로 도출한 해당 제품 한계 
기준은 더 높은 수준을 뒷받침하지만, 개정 전 문서에 기술된 기존 한계 기준을 유지했다. 현행 
기준을 유지한 이유는 제조업체가 이 기준을 충족할 수 있고 개정 전 문서의 채택 이후 임상 성
과도 좋은 것으로 나타났기 때문이다. 그러므로 장기 및 영구 카테고리 제품의 기존 한계 기준을 
이 문서에 제시된 평가 방법에 따라 도출된 수준으로 높일 임상적 이유나 제조 관련 이유는 없다.
제한/지속 노출 카테고리의 허용 흡입량값(0.3 ㎎/㎏/d)은 참고문헌 [82], [83], [84], [169], 
[170], [171]의 결과를 바탕으로 도출했다. 이들 연구 데이터는 전에도 에틸렌옥사이드의 장기 
노출 한계 기준을 뒷받침하는데 사용되었다. 개인간 편차를 감안하여 30의 불확정 인자 1(UF1)과 
종간 역가 차이를 감안하여 1의 불확정 인자 2(UF2)를 바탕으로 변경 인자(MF, modifying 
factor) 30을 상기 데이터에 적용했다. 불확정 인자 1(UF1)과 불확정 인자 2(UF2)의 값을 선정
한 이유도 타당했다.
영구 노출 카테고리의 허용 흡입량(0.02 ㎎/㎏/d)은 암 영향을 바탕으로 도출했으며, 인체 데이터
의 용량-반응 모델링을 활용했다. 또한 암 기반 허용 흡입량값 도출을 위해 다른 암 위험 평가 
방법도 조사했다. 60의 변경 인자(MF)와 원숭이(cynomolgus monkey)의 에틸렌옥사이드 장기 
흡입 노출 이후 정자형성(spermatogenesis)에 미친 부정적 영향(참고문헌 [107], [108], [109] 
참조)에 근거하여 영구 비종양성 종점 허용 흡입량을 0.03 ㎎/㎏/d로 정할 수 있다. 영구 노출 비
종양성 종점 허용 흡입량 설정에 사용한 변경 인자(MF)에는 LOAEL-NOAEL 외삽을 위한 UF3
도 포함된다.
G.2 서론
개정 전 문서 이후로, 에틸렌옥사이드가 사람과 실험동물에 미치는 부정적 영향에 관한 새로운 데
이터가 많이 발표되었다. 또한 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드 반응 변동성과 사람과 실험동물의 에
틸렌옥사이드에 대한 상대 민감성 평가에 있어서 불확도를 줄일 수 있는 데이터도 나왔다. 또한 
에틸렌옥사이드 노출에 따른 위험을 보다 정확하게 평가하는데 도움이 되는 새로운 도구(예, 벤치
마크 용량과 생리 기반 약력학적 모델링)도 개발되었다. 이 위험 평가는 이 규격에 사용된 허용 
흡입량의 선정에 있어서 토대 역할을 한다.


G.3 방법
G.3.1 공통
제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 기술된 방법으로 각종 노출 기간 동안의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 허용 
흡입량값을 도출했다.
의료기기에서 방출된 에틸렌옥사이드에 환자가 단기 또는 장기간 노출될 가능성이 존재한다. 그러
므로 이 화합물에 대하여 제한/지속 및 영구 허용 흡입량(TI)을 도출할 필요가 있었다. 또한 다양
한 노출 경로를 통해 환자가 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출될 가능성도 있다. 일반적으로 임상 상황에서 
비경구 노출 경로를 통해 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출되지만, 관련 데이터가 거의 없어 이 노출 경로에 
대하여 허용 흡입량(TI) 값을 도출할 수 없다. 반면 실험동물과 사람의 흡입 노출에 따른 에틸렌
옥사이드의 영향과 관련된 데이터는 상당히 많다. 이 풍부한 흡입 독성 데이터를 비경구 노출 경
로에 따른 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI) 값을 도출하는데 활용하기 위하여, 경로간 외삽으로 
흡입 노출 이후의 내부 용량 추정 방법이 개발되었다.
G.3.2 경로간 용량 외삽
에틸렌옥사이드를 상대로 많은 독성 실험이 실시되었으나, 비경구 노출 경로와 관련된 데이터는 
거의 없다. 그럼에도 불구하고 흡입 노출 이후 에틸렌옥사이드의 흡수 정도는 알 수 있다. 그러므
로 에틸렌옥사이드 노출 농도에 관한 정보와 에틸렌옥사이드가 호흡기를 통해 흡수되는 정도에 
근거하여 내부 에틸렌옥사이드 용량을 추정하는 것이 가능하다.
또한 노출 농도, 노출된 동물 종의 환기율, 노출 기간, 흡입 경로를 통한 흡수 정도를 바탕으로 
흡수 용량을 추정할 수 있다. 참고문헌 [186]과 [22]의 데이터를 활용하여 다양한 노출 농도에서
의 공기 중 에틸렌옥사이드의 상대 흡수 추정치를 구했다[표 G.1].

G.3.3 비종양성 위험 평가 방식
에틸렌옥사이드의 비종양성 영향에 대한 허용 흡입량(TI)값은 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 
반응 변동성(UF1), 종별 역가 차이(UF2), 데이터 결함(UF3) 데이터를 감안한 불확정 인자(UF: 
uncertainty factor)로 핵심 실험에서 확보된 가장 관련성이 큰 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준
(NOAEL) 
또는 
최소한으로 
관찰된 
부작용 
수준(LOAEL)을 
나누어 
구했다. 
제16장(ISO 
- 189 -

- 190 -
10993-17)은 허용 흡입량을 도출할 때 가능하면 과학적 데이터를 활용하여 주요 독성 실험 데이
터에 적용할 불확정 인자를 구해야 한다고 강조한다. 이 원칙에 따라 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드
에 대한 반응 변동성 데이터와 종별 에틸렌옥사이드 역가 차이에 관한 데이터를 활용하여 각기 불
확정 인자 1(UF1)과 불확정 인자 2(UF2)의 값을 구했다. 불확정 인자 1(UF1) 값의 선정 시에 고
려한 요소로는 사람 집단에서 에틸렌옥사이드를 대사하는 효소의 다형성 발현, 각종 질병 상태에 
의한 이들 효소의 작용 저해, 그리고 DNA 손상의 보수 능력 차이가 있다. 이들 요소를 고려한 결
과, 일반적으로 이 변수에 적용하는 기본값인 10보다 큰 불확정 인자 1(UF1)이 설정되었다. 이와 
달리 과학적 데이터와 PBPK(physiologically based pharmacokinetic) 모델링 결과에 따르면, 에
틸렌옥사이드 역가는 종간에 거의 차이가 없으며, 그러므로 이 변수에 대해 일반적으로 사용되는 
기본값이 10인 반면에 10 미만의 값이 불확정 인자 2(UF2)로 적절한 것으로 나타났다.
G.3.4 암에 대한 위험평가 접근방식
WOE(weight of evidence) 시험을 적용한 결과, 에틸렌옥사이드는 유전독성 발암원이며 동물에서 
나타난 종양이 사람과도 관련이 있다고 볼 수 있다. 제16장(ISO 10993-17)은 유전독성 발암물질
에 대하여 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI) 값을 도출할 때 다양한 접근 방식을 검토하도록 권장한
다. 그에 따라 여러 가지 방법, 즉 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)의 단순 선형 외삽, 최
소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)에 불확정 인자(UF) 값 적용, 그리고 용량-반응 모델링 적
용으로 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI)을 도출하였다.
G.3.5 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI)값 도출 시에 고려하지 않은 영향
발암성이나 비종양성 영향에 근거한 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI)은 과민반응과 과민증 같은 
면역학적 영향이나 용혈 현상 같은 영향을 방지하기 위한 것이 아니다. 에틸렌옥사이드 노출과 관
련된 이런 영향으로부터 환자를 보호하려면 다른 접근 방식이 필요할 수 있다.
G.4 에틸렌옥사이드의 비종양성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI)값
G.4.1 개요
에틸렌옥사이드의 비종양성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI)값을 다음과 같이 도출했다.
- 참고문헌에서 적절한 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)과 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준
(LOAEL)값 선정
- 사람 집단의 개인별 변동성, 종간 역가 차이, 데이터 결함을 감안한 불확정 인자 선정
이 단계를 각기 G.4.2와 G.4.3에서 설명한다.
G.4.2 핵심 시험 자료의 선정
G.4.2.1 제한/장기 노출 카테고리
에틸렌옥사이드의 제한 노출 카테고리 허용 흡입량(TI)을 정하는데 필요한 단일 용량 독성 데이터
를 확보하지 못했다. 하지만 제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 의하면, 성분의 전반적인 독성 프로파일을 
이해할 때는 모든 가용 데이터를 고려해야 한다. 기본적인 접근 방식은 급성 데이터(예, 14일 미


만 연구 데이터)를 토대로 제한 노출 또는 단기 한계 기준을 정하는 것이다.
그러므로 장기 실험 데이터를 활용하여 제한 노출 카테고리 허용 흡입량(TI)을 정했다.
표 G.2는 제한/지속 노출 카테고리의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 허용 흡입량(TI)을 도출하는데 가장 
관련성이 있는 데이터를 요약한 것이다. 하지만 표에 정리된 것 이외의 많은 연구 자료를 허용 흡
입량(TI) 설정 시에 검토하였다.

정) 용량의 에틸렌옥사이드를 개에게 피하 주사한 연구 결과를 보고했다. 하지만 사용 동물의 수가 
적어 이 결과를 제한/지속 허용 흡입량(TI) 설정에 활용할 수 없었다.

않았다. 참고문헌 [22]의 연구에서 확보된 흡수 용량 데이터를 활용하여, 참고문헌 [169]의 33

보아 제한/장기 노출 카테고리 허용 흡입량(TI)을 토대로 이 값을 보다 신뢰성 있게 사용할 수 있다.

영구 노출 카테고리
Lynch
[107]
의 연구 결과에 의하면, 실험동물을 에틸렌옥사이드에 장기 흡입 노출시킨 다음의 부정
적 비종양성 영향 발생과 관련된 최저 흡수 용량은 2.0 ㎎/㎏/d이다. 원숭이(cynomolgus 
monkey)를 0 ppm 에틸렌옥사이드, 50 ppm 에틸렌옥사이드, 또는 100 ppm 에틸렌옥사이드에 
24개월 동안 1일 7시간, 1주 5일간 노출시켰다. 이때 대조군과 비교하여 에틸렌옥사이드 노출군에
서 정자수와 정자 활동성의 통계학적으로 유의미한 감소가 나타났다.

수되는 에틸렌옥사이드 백분율이 랫드와 원숭이 모두 동일하다는 가정을 근거로, 50 ppm 에틸렌
옥사이드 노출 이후 흡수 용량은 다음과 같다.
50 ppm x 1.8 ㎎/m
3
/ppm x 0.83 m
3
/d x 7/24 x 5/7 x 0.68/5.3 ㎏ = 2.0 ㎎/㎏/d
Lynch의 연구에서 나타난 정자수와 활동성에 미치는 영향은 에틸렌옥사이드 노출 사람[5]에서 
나타난 영향과 실험동물에서의 기타 정자 변수 관련 데이터(예, 참고문헌 [128])와도 일치한다. 
또한 정자수, 활동성, 또는 형태의 통계학적 유의미한 감소는 노출 한계 기준 설정 시에 부정적 
영향으로 간주한다(참고문헌 [126]과 [188]). 마지막으로 원숭이 실험 결과가 사람과는 연관성이 
없다고 볼만한 이유는 없다. 그러므로 참고문헌 [107]의 결과를 활용하여 비종양성 영향에 근거
한 영구 주사 허용 흡입량(TI)을 도출하는 방법은 유효하다.
G.4.3 비종양성 영향의 불확정 인자 선정
표 G.3 참조.
            표 G.3 허용 흡입량(TI) 도출 시의 불확정 인자

| 불확정 인자 | 범위 | 기본 UF 수준 | 설명 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UF1, 사람 집단의 개인별 편차 | 1-10 | 10 | 민감 아집단 가운데 일부의 반응과 건강한 집단 의 평균 사이의 반응 편차. |
| UF2, 종간 외삽 (inter-species extrapolation) | 1-10 | 10 | 사람이 실험동물보다 특정 화합물에 따른 부정적 영향에 더 민감할 가능성. |
| UF3, 실험 데이터의 품질과 관련성 | 1-100 | 없음 | NOAEL 값의 부재, 장기 실험에서 구한 NOAEL의 부재, 임상적 연관 노출 경로 데이터 의 결여를 포함하여, 허용 흡입량(TI) 도출에 활용할 수 있는 독성 데이터의 한계. |

G.4.3.1 개인별 편차에 대한 불확정 인자 1(UF1)
G.4.3.1.1개요
제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 따르면, 불확정 인자 1(UF1)의 수준을 정할 때 실제 데이터를 확보하
여 사람 편차를 평가하는 것이 바람직하다. 다행스럽게도 사람 집단, 특히 직업 코호트에서 각종 
바이오마커의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 반응 변동성 데이터를 확보할 수 있었다. 예를 들어 
Fuchs[54]는 말초 단핵 혈액 세포의 DNA 단일 가닥 DNA 파손에 대한 에틸렌옥사이드 노출 작
업자의 “뚜렷한 개인별 민감성 차이”를 관찰했다. 이들은 직업적으로 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 작
업자를 2개 아집단으로 구분했는데, “고민감성” 그룹과 “저민감성” 그룹이 그것이다. 저민감성 그
룹 가운데 비흡연자의 경우, DNA 단일 가닥 파손과 관련된 최저 에틸렌옥사이드 농도(4시간 
TWA)는 3.5 ㎎/m
3
이었다. 고민감성 그룹 가운데 비흡연자의 DNA 단일 가닥 파손과 관련된 최
저 에틸렌옥사이드 농도는 0.6 ㎎/m
3
이었다. 그러므로 “고민감성” 그룹의 민감성 개인을 이 유전 
독성 영향으로부터 보호하려면, 적어도 6(3.6/0.6)의 불확정 인자 1(UF1) 값이 필요하다. 이와 같
은 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 반응 변동성과 관련된 요소가 다양할 수 있는데, 에틸렌옥사이드 대사
를 책임지는 효소의 다형성 발현(GST(glutathione transferase)의 테타 1 이종형과 EH(epoxide 
- 192 -

- 193 -
hydrolase)과 DNA 수리 메커니즘의 변동성이 그 예이다. 또한 일반 집단에 비하여 에틸렌옥사이
드의 부정적 영향에 대한 중증 질환자나 상해자의 민감성을 증가시킬 수 있는 요소도 있는데, 에
틸렌옥사이드의 독성 제거에 중요한 역할을 하는 대사성 효소의 저해와 효소 반응 발생에 필수적
인 보조 인자(예, 글루타치온) 수준의 감소가 그런 것이다. 그에 따라 일반 집단에서의 에틸렌옥사
이드 반응 변동성은 환자 집단의 반응 변동성을 반영한다고 보기 어렵다. 그러므로 직업적으로 에
틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 건강한 성인 집단의 반응 변동성([54] 참조)은 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 
환자 집단의 변동성을 과소 반영한다고 볼 수 있다.
민감성 아집단을 적절하게 보호할 수 있는 불확정 인자 1(UF1)를 파악하기 위해, 에틸렌옥사이드 
노출 관련 부정적 영향에 대한 사람 집단의 변동성에 기여하는 요소 각각을 아래에서 살펴본다. 
G.4.3.1.2 에틸렌옥사이드 독성 제거 효소의 다형성
G.4.3.1.2.1 일반 사항
에틸렌옥사이드는 사람과 설치류에서 2가지 효소(GSTT1(theta 1 isoform of glutathione 
transferase)와 EH(epoxide hydrolase)에 의해 대사되어 독성이 제거된다. 이 두 효소는 모두 사
람 집단에서 여러 형태로 발현된다.(예, 참고문헌 [182], [183], [184]) 이러한 다형성의 결과로 
사람 집단 가운데 일부는 나머지 집단에 비하여 에틸렌옥사이드 대사 능력이 적다. 에틸렌옥사이
드의 독성이 이들 효소에 의해 제거되므로, 에틸렌옥사이드의 대사 능력이 떨어지는 사람은 다른 
사람에 비해 부정적 영향을 받을 위험이 커진다고 예상할 수 있다. 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드에 
대한 반응 변동성에서 GSTT1 다형성이 미치는 영향에 중점을 두어 검토했다.(예, 참고문헌 
[50]) 하지만 에틸렌옥사이드는 기본적으로 사람에서 EH에 의해 대사되므로, GSTT1 다형성은 
사람 집단의 반응 변동성에 유의미한 수준의 영향을 주지 않으리라고 가정할 수 있다. 사람에서 
에틸렌옥사이드 대사와 관련한 EH의 중요한 역할에도 불구하고, EH 다형성이나 저해가 에틸렌옥
사이드 대사에 미치는 영향과 그에 따라 에틸렌옥사이드 노출에 의한 위해에 거의 관심을 기울이
지 않았다. GSTT1과 EH의 다형성이 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 반응에 미치는 영향은 
G.4.3.1.2.2와 G.4.3.1.2.3에서 살펴본다.
G.4.3.1.2.2 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 반응 변동성에서 GSTT1 다형성의 역할
GSTT1 결손 유전형(null genotype) 발생 빈도는 일부 집단의 경우에 최대 54%까지이나(참고문
헌 [6]), 대다수 논문은 집단에 따라 17%-25% 범위(예, 참고문헌 [158])의 값을 제시한다. 
GSTT1 결손 유전형은 GSTT1 효소 활성 감소와 관련이 있으므로 에틸렌옥사이드 관련 부정적 
영향을 보일 위험이 큰 사람이 상당한 비율을 차지한다.
GSTT1 결손 유전형은 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 사람에서 헤모글로빈 부가체 수준에 특이적인 
영향을 준다(표 G.4 참조).


표 G.4 접합 집단과 비접합 집단에서 
GSTT1 다형성이 헤모글로빈 부가체 수준에 미치는 영향

| 연구 자료 | GSTT1+와 GSTT1 결손 집단 사이의 반응 차이 평균 |
| --- | --- |
| [53] | 3 |
| [130] | 2 |
| [182] | 1.5 |
| [50] | 1.5 |
| [205] | 2.1 |

표 G.4의 결과를 감안하면, GSTT1 결손 유전형 집단의 내부 에틸렌옥사이드 용량이 1.5배 ∼ 3
배 더 크다고 볼 수 있다. 하지만 두 집단 사이의 평균 차이를 비교하는 것으로는 GSTT1 결손 집
단의 하한 백분위수와 GSTT1+의 평균 반응과 관련된 용량 사이의 차이를 과소평가하게 될 수 
있다.
에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 사람의 헤모글로빈 부가체 수준에 따른 GSTT1 발현의 의존성이 이 데
이터에서 명확히 나타나지만, GSTT1 다형성이 SCE의 유도에 미치는 영향에 관한 데이터는 복합
적이다. Hallier
[64]
는 GSTT1 결손 상태인 사람의 말초 림프구에서 SCE의 유도는 GSTT1보다 훨
씬 크다고 보고했다. 하지만 Schroder
[163]
와 Wiencke
[202]
는 GSTT1 유전형인 사람과 비교하여 
GSTT1 결손인 사람의 기본 SCE 수준은 매우 미미한 증가를 보였다고 보고했다. 이들 결과를 종
합하면, GSTT1 다형성은 헤모글로빈 부가체 수준의 증가로 이어지나, 비접합 집단에서는 에틸렌
옥사이드의 유전 독성 영향을 약간 증가시킨다고 볼 수 있다.
GSTT1 결손 유전형은 일부 암의 발생 위험 증가와 관련이 있으나,(예, 참고문헌 [48]과 [207]) 
에틸렌옥사이드 노출과 암 발생이 반드시 상관성을 갖는다고 보기는 어렵다.
G.4.3.1.2.3 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 사람 집단의 반응 변동성에서 EH 다형성의 역할
GSTT1과 마찬가지로 EH는 사람 집단에서 여러 가지 형태로 발현되며,(참고문헌 [69]와 [144] 
참조) 그에 따라 EH 활성 수준이 다양할 수 있다. 예를 들어 Mertes
[123]
는 사람 간 검체의 EH 
기질 대사 정도가 63배나 차이를 보인다고 보고했다. 하지만 90%는 중앙값으로부터 3의 배수보
다 적은 수준으로 차이를 나타냈다. Kitteringham
[90]
은 EH 다형성이 EH 활성에 미치는 영향을 
요약하고 다음과 같이 정리했다.
“이들 연구 결과를 일반화하면, HYL1(microsomal epoxide hydrolase)이 완전하게 결손된 
사람은 없는 것으로 보이나, 대다수가 10배 범위 안에 있지만 간 활성의 개인별 편차가 어느 
정도 있다고 볼 수 있다.”
전체 EH 활성 범위(대사 기능이 부실한 사람과 빠르게 대사하는 사람 모두 포함)가 10배 범위 
안에 있다면, 집단 평균과 대다수 부실 대사 집단 사이의 활성 차이는 아마도 분포 형태에 따라 
5의 배수로 나타낼 수 있을 것이다.
- 194 -

- 195 -
사람 집단에서 볼 수 있는 EH 활성 편차는 일부 암의 발생 위험 증가와 관련이 있으나, 에틸렌옥
사이드 노출과 암 발생이 반드시 연관되어 있다고 보기는 어렵다. 예를 들어 McGlynn 등[12]은 
EH 활성이 낮은 다형성을 보이는 중국 집단에서 간세포 암 종 발생이 2배 높다고 보고했다. 또한 
EH를 통한 에폭사이드 대사 능력 감소는 태아 하이단토인(hydantoin) 증후군과 항경련제 사용과 
관련된 기타 독성의 위험 증가와 관련이 있다(참고문헌 [93] 참조). 에틸렌옥사이드는 EH 경로로 
독성이 제거되므로, EH 효소의 다형성 발현에 따라 EH 활성이 감소된 사람은 에폭사이드를 효율적
으로 대사하는 집단에 비하여 에틸렌옥사이드 관련 부정적 영향 발생 위험이 크다고 볼 수 있다.
G.4.3.1.3 에틸렌옥사이드 독성 제거 효소의 저해
G.4.3.1.3.1 질병 상태에서의 저해
내독소증이나 외상성 쇼크 등 특정 질병 상태에서는 EH 활성이 저해된다. 세균성 엔도톡신을 랫
드에 투여했을 때, EH 활성(참고문헌 [49])과 EH 유전자 발현(참고문헌 [36]) 모두가 저해되었
다. 외상 동물 모델에서 마이크로솜 EH는 약 50% 저해되었다(참고문헌 [60]). 아마도 EH 기능
을 감소시키는 질병 상태에서는 에틸렌옥사이드의 대사가 훼손되기 때문으로 생각된다.
G.4.3.1.3.2 약물과 기타 화합물에 의한 저해
항경련제, 발프로익산(valproic acid)과 발프로마이드(valpromide)는 치료 농도에서 EH 활성을 저
해하는 것으로 밝혀졌다[88]. 이러한 저해는 뇌전증 환자가 발프로익산(valproic acid)과 기타 항
경련제에 동반 노출되었을 때 최기형성(teratogenicity) 증가에 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 생각
된다.
효소 저해의 중요성
Fennel과 Brown[51]이 개발한 에틸렌옥사이드의 PBPK(physiologically based pharmacokinetic) 
모델을 활용하여 GSTT1과 EH 저해가 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량에 미치는 영향을 평가할 수 있
다. 이들 연구자가 각 변수가 정맥혈 중의 에틸렌옥사이드 농도에 미치는 영향에 대해 조사한 민
감성 분석에 의하면, 이 모델에서 GST Vmax 변수의 값 변화는 마우스와 랫드에서 에틸렌옥사이
드 정맥혈 농도에 유의미한 영향을 주는 것으로 나타났지만, 사람에서는 그렇지 않았다. 역으로 
EH Vmax 변수의 값 변화는 사람에서 에틸렌옥사이드 정맥혈 농도에 유의미한 영향을 주었지만, 
마우스와 랫드에서는 그렇지 않았다. 사람의 경우 EH Vmax 변수의 민감성 계수는 약 -0.4%였
다. 그러므로 EH Vmax 변수값이 1% 감소될 때마다, 에틸렌옥사이드 정맥혈 농도는 0.4% 증가
한다고 예상할 수 있다. 그에 따라 일부 질병 상태(예, 외상, 패혈증)에서 발생할 수 있는 EH의 
50% 저해는 에틸렌옥사이드 정맥혈 농도의 20% 증가와 관련이 있을 것이다. GSTT1 저해는 사
람에서 에틸렌옥사이드 정맥혈 농도에 거의 영향을 주지 않는 것으로 예상된다. 그러므로 EH 저
해가 중요한 임상적 결과로 이어질 수 있지만(예, 약물 상호작용), PBPK 모델링 결과에 근거하여 
도출한 EH 저해가 사람의 추정 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량에 미치는 영향은 2의 배수 미만이라고 
볼 수 있다.
G.4.3.1.4 글루타치온(glutathione) 수준
GSTT1 경로를 통한 에틸렌옥사이드의 독성 제거를 위해서는 조직에 충분한 수준의 내인성 글루
타치온이 보조 인자로 존재해야 한다. 중증 환자나 수술 이후 환자는 일반적으로 건강한 사람에 
비하여 조직의 글루타치온 수준이 감소된 것으로 나타났다. 예를 들어 Wernerman[197]은 수술과 


- 196 -
중병 때문에 글루타치온 수준이 40%까지 감소된다고 보고했다. 그에 따라 중증 환자는 건강한 사
람에 비하여 에틸렌옥사이드 관련 영향이 발생할 위험이 크다고 볼 수 있다.
G.4.3.1.5 DNA 보수 능력의 다형성
또 다른 약동학적 요소인 DNA 보수 관련 유전자의 다형성과 발암물질 대사도 암 위험에 영향을 
줄 수 있다(참고문헌 [73] 참조). 비효율적인 DNA 보수 메커니즘을 가진 사람은 일반 집단에 비
하여 에틸렌옥사이드 관련 부정적 영향 위험이 더 클 것으로 예상된다. 이를 뒷받침하는 실험 데
이터가 일부 있다. Nivard[138]는 고농도의 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 초파리의 경우, 모체 
NER(nucl에틸렌옥사이드tide excision repair) 부재 시에 돌연변이 발생률이 최대 20 배나 커진
다고 보고했다. 하지만 낮은 용량에 노출된 초파리에서는 이렇게 높은 수준의 돌연변이 발생률이 
관찰되지 않았다. 그러므로 비효율적인 DNA 보수가 에틸렌옥사이드 관련 부정적 영향 위험을 높
일 가능성이 있지만, DNA 보수 다형성 데이터를 정량적으로 평가하여 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 불
확정 인자 1(UF1) 값을 구하기란 가능하지 않다.
종합 변동성(aggregate variability)
위에서 설명한 바와 같이 다양한 약력학적 요소가 일부 환자에서는 에틸렌옥사이드의 대사와 그
에 따른 독성 제거 능력의 감소를 유발할 수 있다. GSTT1과 EH의 다형성 발현, 약물과 기타 화
합물에 의한 EH 저해, 일부 질병 상태에서의 EH 활성 감소가 이에 해당된다. 또한 중증 질환자 
조직 중의 낮은 글루타치온 농도와 DNA 보수 능력의 다형성 같은 다양한 약동학적 요소도 일부 
사람의 표적 조직을 에틸렌옥사이드에 의한 손상에 더 민감하게 만들 수 있다. 이들 데이터를 정
량적으로 평가하여 불확정 인자 1(UF1) 값을 구하기란 가능하지 않다. 하지만 이들 요소를 종합
적으로 검토하면, 에틸렌옥사이드에 따른 개인별 반응 변동성 특성을 파악하여 UF를 정하는데 도
움이 될 수는 있다.
Fuchs[54]의 헤모글로빈 바이오마커 데이터에 존재하는 변동성에 근거하여, 불확정 인자 1(UF1) 
값을 최소 6으로 정할 수 있다. 하지만 이 값은 중증 환자 집단에 속하는 민감성 환자의 반응과 
건강한 집단의 평균 반응 사이의 민감성 차이를 나타내기에 부족하다고 볼 수 있다.
Knudsen[91]는 개인별 변동성을 감안하여 대사 능력에 영향을 주는 다양한 요소가 UF 규모에 미
치는 영향을 검토하고 다음과 같이 강조했다.
“위해 평가 시에 개인별 민감성 차이를 감안하면 안전 ‘계수’를 10으로 정할 수 있다. 각종 
참고 문헌을 검토하면, 단일 다형성을 감안할 때 10의 계수가 타당하다고 생각된다. 하지만 
여러 가지 감수성 대사 유전형과 기타 감수성 결정 인자(예, 결함 DNA 보수, 부실 영양 상
태 등)를 가진 사람인 경우, 위해는 10의 안전 계수 이상으로 증가할 수 있다.”
이런 요소들이 복합적으로 결합되었을 때의 영향은 알 수 없다. 하지만 이 모든 데이터는 기본값 
10보다 큰 불확정 인자 1(UF1) 값이 적절함을 의미한다. 그에 따라 개인별 변동성을 감안하여 불
확정 인자 1(UF1) 값을 30으로 하면 가장 민감한 집단도 적절하게 보호된다고 판단된다.
G.4.3.2 종간 차이와 관련한 불확정 인자 2(UF2)


G.4.3.2.1 개요
불확정 인자 2(UF2) 값을 도출할 때 종간 역가 차이를 고려하기에 앞서, 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출
된 실험동물에서 나타난 결과가 사람에게도 상관성이 있는지 살펴볼 필요가 있다. G.4.2.1과 
G.4.2.2에서 설명한 바와 같이, 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 허용 흡입량(TI)값 도출을 위한 핵심 변수
는 토끼의 체중 증가 감소(제한/장기 노출 카테고리 LOAEL)와 원숭이(cynomolgus monkey)의 
정자 형성 이상과 고환 기능 관련 영향이다(비종양성 영향에 대한 장기 노출 카테고리 LOAEL). 
실험동물의 체중 증가 감소는 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 설정과 관련이 있으며 부정적 영향으로 간주되
는 일반적인 영향이다. 사람이 아닌 다른 영장류의 정자 형성 과정은 정자형성 사이클 시간, 정자 
형성 기간, 유사분열 횟수 등을 감안할 때 사람과 매우 유사하다(참고문헌 [124]와 [195] 참조). 
그러므로 사람이 아닌 다른 영장류에서 얻은 데이터도 사람 정자 형성 실험에 적절한 모델이라 
할 수 있다. 마찬가지로 원숭이에서 관찰된 에틸렌옥사이드에 의한 정자 형성 이상을 사람에게도 
적용된다고 가정할 수 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드는 직접적인 유전 독성 발암물질로 발암성을 발휘한다
고 생각되므로, 실험동물에서 관찰된 영향은 사람에게도 바로 적용될 수 있다.
상대성장 원칙에 근거하여 사람은 실험동물보다 화학적 화합물의 부정적 영향에 보다 민감하다고 
가정한다(참고문헌 [127] 참조). 그에 따라 제16장(ISO 10993-17)은 실험동물과 사람 사이의 화
합물 역가 차이를 가정하여 기본 불확정 인자(UF) 값을 10으로 권장한다. 하지만 에틸렌옥사이드
의 역가가 종 사이에 동등하다는 증거도 많다. 아래에서 보다 자세하게 설명하고 있듯이, PBPK 
모델링 결과에 의하면, 특정 에틸렌옥사이드 농도에 흡입 노출된 뒤에 마우스, 랫드, 사람의 내부 
용량은 동일할 것으로 예상된다. 흡입 노출 이후 에틸렌옥사이드와 유사 화합물(프로필렌 옥사이
드, 스티렌 옥사이드)의 내부 용량이 종 사이에 거의 동일하다는 데이터도 PBPK 모델링 결과를 
뒷받침한다. 이런 요소는 모두 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI)  도출 시에 불확정 인자 
2(UF2) 값을 1로 하는 것을 뒷받침한다.
G.4.3.2.2 PBPK 모델링 결과
앞서 언급한 PBPK 모델을 활용하여 Fennell과 Brown
[51]
은 저농도의 에틸렌옥사이드를 6시간 
동안 흡입한 이후 에틸렌옥사이드의 내부 용량 추정치(혈액 중의 AUC(area under the curve))는 
마우스, 랫드, 사람 모두 동일했다고 보고했다(표 G.5 참조).
표 G.5 에틸렌옥사이드 흡입 이후 내부 용량 추정치

| 에틸렌옥사이드 농도(ppm) | 종 AUC(㎎ x h/l) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

[45]
는 부가체 
수준의 점진적 증가가 동일 농도의 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 종 사이에 걸쳐 일관성을 보인다고 
보고했다. 마찬가지로 동일 에틸렌옥사이드 농도에 노출된 이후의 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량은 종 
전체에 걸쳐 유사했다(표 G.6).

유사 에폭사이드에 대한 역가의 종간 비교
Segerback
[165]
는 프로필렌 옥사이드의 흡입 노출 이후 체내 DNA 부가체 수준은 종 사이에 동일
했다고 보고했다. 약동학적 관점에서 Bjorge 등
[23]
은 체외 조건에서 스티렌 옥사이드에 노출된 사
람과 랫드의 고환 세포를 분리하여 조사했으며 단일 가닥 DNA 파손 수준이 유사했다고 보고했
다. 프로필렌 옥사이드, 스티렌 옥사이드, 에틸렌옥사이드의 구조와 작용 방식이 유사함을 감안하
면, 이 결과는 에틸렌옥사이드의 종간 역가가 동일하다는 결론을 뒷받침한다.
G.4.3.2.3 DNA 보수율의 종간 차이
DNA 보수는 종 사이의 차이 없이 유사한 속도로 진행되는 것으로 보이며, 이는 1의 불확정 인자 
2(UF2) 
값 
선정을 
더 
뒷받침한다. 
예를 
들어 
사람과 
랫드의 
세포는 
MMS(methyl 
methanesulfonate)에 의한 DNA 손상 부위를 유사한 속도로 복구한다(참고문헌 [142] 참조). 에
틸렌옥사이드와 MMS는 유사한 메커니즘을 통해 생식 세포에 영향을 미치므로(참고문헌 [192] 
참조), 에틸렌옥사이드에 따른 DNA 보수 속도는 종간에 동일하다고 가정할 수 있다.
동일 농도의 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 이후 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량 모델값 또는 측정값이 종 
사이에 유사하다는 점과 DNA 보수율이 유사하다는 점에 근거하면, 불확정 인자 2(UF2) 값을 1
로 선정한 것은 과학적으로 타당하다고 볼 수 있다.
G.4.3.3 실험 데이터의 품질과 연관성과 관련한 불확정 인자 3(UF3)
불확정 인자 3(UF3)는 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 값의 부재, 장기 실험에 의거한 관찰
되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)의 부재, 임상적으로 연관된 노출 경로 관련 데이터의 부재를 포
함하여 허용 흡입량(TI) 도출에 사용되는 독성 데이터의 한계와 관련된 것이다.
임상적으로 연관성이 있는 노출 경로의 데이터 결여를 해결하기 위해 경로간 외삽 방식을 활용하
는 방법은 G.3에서 설명했으며, 이를 활용하여 불확정 인자 3(UF3) 값을 도출해서는 안 된다. 하
지만 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 값의 결여 문제를 해결하기 위해 UF3 값이 필요하다.
(참고문헌 [107] 참조)
실험 데이터가 없어 원숭이(cynomolgus monkey)에서의 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 값
을 규정할 수 없는 경우, 이 값을 추정하는 한 가지 방식은 다음과 같다.
- 198 -

- 199 -
- 마우스를 상대로 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)의 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량을 추정한다.
- 이 용량을 확대하여 원숭이에서의 내부 용량을 구한다.
- 값을 비교한다.
참고문헌 [186]의 결과에 근거하면, 6시간 동안 10 ppm 에틸렌옥사이드에 노출된 랫드의 내부 
용량은 2.7 ㎎/㎏이다. 참고문헌 [107]에서 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)의 에틸렌옥
사이드에 원숭이를 6시간 동안 노출시킨 다음의 에틸렌옥사이드 내부 용량 추정치는 3.3 ㎎/㎏이
었다(1주에 5일 노출을 감안해 조정하지 않음). 에틸렌옥사이드 용량은 체중에 직접 비례하여 종
에 따라 확대 적용할 수 있다고 가정하므로, 원숭이에서 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)
의 내부 용량과 랫드에서 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)의 내부 용량 비율은 3.3/2.7=1.2가 
된다. 에틸렌옥사이드의 영향에 대한 종간 정자 반응의 약동학적 동등성을 감안하면, 이 비율은 유
효하다.
그러므로 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)에 적용한 3의 불확정 인자(UF)는 참고문헌 
[107]에서 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 추정에 적절하다고 볼 수 있다. 이 값은 미국 
FDA(2000년)가 DEHP의 주사 경로 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 도출에 적용한 3의 최소한으로 관찰된 
부작용 수준(LOAEL)-관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)의 불확정 인자(UF)와도 일치한다. 또
한 Abdel-Rahman과 Kadry[3]는 24개 화학물질에 대하여 경구 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준
(LOAEL)-관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 비율의 평균값이 3.5라고 보고했으며, 또한 10 이
하의 비율이 96%라고 했다. 그에 따라 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI) 도출을 위해 참고문헌 
[107]에 보고된 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)에 적용한 3의 불확정 인자(UF)가 과학
적으로 뒷받침되며, 이 값을 선택하여 적용한 전례도 있다.
G.4.4 에틸렌옥사이드의 비발암성 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 도출
에틸렌옥사이드의 비발암성 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 도출에 필요한 불확정 인자 각각에 대하여 다음의 
값을 선택한 이유는 위에서 설명했다.
- UF1, 개인별 변동성
        30
- UF2, 종간 외삽
1
- UF3, 데이터 결함
3(NOAEL이 결여된 경우)
그에 따라 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)이 있는 경우에 사용할 변경 인자(MF)는 30이고 
최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)만 있는 경우에는 90이다.
핵심적인 연구에서 구한 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 또는 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수
준(LOAEL) 값에 상기의 변경 인자(MF)를 적용하면, 표 G.7과 같이 에틸렌옥사이드의 비발암성 
허용 흡입량(TI) 값이 도출된다.
표 G.7 비발암성 허용 흡입량(TI)값 도출(제한/장기 노출 카테고리)



| 연구 자료 | NOAEL/LOAEL (㎎/㎏/d) | UF | TI(㎎/㎏/d) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [169] | 9 (NOAEL) | 30 | 0.3 |
| [82] | 9 (NOAEL) | 30 | 0.3 |
| [107] | 2 (LOAEL) | 90 | 0.02 |

G.5 에틸렌옥사이드의 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI) 값
G.5.1 개요
제16장(ISO 10993-17)은 가용 데이터와 규제 기준에 따라 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI)값 설정
에 가장 적절한 방법을 유연하게 선택하도록 하고 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드는 유전 독성 메커니즘을 
통해 발암성 영향을 유발하므로 일반적으로 선형 외삽 방식이 저용량 위해의 추정에 가장 적절한 
방법이라 할 수 있다. 이 선형 외삽 방식은 통계학적 용량-반응 모델을 활용하여 저용량 수준에
서 사람에게 위해가 되는 용량을 추정하거나, 사람이나 실험동물에서 발암성 위험 증가와 관련이 
있는 최저 용량으로부터 단순 선형 외삽으로 “무위해(zero risk)”와 관련된 용량을 추정하기도 한
다. 또는 비발암성 위해 평가에 사용된 것과 유사한 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL) 또
는 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)/불확정 인자(UF) 방식을 특히 유럽 규제 기관이 선호하
기도 한다. 마지막으로 비선형 생물학적 방식의 에틸렌옥사이드 위해 평가도 제시되었으나, 이 방
식은 충분하게 밸리데이션되지 않았고, 수용되지 않았다.
에틸렌옥사이드의 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI) 값은 다음 방식으로 도출하였다.
- 인체 데이터의 선형 외삽
- 동물 데이터의 선형 외삽
- LOAEL 값에 UF 적용
- 용량-반응 모델링
G.5.2 방법 1: 인체 데이터의 선형 외삽

G.6.1 허용 노출량(TE, tolerable exposure)
특정 제품이 사용되는 방식을 감안하고 개별 제품 한계 기준을 실제로 계산하기 위하여 허용 흡
입량(TI) 값을 변형한다. 허용 노출량(TE)는 허용 흡입량(TI), 체질량(body mass, m
b
), 의료기기 
활용 인자(UTF)의 곱이다.
TE = TI x m
b
 x UTF
특정 환자 집단 정보가 없을 때는 일반적으로 체질량 요소를 70 ㎏으로 한다.
의료기기 활용 인자(UTF)는 여러 제품에 의한 에틸렌옥사이드 노출을 감안한 요소 또는 동반 노
출 인자(CEF, concomitant exposure factor)와 특정 제품을 전체 기간 동안 사용하지 않는 상황
을 비례적으로 감안한 요소 또는 비례 노출 인자(PEF, proportional exposure factor)의 곱이다.
UTF = CEF x PEF
구체적인 정보가 없을 때는 동반 노출 인자(CEF)와 비례 노출 인자(PEF)를 각각 0.2와 1.0으로 
한다.
G.6.2 제한 노출관련 허용 노출량(TE)
TE = 0.30 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2
허용 노출량(TE)는 4.2 ㎎/d이며 개별 제품 한계 기준 계산의 편의를 위해 반올림하면 4 ㎎/d가 
된다.
그러므로 평균 일일 에틸렌옥사이드 용량은 4 ㎎/d를 넘지 않는다(G.1 참조).
- 203 -

- 204 -
G.6.3 장기 노출관련 허용 노출량(TE)
TE = 0.30 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2
허용 노출량(TE)은 4.2 ㎎/d이며 개별 제품 한계 기준 계산의 편의를 위해 반올림하면 4 ㎎/d가 
된다.
그러므로 평균 일일 에틸렌옥사이드 용량은 4 ㎎/d를 넘지 않는다. 현재의 한계 기준인 2.0 ㎎/d
를 유지했다.
G.6.4 영구 노출관련 허용 노출량(TE)
TE = 0.02 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2
허용 노출량(TE)는 0.28 ㎎/d이며 개별 제품 한계 기준 계산의 편의를 위해 반올림하면 0.3 ㎎/d
가 된다.
그러므로 평균 일일 에틸렌옥사이드 용량은 0.3 ㎎/d를 넘지 않는다. 3.3.2에서 설명한 바와 같
이, 현재의 한계 기준인 0.1 ㎎/d를 유지했다.
G.6.5 허용접촉한계(TCL, tolerable contact limit)의 계산
G.6.5.1 배경
에틸렌옥사이드는 자극성이 있으므로 허용접촉한계(TCL)를 계산할 필요가 있다. 에틸렌옥사이드 
멸균 표면 접촉 제품과 이식성 제품에 대하여 허용접촉한계(TCL)가 필요하다. 제16장(ISO 
10993-17)에 기술된 방식으로 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계(TCL) 값을 도출했다.
G.6.5.2 핵심 연구 자료의 선정
에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출에 활용할 수 있는 용량-반응 데이터가 많은 연구 자
료에 포함되어 있다(참고문헌 [12], [117], [168], [179]).
Matsumoto[117]는 심장 카테터와 요도 카데터를 에틸렌옥사이드로 멸균한 다음에 6시간, 24시간, 
48시간, 72시간, 96시간, 168시간 동안 통기시켰다. 그리고 3일 동안 수성 용출을 한 다음에 카
데터 제품에 남은 에틸렌옥사이드의 양을 분석했다. 카데터를 절단하여 2 cm 부분들을 랫드에 피
하 이식했고, 이식 이후 24시간, 48시간, 72시간, 1주 뒤에 부검을 실시했다. 심장 카데터의 비 
자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level)과 최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally irritating level) 은 각각 
0.46과 1.02 ㎎ 에틸렌옥사이드/gm 카데터였다.
Andersen[12]도 이식물을 이용해 에틸렌옥사이드 유도 자극 반응을 연구했다. 하지만 이식물에 잔


류하는 에틸렌옥사이드의 양은 멸균 이전 시점과 멸균 이후 여러 시점에 측정한 중량 차이로 결
정했다. 이 기법은 정확성이 떨어지므로, 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출에 활용할 수 
없다.
Shupack
[168]
은 사람 자원자의 등에 부착한 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 패치의 국소 영향을 조사하였다. 
최저 에틸렌옥사이드 농도에서 영향을 유발한 재료는 PVC 블록이었다. 893 ppm의 에틸렌옥사이
드가 함유된 PVC 블록과 접촉한 다음에 자극 반응이 나타났다. PVC 블록의 비 자극 수준(NIL, 
non-irritating level)은 보고 되지 않았다. 이 실험에 사용된 블록의 무게는 719 ㎎이었으므로, 
최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally irritating level) 은 0.642 ㎎ 에틸렌옥사이드에 해당된다(0.893 
㎎ 에틸렌옥사이드/gm 재료 x 0.719 gm PVC). 2 평방 센티미터 크기의 재료가 피부와 접촉했으
므로, 표면적 기반 최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally irritating level) 은 0.32 ㎎/cm
2
(321 μg/cm
2
)
이었다.
Tanaka
[179]
는 토끼를 상대로 에틸렌옥사이드 침윤 거즈 패치의 피부 자극 실험을 실시했다. 자극을 
유발하지 않은 최고 용량은 0.75 ㎎/패치였다. 이 패치의 표면적은 1.77 cm
2
이므로, 표면적 기반 
비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level)은 0.424 ㎎/cm
2
(424 μg/cm
2
)이었다.
Anand
[11]
는 면구(cotton pellet)를 에틸렌옥사이드 용액 0.5 ㎖로 포화시키고, 햄스터의 볼 주머
니에 이 면구를 넣었다. 4시간 노출 이후 14일 동안 관찰했는데, 관찰 기간 이후 자극을 유발하
지 않은 최고 에틸렌옥사이드 농도는 2.500 μg/㎖이었다. 햄스터 볼 주머니의 유효 표면적이 약 
1.5 cm
2
이므로, 표면적 기반 비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level)은 833 μg/cm
2
이었다.
이들 연구 자료에서 확보된 비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level) 값은 표 G.11과 같다.

G.6.5.3 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출을 위한 불확정 인자 선정
에틸렌옥사이드의 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 도출과 마찬가지로, 화합물에 대한 자극성 반응에 있어서 
사람 집단의 개인별 변동성(UF4), 자극제에 대한 종간 반응 차이(UF5), 데이터 결함(UF6)을 감
안해 불확정 인자를 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출에 활용한다.
G.6.5.4 개인간 변동성과 관련한 불확정 인자 4(UF4)
에틸렌옥사이드의 화합물 특이적 UF4를 정할 데이터를 구할 수 없었다. 다양한 접촉성 자극제의 
일정 용량에 대한 사람 집단의 변동성이 확립되었지만(예, 참고문헌 [21]), 이 데이터는 불확정 
인자 4(UF4)의 기본값을 뒷받침하는데 충분하지 않다. 그럼에도 불구하고 개인간 변동성은 에틸
렌옥사이드 멸균 재료의 이식 이후 나타난 영향에 대하여 매우 미미한 것으로 추정된다. 특히 피
부가 완전하지 않은 경우에 피부 접촉 재료는 변동성이 더 클 것으로 예상할 수 있다. 그에 따라 
- 205 -

이식 또는 점막 접촉 연구에서 자극 데이터를 확보할 때 에틸렌옥사이드의 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도
출을 위하여 3의 UF4 값을 적용하며, 에틸렌옥사이드가 피부에 미치는 영향과 관련된 연구에서
는 5의 UF4 값을 적용한다.
G.6.5.5 종간 차이와 관련한 불확정 인자 5(UF5)
에틸렌옥사이드의 화합물 특이적 UF5를 도출할 데이터를 구할 수 없었다. 하지만 특히 이식 재료
인 경우에 에틸렌옥사이드에 의한 국소 영향과 관련하여 종 특이적 반응은 나타나지 않으리라고 
추정된다. 그러므로 불확정 인자 5(UF5) 값을 1로 한다.
G.6.5.6 데이터 결함
조직마다 국소 자극 영향에 대한 상대 민감도가 다양하다. 그러므로 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출에 
활용한 연구 자료의 실험 대상 부위보다 에틸렌옥사이드의 영향에 더 민감할 것으로 생각되는 조
직(예, 뇌 실질조직)과 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 제품이 접촉할 가능성도 존재한다. 에틸렌옥사이드 멸
균 제품이 민감성 조직과 접촉할 가능성을 감안하여 3의 계수를 선택했다.
참고문헌 [168]에는 비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level) 값이 없었다. 비 자극 수준(NIL, 
non-irritating level)의 결여를 감안하여 2의 계수를 사용했다.
제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 기술된 바와 같이, 화합물의 허용 흡입량 또는 허용접촉한계(TCL)를 
도출할 때 핵심 개념은 “환자 노출 용량(dose-to-patient)” 또는 생체이용성 용량이다. 재료를 피
부나 점막과 접촉시켜 국소 자극 실험을 실시할 때, 일정한 양의 에틸렌옥사이드가 제품에 잔류할 
수 있으며, 일정한 양은 휘발될 가능성이 있다. 이에 따라 표적 조직에서 자극성 영향을 유발할 
에틸렌옥사이드의 양이 적어지게 된다. 참고문헌 [11], [168], [179]에 에틸렌옥사이드의 생체 
이용성 용량에 관한 데이터는 없지만, 용량의 50%가 표적 부위에 도달한다고 가정한다. 그에 따
라 이들 실험에서 생체이용성 용량에 관한 부분을 감안해 2의 계수를 사용한다.
[11]에서는 4시간만 노출을 시켰다. 하지만 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 재료가 4시간 이상 동안 조직과 
접촉할 가능성이 존재한다. 보다 오랜 기간 동안 조직과 접촉한다면 낮은 에틸렌옥사이드 용량에
서도 부정적 영향이 발생할 가능성이 있음을 감안하여 2의 계수를 사용했다.
각 실험에 적용한 UF4, UF5, UF6 값과 그에 따른 변경 인자(MF), 그리고 허용접촉한계(TCL) 
값이 표 G.12에 정리되어 있다.
표 G.12 에틸렌옥사이드의 자극 연구를 위해 도출한 불확정 인자와 변경 인자(MF, modifying 
factors), 그리고 이 데이터로 도출한 허용접촉한계(TCL)

| [11] | 점막 | 833 | 3 | 1 | 12 | 36 | 23.1 |

4개 실험에서 도출한 값을 토대로 하고 접촉 조직(점막과 이식)의 임상적 의미를 고려해, 10 μ
g/cm2의 허용접촉한계(TCL)가 각종 조직을 에틸렌옥사이드의 국소 영향으로부터 보호하는데 적
절할 것이다.
G.7 허용 한도 기준의 계산
허용 한도(allowable limit, AL)는 의료기기에 의한 노출 시에 허용 가능하다고 판단되는 에틸렌
옥사이드의 최대량을 의미하며, ㎎/d 단위로 나타낸다. 허용 한도 기준을 개별 제품 한계 기준으
로 용이하게 전환할 수 있으며, 이 계산 방법이 G.8에 설명되어 있다. 허용 한도(AL)는 허용 노출
량(TE)값과 유익성 인자(benefit factor, BF)의 곱이다.
AL = TE x BF
의료기기 사용 시에 특정 유출 성분 또는 잔류물에 노출되는 것이 불가피하며 그 의료기기의 사
용에 따른 건강 이득이 유의미한 경우에 유익성 인자(BF)가 적절하다. 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 제품
의 사용에 따른 용이하게 정량 가능하거나 유의미한 건강 이득이 없으므로(다른 방식으로 멸균한 
제품과 달리), 부록 F에서 별도로 설명한 일부 제품 카테고리를 제외하고 유익성이자(BF)를 1로 
정한다. 그러므로 부록 F에서 달리 정하지 않으면, 모든 노출 기간 카테고리의 허용 한도는 허용 
노출량(TE, tolerable exposure) 값과 같다.
G.8 제품 한계 기준의 계산
G.8.1 공통 사항
제품 사용에 따라 노출되는 에틸렌옥사이드의 최대량(질량 단위로 표현)은 허용 한도(AL)와 특정 
노출 기간 카테고리의 제품 사용 일수의 곱에 해당된다.
mdev,cat = AL x 카테고리의 일수
G.8.2 제한 접촉 제품
제한 노출 카테고리의 의료기기는 최대 1일까지 사용할 수 있다.
mdev,limt = 4.0 ㎎/d x 1 d = 4 ㎎
G.8.3 장기 접촉 제품
장기 접촉 카테고리의 의료기기는 2일부터 30일까지 사용될 수 있다. 이 문서에서 도출한 장기 
카테고리 허용 한도(AL)를 적용하면, 제품 한계 기준은 다음과 같다.
mdev,prol = 4.0 ㎎/d x 30 d = 120 ㎎
하지만 현재의 한계 기준인 2.0 ㎎/d를 유지하기로 했으므로, 장기 제품 한계 기준은 다음과 같
다.
mdev,prol = 2.0 ㎎/d x 30 d = 60 ㎎


- 208 -
또한 에틸렌옥사이드 최대 용량은 1일 기간 동안 4.0 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 한다.
G.8.4 영구 접촉 제품
영구 접촉 카테고리의 의료기기는 31일부터 25,000일까지 사용될 수 있다. 이 문서에서 도출한 
영구 카테고리 허용 한도(AL)값을 적용하면, 제품 한계 기준은 다음과 같다.
mdev,perm = 0.28 ㎎/d x 25,000 d = 7.0 g
하지만 현재의 한계 기준인 0.1 ㎎/d를 유지하기로 했으므로, 영구 제품 한계 기준은 다음과 같다.
mdev,perm = 0.1 ㎎/d x 25,000 d = 2.5 g
또한 에틸렌옥사이드 최대 용량은 첫 30일 동안 60 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 하며, 또는 1일 동안 4 ㎎
을 넘지 않아야 한다.
G.8.5 허용접촉한계(TCL)값 기반 한계 기준
표면 접촉성 제품인 경우에 허용접촉한계(TCL) 기반 한계 기준이 적절하다. 허용접촉한계(TCL) 
기반 한계 기준의 계산 공식은 다음과 같다.
mdev,BSC = TCL x A
mdev,BSC 
제품별 질량, 즉 환자에 대한 최대 용량(㎎)
TCL
허용접촉한계 기준(㎎/cm2)
A
신체와 접촉하는 의료기기의 표면적(cm2)
그러므로 개별 제품에 대하여 대략적인 면적(cm2)을 10 μg/cm2의 허용접촉한계(TCL)로 곱하여 
제품 한계 기준을 정한다.
예:
신체와 접촉하는 제품의 표면적 = 100 cm2
mdev,BSC = 10 μg/cm2 x 100 cm2 = 1 ㎎

에틸렌클로로히드린 허용 한도 기준 설정
(Establishment of allowable limits for ECH)
H.1 일반사항
급성 독성 데이터와 반복 투여 데이터에 의하면, 에틸렌클로로히드린은 피부, 구강, 주사 노출 이
후 용이하게 전신 순환된다. 또한 LD50와 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 연구 결과에 따르
면, 특정 기간(제한 노출, 장기 노출, 영구 노출)의 에틸렌클로로히드린 역가는 구강 노출 경로와 
주사 노출 경로 모두 동등하다. 아만성 및 만성 독성 실험 데이터에 근거하면, 에틸렌클로로히드
린은 노출 기간이 늘어난다고 더 강력한 영향을 미치는 것 같지는 않다. 에틸렌클로로히드린의 표
적 장기 독성은 뚜렷하지 않으나, 특정 표적 장기 영향은 노출 경로와 기간에 따라 달라질 수 있
다. 뒤에서 살펴보는 허용 일일 용량 한계 기준은 이러한 일반적인 사항을 반영하고 있다. 장기 
및 영구 접촉 카테고리인 경우, 이 문서에 제시된 평가를 통해 도출한 허용 흡입량(TI) 값과 그에 
따른 제품 한계 기준은 더 높지만, 개정 전 기존 한계 기준을 유지했다. 기존 한계 기준을 유지하
기로 결정한 이유는 제조업체가 이 한계 기준을 준수할 수 있고 개정 전 문서의 채택 이후로 임
상적 성과가 좋았기 때문이다. 또한 장기 및 영구 카테고리의 기존 한계 기준을 이 문서에 기술된 
평가 결과를 반영한 수준으로 높일 임상적 이유나 제조 관련 증거를 발견할 수 없다.
H.2 서론
이 부록에 포함된 의료기기 중의 에틸렌클로로히드린 잔류물 한계 기준은 제16장(ISO 
10993-17)에 기술된 허용 흡입량(TI, tolerable intake) 설정 방법을 적용하여 정했다. 의료기기 
중의 에틸렌클로로히드린 한계 기준은 많은 참고 문헌을 검토하여 정했다. H.4항에서 설명하는 
바와 같이, 급성 독성 데이터, 표적 장기 영향 데이터, 동물 만성 독성 데이터가 한계 기준 도출
에 가장 적절하다고 판단되었다.
H.3 방법
H.3.1 개요
제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 기술된 방법으로 다양한 노출 기간에 대한 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용 
흡입량(TI) 값을 도출했다.
의료기기에 노출되는 정도에 따라 의료기기에서 방출되는 에틸렌클로로히드린에 제한적 기간부터 
영구적 기간까지 환자가 노출될 가능성이 있다. 그에 따라 이 화합물에 대하여 제한 허용 흡입량
(TI) 값, 장기 허용 흡입량(TI) 값, 영구 허용 흡입량(TI) 값을 도출할 필요가 있었다. 환자는 일
반적으로 임상 상황에서 주사 경로로 에틸렌클로로히드린에 노출되지만, 이 노출 경로에 대한 허
용 흡입량(TI) 값을 도출하는데 필요한 독성 데이터는 거의 없다. 이와 달리 실험동물에서의 에틸
렌클로로히드린에 의한 영향에 관한 데이터는 많았다.


- 210 -
H.3.2 용량의 경로간 외삽
흡입 경로에 의해 환자가 에틸렌클로로히드린에 노출되는 경우와 관련된 데이터는 제한적이다. 에
틸렌클로로히드린 노출은 염소 분자의 추가에 따라 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌클로로히드린으로 유
도체화되면서 나타나므로, 환경적 요소에 의해 에틸렌클로로히드린 노출이 발생한다. 에틸렌클로
로히드린 위해 평가 시에 용량의 경로간 외삽을 실시하지 않았다.
H.3.3 비발암성 위해 평가 방법
에틸렌클로로히드린의 비발암성 영향에 대한 허용 흡입량(TI) 값은 핵심 연구 자료에서 구한 가장 
관련성이 있는 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 또는 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준
(LOAEL) 값을, 사람 집단의 에틸렌옥사이드에 대한 반응 변동성 관련 데이터(UF1), 종간 역가 
차이(UF2), 데이터 결함(UF3)을 감안한 불확정 인자로 나누어 도출했다. 제15장은 가능하면 과학
적 데이터를 활용하여 핵심 독성 실험 데이터에 적용할 불확정 인자를 도출하고 허용 흡입량(TI) 
값을 구해야 한다고 강조한다. 이 원칙에 따라 사람 집단의 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대한 반응 변동
성 데이터와 종간 에틸렌클로로히드린 역가 차이에 관한 데이터를 활용하여 불확정 인자 1(UF1)
과 불확정 인자 2(UF2)를 도출했다.
H.3.4 발암성 위해 평가 방법
동물 실험에서 에틸렌클로로히드린은 암을 유발하지 않는 것으로 나타났으므로, 규제 기관 등은 
에틸렌클로로히드린을 사람 발암 물질로 생각하지 않는다. 그러므로 이 위해 평가 시에 에틸렌클
로로히드린의 발암성 기반 허용 흡입량(TI) 값을 계산하지 않았다.
H.3.5 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용 흡입량(TI) 값 도출 시에 고려하지 않은 영향
비발암성 영향에 근거한 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용 흡입량(TI) 값은 과민반응과 과민증 같은 면
역학적 영향과 용혈현상 같은 영향에 대하여 보호 역할을 하지 않는다. 에틸렌클로로히드린 노출
과 관련이 있는 이런 영향으로부터 환자를 보호하려면 다른 접근 방식이 필요할 것이다.
H.4 비발암성 기반 에틸렌클로로히드린 허용 흡입량(TI) 값
H.4.1 핵심 연구 자료의 선정
H.4.1.1 제한 노출 한계 기준
24시간 미만 기간 동안 에틸렌클로로히드린의 제한 노출 한계 기준에 대한 허용 한도(AL, 
allowable limit)은 9 ㎎/d이다. 이 한계 기준은 랫드를 상대로 30일간 실시한 아만성 복강내 주
사 실험에서 확보한 데이터에 의거한 6.4 ㎎/㎏ 에틸렌클로로히드린의 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수
준(NOAEL)을 바탕으로 한다.(참고문헌 [103]) 이 용량은 동일 연구자가 전에 실시했던 실험에서 
나온 1/10 용량 수준에서 도출된 것이었는데, 그에 따른 LD50 값은 64 ㎎/㎏이었다.(참고문헌 
[102]) 여러 연구자들이 다양한 투여 경로로 여러 종을 상대로 실시한 실험에서도(참고문헌 
[104], [116], [159], [162], [194], [203]) 유사한 급성 독성 LD50 결과가 보고 되었다. 
LD50을 포함한 급성 독성 데이터는 이 평가에 적절하지 않지만, 이들 데이터를 평가하였다. 
LD50 데이터는 표 H.1에 정리되어 있다.
표 H.1의 데이터를 검토하면, 제한 노출(24시간 미만) 시의 에틸렌클로로히드린 독성은 노출 경


로에 상관없이 거의 동일하며 종간에도 상대적으로 유사하다.
데이터는 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)이나 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)이 아
닌 표 H.1의 LD50 값을 반영하고 있으므로, 참고문헌 [103]에 제시된 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수
준(NOAEL) 값을 사용했다. 이 연구에서 연구자들은 원래의 급성 독성 실험에서 구한 LD50 값의 
1/10에 해당되는 것으로 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d의 용량을 선택했다. 이 아만성 실험을 통해 무영향 수준을 
정했으며, 여기서는 제16장(ISO 10993-17)의 가이드라인에 따라 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d의 값을 사용하고 
가장 적절한 불확정 인자와 변경 인자(MF, modifying factor)를 적용해 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허
용 한도(AL, allowable limit)값을 구했다.
NOAEL = 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d

종간 변동성에 대한 UF2 =1은, 저농도의 에틸렌클로로히드린은 간에서 S-카르복시메틸글루타치
온(S-carboxymethlygluthathione)에 글루타치온(gluthathione)이 접합되어 독성이 제거된다는 참
고문헌 [80]과 [81]을 토대로 정했다. 글루타치온 농도가 충분하면 독성 제거 효과가 지속된다.

- 212 -
높은 농도의 에틸렌클로로히드린에 노출될 때는 글루타치온이 고갈되어 과도한 독성이 나타날 수
도 있다. 동물과 사람은 독성 제거 메커니즘이 동일하며 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d의 농도에서 관찰되지 않는 
부작용 수준(NOAEL)이 나타나므로, 불확정 인자 2(UF2)의 값을 1로 정하는 것이 적절하다.
데이터의 연관성과 강도를 감안하여 UF3은 1로 정했다.
a) 변경 인자(MF, modifying factor):
 - MF = UF1 x UF2 x UF3 또는
 - MF = 10 x 1 x 1 = 10
 - TI = NOAEL/MF 또는 TI = 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d/10 = 0.64 ㎎/㎏/d
b) 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF, utilization factor):
 - UTF = CEF(concomitant exposure factor)xPEF(proportional exposure factor)
 - CEF = 0.2
 - PEF = 1
 - UTF = 0.2 x 1 = 0.2
c) 허용 노출량(TE, tolerable exposure):
 - TE = TI x BW x UTF
 - TE = 0.64 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2 = 9 ㎎/d
d) 허용 한도(AL, allowable limit):
 - 각각의 경우별로 제16장(ISO 10993-17)을 적용한 유익성 인자(benefit factor, BF)의 활용을 
포함한다. 이 경우에 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대한 TE 달성이 가능하므로, BF는 1의 값으로 정
한다. AL 계산은 다음과 같다.
 - AL = TE x BF
 - AL = 9 x 1 = 9 ㎎/d, 24시간 미만 노출
 - 반복 투여 시에 70 ㎏ 성인에 대한 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d의 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)을 토대
로 아만성/생식 독성 데이터에서 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)을 도출한 경우에 이 한
계 기준을 적용할 수 있다.
H.4.1.2
장기 노출 한계 기준
24시간부터 30일까지의 노출에 대한 허용 한도(AL, allowable limit)는 3.8 ㎎/d이며, 특정일에 9 
㎎/d를 넘지 않아야 하고 30일 기간 동안 114 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 한다(3.8 ㎎ x 30 d). 이 한계 
기준은 여러 종을 상대로 실시한 아만성 독성 및 생식 영향 데이터(기형성)를 바탕으로 한다. 많
은 연구자들이 연구 데이터를 발표했다(참고문헌 [8], [10], [18], [38], [83], [85], [103], 
[145], [203]). 최대 403일까지 지속된 반복 경구 및 주사 투여 실험에서 에틸렌클로로히드린은 
사망(한 실험에서 상대 장기 중량 증가, 반점이 있고 검게 변한 간, 출혈성 부신, 출혈성 뇌하수
체, 출혈성 위장관, 심근염, 갑상선 충혈, 충혈성 폐 변화 동반)을 포함하여 다양한 부정적 영향을 
유발했다. 또한 에틸렌클로로히드린으로 인하여 체질량 및 성장 감소, 뇌/부신/신장/폐/갑상선 중
량 증가, 고환 크기 감소 또는 고환 손상, 구토, 헤모글로빈/PCV(packed cell value)/혈소판 감

량 범위는 약 2.7 ㎎/㎏/d에서 93 ㎎/㎏/d 이상이었다. 생식 실험은 다양한 임신 기간에 에틸렌클
로로히드린을 투여하여 기형 형성을 조사한 것이었다. 이들 연구에서 에틸렌클로로히드린은 모체 
독성과 태아 독성을 유발했으며, 한 연구에서는 태아 기형의 증가가 나타났다. 120 ㎎/㎏/d 용량
의 에틸렌클로로히드린을 마우스 새끼에게 정맥 투여한 경우에만 태아 기형이 관찰되었는데, 이 용
량은 급성 치사 범위에 속한다(참고문헌 [80] 참조). 장기 노출 한계 기준 계산의 토대가 되었던 데
이터가 표 H.2에 요약되어 있다.
표 H.2 에틸렌클로로히드린의 장기 노출 한계 기준 설정에 사용한 데이터

| 연구 유형 | 경구 NOAEL ㎎/㎏/d [참고문헌] | 주사 NOAEL ㎎/㎏/d [참고문헌] |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 아만성(Subchronic) | 13 [145] | 2.7, 6.4의 비례 배분, 주당 3회 [103] |
| 생식(Reproductive) | 50 [38] | 9 [83] |

이들 데이터를 검토한 결과, 장기 노출 기간(즉, 1일부터 30일) 동안 에틸렌클로로히드린의 관찰
되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)은 노출 경로나 표적 장기 또는 생식 영향에 상관없이 유사했다. 
동물은 생식에 대한 부정적 영향보다는 에틸렌클로로히드린의 일반 전신 독성에 더 민감한 것으
로 보인다. Lawrence 등
[103]
이 실시한 아만성 실험에서는 이들이 전에 실시한 실험에서 나타난 
64 ㎎/㎏의 LD50를 활용해 계산한 1/10 용량인 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d를 활용했다. 이 실험에서 30일 동안 
1주에 3일씩 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d 용량의 에틸렌클로로히드린에 노출시킨 결과, 주사 투여 시의 관찰되지 
않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 계산값은 2.7 ㎎/㎏/d였다. 랫드에서 구한 이 용량을 다음과 같이 장
기 노출 시의 AL 계산에 적용했다.
NOAEL = 6.4 ㎎/㎏/d x 3d/7d = 2.7 ㎎/㎏/d
불확정 인자(UF):
 - UF1(사람의 개인별 변동성) = 
10
 - UF2(종간 변동성) =
1
 - UF3(데이터의 품질/연관성) =
 
1
여기에서 적용한 불확정 인자(UF)는 일자와 근거가 동일하기 때문에 제한 노출 부분에 적용했던 
것과 동일하다.
a) 변경 인자(MF, modifying factor):
 - MF = UF1 x UF2 x UF3
 - MF = 10 x 1 x 1 = 10
 - TI = NOAEL/MF 또는 TI = 2.7 ㎎/㎏/d/10 = 0.27 ㎎/㎏/d
b) 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF, utilization factor):
 - UTF = CEF(concomitant exposure factor)xPEF(proportional exposure factor)
- 213 -

 - CEF = 0.2
 - PEF = 1
 - UTF = 0.2 x 1 = 0.2
c) 허용 노출량(TE, tolerable exposure):
 - TE = TI/MF x BW x UTF
 - TE = 0.27 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2 = 3.8 ㎎/d
d) 허용 한도(AL, allowable limit):
 - 각각의 경우별로 제16장(ISO 10993-17)을 적용한 유익성인자(benefit factor, BF)의 활용을 
포함한다. 이 경우에 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대한 TE 달성이 가능하므로, 유익성인자(BF)는 1
의 값으로 정한다. AL 계산은 다음과 같다.
 - AL = TE x BF
 - AL = 3.8 x 1 = 3.8 ㎎/d, 30일 이내
 - 만성 vs. 장기 노출 시에 에틸렌클로로히드린에 의한 독성이 증가되지 않으므로, 이 한계 기준
은 70 ㎏인 사람을 적절하게 보호한다고 볼 수 있다. 이 한계 기준은 동물 데이터를 바탕으로 
정한 것이다.
H.4.1.3
영구 노출 한계 기준
30일 이상부터 평생 동안의 영구 노출 허용 한도(AL)는 10 g이며, 어떤 날도 9 ㎎/d를 넘지 않
아야 하고 1개월 동안 114 ㎎을 넘지 않아야 한다. 이 한계 기준은 참고문헌 [81], [116], 
[133]에 제시된 만성 독성, 유전 독성, 발암성 데이터를 바탕으로 한 것이다. 에틸렌클로로히드린
을 음용수에 섞어 24개월 연령까지 랫드에 투여했고, 최소 1년 동안 1주에 2회 에틸렌클로로히드
린을 피하 주사로 랫드에 투여했으며, 103주에서 104주 동안 에틸렌클로로히드린을 랫드와 마우
스 피부에 투여했다. 이들 연구에서 에틸렌클로로히드린 투여와 관련된 종양 발생률 증가나 만성 
독성 증거가 발견되지 않았다.(생존율 감소 제외)(참고문헌 [81] 참조) 예측적 영구 노출 한계 기
준 계산의 근거가 된 핵심 데이터가 표 H.3에 요약되어 있다.
이들 데이터를 검토한 결과, 경구 및 주사 경로에 의한 영구 노출(즉 30일부터 평생) 시의 에틸렌
클로로히드린 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)은 유사했다. 또한 이들 데이터는 아만성 및 생
식 독성 실험에서 도출한 것과 유사했다. 동물은 발암성보다 에틸렌클로로히드린의 일반 전신 독
성에 더 민감했다.
표 H.3 에틸렌클로로히드린의 영구 노출 한계 기준 설정에 사용된 데이터

2.9 ㎎/㎏/d와 24개월 연령까지 랫드에 경구 투여했을 때의 종양 생성 LOAEL인 16 ㎎/㎏/d를 
적용하여, 영구 노출 허용 한도 기준을 10 g으로 계산했다.
LOAEL = 2.9 ㎎/㎏/d
불확정 인자(UF):
 - UF1(사람의 개인별 변동성) = 
10
 - UF2(종간 변동성) =
10
 - UF3(데이터의 품질/연관성) = 1
사람의 개인간 변동성에 대한 불확정 인자 1(UF1)을 10으로 정했는데, 이 값은 동물에서의 중앙
값으로부터 도출한 것이며 사람 사이의 변동성도 유사하리라고 가정했기 때문이다.
종간 변동성에 대한 불확정 인자 2(UF2)는 10으로 정했는데, 사람이 에틸렌클로로히드린에 노출
된 이후 대사 활성에 미치는 장기 영향을 명확히 알 수 없기 때문이다. 저농도의 에틸렌클로로히
드린은 간에서 효소 반응에 의하여 S-카르복시메틸글루타치온(S-carboxymethlygluthathione)으
로 되면서 독성이 제거된다(참고문헌 [81])고 생각되나, 이는 평생 노출에 외삽하기에 충분하지 
않다.
UF3은 1로 정했는데, 데이터의 연관성과 강도를 감안하면 적절하다.
a) 변경 인자(MF, modifying factor):
 - MF = UF1 x UF2 x UF3
 - MF = 10 x 10 x 1 = 100
 - TI = LOAEL/MF 또는 2.9 ㎎/㎏/d/100 = 0.029 ㎎/㎏/d
b) 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF, utilization factor):
 - UTF = CEF(concomitant exposure factor)xPEF(proportional exposure factor)
 - CEF = 0.2
 - PEF = 1
 - UTF = 0.2 x 1 = 0.2
c) 허용 노출량(TE, tolerable exposure):
 - TE = TI/MF x BW x UTF
 - TE = 2.9 ㎎/㎏/d/100 x 70 ㎏ x 0.2 = 0.4 ㎎/d
d) 허용 한도(AL, allowable limit):
 - 각각의 경우별로 제15장을 적용한 유익성 인자(benefit factor, BF)의 활용을 포함한다. 이 경우
에 에틸렌클로로히드린에 대한 허용 노출량(TE) 달성이 가능하므로, BF는 1의 값으로 정한다. 
AL 계산은 다음과 같다.
 - AL = TE x BF


 - AL = 9 x 1 = 9 ㎎/d, 1일 한계
 - AL = 2.9 ㎎/㎏/d/100 x 70 ㎏ x 0.2 x 25000 d = 10 g, 평생
이 예측적 한계 기준(9 ㎎/d와 10 g/평생)을 검토한 결과, 9 ㎎/d는 영구 노출에 따른 에틸렌클로
로히드린의 부정적 영향을 적절하게 방지할 수 있다고 판단되었다. 그러므로 이 한계 기준은 동물 
데이터에 근거한 영구 노출에 따른 에틸렌클로로히드린의 부정적 영향으로부터 70 ㎏ 성인을 최
소 100배의 안전 마진으로 보호한다.

H.5 허용접촉한계(TCL, tolerable contact limit)의 계산
에틸렌클로로히드린의 자극 영향에 관한 데이터는 별로 없었다. 허용접촉한계(TCL) 계산은 의미
가 있는데, 허용접촉한계(TCL) 도출 한계 기준은 표면 접촉성 제품과 이식성 제품에 적절한 것으
로 가정했다.

[61]
는 희석하지 않은 에틸렌클로로히드린을 토끼 피부에 투여했을 때 유의미하지 않은 자극 
반응이 발생했다고 보고했다. 하지만 에틸렌클로로히드린을 피내 주사 및 근육 주사했을 때는 주
사 부위에 강력한 자극 반응이 발생했다. 에틸렌클로로히드린 용액을 희석하여 피내 조직과 음경 
점막에 가했을 때는 변조 반응이 발생했다. 최대 80%까지 희석했을 때는 아무런 자극 반응이 발
생하지 않았다고 많은 연구자가 보고했다(참고문헌 [59], [61], [102], [103]). 에틸렌클로로히
드린을 평균 68 ㎎/㎏ 용량으로 토끼 피부에 투여했을 때 LD50에 미미한 영향만이 있었으나 국
소 자극 반응은 관찰되지 않았다. 이는 에틸렌클로로히드린이 매우 빠르게 흡수되어 간에서 독성 
대사산물로 빠르게 전환되었기 때문이라고 생각되었다. 이들은 피내 및 드레이즈 눈 자극 실험을 
실시했는데, 희석하지 않은 에틸렌클로로히드린에서는 자극 점수가 매우 높게 나타났다. 하지만 
5%와 1%(부피 기준) 에틸렌클로로히드린 용액은 각기 자극이 미미했거나 거의 없었다. 이는 에
틸렌클로로히드린이 피내 및 눈 조직에 대한 자극성이 매우 높다는 것을 의미한다. 그러므로 에틸
렌클로로히드린의 비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level)과 최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally 
irritating level) 농도 각각에 대한 허용접촉한계(TCL)와 피내 허용접촉한계(TCL)를 도출한다.
다음과 같은 방식으로 에틸렌클로로히드린의 허용접촉한계(TCL)를 도출했다. 변경 인자(MF) 방
식으로 허용접촉한계(TCL)를 계산한다. 이 방식은 UF(상기 참조)를 통합하여 자극에 대한 적정

Lawrence 등[103]은 최대 80% 에틸렌클로로히드린 용액을 토끼 피부에 3.27 cm2(0.5 in2) 당 
0.2 ㎖ 용량으로 투여했다. 이는 3.27 cm2 당 에틸렌클로로히드린 160 ㎎에 해당되며, 피부에서
는 아무런 자극도 관찰되지 않았으므로 비 자극 수준(NIL, non-irritating level)은 다음과 같이 
계산된다.
NIL = 80% 용액 = 0.2 ㎖ x 80 g/100 ㎖ = 160 ㎎ 용량
그러므로 허용접촉한계(TCL)은 다음과 같다.
TCL = 160 ㎎/(10 x 3.27 cm2) = 4.89 ㎎/cm2
그러므로 허용접촉한계(TCL)는 5 ㎎/cm2에 해당된다.
Lawrence 등[103]은 에틸렌클로로히드린의 여러 희석액을 사용해 토끼를 상대로 이차 피내 자극 
실험을 실시했다. 이 실험에서는 모든 희석액이 상당한 국소 피부 자극을 유발하여, 일부 예외를 
제외하고는 국소 조직 괴사로 이어졌다. 표준 점수 평가 방법에 따르면, 1%와 5% 에틸렌클로로
히드린 용액은 각기 자극을 유발하지 않거나 자극이 최소 수준이었다(의심스러운 수준). 이는 국
소 지역의 에틸렌클로로히드린 유지성 때문으로 생각되었는데, 이들 성분이 이후에 생체 전환되지 
않아 독성 국소 조직 반응으로 이어졌다고 보았다. 이차 실험을 통해 얻은 피내 용량 데이터를 토
대로 최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally irritating level) 을 계산했다.
MIL = 0.5% 용액 = 0.2 ㎖ x 5 g/100 ㎖ = 10 ㎎ 피내 에틸렌클로로히드린


- 218 -
이는 동물 당 10 ㎎ 용량에서는 피내 노출 때문에 자극이 발생하지 않음을 의미한다. 이때 토끼
의 체중을 2.5 ㎏으로 했다. 다음에 원래의 TCL과 같은 불확정 인자(UF)를 적용하면, 사람에 대
한 TCL이 다음과 같이 계산된다.
피내 TCL = 토끼 용량(㎎/㎏)/MFTCL x 70 ㎏(사람)
피내 TCL = [(10 ㎎/2.5 ㎏)/100] x 70 ㎏(사람)
피내 TCL = 17.5 ㎎/㎏
이는 사람의 피내 최소 자극 수준(MIL, minimally irritating level) 이 17.5 ㎎/㎏임을 의미한다.

에틸렌글리콜 허용 한도 기준 설정8)
(Establishment of allowable limits for EG)
I.1 배경
비발암성 기반 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린 한계 기준 설정 방법으로 의료기기 중의 
에틸렌글리콜 잔류물 한계 기준을 정했다. 에틸렌글리콜은 유전 독소가 아니며(참고문헌 [17], 
[135], [136]), 동물 생체 분석에서 암 유발성을 전혀 보이지 않았고(참고문헌 [41]), 발암성 성
분으로 간주되지 않는다.(참고문헌 [135]와 [136]) 이러한 이유 이외에도 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 
의료기기의 제조에 사용되는 대다수 재료는 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리콜로 전환되는 것이 유
의미하지 않으므로 에틸렌글리콜의 허용 한도 기준 설정이 필요하다고 생각되지 않는다. 이 부록
에서는 에틸렌옥사이드와 에틸렌클로로히드린 허용 한도 기준 설정 시에 채택한 것과 같은 방법
으로, 에틸렌글리콜 허용 한도 기준이 에틸렌옥사이드 및 에틸렌클로로히드린에 비해 유의미하게 
높으며 대개는 이 정도 수준에 도달할 가능성이 없음을 설명한다.
일부 천연 재료(예, 콜라겐, 면 등)가 에틸렌옥사이드 멸균 의료기기의 제조에 사용되는 경우, 매
우 높은 농도의 에틸렌글리콜이 존재할 가능성이 있다. 제조업체는 이와 같은 높은 수준의 에틸렌
글리콜이 검출되면 그 때문에 환자에게 위해가 되거나 제품 성능에 부정적인 영향이 없도록 해야 
한다.
I.2 공통 사항
I.2.1 개요
급성 독성 데이터와 반복 독성 데이터에 의하면, 에틸렌글리콜이 매우 강력한 화합물은 아니더라
도 구강 및 주사 노출 이후에 전신 순환될 가능성이 있다. LD50 값과 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수
준(NOAEL)을 검토한 결과, 특정 시점, 제한 노출 등의 조건에서 에틸렌글리콜 역가는 구강 경로
와 주사 경로에 의한 노출 모두에서 유사한 것으로 나타났다. 아만성 및 만성 독성 실험 데이터에 
의거하면, 에틸렌글리콜은 노출 기간 증가에 따라 더 큰 영향을 발휘하는 것으로 보이지 않는다. 
에틸렌글리콜의 주된 표적 장기는 신장이다.
I.2.2 제한 노출
24시간 미만의 노출 시에 에틸렌글리콜이 건강 위해를 유발할 가능성은 거의 없다. 이러한 결론
은 여러 동물 종을 대상으로 실시하여 얻은 급성 독성 데이터와 에틸렌글리콜 또는 에틸렌글리콜 
함유 제품을 사람이 섭취한 이후에 나타난 중독 증상에 관한 각종 문헌을 바탕으로 한 것이다(참
고문헌 [85], [101], [116], [160], [162], [203], [204]). 또한 에틸렌글리콜을 섭취한 사람의 
사망과 관련된 보고도 많이 있다. 이들 데이터에 근거하여 추정한 에틸렌글리콜의 치사 용량 추정
치는 1.4 ㎖/㎏(참고문헌 [160] 참조) 또는 성인 기준 약 111 g이다. 하지만 사람의 에틸렌글리

하다고간주되지않지만, 완전성확보차원에서이정보를포함시킨다.

콜 대사 포화는 125 ㎎/㎏에서 나타나며(참고문헌 [20]과 [148]), 안전 수준 설정 측면에서 인체 
데이터가 항상 더 설득력이 있으므로, 다음과 같은 제한 노출 시의 허용 한도 기준 계산 시에 이 
용량을 적용했다.
NOAEL = 125 ㎎/㎏/d
불확정 인자(UF)
 - UF1(사람의 개인별 변동성) = 
10(기본값)
 - UF2(종간 변동성) =
1(인체 데이터 활용 가능)
 - UF3(데이터의 품질/연관성) = 1(관련 데이터)
변경 인자(MF, modifying factor)
 - MF = UF1 x UF2 x UF3 또는 MF = 10 x 1 x 1 또는 MF = 10
 - TI = NOAEL/MF 또는 TI = 12.5 ㎎/㎏/d/10 또는 TI = 12.5 ㎎/㎏/d
의료기기 활용 인자(UTF, utilization factor)
 - UTF = CEF(concomitant exposure factor) x PEF(proportional exposure factor)
 - CEF = 0.2(기본값)
 - PEF = 1(1일 노출)
 - UTF = 0.2
허용 노출량(TE, tolerable exposure)
 - TE = TI x BW x UTF 또는 TE = 12.5 ㎎/㎏/d x 70 ㎏ x 0.2 
또는 TE = 175 ㎎/d
허용 한도(AL, allowable limit)
 - BF(benefit factor) = 1(기본값)
 - AL = TExBF 또는 AL = 175 ㎎/d x 1 또는 AL = 175 ㎎/d 또는 175 ㎎/제품
이 노출 한계 기준을 검토한 결과, 사람이 의료기기에 제한적으로 노출되어 이렇게 많은 에틸렌글
리콜에 노출될 가능성은 거의 없다고 판단되었다.
I.2.3
장기 노출
에틸렌글리콜의 장기 노출 한계 기준은 아만성 독성 및 생식 독성 동물 실험 데이터를 검토하여 
정했다.(최기형성, 우성 치사, 생식 독성)(참고문헌 [42], [55], [67], [115], [122], [137],

질소가 흘러나온 바이알을 위로 향해 있는 주사기 바늘에 놓고 에틸렌옥사이드 10 μL를 그 바이

4.4에 기술되어 있는 원리에 따라 용출물을 준비한다. 
K.4.2 사용조건을 모의하기 위한 용출법
제품 사용 상황을 모의할 때 물을 사용한다. 예정 사용 상황을 최대한 모의한 조건에서 용출한다.
예를 들어, 비경구용 의료기기와 혈액 접촉 의료기기의 경우, 물 또는 기타 수성 액체를 혈액이나 
유체 경로에 흘려보내어 쏟아져 나오게 하거나 완전히 채워서 (적합한 경우) 용출한다.
주) 완전히 채우는 경우에는 빈 공간이 없는 지 확인한다.
사용자 또는 환자와 접촉을 하는 의료기기의 부분을 채울 수 없는 경우에는 그 제품 전부 또는 
핵심적이고 대표적인 부분을 적합한 용기에 넣고 물을 붓는다. 적절한 검체/용출액 비율
(sample/extraction fluid ratio)이 확보되도록 한다. 큰 제품의 작은 일부를 시험하여 얻은 자료
의 신뢰성을 확인하기 위해 의료기기의 대표 부분을 몇 부분 이용한다.
3.4.6.2에 기술된 바에 따라 사용 상황을 최대한 모의한 온도에서 최대 단일 사용 시간에 해당되
거나 이를 초과하는 시간 동안 용출을 실시한다. 또는 보다 짧은 여러 기간을 대표하는 일련의 용
출물을 만들어(최소 3개 권장), 이를 바탕으로 장기간의 영향 또는 매일 반복되는 노출의 영향을 
계산한다.
평가를 곧바로 시행하지 않는 경우에는 검체에서 용출물을 가만히 따라내고, 검체를 격막 마개가 
있는 바이알(PTFE 라이닝)에 넣어 밀봉한다. 표준액이나 용출액이 담긴 바이알의 헤드스페이스는 
전체 부피의 10% 미만이어야 한다. 용출액을 냉장(5±3℃) 보관한다. 시험자는 유효기간과 보관 
기간을 확립해야 한다. 물로 용출할 때는 수성 용출액의 보관 시에 에틸렌옥사이드가 에틸렌글리
콜나 에틸렌클로로히드린 또는 이 둘 모두로 전환될 수 있으므로, 에틸렌옥사이드 분석 시에 주의
해야 한다.

K.4.3 열 용출에 의한 완전 용출 과정
검체 1 g을 0.1 ㎎ 수준까지 측정하고 마개와 격막이 있는 바이알에 넣고 적정 온도에서 적절한 
시간 동안 오븐에서 가열한다. 시간/온도 조건은 임의로 정한다. 에틸렌옥사이드의 평형 헤드스페
이스 분압을 달성할 수 있게 시간을 다양하게 조정한다.
바이알을 오븐에서 꺼내고 헤드스페이스 기체 100 μL를 취해 기체 크로마토그래피 칼럼에 주입
하여 에틸렌옥사이드 피크의 면적이나 높이를 구한다. 2회 반복하고 평균을 구한다.
주) 주입 시에 칼럼 패킹 물질이 바늘에 묻어나오지 않도록 주의한다. 오븐에서 꺼낸 직후 뜨거운 
검체를 시험할 때, 20% 이상의 오차가 발생할 수 있다. 주사기를 바이알에서 꺼낼 때 압력이 실
내 압력과 평형을 이루면서 일부 물질의 손실이 발생하기 때문이다. 온도가 실온과 평형을 이룰 
때 일부 물질은 에틸렌옥사이드를 다시 흡수한다. 또한 냉각시키면 바이알의 에틸렌옥사이드를 완
전히 흡수하는 것으로 보이는 물질도 있다. 이런 물질을 분석할 때는 검체와 표준물질이 뜨거운 
상태에 있을 때 칼럼에 주입하고 추가 냉각 없이 퍼징(상기 참조)을 할 필요가 있다.
자동화 헤드스페이스 분석 장치가 있다. 하지만 수작업으로 할 수도 있다.
후드 안에서 바이알의 뚜껑을 제거하고 건조 질소(dry nitrogen)로 30초간 바이알을 정화시킨다. 
새로운 격막을 사용해 뚜껑을 다시 덮고, 가열과 주입을 반복한다. 최초 용출량의 10% 미만에 해
당되는 에틸렌옥사이드가 용출될 때까지, 또는 누적 잔류물 수준이 분석학적으로 유의미하게 증가
되지 않을 때가 되어야 용출이 완전하게 되었다고 볼 수 있다. 가열한 검체를 각각을 분석하여 구
한 평균 피크 면적이나 피크 높이 측정값을 토대로 에틸렌옥사이드 값을 구하고 이를 합하여 표
준 곡선을 참고로 검체 중의 에틸렌옥사이드를 계산한다.
K.4.4 에탄올을 이용하여 완전 용출 후 에탄올 용출물의 헤드스페이스 가스 분석
K.4.4.1 교정 표준액(calibration standards)
에틸렌옥사이드를 에탄올로 희석하여 0.4 μg/㎖, 0.8 μg/㎖, 1.2 μg/㎖, 1.6 μg/㎖, 2.0 μg/㎖ 농
도로 에틸렌옥사이드를 함유하는 에틸렌옥사이드 표준액을 조제한다. K.3.3에 기술된 바에 따라  
0.5㎕/㎖ 농도로 에탄올에 프로필렌 옥사이드(propylene oxide, PO)가 함유되어있는 표준액을 조제
한다. 
적당한 개수의 특수 헤드스페이스 병(그림 K.1 참조)과 이들 표준 용액을 드라이아이스/이소프로판
올 (isopropanol) 용액이나 이에 상응하는 것에 냉각시킨다. 각각의 적당한 에틸렌옥사이드 표준 
용액 분취량과 프로필렌 옥사이드(PO) 표준 용액을 동일한 양으로 헤드스페이스 병에 옮긴다. 7
0℃에서 30분 동안 헤드스페이스 병을 가열하고, 기체 크로마토그래피의 칼럼으로 각각의 병에서 
희석시킨 헤드스페이스 가스의 분취량을 100㎕에서 1㎖까지 똑같이 주입한다. 에틸렌옥사이드와 
프로필렌 옥사이드(PO)의 피크 높이 또는 피크 면적을 측정하고 피크 높이 또는 피크 면적 비율(X
축)과 에틸렌옥사이드 농도(Y축)의 그래프를 그려 검량선(calibration line)을 구한다.
에틸렌옥사이드 표준액에 프로필렌 옥사이드(PO)를 첨가하여 에틸렌옥사이드 표준액 조제의 정확
성을 평가하는 내부표준액으로 사용한다. 표준액의 목표 에틸렌옥사이드 농도에 대비한 에틸렌옥


- 233 -
사이드/프로필렌 옥사이드(PO) 비율의 그래프가 선형 상관 계수 r이 1,000이고 y = 0.5x + 0인 
선형 함수를 보이는 것이 이상적이다. 이런 변수값에서는 기울기가 0.5이고 y절편이 0인 완전한 
직선의 검량선이 만들어진다. y절편이 0이고 기울기가 0.5보다 크면, 에틸렌옥사이드 표준액 모두
가 목표 농도보다 낮다는 의미이다. y절편이 0이고 기울기가 0.5보다 작으면, 에틸렌옥사이드 표
준액 모두가 목표 농도보다 크다는 의미이다. y절편이 0보다 크거나 작은 검량선인 경우, 에틸렌
옥사이드 검체 결과가 실제 농도보다 크거나 작게 나온다. 에틸렌옥사이드 검체 농도가 작은 경우
에 특히 그렇다. y절편과 0 사이의 거리에 따라 부정확도가 달라진다. 프로필렌 옥사이드(PO) 피
크 면적이나 높이 자체는 상대적으로 일정하게 유지되어야 한다. 프로필렌 옥사이드(PO) 피크 높
이나 면적이 변동성을 보이면, 기체 크로마토그래피에 주입되는 검체의 양이 다르다는 의미이다. 
하지만 현재의 기체 크로마토그래피 기술 수준에서는 이 부분은 문제가 되지 않는다.
K.4.4.2 분석 절차
검체 5 g(또는 0.5 g)을 취하여 0.1 ㎎ 수준으로 측정하고 작은 조각(튜빙은 길이 5 ㎜, 시트는 
10 ㎜2)으로 자른 후에 100 ㎖(또는 10 ㎖) 용량의 헤드스페이스 병에 넣는다. 이 병에 PO 표준 
용액(0.25 μg/㎖) 50 ㎖(또는 5 ㎖)을 첨가한다. 뚜껑을 닫고 단단히 조인 다음 밀봉된 병을 부드
럽게 흔들며 70℃에서 3시간 동안 가열한다. 기체 크로마토그래피의 칼럼으로 헤드스페이스 가
스의 검체를 100㎕에서 1㎖까지 똑같이 주입하고, 에틸렌옥사이드/PO의 피크 비율을 측정한
다. 검량선(calibration line)을 참조하여 검체 분석 값(2회 측정)으로부터 평균 에틸렌옥사이드 
함량을 계산한다.

제8장 잠재적 분해산물의 확인과 정량을 위한 체제
(관련규격: ISO 10993-9:2009)
1 적용범위
본 장은 생분해 시험의 실행과 설계 그리고 의료기기에서 관찰된 생분해 및 생분해 잠재성을 체계
적으로 평가하기 위한 기본 원리를 제시한다. 이러한 시험에서 얻은 정보는 「의료기기 생물학적 
안전에 관한 공통기준규격」에 제시된 생물학적 평가에 사용될 수 있다. 본 장은 비흡수성 및 흡
수성 원자재에 대하여 설명한다.
다음과 같은 경우에는 본 장을 적용하지 않는다.
1) 기계적 과정에 의해 생성되는 분해산물에 대한 평가; 가능한 경우, 이러한 유형의 분해산물의 
생성에 관한 방법은 개별 기준규격(specific product standards)에 설명되어 있다. 
주 1) 기계적 분해는 일반적으로 미립물질을 생성시킨다. 이 부분이 본 장의 적용 범위에서 제외
되기는 했지만, 이러한 분해산물은 생물학적 반응을 일으킬 수 있으므로, 본 규격의 다른 장에 
설명된 대로 생물학적 평가를 실시할 필요가 있다.
2) 분해 산물이 아닌 용출 성분(leachable components)
3) 환자의 신체에 직ㆍ간접적으로 접촉하지 않는 의료기기 또는 성분
주 2) 본 장은 「의료기기 생물학적 안전에 관한 공통기준규격」제1장의 정의에 포함되는 제품에 
사용된 원자재의 분해에 적용할 수 있다. 물론 이러한 제품들은 조직공학제품(tissue 
engineered medical product)의 지지체(scaffold) 또는 약물이나 생물제제를 전달하는 운반 
매트릭스(carrier matrix)에 적용되는 규정과는 다른 규정을 따른다. 
2 정의
본 장에서는 이 규격의 제1장(ISO 10993-1)과 다음의 용어 및 정의가 적용된다.
2.1 분해(degradation) 
원자재의 분해
2.2 생분해(biodegradation)  
생물학적 환경에 기인하는 분해
2.3 생체 흡수성(bioresorbable) 의료기기 
인체의 생물학적 환경에서 분해되고 흡수되는 의료기기
2.4 용출물(leachable) 


- 255 -
분해 산물이 아닌 원자재에서 용출할 수 있는 성분
2.5 부식(corrosion) 
화학적 반응이나 전기화학적 반응에 의한 금속성 원자재에 대한 공격
주) 간혹 본 용어는 다른 원자재의 분해와 관련하여 일반적인 의미로 사용되기도 하지만, 본 장에
서는 금속성 원자재에 관한 것으로만 제한된다.
2.6 물질(substance) 
단일 화학 원소 또는 화합물, 또는 화합물의 복합 구조
2.7 의료기기 구성품(device component) 
의료기기를 구성하고 있는 서로 다른 부분 가운데 하나
2.8 분해산물(degradation product) 
본래 원자재의 화학적 파괴로 인해 유도된 화학적 화합물 또는 입자
2.9 사용 환경(service environment) 
체액 주변, 조직 및 생체분자(biomolecules)를 포함하여 의료기기가 의도적으로 사용되는 해부학
적 위치
3 분해 시험의 설계에 관한 원리
3.1 개요
분해 평가에 접근하는 방법은 조사 대상 원자재의 특성, 의료기기 및 특정 의료기기의 인체적용 
위치에 따라 다양하다. 평가를 위해 선정된 모델은 의료기기의 사용 환경을 대표해야 한다. 수행
하여야할 시험이 생물학적 환경을 필요로 하지는 않으나, 생물학적 환경의 조건을 모의 실험하는 
시험도 있다. 일부 분해 과정에서 체외 모델은 사용 환경의 모든 측면을 반영하지 않을 수 있다. 
예를 들어, 기계적 과정들은 생분해에 영향을 미칠 수 있으므로, 모델 사용 환경을 정할 때 반드
시 고려해야 한다. 
분해 연구를 설계할 때에는 분해산물의 정성 및 정량에 대해 기술하고 있는 원자재별 또는 제품
별 분해 표준을 사용하도록 한다. 적절한 원자재별 규격이 존재하지 않는다면 고분자에 관해서
는 제12장(ISO 10993-13), 세라믹에 대해서는 제13장(ISO 10993-14), 금속과 합금에 대해서는 
제14장(ISO 10993-15)을 적용한다. 두 가지 유형 이상의 원자재로 구성된 의료기기는 관련된 
모든 분해 표준을 고려하여야 한다.
제12장(ISO 10993-13), 제13장(ISO 10993-14) 및 제14장(ISO 10993-15)은 의료기기 완제품
의 화학적 변형에 의해 생긴 분해산물만을 고려한다. 이 장들은 기계적 응력, 마모, 전자기방사선
에 의해 사용되는 동안 유도된 의료기기의 분해에는 적용되지 않는다. 이러한 분해를 위해서는 
다른 방법들이 고려되어야 한다. 


- 256 -
3.2 사전 고려사항
의료기기의 생물학적 안전성을 평가하는 데 있어 가장 중요한 것은 원자재의 의도된 분해 가능성 
또는 의도되지 않은 분해 가능성에 대해 신중하게 고려하는 것이다. 본 고려 사항의 일부는 화학
적 특성과 이미 알려져 있는 분해 메커니즘에 관한 평가를 통하여 실험적 생분해 연구의 필요성 
및 설계를 평가하는 것이다. 
모든 의료기기를 대상으로 분해 시험을 반드시 수행해야 하거나 모든 의료기기에 대한 분해 시험
이 실질적으로 도움이 되는 것은 아니다. 분해 시험의 필요성에 관한 고려 사항은 부록 A에 제시
되어 있다. 실험적 분해 시험의 필요성에 대한 평가에는 논문의 검토 및/또는 알려진 임상 경험이 
포함되어야 한다. 문헌에 대한 적절한 검토 지침은 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 제시되어 있다. 대상 
제품에 대한 만족스러운 임상 경험 이력, 새로운 자료, 발표된 자료 그리고 이미 알고 있는 의료
기기와 원자재 그리고 분해 산물의 유사성이 입증된 경우에는 그러한 평가를 통하여 더 이상의 
시험이 필요하지 않다는 결론이 도출될 수 있다.
분해 산물 및 용출물의 생물학적 평가에 대한 지침은 제1장(ISO 10993-1), 제15장(ISO 
10993-16) 및 제16장(ISO 10993-17)에 제시되어 있다. 의료기기 용출물의 용출에 관한 지침은 
제11장(ISO 10993-12)을 참조하고, 의료기기에 사용된 원자재의 화학적 특성과 그 용출물에 관
한 지침은 제12장(ISO 10993-13)을 참조한다. 그리고 원자재의 물리화학적, 형태학적 및 표면상 
특성에 관한 지침은 ISO 10993-19를 참조한다. 분해시험을 수행하기 전, 이러한 규격들을 고려
하면 분해산물에서 용출물을 구분하는데 도움이 될 수 있다.
주) 용출물과 분해 산물 간에 차이가 있지만, 분해 산물에 대한 시험과 용출 성분들에 대한 시험
을 병행할 수 있다. 추가적인 생물학적 평가 시험을 위해 분해산물과 다른 유형의 용출물을 
구분할 필요는 없다. 하지만 위험관리조치로 용출 성분의 수준을 감소시키는 것이 필요하다고 
생각될 때는 이 정보가 중요하다. 
3.3 시험 설계
시험의 목적과 관련하여 완성된 생분해 시험 계획은 3.1에 규명되어 있는 문제를 다루기 위하여 
설계되고, 입증되어야 한다. 시험 계획에는 분해 산물의 특성에 대한 다음의 조사를 통하여 분석
적 방법이 정의되어야 한다.
1) 화학적 특성과 물리화학적 특성

3. 일반원리 - 단계식 접근법
감작 시험과 자극성 시험에 사용할 수 있는 방법은 특히 잠재적인 피부 및 점막의 자극성과 피부 
감작을 측정하기 위해 개발되었다. 일반적으로 다른 유형의 부작용들은 이들 시험으로 예측되지 
않는다. 이식재 또는 체내ㆍ외 연결형 의료기기(external communicating devices)로 사용되는 의
료기기의 경우에는 적용 접근방법에서 피내검사(intradermal testing)가 더 적합하므로, 자극성을 
파악하기 위해서는 5.4에 기술된 것처럼 피내반응시험(intracutaneous testing)을 이용해야 한다. 
본 장에서는 단계적 접근을 요구하고 있고, 아래의 사항들 중 하나 이상이 포함되어야 한다.
1) 
제8장(ISO 
10993-9), 
제12장(ISO 
10993-13), 
제13장(ISO 
10993-14), 
제14장(ISO 
10993-15), 제17장(ISO10993-18)에 기술되어 있는 시험검체의 분석 및 화학적 특성과 관련
된 시험원자재의 특성을 분석함.
2) 의료기기의 원자재뿐만 아니라 구성품의 잠재적 감작성과 자극성에 관한 정보 및 화학적·물리
적 특성에 대한 평가가 포함되어 있는 문헌을 검토함.
3) 제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 따라, 과학적으로 검증되고 합리적이고 실제적으로 이용할 수 있는 
새로운 체외시험이 개발되면 체내 시험에 앞서 체외 시험을 고려하고 체내 시험을 대체한다. 
피부 자극성과 부식의 평가를 위해, 체외 대체시험은 화학물질에 대해 이용 가능하다. 현재까지 
감작제(sensitizer)를 
검출하는 
것 
외에 
국제적으로 
검증되고 
인정된 
체외 
시험법
(internationally validated and accepted in vitro test)은 없다. 
4) 동물체내시험: 재현성과민감성을확보하기위해시험마다(in each assay) 자극및피부


- 266 -
감작성에대한양성대조물질시험을포함시켜시험함으로써시험시스템을검증하고양성반
응을입증하여야한다. 그러나기니피그감작성시험법에서는6개월또는그이상의기간동안
일관성이입증된경우시험마다양성대조군을포함시킬필요는없으나, 6개월을넘지않는
일정한간격을두고양성대조군을포함한시험을시행할수는있다.
주1) 감작성은현재체내(in vivo)시험법에의해서만측정될수있으며, 마우스국소림프절시
험법(local lymph node assay, LLNA), 기니피그폐색첩포시험(occluded patch test) 또는
기니피그극대화시험(guinea pig maximization test, GPMT)을이용하여수행될수있다.
단일화학물질에대한감작능(sensitizing potential)을확인하기위해최근선호되는시험법
은LLNA이다.(참고문헌[69], [88], [90] 참조)
주 2) 시험물질의 특성이 분석될 수 없고 1), 2) 및 3)에서 제시된 방법으로 얻은 정보를 사용
하여 위험 측정(risk assessment)을 할 수 없을 때는 체내 동물 시험이 적합하다. 
주3) 기니피그를사용하는감작성시험의경우, 일반적으로6개월에한번양성대조군으로서
10마리의시험동물이사용된다. 양성대조물질이포함된시험의빈도가6개월에한번이상이
라면기니피그의수를줄여사용할수도있다. 최소5마리의양성대조동물과5마리의대조
동물이사용되어야한다.
5) 비침습적 인체시험 / 임상시험
  만일 시험검체가 동물시험에서 독성 물질, 감작제, 자극제가 아님이 입증되었다면, 인체를 대상
으로 하는 비침습적 피부 자극성 시험을 고려할 수 있다. 
관리기준 ISO 14155-1, ISO 14155-2, 윤리 원칙에 따라 수행되는 임상시험은 1)∼4)에서의 평
가 결과를 알기 전에는 시행되어서는 안 된다. 
4. 예비시험 시의 고려사항
4.1 일반사항
예비시험을 고려하는 과정 중에 자극성 및/또는 감작성 시험이 필요하지 않다는 결론을 내릴 수 
있다.
제1장(ISO 10993-1) 제6항과 아래의 항에 제시되어 있는 필요 조건들이 적용된다.
시험검체의 미생물 오염 가능성이 최종 시험에 대한 해석을 혼란스럽게 할 수 있으므로 비멸균 
검체는 표면적용 시험(topical investigation)에 의해서만 시험되어야 한다. 시험검체의 멸균이 보
장될 수 없지만 검체가 오염되지 않은 것으로 간주되는 경우에, 피내 투여가 정당화될 수 있다.
4.2 시험물질의 유형
4.2.1 초기의 고려 사항
의료기기의제조공정중에추가적인화학적성분, 예를들어, 윤활제나몰드이형제와같은성분


- 267 -
들이사용되는지를고려하여야한다. 이외에도멸균과정에서발생하는반응산물, 멸균잔류물, 조
립시의접착제잔류물, 용매잔류물, 제조과정의보조제및개시제등의화학성분이완제품에남
아있을수있다. 이들성분이위해/위험을나타내는지여부는완제품의누출또는분해특성에달
려있다. 이들성분의잠재적자극성/감작성반응에대해서도고려하여야한다.
4.2.2 세라믹, 금속, 합금
이 시험검체는 일반적으로 화학적 조성의 수가 고분자물질이나 생물학적으로 유도된 시험검체보
다는 덜 복잡하다.
4.2.3 고분자물질
이 물질은 일반적으로 조성의 측면에서 4.2.2항에 제시되어 있는 물질보다는 화학적으로 더 복잡
하다. 수많은 반응 생성물/불순물/첨가제가 존재할 수 있고, 중합의 완전도도 다양할 수 있다.
4.2.4 생물학적으로 유도된 물질
이 물질은 본래 조성이 복잡하다. 이 물질은 종종 공정상의 잔류물(예를 들면 가교제와 항균제)이 
함유되어 있다. 생물학적 물질은 검체마다 균일하지 않다.
이 규격의 시험방법은 생물학적으로 유도된 물질의 시험을 위해 설계된 것들이 아니므로 적절하
지 않을 수 있다. 예를 들어, 이 규격의 시험방법은 교차-종(cross-species) 감작성은 고려하지 
않고 있다.
4.3 화학적 조성에 대한 정보
4.3.1 일반사항
물질의 화학적 조성에 관한 완전한 정성 자료를 확립하여야 한다. 생물학적 안전성과 관련이 있는 
경우에도 정량 자료를 확보하여야 한다. 만일 정량 자료가 확보되지 않으면, 이론적 근거가 제출
되어야 하고, 그 근거는 타당하여야 한다.
4.3.2 기존 자료의 출처
조성에 대한 정성 및 정량 정보는 가능한 한 원자재의 공급자로부터 확보하여야 한다. 
고분자물질의 경우에는 종종 특허 정보에 접근을 해야 할 필요가 있다. 그러한 기밀 정보의 이용 
및 이전에 관한 규정이 만들어져야 한다.
보조 공정 첨가물(예를 들어, 몰드 이형제)에 관한 정성 정보도 마찬가지로 부품 제조업자와 가공
업자(convert)를 포함하여 제조 공정의 구성원들로부터 제공받아야 한다.
조성에 관한 자료가 존재하지 않는 경우에는, 해당 물질에 대한 가장 적절한 분석 방법을 선정하기 
위해 원자재 및 첨가제의 특성 확립에 관한 문헌고찰이 권장된다.
완제품의 화학 조성은 제17장(ISO 10993-18)에 따라 결정되어야 한다.
주) 세라믹, 금속, 그리고 합금의 조성은 ISO나 미국 원자재 시험 학회 (ASTM)의 표준을 따를 


- 268 -
수 있고, 그리고/또는 사용자가 그 조건을 지정할 수도 있다. 그러나 조성에 관한 전체적인 정
성 및 정량 자료를 얻기 위해서는 원자재의 제조업자나 공급업자에게 이를 요구할 필요가 
있고, 공정상 보조제를 확인하기 위해서 부품 제조업자에게도 이를 요구할 필요가 있다. 
원자재 마스터 파일 (master file)에 접근할 수 있는 경우에는 규제 당국이 관리를 하고 있
는 원자재 마스터 파일이 또 하나의 정보 출처가 된다.
5. 자극성 시험
5.1 체외 자극성 시험
체외 방법에서, 랫드의 피부 경피성전기저항(Transcutaneous Electrical Resistance, TER)시험
과 인체유래 인공피부모델시험(Human skin model test)은 화학물질의 피부 부식성을 평가하기 
위한 대안으로 국제적으로 검증되고 인정받은 시험방법이다(OECD 가이드라인 430[9] 와 
431[10]). 
국가 및 국제기관들은 대안적인 방법을 모색함과 동시에 피부 자극성에 대한 체외 시험을 개발하고 
검증하기 위한 작업을 진행하고 있다. 다른 기관들은 비침습 기법을 이용해 종점(endpoint)을 보다 
확실하게 규명하기 위하여 사람과 동물의 반응을 양적으로 측정하는 방법들을 대안으로 개발하고 
있다. (부록 F.1 참조)
주) 2007년 유럽 동물대체시험법검증센터(ECVAM) 과학자문위원회(ESAC)는 화학물질에 대한 피
부 자극성을 규명하기 위해 체외 인체유래 인공피부모델의 검증 과정을 평가하였다(참고문헌 
[101] 참조). 화학물질의 피부유발 잠재성을 평가하기 위해 인체유래 인공피부모델을 사용하
는 체외 시험방법은 부록 D에 설명되어 있다. 
피부 자극성에 대한 체외 시험은 지금까지 단일 화학물질에 대해서만 검증되었고 의료기기 용출
액에 대해서는 검증되지 않았다. 의료기기의 잠재적 자극성을 시험하는데 이러한 시험을 적용하기 
위해서는 이러한 특정 부분에 대한 추가적 검증이 필수적이다. 
5.2 체내 자극성 시험 - 시험의 설계와 선정 시 고려 사항
의료기기의 자극성 시험은 완제품 그리고/또는 완제품의 용출액으로 시행한다. 
자극성 연구의 결과에 영향을 미치는 요인들은 다음과 같다. 
1) 첩포시험(patch test)에 사용되는 의료기기의 특성
2) 시험물질의 투여량
3) 시험물질의 적용방법
4) 폐쇄 정도
5) 적용부위
6) 노출 횟수 및 기간
7) 시험결과를 평가하는데 사용된 기법


- 269 -
추가적인 배경 정보는 부록 F에 제시되어 있다. 
정확한 시험계획과 관련하여 시험의 유연성을 높임으로써, 사용조건과 모집단 노출의 적합성을 꾀
하여 시험의 감도를 증가시킬 수 있는 반면, 시험절차에 일관성을 기하게 되면 실험실간 서로 다
른 시험물질에 대한 시험결과를 비교할 수 있다.
시험은 임상적인 상황에서 예상되는 접촉(시간 및/또는 농도)을 과장하여 설계하여야 하고, 
시험결과를 해석할 때 이를 고려하여야 한다.
시험검체의 pH가 2이하이거나 11.5이상인 경우에는 그 재료는 자극성이 있다고 간주되고 추가적
인 시험은 요구되지 않는다. 그러나 시험재료의 산성/알칼리성에 관한 시험자료만으로는 그 시험
물질이 심각한 손상을 일으키는 것으로 판단할 수는 없다. 시험물질의 접촉기간, 농도, 그리고 다
양한 물리적ㆍ화학적 특성들도 중요한 요소이다.
추가적인 위험 특성 분석 및 측정(risk characterization)이 필요한 예외적인 경우에는 자극성이 
있는 시험물질 또는 앞에서 언급된 pH의 범위를 벗어나는 시험물질에 대한 시험이 필요할 수 있
다. 이러한 경우는 근거가 제시되고 문서화되어야 한다. 
5.3 자극성 동물시험
5.3.1 원리
적합한 동물 모델을 이용하여 피부 자극을 유발하는 시험으로 시험물질의 피부자극 잠재성을 
평가한다.
선호되고 있는 동물 모델은 토끼이다.
5.3.2 시험물질
시험물질이 고체이거나 액체인 경우에는 부록 A에 명시되어 있는 내용에 따라 준비하여야 한다.
시험의 민감도가 증명되어야 하며, 시험의 민감도 증명을 위하여 시험에 양성 대조군을 포함시킬 
수 있다. 그러나 민감도 확인을 위한 양성 대조군은 실험실에서 지난 6개월 이내에 해당 시험 방
법을 사용하여 양성결과를 얻지 못했을 때에만 사용하는 것이 적합하다.
주) 적합한 양성대조군은 SLS(Sodium Lauryl Sulfate)이다.
5.3.3 동물과 관리
동일한 품종으로 암, 수구별 없이 무게 2kg 이상의 젊고 건강한 알비노 토끼 성체를 이용하여야 
한다. 자극성이 예상되는 경우에는 먼저 한 마리 동물로만 시험하는 것을 고려해야 한다. 명확한 
양성 반응[홍반이나 부종 어느 것이든 수치가 2보다 큰 경우 (표 11 참조)]이 관찰되지 않는다면, 
최소 두 마리의 동물을 더 이용하여 시험을 수행하여야 한다. 만약 최소 세 마리의 동물을 이용한 
시험에서도 명확하지 않거나 불분명한 경우에는 추가 시험을 고려하여야 한다.
제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고, 관리하여야 한다.

5.3.4 시험과정
5.3.4.1 동물의 준비
가장 중요한 요소는 피부의 상태이다. 피부가 손상되지 않고 건강한 동물만을 이용한다. 시험부위 
(약 10cm × 15cm)를 모두 이용하고 관찰하기 위하여 24시간∼4시간 이내에 등뼈 양쪽으로 충
분한 거리를 확보할 수 있도록 하여 털을 짧게 깎는다.
 
반복적인 노출에 적응시키고 관찰을 용이하게 하기 위하여 털을 다시 잘라내기도 한다. 탈모제는 
시험기관에서 그 공정이 검증된 경우에 숙련된 전문가에 의해 사용될 수 있다. 반복 노출이 필요한 
경우, 5.3.4.2.1항, 5.3.4.2.2항 또는 5.3.4.2.3항에 제시된 과정에 따라 최대 21일 동안 반복한다.

그림 2 피부 적용부위의 위치
5.3.4.2 시험검체의 적용
5.3.4.2.1 분말 또는 액상검체의 적용
그림 2에 제시된 각각의 시험 피부 부위에 0.5g 또는 0.5ml의 시험물질을 직접 바른다. 단단하고 
소수성인 시험물질의 경우에는 촉촉하게 적실 필요가 없다. 시험물질이 분말인 경우에는 사용하기 
전에 적당한 용매나 물로 약간 적셔야 한다. (부록 A 참조)
2.5cm × 2.5 cm의 비폐쇄드레싱(흡수성 거즈 첩포(patch))으로 적용부위를 덮고 난 후 최소 4
시간 동안 붕대(반폐쇄 또는 폐쇄붕대)로 적용부위를 감싸둔다. 접촉 시간이 끝나면 드레싱을 제거
하고 영구적인 잉크로 부위의 위치를 표시한다. 적당한 비자극성 용매나 미지근한 물로 닦아내는 


것과 같은 적절한 방법을 이용하여 남은 시험물질을 제거하고, 조심스럽게 건조시킨다.
5.3.4.2.2 용출액과 용출용매의 적용
2.5cm × 2.5 cm의 흡수성 거즈 첩포(patch)에 적당한 용출액을 바른다. 충분한 양의 용출액(보통 
첩포 당 0.5g 또는 0.5ml)을 이용하여 거즈를 흠뻑 적신다. 그림 2에 제시된 대로 동물의 양쪽에 
첩포를 하나씩 붙인다. 그림 2에서 가리키는 대로 용출용매로 적신 거즈의 대조군 첩포(patch)를 
붙인다.
최소 4시간 동안 붕대(반폐쇄 또는 폐쇄붕대)로 적용부위를 감싸둔다. 접촉 시간이 끝나면 드레싱을 
제거하고 영구적인 잉크로 부위의 위치를 표시한다. 적당한 비자극성 용매나 미지근한 물로 닦아내
는 것과 같은 적절한 방법을 이용하여 남은 시험물질을 제거하고, 조심스럽게 건조시킨다.
5.3.4.2.3 고형 검체
그림 2에 제시된 피부의 시험부위 각각에 시험물질을 직접 바른다. 동일한 방법으로 각각의 토끼
에 대조군을 바른다. 고체로 시험을 하는 경우(필요한 경우 분쇄하기도 하는), 충분한 피부 접촉을 
위해 물 또는 필요한 경우 대체 용매를 이용하여 시험물질을 충분하게 적셔야 한다.(부록A 참조) 
용매를 사용하는 경우, 시험물질에 의한 피부 자극에 용매가 미치는 영향을 고려해야 한다.
2.5cm × 2.5 cm의 비폐쇄드레싱(거즈 첩포(patch)와 같은)으로 적용부위를 덮고 난 후 최소 4시
간 동안 붕대(반폐쇄 또는 폐쇄붕대)로 적용부위를 감싸둔다. 접촉 시간이 끝나면 드레싱을 제거
하고 영구적인 잉크로 부위의 위치를 표시한다. 적당한 비자극성 용매나 미지근한 물로 닦아내는 
것과 같은 적절한 방법을 이용하여 남은 시험물질을 제거하고, 조심스럽게 건조시킨다.
5.3.5 동물의 관찰
5.3.5.1 일반사항
피부 반응을 시각화하기 위하여 전파장(full-spectrum) 조명이나 자연(natural) 조명을 이용할 것
을 강력히 권장하고 있다. 표 11에 제시되어 있는 수치 체계에 따라 매 시간 간격마다 각각의 적

시간, (72 ± 2)시간 마다 적용부위의 모습을 각각 기록한다. 지속적인 손상이 일어나는 경우에
는 손상의 가역성이나 비가역성을 평가하기 위하여 관찰 기간을 연장할 필요가 있다. 필요한 기
간은 14일을 초과하지 않는다.

| 최대 가능한 자극점수 | 8 |
| 피부 부위에 나타나는 기타 이상 변화는 기록하고 보고한다. |  |

5.3.5.3 반복 노출 시험
반복 노출은 급성 1회 노출 시험이 완료된 이후에 실시되어야 한다(적어도 관찰하고 (72 ± 2)시
간이 지난 후에).
반복 노출 시험의 경우에는 첩포(patch)를 제거하고 (1 ± 0.1)시간 후에 그리고 다음 적용 직전
에 적용부위의 모습을 기록한다. 노출의 횟수는 다양하다.
마지막 노출 후에 첩포(patch)를 제거하고 (1 ± 0.1) 시간, (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 
2)시간 마다 적용부위의 모습을 각각 기록한다. 지속적인 손상이 일어나는 경우에는 손상의 가역
성이나 비가역성을 평가하기 위하여 관찰 기간을 연장할 필요가 있다. 필요한 기간은 14일을 초
과하지 않는다.
5.3.6 결과의 평가
1회 노출 시험의 경우에는 다음과 같이 1차 자극 지수(PII; Primary Irritation Index)를 측정한
다.
(24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간 관찰결과만을 계산에 이용한다. 투여 이전의 관찰 또
는 회복을 감시하기 위하여 72시간이 지난 후에 관찰한 결과는 측정치로 사용하지 않는다.
72시간 등급을 매긴 후에 (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간 관찰된 모든 홍반 등급과 
- 272 -

부종 등급을 더하여 각 시험 검체와 각 동물의 공시험액에 대해 별도로 누계를 낸다. 동물에 대한 
1차 자극 점수는 모든 점수의 총합을 6으로 나누어 산출된다(2회 시험/관찰 부위, 3회 관찰시간
별 점수). 
시험 검체에 대한 1차 자극 지수를 얻기 위해서는 개체별 동물들의 모든 1차 자극 점수를 더하여 
동물의 수로 나눈다(일반적으로 3).  
공시험액 또는 음성 대조군을 사용하는 경우에는 대조군에 대한 1차 피부 자극 점수를 계산하고, 
시험물질에 대한 점수에서 대조군에 대해 계산한 점수를 빼 1차 피부 자극 점수를 구한다. 
반복 노출 시험의 경우에는 모든 평가 점수를 고려하여 각 동물에 대한 1차 자극 점수를 앞에서 언급
한 원칙에 따라 계산해야 한다.
반복 노출에서는 다음과 같이 누적자극지수(Cumulative Irritation Index)를 계산한다.
각 동물의 자극 점수를 더하고 총 동물 숫자로 나눈다. 이 값이 1차 자극 지수(PII)이다.
누적자극지수는 표 12에 명시된 자극반응의 범주와 비교하여 적절한 범주를 보고서에 기록하도록 
한다. 
주) 누적자극지수의 범주는 토끼와 사람 두 종 모두에 대하여 많은 화학물질을 시험하였을 때 나
타난 화학물질에 대한 토끼의 1차자극지수(PII)와 사람의 1차자극반응을 관련시킨 자료에 기
초한 것이다.
어떤 반응의 경우에는, 표 11에 의거하여 각 동물에 대한 최대 1차자극점수, 반응시작시간, 최대반
응 시간을 기록한다.
표 12에 제시된 점수와 설명(반응 범주)은 1차 자극 점수 또는 누적 자극 점수의 특성을 나타내고 
있다. 시험된 용출액이 서로 다른 경우에는 최대 1차 자극 점수를 나타내는 것에 의해 반응 범주가 
결정된다.

5.4.1. 서론
이식재로 사용되는 의료기기는 피내반응시험의 적용이 권고된다. 원자재 용출액의 피내주사 후에 
시험물질이 자극을 일으킬 잠재성에 대하여 평가한다.
5.4.2 시험을 배제하는 경우
피부, 눈 및 점막 자극제나 pH가 ≤2 또는 ≥11.5인 원자재는 피내에 시험하지 않는다. 위험 특성분
석/평가가 필요한 예외적인 경우에는 자극성이 있거나 앞에서 언급한 pH의 범위를 벗어나는 시험
물질에 대해서 시험이 필요할 수 있다. 이러한 경우에는 근거를 제시하고 문서화하여야 한다.
5.4.3 시험검체
시험검체는 부록 A에 제시되어 있는 바에 따라 준비된 용출액이어야 한다. 각 동물에 시험부위가 
여러 군데 있으므로, 적합한 음성 대조군 또는 공시험액과 함께 여러 개의 시험검체가 적용될 수 
있다.
5.4.4 시험동물 및 관리
동일한 혈통으로 암수 구별 없이 무게 2kg 이상의 건강하고 어린 알비노 토끼 성체를 이용하여야 
한다. 제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고, 관리해야 한
다. 처음부터 최소 3마리의 동물을 이용해 시험원자재를 평가해야 한다. 자극성이 예상되는 경우에
는 먼저 한 마리 동물로만 시험하는 것을 고려한다. 명확한 양성 반응[홍반이나 부종 어느 것이든 
수치가 2보다 큰 경우(표 11 참조)]가 관찰되지 않는다면, 최소 2마리의 동물을 더 이용하여 시
험을 수행하여야 한다. 최소 3마리의 동물을 이용한 시험에서 반응이 명확하지 않거나 또는 불분명
한 경우에는 추가 시험을 고려해야 한다.
5.4.5 시험방법
용출액을 주사하기 위하여 시험하기 4시간∼18시간 전에 양쪽 등뼈에서 충분한 거리를 두고 동물
의 등에 있는 털을 깎는다.
극성용매 또는 비극성 용매를 이용하여 얻은 용출액 0.2ml를 각각의 토끼의 한쪽부분에 5군데씩 
피내 주사한다. 피내주사 시에 시험물질의 점도에 맞추어 최대한 작은 바늘을 적절하게 사용한다.

| 최대 가능한 자극 점수 | 8 |
| 피부 부위에 나타나는 기타 이상 변화는 기록하고 보고한다. |  |

5.4.7 결과의 평가
등급을 매기고 (72 ± 2) 시간이 지난 후에 (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간 관찰된 
각각의 시험검체와 용매대조군(vehicle blank) 별로 홍반 등급과 부종 등급을 합산한다. 각각의 개
체별 동물에 대한 시험 검체 또는 공시험액의 점수를 계산하기 위해서는 각각의 총합을 15로 나
눈다(3회 시간별 관찰 점수 x 5회 시험 또는 공시험액 주사 부위). 각 시험 검체와 이에 상응하는 
각 공시험액에 대한 전체 평균 점수를 결정하기 위해서는 3마리의 동물에 대한 점수를 더하여 3
으로 나눈다. 최종 시험 검체 점수는 시험 검체 점수에서 공시험액의 점수를 빼서 얻을 수 있다. 
최종 시험 검체 점수가 1.0 이하이면 시험의 필요조건이 충족된다. 만일 어떠한 관찰 기간에 시험
검체에 대한 평균 반응이 용매대조군에 대한 평균 반응보다 의심스러울 만큼 크다면, 3마리 토끼
를 추가로 사용하여 다시 시험한다. 최종 시험 검체 점수가 1.0 이하라면 시험의 필요조건이 충족
된다.
주) 공시험액 대조 검체는 그림 3에 언급된 것처럼 극성 또는 비극성 용매 대조군이다. 
5.4.8 시험보고서
시험보고서에는 다음 사항이 포함되어야 한다.

5.5 사람 피부 자극성 시험
5.5.1 서론
현재 위험 요인을 규명하기 위하여 사람의 피부 자극성을 예측하는 시험은 주로 시험동물의 사용
에 의존하고 있다 (부록 F 참조). 그러나 동물 자료에 의거하여 사람의 피부 자극성을 추정하는 
데에는 문제가 있다. 사람에게 높은 수준으로 노출되는 화학 물질 (예를 들어, 화장품이나 세제)의 
경우에는 종종 사람의 피부 첩포(patch) 시험방법을 이용해 위험성을 평가한다. 
사람 피부에 대한 시험은 몇 가지 목적을 충족시켜줄 수 있다.
1) 시험동물 보다는 사람을 대상으로 하는 화학 물질 시험으로 사람에 대한 위험성을 직접적으
로 규명
2) 사람에게 높은 수준으로 노출되는 특정한 화학 물질의 위험성 평가를 제공
3) 과거에 시험동물 시험에서 얻어진 자료를 인간에게 적용하는 것을 용이하게 함
이 규격은 위해를 규명하기 위하여 피부 자극성에 대한 자료를 사람에게서 직접 얻을 수 있도록 
한다. 이것의 목적은 급성 노출로 인해 시험물질이 중대한 피부 자극의 위해를 나타내는 지의 
여부를 측정하기 위한 것이다. 
임상시험은, “의료기기법 시행규칙 제13조(임상실험실시기준 등)” 및 ISO 14155-1과 ISO 
14155-2에 따라 시행되어야 한다. 임상시험에 관한 추가 기준은 부록 C에 설명되어 있다. 
주) 자극성 시험에 대한 추가 자료는 부록 F.1 참조
5.5.2 시험 전 고려 사항
피부 흡수 자료를 포함한 시험물질과 시험물질의 화학적 조성에 대한 독성 분석표를 통해 중대한 
건강상 손상을 야기하지 않는 시험이라는 것을 나타내야 한다.
다음은 시험물질을 사람에게 시험해서는 안 되는 경우이다. 
1) 체내 또는 체외 예측 평가에서 시험물질이 자극성이 있는 것으로 나타난 경우
   주) 어떤 상황에서는 사람에 대한 잠재적 위험을 추가로 확인하기 위해 사람에 대한 제품의 
자극성 검체/용출액에 대한 추가 시험을 수행하는 것이 필요할 수 있다.
2) 체내 또는 체외 예측 평가에서 시험물질이 부식성이 있는 것으로 나타난 경우
3) 물리화학적 특성 및/또는 구조/기능 상관성에 근거하여 사람 피부에 대해 잠재적인 부식성이 
예측되는 강산 또는 알칼리성 잔류물과 같은 물질인 경우
4) 시험물질이 피부 손상이나 기도 감작을 나타내는 경우


- 278 -
5) 시험물질이 시험조건 하에서 급성 독성의 위험성을 나타내는 경우
6) 시험물질이 유전 독성, 생식 독성 또는 발암성의 위험성을 나타내는 경우
지원자의 선정과 관련된 추가적 지침은 부록C와 부록F에 제시되어 있다. 
6. 피부감작성시험
6.1 시험방법의 선정
현재 화학물질의 피부 감작능(skin sensitizing potential)을 측정하기 위해 사용되는 동물 시험법
은 세 가지가 있다. 두 종류의 기니피그 시험법(guinea pig assay)과 하나의 마우스 시험법
(murine assay)이 이에 속한다. 지금까지 일반적으로 피부 감작성 시험에는 기니피그 극대화시험
(guinea pig maximization test; GPMT)과 폐쇄첩포시험(Buehler test, 뷸러 시험)이 사용되었다. 
극대화 시험방법은 가장 민감한 방법이다. (참고문헌 [51] 참조) 폐쇄 첩포 시험은 국소적인 제품
에 적합하다.
마우스의국소림프절시험법(Murine Local Lymph Node Assay, LLNA)이단일화학물질을시
험하기위한기니피그평가방법의유일한대안으로국제적으로인정받아현재화학물질에대해
선호되는시험법이다. (참고문헌[69], [88], [91] 참조) 일부경우에는특정시험검체의잠재적감
작성의평가를위해기니피그시험이필요할수도있다. 위음성, 위양성, 특정금속및피부에침
투하지못하는고분자물질의경우가이에해당될수있다. 자극제의활성이양성림프절반응을
일으킬수있음을알아야한다.
동물 복지 기준에 관한 제2장(ISO 10993-2)의 규정을 고려하여 국소림프절시험법(LLNA)이 고려
되어야 한다. 동물 복지 요구사항을 고려하는 것 외에, LLNA는 객관적인 정량 데이터를 제공하
는 장점이 있다. 
주) 세가지시험법모두화학물질의피부잠재적감작성즉, 지연성(유형IV) 감작성인접촉성
피부염의검출을위해개발되었다.
6.2 마우스국소림프절시험법(LLNA)
6.2.1 원리
시험검체를귓등에국소처리후에(귀의) 도포부위에서가까운림프절내림프구증식의정도를
측정한다. 대조군의활성도(activity)와비교하여3배또는그이상의세포증식의반응은시험물질
을감작제(sensitizer)로지정할수있는역치이다.
LLNA는 물질이 사용될 때 투여량-반응 접근법을 사용하여 수행해야 한다. 최종제품/의료기기 완
제품의 경우에는 희석되지 않은 용출액 만으로 시험하는 것으로 충분하다.
주) 참고문헌에 대표적인 LLNA 문헌(publication)이 포함되어 있다. 이 시험을 수행하는 실험실
에서는 이러한 문헌과 기타 이용 가능한 관련 자료들을 검토해야 한다. 이외에 LLNA에 대한 
체외 대체시험법이 현재 개발 중에 있다. 이러한 시험법 개발에 관한 최신 정보는 참고문헌에

6.2.2 시험 검체 준비 
시험검체는마우스의귀에도포할수있는액체, 현탄액, 겔또는페이스트(paste)상태이어야한
다. 가능하다면단계별희석용량으로시험해야한다. 그렇지않으면화학용액이나현탁액또는
용출액으로준비된최대농도를사용해야한다. 전신독성과지나친국소피부자극은시험결과를
무효화할수있다. 따라서이런반응은피해야한다. 특정상황에서는예비시험이필요할수도
있다.
물질/화학물질에 대해 흔히 사용되는 용매는 아세톤 올리브 오일(acetone olive oil, AOO) 4:1 
혼합물이다. 친수성이고/또는 귀의 피부에 적절히 붙지 않는 액체 검체는 시험 부위에 잘 붙게 변
형해야 한다. 이것은 카르복시메틸셀룰로오스(carboxy methyl cellulose)나 하이드록시에칠셀룰
로오스(hydroxyethyl cellulose) (0.5 % w/v)와 같은 물질을 첨가하여 얻을 수 있다. 
수용성 화학물질의 경우, DMSO(dimethyl sulfoxide) 또는 DMF(dimethyl formamide)가 계면활
성제 Pluronic® L92보다 선호된다. (참고문헌 [89] 참조) 그렇지 않다면 앞서 언급된 다른 용출 
용매를 사용할 수 있다. (참고문헌 [88] 참조) 용출액 배지(extract media)에 대한 첨가물의 영향 
및/또는 용매 조성에서의 변화를 검증하고 문서화하여야 한다. 이는 흔히 양성대조군으로 사용되
는 약한 정도에서 중간 정도의 감작제를 이용한 실험을 통해 검증할 수 있다. 추가적으로 준비된 
용출액이 잠재적 감작제의 존재를 검출할 수 있다는 것을 증명하기 위해 양성대조군을 이용하여 
시험검체에 대한 첨가(spiking) 시험이 수행될 수 있다. 용출 방법은 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 
기술되어 있다. 
각각의 투여를 위해서는 별도의 용출액을 준비해야 한다.
주) 고분자 물질의 용출액 준비를 위한 구체적인 방법에 관한 정보는 부록 E에 제시되어 있다.  
6.2.3 동물과 사육관리
다른계통(strain)이검증되지않았다면CBA/Ca 또는CBA/J 계통의건강한암컷마우스를사용
해야한다.(참고문헌[88] [96] 참조) 몇몇마우스의혈통이승인된것으로보고되었다(DBA/2,
B6C3F1, BALB/c). (참고문헌[90] 참조) 마우스는임신하지않은, 8-12주령이어야한다. 각시험
에사용되는마우스의나이가일치해야한다(1주령이내).
수컷마우스가암컷의민감도수준과
같다면수컷마우스를사용할수있다.
동물의선정및사육관리는제2장(ISO 10993-2)에따라야한다. 통상적으로실험실에서순화된
마우스들은개체식별을해준다. 특정시험검체의경우, 개체별우리가필요할수있다. 이에대해
서는정당한근거가있어야하고문서화되어야한다.
주) 집단 사육을 하는 경우에는 교차 오염과 원치 않는 섭취를 고려해야 한다.   
6.2.4 시험 과정


- 280 -
화학물질의 경우에 LLNA는 일반적으로 투여량-반응(dose-response) 방식으로 수행된다. 의료기
기의 경우에는 시험 검체가 용출액일 수 있다. 이러한 경우에는 시험을 위해 단일 투여량(single 
dose)만을 이용할 수 있다. 일반적으로 용출액은 희석하지 않고 시험할 수 있다. 하지만 용출액이 
독성이 강한 성분을 함유하는 경우에 독성으로 인해 LLNA에서 음성반응을 일으킬 수 있다. 따라
서 독성이 강한 용출액을 시험할 때(제5장, ISO 10993-5 참조)는 투여량-반응(dose-response) 
방식으로 LLNA를 수행하고 용출액을 희석할 것을 권장한다. 
시험과정의 재현성과 민감도를 확인하기 위해서는 잘 알려진 약한 정도에서 중간 정도의  접촉 
알레르겐, 예를 들어 메르캅토벤조티아졸(mercaptobenzothiazole), 헥실시나믹알데히드(hexyl 
cinnamic aldehyde) 및 벤조카인(benzocaine)을 이용한 시험이 각 시험에 포함되어야 한다. 언급
된 예는 검체 준비를 위해 사용되는 각 용매(즉, 수계 용매)에는 적합하지 않을 수 있다. 그러한 
경우에는 또 다른 양성 대조군이 선정될 수 있고, 이에 대해서는 정당한 근거가 제시되고 문서화
하여야 한다. 시험을 자주 실시할 때는 각 시험에 양성 대조군을 포함할 필요가 없지만, 최소 6개
월에 한번은 포함해야 한다. 
시험 시작과 종료 시에 개체별 체중을 기록해야 한다. 시험 검체의 잠재적 독성을 파악하기 위해
서는 시험 중에 임상관찰을 수행하고 기록하여야 한다.
주) 6개월에 한번만 양성대조군을 사용하는 경우, 이 양성 대조군이 음성 결과를 보일 때 과거 6
개월에 얻은 결과에 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 참고문헌 [88]에서는 LLNA을 정기적으로 시행하고
(즉, 월 1회 이상의 횟수로 LLNA를 실시하고), 음성대조군을 이용하여 일관된 결과를 얻은 이
력과 문서화된 방법을 갖추고 있는 실험실에서는 양성 대조물질에 대한 주기적(즉, 6개월 이하
의 간격으로) 시험을 고려할 수 있다고 밝히고 있다. 양성 대조군을 매시간 포함하는 대신  주
기적으로만 포함하는 것은 각각의 주기적 양성 대조군 시험의 간격 동안에 공존하는 양성대조
군 없이 시험되어 얻은 음성 결과의 타당성과 용인성에 대하여 영향을 미칠 수 있음을 아는 
것이 중요하다. 예를 들어 위음성 결과를 주기적 양성 대조군 시험에서 얻는 경우에는 마지막
으로 승인된 주기적 양성 대조군 시험과 승인되지 않는 주기적 양성 대조군 시험 사이의 간격
에서 얻은 모든 음성 시험물질의 결과에 의문이 들 수 있다. 이전의 음성 시험 물질의 결과가 
승인된 것을 입증하기 위해서는 실험실에서 추가 비용과 동물 수를 증가시켜 모든 음성 시험
을 반복 실시하는 것을 생각할 수 있다.  
6.2.5 처리군(Treatment groups)
LLNA 수행시, 군당최소4마리마우스의자료가평가에사용되어야한다. 림프절반응은개체별
측정에의해서또는혼합된(pooled) 림프절검체의측정을통해결정될수있다. 통계분석을위
해서는개체별측정이선호된다.
평가를위해단일투여량만이용할수있는경우, 예를들어하나의용출액만을이용할수있는
경우에는개체별반응을측정할때각군당최소5마리의마우스를사용해야한다.
처리군에는 다음이 포함되어야 한다.
 - 각각의 사용된 용매 유형의 공시험액(부록 A 참조) 


- 281 -
 - 해당되는 경우, 각각의 사용된 용매에 대한 양성 대조군
 - 각각의 사용된 용출 용매에 대한 시험군 
단일 화학물질 또는 물질을 시험할 때, LLNA는 투여량-반응 방식으로 수행되어야 한다. 다른 유
형의 시험과 검체 같은 용출액의 경우에는 투여량-반응 평가가 실현가능하지 않다. 실험군 하나
만 사용할 때는 정당한 근거를 제시하고 문서화하여야 한다. 
주) 양성대조군의 용량 반응에 대한 일관성을 입증하는 충분한 자료가 수집된 경우 시험의 민감
도를 증명하기 위해 단일용량을 포함시킬 수 있다. (참고문헌 [88] 참조)
3일간연속으로25 μl/d 용량씩지정된마우스의양쪽귀의뒷(배)면에적합한검체를도포한다.
결과해석에간섭할수있는귀의자극신호를매일관찰한다. (참고문헌[73], [82], [84] 참조)
6.2.6 세포 증식에 대한 측정 및 조직 준비
배출 림프절(draining lymph nodes)에서의 증식 세포는 방사성 또는 형광성 표지로 표시할 수 있
다. 흔히 사용되는 방사성 표지는 3H-methyl thymidine과 125I-iododeoxyuridine인 반면에 형광
성 표지로는 fluorodeoxyuridine이 사용될 수 있다.  
마지막 처리 후 (72 ± 2)시간이 지난 후에 마우스의 개별 체중을 기록하고 세포 증식에 대한 표
지용액을 정맥주사로 투여한다. 3H-methyl thymidine 방사성의 20 μCi(740 KBq) 단위를 함유한 
PBS(인산완충액) 0.25ml를 모든 시험군 및 대조군 마우스의 꼬리정맥을 통해 주사한다. 
125I-iododexyuridine의 
경우에는 
2 
μCi(74 
KBq)을 
함유한 
PBS 
0.25ml를 
주사하고, 
fluorodeoxyuridine의 경우에는 10−5 mol/l을 함유한 0.25ml를 꼬리 정맥에 주사한다. (참고문헌 
[88] 참조)  
방사성 표지를 필요로 하지 않는 다른 대체 과정을 이용할 수 있으며, 정당한 근거가 있을 때에는 
사용될 수 있다[예를 들어, 브로모데옥시우리다인(BrdU), 아데노신삼인산(ATP) 측정(DA 방법)]. 
주 1) 보다 자세한 정보는 참고문헌 [88], [91], [100], [114] 를 참조. 
표지용액의투여후(5 ± 0.75) 시간이지난후에마우스를안락사시킨다. 배출귓바퀴림프절
(draining auricular lymph node)을제거한다. 조직검체의교차오염이생기지않도록주의한다.
각군의림프절을혼합하거나, 각개체별동물의양측림프절(pairs of lymph nodes)을혼합할수
있다. 단일세포준비는200 μm 스테인리스와이어메쉬망이나나일론메쉬망을통해림프절을부
드럽게눌러준비한다. 각개체별동물의자료가실험군에서각동물간의변이성을제공한다면
더욱좋다. 세포준비는원심분리법에의해두번세척하여PBS에서재부유시킨다. 세포는5%의
트리클로로초산(TCA)으로(4 ± 2)°C에서(18 ± 1)시간동안침전시킨다. 마지막원심분리후에
단계펠릿(step pellets)를TCA 1ml로부유시키고
3H-계수(counting)를위해섬광액(scintillation
fluid) 10ml가든섬광유리병으로옮겨담거나125I-계수를위해바로감마계수기(gamma counter)
로옮긴다.(참고문헌[70], [90], [91] 참조)

6.3 피부감작성탐지를위한기니피그시험
6.3.1 원리
현재 화학물질과 의료기기의 감작 활성(sensitizing activity)을 탐지하기 위해  사용되는 두 가지 
기니피그 시험에는 뷸러시험법(Buehler test)과 GPMT가 있다. 두 시험법 모두 유도(induction)와 
유발(challenge) 단계로 구성되고, 과민성반응의 모든 단계를 다룬다. 
6.3.2 시험검체 농도의 선정
단일 화학물질에 대한 잠재적 감작성 시험에 관한 현행 지침은 한 가지 농도만을 이용해 시험할 
것을 권고하고 있다. 


- 283 -
주) 고분자 물질의 용출액 준비를 위한 구체적인 방법에 관한 정보는 부록 E에 제시되어 있다.  
6.3.3 유도
감작율은 유도 투여량에 의해 크게 좌우되며, 가능하면 그 양은 중간 정도의 자극을 일으키는 것
이어야 한다. 자극 역치(threshold)에 영향을 미치지 않는다면, 가능한 가장 높은 농도를 사용하여
야 한다. 그러나 이것이 동물의 건강상태에 영향을 미치는 것이어서는 안 된다. 기니피그 시험법에
서 유도투여량은 일반적으로 개체별 기니피그 시험에 대해 설명한 것처럼 예비 시험을 기초로 선
택된다. 
통상적인 용매로 용출한 용출액이 비경구 투여일 경우, 희석되지 않은 용출액은 예비 시험의 대상
으로 하지 않는다.
6.3.4 유발(challenge)
기니피그 시험법에서 유발 농도도 마찬가지로 과거에 시험검체에 노출된 적이 없는 동물의 예비 
시험을 근거로 한다. 예비 시험 평가에서 측정된 대로, 자극을 유발하지 않는 최고 투여랑이 사용
되어야 한다. 결과에 대한 평가를 용이하게 하기 위해서는 유발 과정에 한 가지 이상의 농도 사용
을 권한다(F.2 참조).  
6.4 시험결과에 영향을 미치는 중요한 요소
시험검체의 생화학적 특성과 물리적 특성이 시험방법의 선정에 영향을 미친다. 극대화 시험은 피내 
주사를 하여야 하므로, 시험동물에 피내 주사를 할 수 없는 경우에는 대체 방법을 사용한다. 용출용
액는 무균상태에서 준비되어야 한다. 피내 적용을 위해서는 멸균되지 않은 용액을 사용하여서는 
안 된다. 
모든 검체에 적합한 용매는 존재하지 않지만, 용해성과 침투력으로 노출을 최적화시켜주는 용매를 
선정하여야 한다. 시험검체의 농도는 결과의 해석에 영향을 미치지 않는 범위에서 가장 높은 것이
어야 한다. 현탁액이 침전물을 만들어 정확한 양을 투여하는 것이 어렵기 때문에 대부분의 조사자
들은 용액상태의 시험검체를 선호한다. 피내 주사를 위한 용매에는 식염수, 프로필렌글리콜 
(propyleneglycol), 식물성 유지가 포함된다.
다양한 실험실에서 나온 결과 간 차이의 원인은 여러 가지가 있을 수 있다. 
다음의 요소들은 시험과정에서 중요한 것들이다. 
- 시험환경상태, 
- 동물의 시험부위, 
- 털 제거방법(자르기/면도 또는 화학적 탈모), 
- 첩포(patch) 모양, 
- 시험검체의 양, 
- 폐쇄의 특성(quality), 
- 노출시간, 동물 관찰결과
동물의 반응성도 유전적 요인 및 관리에 따라 다양하다.

반응의 심한 정도는 해석에 도움이 되기는 하지만, 양성 시험결과를 표시해주는 가장 필수적인 요
소는 적절한 대조군들에 대한 (유발; challenge에서) 양성 반응을 나타내는 시험동물의 숫자를 비
교하는 것이다. 유발(challenge)시험결과가 모호한 경우, 재유발(rechallenge)로 명확한 결과를 얻
을 수 있다. 조직병리학에서는 시험 결과에 대한 평가에 도움이 되는지를 보여주지 못하였다. 
시험과정의 재현성과 민감성을 확인하기 위해 양성대조군을 이용한 시험을 정기적으로 수행하여
야 한다. 양성 대조군은 가급적 머캡토벤조티아졸, (mercaptobenzothiazole) 핵실시아나믹알데히
드 (hexyl ciannamic aldehyde), 벤조카인 (benzocaine)과 같이 약한 정도에서 중간 정도의 접
촉 알레르겐이어야 한다. 양성대조군은 최소 6개월에 한번은 수행되어야 한다. (참고문헌 [6] 참
조.)
주) 양성 반응을 얻기 위해 중간정도에서 강한 정도의 감작제의 희석물(예를 들어, 포름알데히드
와 DNCB)이 사용될 수 있다. 그러나 이 시험법으로 의료기기의 용출액에서 약한 감작제의 반
응 또한 확인 할 수 있다는 것을 보증하지는 않는다.
6.5  기니피그 극대화 시험(GPMT)
6.5.1 원리
본 시험은 기니피그 극대화 시험에서 단일 화학 물질에 적용된 기법을 이용하여 기니피그에게 피
부 감작을 일으킬 수 있는 시험물질의 잠재성을 평가한다. 
6.5.2 시험검체 준비
시험검체는 부록 A에 설명된 바에 따라 시험검체를 준비해야 한다. 시험검체의 농도는 결과의 해
석에 영향을 미치지 않는 범위에서 가장 높은 것이어야 한다.(6.5.4.2항 참조)
주) 고분자 물질의 용출액 준비를 위한 구체적인 방법에 관한 정보는 부록 E에 제시되어 있다.
6.5.3 동물과 관리
단일교배종으로(single outbred strain) 암, 수구별 없이 무게가 300g에서 500g인 젊고 건강한 
알비노 기니피그 성체를 이용하여야 한다. 암컷을 사용하는 경우에는 출산의 경험이 없고 임신하
지 않은 것이어야 한다. 
제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고 관리해야 한다. 필
요할 경우, 가장 알맞은 시험농도를 결정하기 위하여 한 세트의 동물로 예비시험을 실시하여야 한
다.(6.5.4.2항 참조)
시험물질이 액체이거나 고체인 경우에는 시험검체를 최소 10 마리의 동물에 처리해야 하며, 최소 
5마리의 동물을 용매 대조군으로 써야 한다. 예비시험이 필요한 경우에는 추가 동물로 예비시험을 
실시하여야 한다.
용출액으로 시험하는 경우에는 시험검체를 최소 10마리의 동물에 처리해야 하며, 최소 5마리
의 동물을 용매 대조군으로 써야 한다. 예비시험이 필요한 경우에는 추가 동물로 예비시험을 


실시하여야 한다. 
10마리의 시험동물과 5마리의 대조동물이 시험에서 완전히 음성을 나타내는 경우에는 10마리의 
동물에 5마리를 더한 추가적인 시험에서도 양성결과가 나타나지 않을 것이다. 그러나 만일 반응이 
불분명하게 나타난다면 재유발(6.5.6 참조)하여야 한다. 만약 모호한 반응이 지속되면, 최소 20마리의 
시험동물과 10마리의 대조동물을 이용하여 새로운 시험을 실시한다.
6.5.4 시험과정
6.5.4.1 준비
시험과정의 모든 단계에 앞서 처리부위의 털을 모두 제거한다. 
피내 주사의 경우에는 부위 당 0.1ml씩 주사한다.
국소적 적용의 경우에는, 흡수거즈 첩포(patch) (4cm
2
-8cm
2
)나 적합한 여과지를 시험검체로 적시고, 
털을 제거한 피부표면에 첩포(patch)를 붙이고 폐쇄드레싱으로 동물 몸통주위를 감싸서 보호한다.
주) 폐쇄드레싱을 보호하기 위해 동물을 감쌀 때는 동물의 정상적인 호흡이 가능하도록 주의해야 
한다. 훈련된 전문가가 융통성 있게 붕대를 감는 것이 좋다.
6.5.4.2 예비시험
예비시험은 6.5.4.3항에 있는 본시험에 사용될 시험검체의 농도를 결정하기 위한 것이다. 
통상적인 용매로 용출한 용출액을 희석하지 않은 경우, 예비시험의 대상으로 하지 않는다.
최소한 3마리 동물의 옆구리에 일정 범위의 희석된 시험검체를 국소적으로 적용한다. 24시간 후
에 첩포와 폐쇄드레싱을 제거하고, 표 14에 제시된 매그누슨과 클리그만 등급 (Magnusson and 
Kligman grading)을 이용하여 적용부위의 홍반과 부종을 평가한다.
본시험(main test)의 국소적 유도단계에서는, 약간의 홍반은 수반하지만, 동물에게 부작용을 일으
키지 않는 범위에서 가장 높은 농도를 선정한다. 의료기기 용출액의 경우, 자극 역치를 얻지 못할 
수 있다는 점을 알아야 한다. 그런 경우에는 희석되지 않은 용출액과 같이 가능한 한 가장 높은 
농도가 사용되어야 한다. 최종 제품/의료기기 완제품의 경우에는 희석되지 않은 용출액만 시험하
는 것으로도 충분할 수 있다.
본시험(main test)의 유발(challenge) 단계에서는 홍반을 일으키지 않는 범위에서 가장 높은 농도를 
선정한다.

프로이드 완전 보조제(Freund's complete adjuvant, FCA)를 모든 동물에 전처리로 주사할 때, 본
시험이 진행되는 동안 과민피부 가능성과 그로 인한 판독(reading) 간섭을 고려하여야 한다.
6.5.4.3 본시험(main test)
6.5.4.3.1 피내 유도단계
그림 4에 제시되어 있는 것처럼 털을 제거한 견갑골 내 부위(intrascapular region)에 있는 주사부
위 (A, B, C)에 검체 0.1ml를 양쪽에 피내 주사한다. 
부위 A : 안정된 프로이드 완전 보조제 현탁액과 선정된 용매를 50 : 50 (양)의 비율로 혼합한다. 
수용성 물질의 경우에는 생리식염수 (대한약전 또는 이에 상응하는)를 사용한다. 
부위 B : 시험검체 (희석하지 않은 용출액) : 대조동물에는 용매만을 주사한다. 
부위 C : 부위 B에 사용된 농도와 같은 농도의 시험검체를 프루인드 완전 보조제 에멀젼과 용매를 
50 : 50 (부피 비; 50%)으로 혼합하여 유화시킨다. 대조동물에 보조제와 함께 공 시
험액 에멀젼을 주사한다.
6.5.4.3.2 국소유도단계
피내유도단계가 완료된 지 7일 (±1)이 지나면 피내 주사부위(그림4)를 덮을 수 있도록 약 8cm
2 
크기의 첩포(여과지 또는 흡수성 거즈)를 이용하여 시험검체를 개별동물의 견갑골 내 부위
(intrascapular region)에 국소적으로 적용한다. 6.5.4.3.1항에서 부위B에 투여한 농도를 사용한
다. 만약 6.5.4.3.1항에서 구할 수 있는 최대농도가 자극을 일으키지 않는다면, 첩포(patch)를 붙이기 
24 ± 2시간 전에 10%의 SDS(소디움 도데실 나트륨;sodium dodecyl sulfate)로 피부를 마사지 하
여 해당부위를 전처리한다. 폐쇄드레싱으로 적용부위를 보호한다. 48 ± 2시간이 지난 후에 드레싱과 
첩포(patch)를 제거한다.
준비한 용출액을 바로 사용하도록 한다. 만일 24 ± 2시간 이상 용출액을 보관하는 경우, 보관 조건
에서 용출액의 안정성을 검증하여야 한다.
유사하게 공시험액만으로 대조동물을 처리한다.

6.5.4.3.3 유발 단계(challenge phase)
국소유도단계가 완료된 후 (14 ± 1)일이 지나고 나면 모든 시험동물과 대조동물을 시험검체로 유발
시킨다. 부위 C에 대해 6.5.4.3.1항에서 선정한 농도와 동일한 농도의 시험검체로 첩포(patch) 또
는 챔버(chamber)를 적신 후 이를 이용하여 유도단계가 진행되는 동안 처리하지 않은 부위(옆구
리 위쪽 부위)에 시험검체와 공시험액을 국소적으로 적용한다. 이 희석농도는 처리하지 않은 다
른 부위에 유사한 방법으로 적용할 수도 있다. 폐쇄드레싱으로 보호해야 한다. 24 ± 2시간이 
지난 후에 드레싱과 첩포(patch)를 제거한다.
6.5.5 동물의 관찰
드레싱을 제거하고 (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간 후에 시험동물과 대조동물의 유발된 피부부위
의 모습을 관찰한다. 피부반응을 시각화하기 위하여 전 파장(full spectrum)조명이나 자연조명을 이
용할 것을 권장한다. 표 14에 제시되어 있는 매그누슨과 클리그만 등급에 따라 매 시간 간격마다 
각각의 적용부위에 대한 피부홍반과 부종반응 등급을 매기고, 이를 설명한다. 결과에 대한 평가에서 
선입견을 최소화하기 위하여 처리방법에 관한 정보 없이 해석하도록 한다.
6.5.6 결과의 평가
대조동물의 매그누슨과 클리그만 등급이 1등급 미만을 나타내고, 시험군에서 1등급 이상인 경우 
일반적으로 감작성을 나타낸다고 할 수 있다. 만일 대조동물이 1등급 이상으로 나타났다면, 시험
동물에서의 반응은 감작 때문에 대조동물에서의 가장 심한 반응보다 더 심하게 나타날 것이라고 
추정한다. 만일 반응이 불분명한 경우에는 첫 번째 유발시험의 결과를 확인하기 위하여 재유발할 
것을 권고한다. 시험결과는 시험동물과 대조동물의 양성유발결과의 빈도수로 표시한다.
경우에 따라서 반응의 강도는 대조군에서 나타나는 것보다는 약하더라도 반응을 나타내는 동물들
의 숫자가 대조군보다 시험군에 더 많기도 하다. 이런 경우에는 반응을 명확하게 규정하기 위해 
재유발이 필요할 수도 있다. 재유발은 첫 번째 유발이 끝나고 1주에서 2주가 지난 후에 실시하여야 
한다. 첫 번째 유발 방법과 동일한 방법을 사용하며, 동물 옆구리의 다른 부분을 이용한다.

6.6 폐쇄 첩포(patch) 시험(Buehler test)
6.6.1 원리
기니피그에게 피부 감작을 일으킬 수 있는 시험물질의 잠재성을 평가한다.
6.6.2 시험검체 준비
시험검체는 부록 A에 설명되어 있는 바에 따라 준비하여야 한다. 시험 검체의 농도는 결과의 해
석에 영향을 미치지 않는 범위 내에서 가장 높은 것이어야 한다(6.6.4.2 참조). 인체에 국소적으로 
적용하는 의료기기 중 모양과 크기가 적절한 경우, 예를 들어 전극(electrode)은 그 자체로 부착
될 수도 있다.
6.6.3 동물과 관리
단일교배종으로(single outbred strain) 암, 수구별 없이 무게가 300g에서 500g인 젊고 건강한 
알비노 기니피그 성체를 이용하여야 한다. 암컷을 사용하는 경우에는 출산의 경험이 없고 임신하
지 않은 것이어야 한다. 
제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고, 관리해야 한다. 가
장 알맞은 시험농도를 결정하기 위하여 한 세트의 동물로 예비시험을 실시하여야 한다(6.5.4.2항 
참조).
시험물질이 액체이거나 고체인 경우에는 시험검체를 최소 10 마리의 동물에 처리해야 하며, 최
소 5마리의 동물을 용매 대조군으로 써야 한다. 예비시험이 필요한 경우에는 추가 동물로 예비
시험을 실시하여야 한다.
용출액으로 시험하는 경우에는 시험검체를 최소 10마리의 동물에 처리해야 하며, 최소 5마리
의 동물을 용매 대조군으로 써야 한다. 예비시험이 필요한 경우에는 추가 동물로 예비시험을 
실시하여야 한다. 
10마리의 시험동물과 5마리의 대조동물이 시험에서 완전히 음성을 나타내는 경우에는 10마리의 
동물에 5마리를 더한 추가적인 시험에서도 양성 결과가 나타나지 않을 것이다. 그러나 만일 반응이 
불분명하게 나타난다면 재유발(6.5.6 항 참조) 하여야 한다. 만약 모호한 반응이 지속되면, 최소 20
마리의 시험동물과 10마리의 대조동물을 이용하여 새로운 시험을 실시한다.
6.6.4 시험과정
6.6.4.1 준비
시험과정의 모든 단계에 앞서 처리부위의 털을 모두 제거한다. 


- 289 -
국소부위 적용의 경우에는 적당한 크기의 첩포 (여과지 또는 흡수 거즈)를 시험물질이나 용출
액으로 적시고, 털을 제거한 부위에 붙이고 폐쇄드레싱으로 덮은 후 (6 ± 0.5)시간 동안 둔다. 
시험부위를 안전하게 하기 위하여 각각의 동물들을 가두어 둘 수 있다.
주) 폐쇄드레싱을 보호하기 위해 동물을 감쌀 때는 동물의 정상적인 호흡이 가능하도록 주의해야 
한다. 훈련된 전문가가 융통성 있게 붕대를 감는 것이 좋다.
6.6.4.2 예비시험
예비시험은 6.6.4.3항에 있는 본시험에 사용될 시험검체의 농도를 결정하기 위한 것이다.
국소적 용도의 의료기기와 통상적 용매로 용출한 용출액이 희석되지 않은 경우, 예비시험을 시
행할 필요가 없다.
최소한 3마리 이상의 동물 옆구리에 적합한 첩포(patch)를 이용하여 4가지 농도의 시험검체를 국소
적으로 적용한다. (6 ± 0.5)시간이 지난 후에 폐쇄드레싱과 첩포(patch)를 제거한다. 첩포를 제거
한 후 (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2) 시간이 지나면 표 14에 있는 매그누슨과 클리그만 등급을 이용해 
적용부위의 홍반과 부종을 평가한다.
다음의 사항을 결정한다.
1) 본시험의 유도단계의 경우에 대해, 약간의 홍반은 수반하지만, 동물에게 부작용을 일으키지 
않는 범위에서 가장 높은 농도를 선정한다.
2) 본시험의 유발단계의 경우에 대해 홍반을 일으키지 않는 범위에서 가장 높은 농도를 선정한다.
6.6.4.3 본시험(main test)
6.6.4.3.1 유도단계
6.6.4.2 1)항에서 선정한 농도와 동일한 농도의 시험검체로 적신 적합한 첩포(patch)를 이용하여 
각 동물의 털을 제거한 등 왼쪽 윗부분에 국소적으로 시험검체를 적용한다. (6 ± 0.5) 시간 후에 
가두어 두었던 것을 풀어주고 폐쇄드레싱과 첩포를 제거한다. 이와 같은 과정을 3주에 걸쳐 매 
주마다 3일 동안 반복한다. 공시험액만을 이용하여 유사한 방법으로 대조동물을 처리한다.
6.6.4.3.2 유발단계 (Challenge phase)
국소 유도단계가 완료된 후 (14 ± 1)일이 지나고 나면 시험검체로 모든 시험동물과 대조동물을 유
발시킨다. 6.6.4.2 2)항에서 선정한 농도와 동일한 농도의 시험검체로 적신 적합한 첩포를 이용하
여 털을 제거한 시험되지 않은 부위에 시험검체를 국소적으로 적용한다. (6 ± 0.5)시간 후에 가
두었던 것을 풀어주고 폐쇄드레싱과 첩포(patch)를 제거한다.
6.6.5 동물의 관찰
최초의 유발이나 재 유발 노출 후 (24 ± 2)시간이 지난 후에


- 290 -
1) 제조업체의 설명서에 따라 시험부위와 그 주변에 상업용 탈모제를 발라서 털을 제거하거나,
2) 모든 동물의 유발 부위와 그 주변을 면도한다.
털을 제거한 부위를 따뜻한 물로 완전히 닦아내고 수건으로 말린 후 우리(cage)에 다시 넣어둔다. 
털을 제거한 후 최소 2시간이 지나면 표 14에 제시된 바에 따라 시험부위의 등급을 매긴다. 유발 
첩포(patch)를 제거한 후 48±2시간이 지나면 등급을 다시 매긴다. 피부 반응을 시각화하기 위하여 
전 파장(full-spectrum) 조명이나 자연 조명을 이용할 것을 권장한다. 결과에 대한 평가에서 선
입견을 최소화하기 위하여 처리방법에 관한 정보 없이 해석할 것을 권고한다.
6.6.6 결과의 평가 
대조동물의 매그누슨과 클리그만 등급이 1등급 미만을 나타내고, 시험군에서 1 등급 이상인 경우 
일반적으로 감작성을 나타낸다고 할 수 있다. 만일 대조동물이 1등급 이상으로 나타났다면, 시험
동물에서의 반응은 감작 때문에 대조동물에서의 가장 심한 반응보다 더 심하게 나타날 것이라고 
추정한다. 첫 번째 유발의 결과를 확인하기 위해 재유발이 권장된다. 시험결과는 시험동물과 대조동
물의 양성 유발결과의 빈도수로 표시한다.
경우에 따라서 반응의 강도는 대조군에서 나타나는 것보다는 약하더라도 반응을 나타내는 동물들의 
숫자가 대조군보다 시험군에 더 많기도 하다. 이런 경우에는 반응을 명확하게 규정하기 위해 재유발이 
필요할 수도 있다. 재유발은 첫 번째 유발이 끝나고 1주에서 2주가 지난 후에 실시하여야 한다. 
첫 번째 유발 방법과 동일한 방법을 사용하며, 동물의 옆구리에서 다른 부분을 이용한다.
이러한 상황에서는 새로운 음성 대조군을 권장한다.
6.6.7 시험보고서
시험보고서에는 다음과 같은 내용들이 포함되어야 한다.
1) 시험원자재 또는 의료기기에 대한 설명
2) 시험검체 또는 원자재의 사용목적/적용

부록 A 
자극성/감작성 시험을 위한 원자재의 준비
A.1 개요
자극성/감작성 시험을 실시하고 여기에서 얻은 자료를 해석할 때에는, 사람에 대한 의료기기의 
노출조건과 기간, 빈도수, 정도, 특성이 고려되어야 한다. 이 시험에서 중요한 변수 가운데 하나가 
시험원자재의 준비이다.
A.2 직접 접촉 노출 원자재
A.2.1 고형 시험원자재
적합한 물리적 상태 (예를 들어, 시트, 필름)에 있는 고형원자재를 변형시키지 않고 시험에 사용해
야 한다. 두께는 일반적으로 사용되는 두께로 하되 0.5cm를 넘지 않도록 하며, 크기는 2.5cm × 
2.5cm가 되도록 검체를 준비한다. 동일한 방법으로 적합한 음성 대조군을 준비한다. 음성 대조군
은 물리적으로 시험원자재와 아주 유사한 것이어야 하며, 비자극성이어야 한다. 적합한 대조군이 
없는 경우에는 흡수성 거즈(absorbent gauze)를 대신 사용한다.
고체는 분쇄를 하는 동안 오염되지 않도록 각별한 주위를 기울여 가루로 만들거나 조직과 접촉이 
잘 되도록 적합한 비자극성 용매나 물을 이용해 충분히 적시게 한다. 반드시 가루로 만들어야 하
는 세라믹의 경우에는 분쇄로 인해 세라믹의 물리화학적 특성이 바뀔 수도 있다는 사실을 명심해
야 한다.
분말(예를 들어, 고흡수성)은 직접 적용하거나 적절한 용매로 반죽을 만들어 적용시켜 시험하여야 
한다. 동일한 용매를 이용하는 대조군은 현탁되거나 희석되고 젖은 시험원자재와 동시에 평가해야 
한다.
주) 표면적 및/또는 입자의 크기는 염증성과 면역반응에 중요한 역할을 하는 식세포 작용과 같은 
생물학적 반응에 있어서 중요한 요소이다.
A.2.2 액상 시험원자재
액체는 희석하지 않고 직접 적용하거나, 그럴 수 없을 경우에는 적합한 용매로 희석시켜 사용한다. 
동일한 용매를 이용하는 대조군은 희석시킨 시험검체와 동시에 평가해야 한다.
A.3 시험원자재의 용출액
고체는 고체의 용출액을 준비하여 사용한다. 용출액을 사용하는 경우에는 극성, 비극성 및/또는 


- 293 -
적절한 경우 추가 용매를 이용하여 “제11장(ISO 10993-12) 검체준비방법과 참고물질”에 설명
되어 있는 방법에 따라 용출액을 준비해야 한다. 용출 방법의 적합성에 대한 이론적 근거를 제시
하여야 한다.
용출 용매를 이용하는 공시험액은 시험원자재의 용출액과 동시에 평가해야 한다. 
A.4 용매
시험원자재를 용출, 희석, 현탁시키거나 적셔야 하는 경우에는 적합한 비자극성 용매를 이용해야 
한다. “제11장(ISO 10993-12) 검체준비방법과 참고물질”에 적합한 용매 목록이 수록되어 있다.
A.5 멸균 시험원자재
완제품이 멸균 상태로 공급되는 경우에는, 시험 전에 이와 동일한 방법으로 시험원자재를 멸균해야 
한다. 산화에틸렌으로 멸균하는 제품의 경우 산화에틸렌과 그것의 반응물이 이 규격의 시험에서 
생물학적 반응을 일으킬 수 있다는 점에서 기술적 어려움이 존재한다.
자극 반응이 관찰되는 경우에는 산화에틸렌 잔류물이 미치는 영향과 시험원자재가 미치는 영향 
사이의 차이를 구분하기 위하여 의료기기의 산화에틸렌 멸균 전 후 반응평가를 고려하여야 한다.

부록 B
추가 자극성 시험방법
B.1 개요
다음의 특정한 시험방법들은 특정한 부위에 사용하려는 의료기기에만 해당된다. 시험방법을 선정
할 때에는 관련된 이론적 근거를 제시하여야 한다.
B.2 안자극성 시험 
B.2.1 개요
안자극성 시험은 다른 방법으로 안전성 자료를 구할 수 없을 경우에만 고려하여야 하고, 눈 또는 
눈꺼풀에 접촉을 하게 될 원자재의 경우에만 수행하여야 한다. 
최근 ICCVAM에서는 4 가지의 체외 대체 시험 시스템을 평가하였고, 그 중 2가지는 심각한 자극 
및 부식을 확인하기 위한 체내 동물시험을 대체하기 위해 개발되었다. BCOP 시험법(Bovine 
Corneal Opacity and Permeability test)과 ICE(Isolated Chicken Eye) 시험법이 이에 속한다. 
(참고문헌 [107] 참조) 약한 자극제(irritnats)에 대해서는 체내 시험이 여전히 필요할 수 있다. 
B.2.2 원리
안자극을 유발하는 시험조건에서 재료의 안자극 유발 가능성 평가
B.2.3 시험에서 제외하는 경우
피부 시험에서 심한 자극을 일으키거나 명백한 자극제로 입증된 원자재 및/또는 완제품은 안자
극성에 대해 추가적인 시험을 실시하지 않는다. 피부 자극성을 나타내거나 pH ≤ 2 또는 ≥ 11.5 
인 원자재는 시험하지 않으며, 안자극성을 일으킬 가능성이 있는 것으로 간주한다.
추가적인 위험 특성분석/측정(risk characterization/assessment)이 필요한 경우를 제외하고, 자극
성이 극미한 시험물질에 대해 시험이 필요할 수 있다.  이러한 경우에는 근거를 제시하고 문서화
하여야 한다.
B.2.4 시험원자재
시험원자재가 액체인 경우에는, 0.1ml 정도를 희석시키지 말고 그대로 한쪽 눈의 아래쪽 결막낭에 
주입시킨다. 시험원자재가 고체나 알갱이(granular product)일 경우에는 미세한 분말로 갈아서 사용
한다. 분말이 형성되면 0.1ml 정도의 부피의 양(100mg을 넘지 않아야 함)을 한쪽 눈의 아래쪽 결막낭
에 주입시킨다.
주) 어떤 물질들은 눈에 직접 시험하기에는 적합하지 않다. 눈을 다치게 하여 시험 자체를 의미 
없게 만들 수 있다. 
시험원자재가 펌프식으로 된 분무기에 들어 있을 때에는 0.1ml를 분사시켜 액체와 마찬가지로 주
입한다. 시험재료가 에어로졸 용기에 들어 있는 경우에는 다음 중 하나의 방법으로 검사한다. 


- 295 -
1) 눈을 뜬 상태에서 눈 앞 약 10cm 정도의 거리에서 1초간 뿌려주거나
2) 차가운 용기에 에어로졸을 분사하여 액체의 경우와 동일하게 시험한다.
시험원자재가 용출액으로만 적용할 수 있는 것이라면, 부록A에 나와 있는 대로 용출액을 준비하도록 한
다. 0.1ml 정도의 용출액을 한쪽 눈의 아래쪽 결막낭에 주입시킨다.
위에서 언급한 것과 동일한 조건하에서 시험검체 없이 극성과 비극성 용매를 사용하여 공시험액
을 준비한다.
B.2.5 동물과 관리
동일한 혈통으로 암, 수 구별 없이 무게가 2kg∼3kg인 건강하고 어린 알비노 토끼 성체를 이용하
여야 한다. 제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고, 관리해
야 한다.  최초에는 1마리의 동물을 이용해 시험원자재를 평가해야 한다. 1마리 동물에게서 명확
한 양성 반응 (표 B.1 참조)이 나타나는 경우에는 추가적인 시험을 시행할 필요가 없다. 고체나 
액체 원자재에 대한 명확한 반응이 관찰되지 않는 경우에는 최소 2마리의 동물을 추가하여 사용해
야 한다. 용출액의 경우에는 용출액 당 최소 2마리의 동물을 이용하여야 한다.
최소한 세 마리를 가지고 시험을 했는데도 그 결과가 명확하지 않다면, 추가적인 시험을 행한다. 
B.2.6 시험방법
시험을 시작하기 최소한 24시간 전에 각각의 토끼의 양쪽 눈을 육안으로 검사하여 이상이 없음을 
확인해야 한다. 만약 한 쪽이라도 이상이 있으면 다른 것으로 대체하도록 한다. 
눈을 시험할 때는 각막 손상을 시각화하기 위하여 2%의 플루오레세인나트륨 (sodium 
fluorescein) BP (영국 약전)을 사용하기도 한다. 검안경이나 수동식 세극등 또는 기타 적합한 기
기를 이용할 것을 권고한다.
B2.4에 언급된 대로 한쪽 눈에 삽입한다.
투여 후 약 1초간 토끼의 눈꺼풀을 잡는다.
각 동물의 반대쪽 눈은 대조군으로 이용하며, 용출액을 시험하는 경우에는 공시험액으로 처리하여
야 한다. 
원자재의 반복적인 노출이 예상되고 시험재료가 급성 시험에서 유의성 있는 반응을 보이지 않았
다면 반복 노출 시험을 수행할 수도 있다. 반복 노출은 급성 노출 시험 이 끝난 이후에만 (최소 
72시간이 지난 뒤에) 실시하여야 한다. 노출 기간은 임상적인 상황 하에서의 시험원자재 및 의료
기기의 사용 기간과 비슷하게 조작하도록 한다. 
B.2.7 동물의 관찰
시험원자재를 한번 주입한 동물에 대해서는 주입 후 (1 ± 0.1)시간, (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시


- 296 -
간 및 (72 ± 2)시간 마다 각 동물의 양쪽 눈을 검사한다.
외상이 지속적으로 존재할 경우에는 외상의 진행여부와 가역성을 알아보기 위하여 관찰기간을 
연장할 필요가 있을 수 있으나, 이러한 경우에도 21일을 초과할 필요는 없다. 외상이 심한 경우에
는 관찰기간을 연장하지 않는다.
주) ISO 9394[25]는 콘택트렌즈 시험에 관한 지침을 제시하며, 이 지침은 하루에 8시간씩 21일 동안 
노출시키도록 하고 있다. 이는 동 지침에 대한 예외이다.
표 B.1의 눈의 외상등급에 대한 척도에 따라 관찰된 반응을 모두 기록하고 등급을 정한다.
시험원자재를 여러 번 주입한 동물에 대해서는 주입 직전 및 (1 ± 0.1)시간 후에 각 동물의 양쪽 
눈을 검사한다.
만약, 최종적인 처리 후에 자극성의 징후가 나타나면 좀 더 관찰을 하도록 한다. 지속적인 각막 
질환 및 다른 안자극이 발생한다면 진행정도와 가역성여부를 확인하기 위하여 관찰을 좀 더 
연장할 수 있다.
표 B.1에 따라 관찰된 반응을 모두 기록하고 등급을 정한다.
만약에 다음과 같은 상황을 보이면 해당동물을 즉시 회수하여 인도적인 방법으로 폐사시킨다.
1) 아주 심한 눈의 손상(예를 들어, 결막이 벗겨지거나, 궤양이 생기거나, 각막에 구멍이 생기거나 
눈의 전방에 피나 고름이 생길 경우)이 있거나,
2) 혈액이 섞인 혹은 화농성의 진물이 날 때,
3) 심각한 각막의 궤양이 관찰될 때
표 B.1에 제시된 등급 체계에서 최대 영향치를 나타나는 동물은 시험에서 제외시키고, 안락사 
시킨다.
- 광반사 (2등급의 홍채 반응)를 하지 않거나 또는 (24 ± 2)시간 내에 회복될 조짐이 없는 각
막 혼탁 (4등급)
- (48 ± 2) 시간 내에 회복될 조짐이 없는 최대 결막 염증 (충혈 3등급을 수반한 결막 부종 
4등급)
 
B.2.8 결과의 평가
시험군의 눈과 대조군의 눈 사이의 차이는 표 B.1에 사용된 분류체계에 따라 특성을 규정하고 
설명되어야 한다.
1) 급성 노출
관찰의 어느 단계에서든지 눈을 처리한 동물 가운데 1마리 이상이 양성 결과를 나타내는 경우에는 
(표B.1의 각주가 있는 등급) 원자재에 안자극성이 있는 것으로 간주하며, 추가 시험은 실시하지 않


는다. 
관찰의 어느 단계에서든지 처리한 3마리 동물 가운데 1마리가 중간 정도 혹은 가벼운 반응을 
나타내거나 반응이 불분명한 경우에는 동물을 추가로 처리한다. 추가적인 동물시험에서 시험군의 
절반 이상에서 양성반응을 나타내면 안자극이 있다고 볼 수 있다. (표B.1의 각주가 있는 등급)
한 동물에서라도 심각한 반응을 나타내면 충분히 안자극성이 있는 원자재로 간주할 수 있다.
2) 반복 노출
관찰의 어느 단계에서든지 시험군 안에 있는 동물의 절반 이상이 양성 결과 (표 B.1의 각주가 있
는 등급)를 나타내는 경우에는 시험원자재에 안자극성이 있는 것으로 간주한다. 
B.2.9 시험보고서
시험보고서는 다음사항을 포함해야 한다.

구강 자극성 시험은 구강 조직에 접촉을 하게 될 원자재에 대해 시험하고자 하는 경우, 그리고 
다른 방법으로 안전성 자료를 구할 수 없을 경우에만 고려하여야 한다.
B.3.2 원리
구강 조직에 자극을 일으키는 시험에 대한 원자재의 구강 조직 자극 유발 가능성을 평가한다.
B.3.3 시험에서 제외하는 경우
피부 자극이나 눈 자극을 일으키는 원자재 또는 pH ≤ 2 또는 ≥ 11.5 인 원자재는 시험을 실시
하지 않으며, 구강 조직 자극의 가능성이 있는 것으로 간주한다.

위험 특성분석/평가(risk characterization/assessment)가 필요한 예외적인 경우에는 자극성이 있
는 원자재 또는 앞에서 언급된 pH의 범위를 벗어나는 원자재에 대해서 시험이 필요할 수 있다. 
이러한 경우에는 근거를 제시하고 문서화하여야 한다.
B.3.4 시험물질
부록A에 따라 시험물질을 준비한다.
B.3.5 동물과 관리
동일한 계통으로 암, 수 구별 없이 건강하고 어린 시리아 햄스터 성체를 이용하여야 한다. 제2장
(ISO 10993-2)에 명시되어 있는 바에 따라 동물들을 환경에 순응시키고, 관리해야 한다. 
적절한 경우 폭이 3mm∼4mm인 적합한 목걸이를 각 동물의 목둘레에 끼운다. 정상적으로 먹이
를 주고 호흡을 하도록 하되 동물이 생면 펠리트(pellet)를 제거하지 못하도록 한다. 시험 기간 동
안 매일 7일 간 각 동물의 몸무게를 측정한다. 이 기간 동안 체중이 감소한 동물이 있는 지 검사
하고, 목걸이를 조절한다. 체중이 지속적으로 감소하는 동물은 시험에서 배제한다.
처음부터 최소 3마리의 동물을 이용해 시험원자재를 평가해야 한다.
주) 음성 대조군이나 공시험액으로 처리된 추가 동물을 사용하는 것이 적합할 수도 있다.
최초의 시험에서 반응이 명확하지 않거나 불분명하게 나타나는 경우에는 추가적인 시험을 고려해야 
한다.
B.3.6 시험방법
각각의 동물에게서 목걸이를 제거하고 볼 주머니(cheek pouches)를 뒤집는다. 생리식염수로 주머
니(pouches)를 닦고, 이상이 있는 지 검사한다.
고형 시험원자재의 경우는 볼 주머니 안으로 검체를 직접 집어넣는다.(지름이 5mm를 넘지 않는 
경우)
액상 시험원자재나 용출액의 경우, 생면 펠리트를 검체에 적신다. 흡수량을 기록하고 각 동물의 
한쪽 볼 주머니에 펠리트를 집어넣는다. 이 방법 대신 적합한 양의 검체를 볼 주머니 안으로 흘려
보내기도 한다.
대조군으로 이용하는 다른 볼주머니 속에는 검체를 집어넣지 않는다. 적합한 대조동물을 동시에 
시험해야 한다.
필요한 경우에는 목걸이를 교체하고 동물을 우리에 다시 넣는다.
노출 기간은 시험원자재의 실제 사용 기간과 유사해야 하지만, 5분 이상은 되어야 한다.
노출이 끝나면 목걸이와 생면 펠리트를 제거하고 주머니를 생리식염수로 씻어내어, 다른 주머니를 


오염시키지 않도록 주의한다.
급성 노출 시험의 경우에는 4시간 동안 매시간(±0.1 시간) 간격으로 위 과정을 반복한다.
반복 노출 시험의 경우에는 임상적 상태에서의 노출 시간 간격과 기간, 적용 횟수를 근거로 한다.
B.3.7 동물의 관찰
반복 노출이 필요한 경우에는 다음번 투여에 앞서 즉각적으로 펠리트를 제거한 후 육안으로 검사
한다.
각 동물의 볼 주머니 모양을 기술하고, 매 시간 간격마다 표 B.2에 제시된 체계에 따라 각각의 
동물 주머니 표면에 나타나는 홍반에 반응 등급을 매긴다. 시험보고서를 위해 결과를 기록한다.
마지막 처리가 끝나고 (24 ± 2)시간이 지나면 볼 주머니를 육안으로 검사한다. 햄스터를 안락사 
시키고, 주머니의 반응 부위에서 조직 검체를 제거한다. 조직 검사를 하기 위한 처리에 앞서 적합한 
정착제에 담가둔다.

다음 기준은 의료기기 임상시험 관리기준인 ISO 14155-1과 ISO 14155-2 외에 보다 구체적인 범
위까지 적용된다.
C.2 원리
시험하려는 시험물질의 1회 투여는 지원자의 피부를 폐쇄한 상태에서 시행되어야 한다. 시험물
질을 단기간 동안 적용하여 자극을 최소한으로 유지한다. 특정 환경 하에서는 장기적 노출이 
적절할 수도 있다.
평가의 주요 수단은 동시에 측정한 양성 대조군에 대한 반응과 관련하여 피부 자극을 일으키는 
지원자의 비율을 측정하는 것이다.
C.3 시험방법
C.3.1 지원자의 선정
이 규격은 건강한 지원자를 대상으로 시험하기 위하여 설계되었다. 지원자는 임신과 수유를 하지 
않는 18세 이상의 사람으로 선정하여야 한다. 또한 피부염의 징후가 보이거나 시험물질에 대해 
민감한 지원자는 시험에서 제외시켜야 한다. 자격을 갖춘 사람이나 피부과 전문의가 지원자의 선
정을 관리하고 감독하여야 한다.
C.3.2 투여 준비
일반적으로 액상 시험물질은 희석하지 않고 사용한다. 고형 시험물질로 시험을 하는 경우에는 피부와 
충분히 접촉하도록 하기 위하여 적은 양의 물 (대체로 0.2ml)이나 다른 적당한 용매를 이용하여 
시험물질을 적신다. 고형 시험물질의 구조를 고려해야하며, 시험물질 준비방법의 선정에는 충분한 
근거가 있어야 한다. 젖은 검체를 이용하는 경우, 각각의 시험대상에 동일한 양의 시험물질이 적용
되도록 주의한다. 시험검체를 적시기 위한 물의 양은 각각의 시험대상에 대해 동일하게 하고, 
그 양을 기록한다.
용매를 사용하는 경우에 시험물질로 인한 피부자극에 용매가 미치는 영향을 고려해야 한다. 고체 
화합물에 대한 습윤제로 물 이외의 용매를 사용하는 경우에는 각각의 대상에 공시험액 (용매 대
조군)첩포(patch)를 붙일 것을 고려한다.
C.3.3 과정
C.3.3.1 지원자의 수
최소한 30명의 지원자들 (남성과 여성의 비율이 각각 3분의 1 이상)이 시험을 완수해야 한다. 
C.3.3.2 시험물질의 적용
적합한 부위, 예를 들어 상완 바깥쪽에 있는 건강한 피부에 거즈 패드가 들어있는 폐쇄 챔버를 이
용해 시험검체를 적용한다. 적용부위는 모든 지원자에게 동일해야 하고, 기록되어야 한다. 일


반적으로 첩포(patch)의 크기는 1.8cm이상이 되어야 하며, 지름은 가급적으로 2.5cm가 되어야 
한다. 노출 기간이 지속되는 동안 비자극성 테이프를 포함해 자극성이 없는 드레싱으로 첩포
(patch)를 피부에 접촉시켜야 한다.
첩포(patch)는 단위 면적당 적당한 투여량을 전달해 주어야 한다. 시험검체의 양은 1 cm
2
 당 약 50mg
∼100mg이 가장 적당한 것으로 간주된다. 액상 시험물질을 사용하는 경우에는 일반적으로 
0.2ml∼0.4ml를 거즈 패드에 첨가하여 적신다. 고형 시험물질을 사용하는 경우, 일반적으로 0.2g
의 시험물질을 촉촉하게 적셔 거즈패드에 적용한다. 고형 시험검체를 대신해서 적용하는 방법으로
써, 거즈패드는 촉촉하게 적시고, 시험물질은 전체 시험부위를 덮는다.
C.3.3.3 노출 기간
불필요한 강력한 반응이 발생하지 않도록 신중한 시험 접근법을 채택하여야 한다. 순차적 첩포
(patch) 검사에서는 심각하지 않은 양성 자극 반응이 나타날 수 있다. 첩포(patch)는 15분, 30
분, 1시간, 2시간, 3시간, 4시간으로 단계적으로 적용한다. 1시간 노출 후 과도한 반응이 나타날 
것 같은 충분한 징후가 없는 경우, 15분 및/또는 30분의 노출 기간은 생략할 수 있다. 피부 감작성
을 적절하게 평가하기 위하여 피부의 다른 부위에 24시간동안 폐쇄 첩포(patch)를 적용한다. 이와 
같이 노출시간을 연장하는 것은 단기간의 노출에서 피부 자극의 발생이 없는 경우(최소한 48시간까
지 평가한다)에 한한다.
장기간 노출을 위해 시험검체를 적용할 때에는 항상 이전에 처리하지 않은 부위를 사용하여야 한다.
노출 기간이 끝나면, 사용해도 되는 적절한 용매나 물을 이용하여 표피를 손상시키지 않고 기존의 
반응이 변형되지 않도록 남아있는 시험검체를 제거해야 한다. 
C.3.3.4 제한적 노출
시험검체가 심한 자극성을 나타낼 가능성이 있는 경우, C.3.3.3에 기술되어 있는 것처럼 적용 기
간을 단계적으로 증가시키는 것 이외에 노출 시간을 감소시켜 그 시험결과로부터 시험의 진행을 결
정할 수 있다. (48 ± 2)시간/(72 ± 2)시간의 결과를 보고 난 다음 첩포(patch)를 붙여야 한다.
C.3.3.5 피부 반응 등급과 임상적 관찰
처리부위에서 자극성 징후를 검사하고 첩포(patch) 제거 직후, 제거 후 (1 ± 0.1)시간, (2 ± 1)시
간, (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간 마다 반응의 등급을 매긴다. 만약 반응의 가역성
을 측정할 필요가 있는 경우, 관찰기간은 72시간 이상으로 늘릴 수 있다. 이 외에도 시험 전, 후
의 피부 상태를 자세히 묘사해야 한다.(예를 들어, 착색과 수화정도) 표 C.1의 등급에 따라 피부 
자극 등급을 매기고 기록한다.
비침습적 생물공학 방법이 이용되기도 한다. (부록 E 참조)
표 C.1 사람의 피부 자극성 시험, 등급표

| 반응의 특징 | 등급 |
| --- | --- |
| 반응 없음 | 0 |

- 311 -


| 아주 약간의 양성 반응 (일반적으로 처리부위 대부분에서 나타나는 건조 및/또는 연한 홍반이 특징) | 1 |
| --- | --- |
| 중간 정도의 양성 반응 (일반적으로 처리부위를 넘어서 확산된 뚜렷한 건조 또는 홍반이 특징) | 2 |
| 강력한 양성 반응 (종종 가피의 형성 및/또는 부종을 수반하는 강력한 홍반과 그러한 홍반의 확산) | 3 |

4시간 미만의 노출 결과가 1등급 이상의 반응을 나타낸 지원자에 대해, 4시간 동안 시험검체에 
노출시킨다면 더 강한 반응이 나타날 것으로 가정한다. 1등급 이상의 반응을 나타낸 지원자의 경우, 
그 지원자를 대상으로 시험검체를 추가적으로 적용할 필요가 없다. 지원자를 적절하게 보호하기 위한 
추가적인 관찰이 필요하다. 자극성에 대한 관찰 이외에도 기타 영향들을 자세히 묘사하고, 기록한다. 
예를 들어, 지원자는 첩포(patch) 적용과 관련된 증상을 설명하는 훈련을 받아야 하며, 평가자는 
첩포(patch)를 제거하자마자 반응(예를 들어 두드러기)을 즉각적으로 기록하는 훈련을 받아야 한다. 
그러한 관찰을 통해, 자극 효과는 나타나지 않았으나 인지되었다면 시험보고서에 이를 포함시켜야 
한다. 만일 그것이 중요한 것이라면, 지원자를 적절하게 보호하기 위하여 시험 관리차원에서 관
찰내용을 고려해야 한다.
중요한 자료는 4시간까지 노출된 후에 피부 자극성을 나타내거나 피부 자극성이 나타날 것으로 
예상되는 지원자의 숫자이다. 개체별로 반응을 일으키는 데 필요한 시간은(반응이 있더라도), 평가
해야 하는 결과가 아니다; 이는 지원자를 적절하게 보호하기 위한 것일 뿐이다.
C.3.3.6  동시 양성 대조군 물질의 선별과 이론적 근거
사람의 자극성 반응은 다양하기 때문에 양성 대조군을 포함시켜 시험 패널이 시험 화합물의 자극 
영향을 측정하기에 적합한지 결정한다. 가급적 자극 영향 특징을 가장 잘 나타내주는 20%의 황산 
도데실 나트륨 (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS)을 양성대조군으로 사용한다.(부록 F.1 참조) 검증
된 기타 대조군을 이용할 수도 있다.
통상적인 양성 대조군은 기준점(benchmark)으로써 시험에 포함될 수 있다. 피부 자극성은 절대적인 
현상이 아니다. 모든 시험물질이 피부 자극을 일으킬 수 있다. 이는 단순히 노출의 정도와 특성 
그리고 투여량의 문제이다. 따라서 사람의 피부 자극성 시험은 거의 항상 상대적이고, 알려진 화
학적 자극과 관련이 있어야 한다.
C.4 시험자료와 보고서
C.4.1 시험자료
시험자료는, 양성 대조군과 음성 대조군의 결과를 포함하여, 첩포(patch)를 제거한 후 (24 ± 2)시
간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간에서의 각각 대상에 대한 자극성 등급과 기타 관찰된 영향을 표
의 형식으로 요약하여 나타내도록 한다.
C.4.2 자료 평가 및 해석
본 시험의 목적은 급성 노출에 의해 시험물질이 중대한 피부 자극의 잠재적 위험성을 나타내는지
- 312 -

- 313 -
를 측정하기 위한 것이다. 따라서 시험물질이 빈번한 피부자극을 일으키고 그 자극이 양성 대조군
과 유사하거나 또는 그보다 큰 경우, 이는 중대한 피부 자극으로 간주되어야 한다. 한편, 시험물
질이 빈번한 피부자극을 일으키지만 그 자극이 양성 대조군보다 충분히 작다면, 중대한 피부 자극
으로 간주하지 않을 수 있다. 중요한 것은 지원자 보호 측면에서 만들어진 중간결과자료를 종점
(endpoint)자료(자극 반응을 보이는 대상의 비율)와 혼동해서는 안 된다는 것이다. 또한 대상간의 
피부자극에 대한 감수성 차이를 시험물질의 일반적인 피부자극 잠재성의 문제와 혼동해서는 안 된다.
C.4.3 시험보고서
시험 보고서를 위해서는 ISO 14155-1과 ISO 14155-2의 기준을 따라야 한다. 사람 피부 자극성 
시험에 대한 구체적인 보고를 위해서는 다음과 같은 정보들이 수록되어야 한다.

피부 자극에 대한 체외시험(in vitro tests)
D.1 배경 정보
최근 토끼 피부 자극성 시험에 대한 대안으로 화학물질의 자극 활성(irritating activity)을 측정하
는 체외 시험법에 대한 평가 및 검증에 관한 다양한 연구들이 발표되었다. (참고문헌 [101], 
[102], [103], [104] 참조) 2007년, ECVAM 과학자문위원회(ESAC)는 화학물질에 대한 피부자
극(skin irritation)을 측정하기 위한 체외 인체유래 인공피부모델(in vitro human skin model)의 
검증 과정을 평가하였다. (참고문헌 [101] 참조) 이러한 평가 후에 ESAC는 다음과 같이 지지하
였다.  
“충실한 밸리데이션 연구에 필수적인 과학적 보고서와 동료평가 문헌을 다음의 체외시험에 대해 
검토한 후에 
1. EpiDermTM (MTT 환원 및 IL-1α 유리)
2. EPISKINTM (MTT 환원 및 IL-1α 유리)
EPISKINTM 방법이 종말점(endpoint)을 MTT 환원(reduction)으로 평가할 때 토끼 피부 자극성을 
예측하고, R38 피부 자극 시험물질과 비표지(피부 자극이 없는) 시험물질을 구별하기 위한 드레
이즈 피부 자극성 시험(지침67/548/EEC의 부록 V의 OECD TG 404 및 시험법 B.4)에 대한 대
체(replacement) 시험으로 사용하기 위한 신뢰할 만하고 타당한 독립 시험이라는 증거를 제시하
였다. 현재, IL-1α 종말점은 그 특이도(specificity)를 줄이지 않고도 시험에 대한 민감도
(sensitivity)를 증가시킬 가능성을 가지고 있기 때문에, MTT 시험에 대한 유용한 보조방법으로 
간주해야 한다. 이 종점은 MTT 종말점을 통해 얻은 음성을 확인하는데 사용할 수 있다. 
지금은 높은 특이도(high specificity) 때문에 EpiDermTM 모델에서는 피부자극제를 안정적으로 
확인할 수 있지만 음성 결과는 추가 시험을 필요로 할 수 있다(예 ; 참고문헌 [7]에 설명된 배열 
전략에 따라). 민감도(sensitivity)의 수준을 높이기 위해서는 EpiDermTM 시험계획에 대한 개선이 
이루어져야 한다.“ 
               
EPISKINTM와 EpiDermTM 모델 모두에서 피부자극제들을 안정적으로 확인할 수 있지만, 오직 
EPISKINTM 모델만 화학물질의 비자극(비표지) 특성을 입증하는데 사용될 수 있다.
EPISKINTM 모델의 경우에는 음성 반응에 대한 추가 확인을 위해 IL-1α 생성에 대한 측정이 이
용될 수 있다. EpiDermTM 모델에서 음성 반응은 토끼 피부 자극 시험에서의 확인을 필요로 한다.
상업적으로 이용 가능한 피부 모델 외에(D.2.2 참조), “오픈소스(open source)” 모델도 이용할 수 
있다. 이 모델들은 피부와 동등한 매트릭스에서 사람 세포를 이용하는 동일한 원리에 기초로 한
다.(참고문헌 [109] 참조)
피부 자극성에 대한 체외 시험은 지금까지 단일 화합물질에 대해서만 검증되었고 의료기기 용출


- 315 -
액에 대해서는 검증되지 않았다는 점에 유의해야 한다. 의료기기의 잠재적 자극성을 시험하는데 
이러한 시험을 적용하기 위해서는 이러한 특정 부분에 대한 추가적 검증이 필수적이다. 이들 용출
액에서 ‘화학물질의 가능 최저 농도’ 및 ‘용출기법’과 같은 의료기기 시험의 특정 측면들은 용출 
기법이나 배양 시간을 변경하여 시험계획에 적응시킬 수 있다.
D.2 체외 피부 자극 시험의 원리 
D.2.1 일반사항
체외 피부 모델 자극 시험의 원리는 자극 화학물질이 확산에 의해 각질층(stratum corneum)을 
침투할 수 있고, 그 밑에 있는 층의 세포에 독성효과를 준다는 전제를 기초로 한다. 더 나아가 독
성 효과가 없거나 약하면, 정량화 할 수 있는 염증 매개인자(inflammatory mediator)가 표피에 
의해 유리되어 시험의 민감도(sensitivity)를 증가시키기 위한 단계별 접근법에서 사용할 수 있다.
시험물질은 3차원 인체 표피 모델에 국소적으로 적용되고, 최소한 몇몇 상피세포층의 재생 상피
(reconstructed epidermis)와 기능적 각질층으로 구성된다. 
자극 원자재는 정해진 역치 수준 밑으로 세포 생존능력을 감소시킬 수 있는 능력에 의해 확인된
다(예를 들어, 50%). 피부 자극에 추가조치로 염증매개인자의 유리(예를 들어, Interleukin 1α)가 
측정될 수 있다. 
밸리데이션 시험에서는 피부자극에 대한 체외 인체유래 인공피부모델 시험계의 밸리데이션을 위
하여 신중하게 선정된 화학물질이 이용되는데, 이 화학물질은 광범위한 화학물질을 대표한다. (참
고문헌 [102], [103], [104] 참조) 기체나 에어로졸을 제외하고 이 방법은 일반적으로 화학물질 
분류 전반에 걸쳐 적용될 것으로 예상된다.  
D.2.2 일반 모델의 특성
인체유래 인공피부모델(Human skin models)은 상업적으로 얻거나(예를 들어, EpiDermTM, 
EPISKINTM, Vitrolife-Skin, TESTSKIN, Labcyte EPI-MODEL) 개발하거나 실험실에서 만들 수 
있다. 모든 새로운 모델에 대해서는 검증이 이루어지고 기존모델들과 비교 분석이 되어야 한다. 
인체 각질형성세포(Human keratinocyte)는 상피를 만드는데 사용해야 한다. 생존 상피세포의 여
러 층(기저층, 각질층, 과립층)은 기능적인 각질층 밑에 존재해야 한다. 각질층은 소디움 도데실 
설페이트(sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) 또는 트리톤(Triton) X-100과 같은 세포독성 표지자 화
학물질(cytotoxic marker chemical)의 신속한 침투에 저항하도록 기능장벽을 견고하게 만드는 필
수 지질분획(lipid profile)을 포함하고, 여러 층으로 되어 있다. 이 특성은 정해진  세포독성 표지
자 화학물질의 적용 후에  IC50 또는 ET50의 측정에 의해 추정될 수 있다. 모델의 억제 특성은 각
질층 주변의 원자재가 피부생존 조직으로 이동하는 것을 막아, 피부 노출에 대한 빈약한 모델링을 
이끌게 된다. 
일반적으로 새로운 피부나 상피 모델의 특성분석을 위해서는 조직 평가(H&E 염색), 케라틴에 대
한 식별(면역조직화학적 검색) 및 지질분획[고성능박충크로마토크래피(HPTLC)]이 수행되어야 한
다. (참고문헌 [110] 참조)


피부 모델은 박테리아, 마이코플라즈마 또는 곰팡이에 의한 오염이 없어야 한다. 
D.2.3 기능 모델 요구기준 
D.2.3.1 일반사항
기능 모델 조건은 참고문헌 [105]에 설명되어 있다. 다음 기준들은 체외 피부 자극시험의 사용에 
적용된다. 
D.2.3.2 생존능력(Viability)
생존능력의 정도는 일반적으로 MTT나 기타 대사적으로 전환된 생체염료(vital dye)를 사용하여 
정량화된다. 이런 경우에는 음성대조군 조직으로부터 용출된(가용성) 염료의 광도(OD)가 최소 용
출 용매만의 광도보다 20배 이상이어야 한다. 음성대조군 조직의 광도(OD)는 가급적 0.8이상이어
야 한다. 음성 대조군 조직이 시험 기간 동안 배양에서 안정적임을 문서화해야 한다. 이것은 시험 
기간의 여러 시점에서 생존능력 시험을 수행하여 할 수 있다. 측정을 통해 각 시점에 대해 유사한 
생존능력이 나타나야 한다. 
D.2.3.3 장벽기능(Barrier function)
각질층(SC)과 그 지질 조성은 SDS 또는 Triton X-100같은 세포독성 표지자 화학물질(cytotoxic 
marker chemical)의 신속한 침투에 저항하기에 충분해야 한다. 이 특성은 표지자 화학물질이 고
정 노출 시간 후에 50 %(IC
50
)에 의해 조직의 생존능력을 감소시키는 농도의 측정을 통해 또는 
명시된 고정 농도에서 표지자 화학물질의 적용 시 50 %(ET
50
)에 의한 세포 생존능력을 감소시키
는데 필요한 노출 시간의 측정을 통해 추정될 수 있다. 충분하게 기능적인 SC의 ET
50
은 2시간이
상이어야 한다.  
D.2.3.4 형태(Morphology)
사람 피부/상피 같은 구조(기능적 SC 포함)를 보이는 재생 피부/상피에 대한 지속적인 조직 검사
를 수행해야 한다. 이 정보는 피부 구성체의 제조업체가 제공할 수 있다. 
D.2.3.5 재현성(Reproducibility)
특정 모델을 사용한 방법의 결과는 시간이 흐르면서 재현성을 입증해야 한다. 이 모델은 연장된 
시기 동안 기준 화학물질에 대한 정확한 예측을 입증할 수 있어야 한다(표 D.1 참조).  
표 D.1 —품질관리 배치 출하 기준의 예

사용된 상피 모델의 각 배치는 정해진 생산 출하 기준을 충족해야 하는데, 그 중에서도 생존능력
과 장벽기능에 대한 기준이 가장 관련이 있다.  IC
50
 또는 ET
50
에 대한 허용 범위(상한 및 하한)
는 피부 모델 공급업체(또는 실험실내 모델을 사용할 경우에는 임상시험자)가 정해야 한다. 정량
된 조직을 이용하여 생성된 결과만이 자극효과에 대해 신뢰할 수 있는 예측으로 허용될 수 있다. 
한 예로, EPISKIN
TM
 와 EpiDerm
TM
의 허용 범위가 D.3에 제시되어 있다. 
D.3 시험물질
시험물질은 고체, 액체, 반고체 및 왁스로 구성될 수 있다. 액체는 수성이거나 비수성일 수 있고, 
고체는 수용성이거나 비수용성일 수 있다. 고체는 적용 전에 분말이 되도록 분쇄해야 한다. 검체
의 다른 전처리는 필요하지 않다. 의료기기 또는 생체재료의 용출액의 경우에는 극성과 비극성 용
매가 모두 사용될 수 있다. 
음성 기준 대조군 및 양성 기준 대조군은 생존능력(음성 기준대조군), 장벽기능 및 조직들의 결과
조직의 민감도(양성기준대조군)에 정해진 이력 허용 범위 내에 있다는 것을 입증하기 위해 시험물
질과 동시에 처리해야 한다. 양성 대조물질의 목록의 경우 참고문헌 [105]를 참조한다. 
비자극 음성 대조군(NC)(예를 들어, PBS, 물 또는 공시험액)은 시험물질과 동시에 처리해야 한다. 
음성 대조 조직은 배양에서 안정적이어야 하고 시험화학물질 노출과 후배양 기간에 유사한 생존
능력치(viability measurement)을 제공해야 한다. 최소 생존능력(예를 들어, 생체 염료의 절대 광
도(OD)로 표시)은 시험 허용 기준으로 정해져야 한다. 일반적으로 그러한 음성 대조군은 OD가 
0.8 이상이어야 한다.
모델의 완벽한 “녹아웃(knockout)”을 피하기 위해서는 시험에서 적합한 양성대조군(PC)을 사용해
야 한다(예를 들어, 5 % SDS). 충분한 수의 독립 실험을 통해 얻은 데이터를 기초로 양성대조군
에 대한 반응 범위가 파악되어야 한다. 각 시험에서 양성대조군은 정확하게 자극제로 분류되어야 
하고 정해진 반응 범위 내에 포함되어야 한다. 그리고 세 개의 조직 배양 용기의 표준편차는 정해
진 최대치 이하이어야 한다. 이러한 기준이 충족되지 못하면 시험은 무효한 것이 되어 반복 실시
해야 한다. ECVAM 피부 자극 밸리데이션 시험에 사용된 두 가지 피부 모델(EPISKIN
TM
 및 
EpiDerm
TM
)에 대한 일반적인 범위는 표 D.2에 제시되어 있다.
표 D.2 —양성대조군에 대한 모델 반응의 범위의 예(5 % SDS)

| 피부모델 | 생존능력 | 범위 | SD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EPISKINTM | < 40% | 1 . 5 ∼ 3 2 . 2 (1.3∼41.6)a | ≤ 18% |
| EpiDermTM | < 20% | 3 . 7 ∼ 3 . 8 (4.7∼13.6)a | ≤ 18% |
| a 95% 신뢰구간 |  |  |  |

D.4 시험과정
조직 구성체(tissue construct)는 제조업체가 제공한 시험계획에 따라 조직 배양배지에서 배양한
다. 조직이 운송되었으면 실험실에서 조직을 사용하기 전에 조직의 조절을 위해 주의하여 권장된 
- 317 -

- 318 -
과정을 적용해야 한다.
최소한 3개의 충분한 크기의 동일한 조직(replicate) (최소 10mm 지름, 0.63㎠)을 시험검체와 대
조군을 이용하여 배양해야 한다. 시험 검체와 대조군은 최소한 (15 ± 5)분간 피부 구성체와 함께 
배양해야 한다.  
충분한 양의 시험물질을 피부 표면에 균일하게 적용해야 한다. 최소 25 μl/cm2 또는 25mg/cm2를 
사용해야 한다. 고형물질은 피부에 잘 접촉하도록 이온을 제거하거나 증류수로 적셔야 한다. 적합
한 경우에는 고체는 적용하기 전에 분말로 분쇄해야 한다.     
배양 후 (15 ± 5) 분이 지나면, 적절한 완충제나 0.9 % NaCl를 사용하여 철저하게 세척하고 헹
굼으로 시험 검체를 제거한다. 세척과 헹굼 과정은 모든 시험물질을 제거하기에 적절해야 한다.
 조직은 약한 자극 효과로부터 회복을 위해 허용되는 노출 후 회복기간처럼 신선한 배지에서 (42 
± 2)시간 동안 추가 배양한다. (42 ± 2) 시간 후에, 세포 생존을 확인한다.
주) 의료기기의 용출액이 저농도의 자극성 화학물질을 포함할 수 있음을 인지하는 것이 중요하다. 
따라서 노출기간을 조정할 필요가 있을 수 있다. 
세포 생존능력을 측정하기 위해서는 정량법만이 사용될 수 있다. 그 외에, 생존능력의 측정은 3차
원 조직 구성체에서의 사용과 맞아야 한다. 비특이적 염료 결합(Non-specific dye binding)이 생
존능력 측정을 방해해서는 안 된다. 따라서 단백질 결합 염료와  대사물로 전환되지 않는 염료들
(예; neutral red) 은 적합하지 않다. 
가장 자주 사용되는 시험은 정확하고 재현 가능한 결과를 나타내는 것으로 알려진 MTT 환원
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium 
bromide, 
Thiazolyl 
blue; 
CAS 
number 298-93-1)]이다. 피부 검체를 적합한 농도의 MTT 용액(예를 들어, 0.3 mg/ml~1 
mg/ml)에 3시간 동안 둔다. 그런 다음 용매(isopropanol)를 사용하여 침전물 청색 포르마잔
(formazan) 제품을 추출하고, 포르마잔의 농도를 540nm과 595nm 사이의 파장에서 광도(OD)를 
측정한다. 
주 1) 생체염료와 시험물질과의 화학 상호반응이 세포 대사의 상호반응처럼 보여 생존능력에 잘
못된 추정을 하게 할 수 있다. 이것은 헹굼 시 피부에서 시험물질을 완전히 제거하지 않을 때 
발생할 수 있다. 시험물질이 직접 생체 염료에서 작용하면, 생존능력 측정에 시험물질의 간섭
을 검사하여 파악하기 위해 추가 대조군이 사용되어야 한다. 
주 2) 세포 생존능력 측정처럼 세포 대사작용의 검출을 위해서는 MTS 및 WST-1. XTT, MTS 
및 WST-1처럼 테트라졸륨염의 변종을 이용할 수 있다. 
특히 EPISKINTM모델에서 피부 구성체에서 세포의 생존능력 외에, 보완 종점으로 인터류킨
(Interleukin) 1α가 측정될 수 있다. 세포 생존능력이 50% 초과( >50 %)를 보이는 상피 세포의 
경우에는 후 배양기간 [(42 ± 2)시간 후 배양]의 종료 시에 조직 배양배지에 유리된 IL-1α의 양
은 상업적으로 이용 가능한 ELISA 키트를 사용하여 배지에서(즉시 또는 냉동으로) 측정된다. (참

고문헌 [107] 참조)  IL-1α의 양은 국제단위로 표시해야 한다.
D.5 결과 및 해석
각 시험 검체를 통해 얻은 광도(OD)값은 100%로 설정된 음성대조군과 비교하여 생존능력의 비
율을 계산하는데 사용할 수 있다. 자극성 원자재와 비자극성 원자재를 구별하는 세포생존율의 절
사(cut-off) 값과 결과를 평가하고 자극 물질을 확인하는데 사용된 통계 절차를 명확하게 규정하
고 문서화하여 적합한 것으로 증명해야 한다.  
EPISKINTM 또는 EpiDermTM  모델에서 노출 후와 후 배양 후 조직 생존능력이 50% 이하(≤ 50 
%)이면 시험 물질은 피부에 자극이 있는 것으로 간주해야 한다. 
IL-1α이 화학물질의 잠재적 자극성에 대한 추가정보를 얻는데 유용할 수 있지만, 현재는 MTT 
시험을 통해 얻은 결과만이 시험검체를 자극이 있는 것으로 간주하기 위해 사용된다. 자극에 대한 
신뢰할 만한 예측을 위해, 두 종점의 결합을 허용하기 위한 IL-1α 시험의 재현성을 개선하려는 
추가 연구가 진행되고 있다.   
세포 생존능력이 50% 초과(>50 %)를 보이는 조직에 대한 EPISKINTM모델에서, 후 배양기간 
[(42 ± 2)시간 후 배양]의 종료 시에 조직 배양배지에 유리된 IL-1α의 양은 상업적으로 이용 가
능한 ELISA 키트를 사용하여 배지에서(즉시 또는 냉동으로) 측정된다. 
노출 후 (15 ± 5)분이 지나고 후 배양의 (42 ± 2) 시간이 지난 후에 생존능력이 50 %를 초과하
면, IL-1α 유리 양은 9 IU/ml 이상이면, 시험물질은 피부에 자극이 있는 것으로 간주된다.
노출 후 (15 ± 5)분이 지난 후에 그리고 후 배양 후 (42 ± 2)시간이 지나고 생존능력이 50% 이
상이고 IL-1α 유리의 양이 9 IU/ml 이하면, 시험물질은 피부에 자극이 없는 것으로 간주되어야 
한다. 
EpiDermTM 모델에서 음성 반응은 토끼 피부 자극 시험으로서 확인을 필요로 한다. 
D.6 시험 보고서

부록 E
고분자 시험물질로부터 용출액 준비 방법
E.1 일반사항
이 부록은 기니피그 극대화시험(GPMT)에서 사용되는 고분자 시험물질의 용출액 준비에 관한 지
침을 제공한다. 용출액 준비는 참고문헌 [22]에 기술되어 있다. 
E.2 준비 방법
E.2.1 예비 용출
GPMT에서 사용을 위한 가장 적절한 용출 과정을 결정하기 위해 시험검체에 대해 예비 용출 과
정을 수행한다.
용출을 위한 용매로는 메탄올과 아세톤을 권장한다. 시험검체는 (가능한 한) 작은 조각으로 잘라 
별도의 두개의 플라스크에 놓는다. 각 용매의 10배∼20배(즉, 시험검체 각 1그램에 대한 용매 10 
ml∼20 ml)를 각 플라스크에 첨가하여, 용출을 위해 플라스크를 실온에서 진탕(shake)한다. 24시
간∼72시간 내에 매번 동일한 양의 새로운 용매를 사용하여 진탕(shaking)에 의한 용출을 3회 실
시한다[예를 들어, (4 ± 1)시간, (8 ± 1)시간, 또는(24 ± 2) 시간]. 용출액을 각 용출 기간에 수
집하여 혼합한다. 잔류물을 얻기 위해 용매를 증발시켜 제거한다.  
시험에 가장 적합한 용매는 얻은 잔류물의 질량을 기초로 결정된다. 잔류물의 생성률을 측정해야 
한다. 가장 많은 양의 잔류물을 생성하는 용매를 감작성 시험을 위한 용출 용매로 선정한다.   
올리브오일, 아세톤, 메탄올 또는 DMSO(디메틸설폭사이드, dimethylsulfoxide)를 첨가하여 잔류
물의 용해성을 결정한다. 
대부분의 잔류물을 용해하는 용액을 GPMT에서 시험 용매로 사용한다.
주) 시험검체가 아세톤이나 메탄올로 용해되거나 분해되는 경우 또는 적합한 양의 잔류물을 얻을 
수 없는 경우에는 노멀핵산(n-hexane)이나 시클로헥산과 2-프로파놀의 1:1 혼합물을 용출 용
매로 사용할 수 있다.
E.2.2 최종 용출
E.2.2.1 일반사항
유기용매 용출로 시험용액을 준비하는 두 가지 방법이 있다. 방법 1은 잔류물의 충분한 양을 얻
어서 시험검체의 용매용출에 의해 얻어진 잔류물의 양과 시험검체의 중량이 상대적으로 높을 때 
적용한다. 이외에도 방법 1은 특히 반복적으로 사용하는 의료기기에 대한 위험을 평가하는데 권
장된다. (참고문헌 [56] 참조)
방법 2는 시험검체의 용매 용출에 의해 얻어진 잔류물의 양 또는 시험검체의 중량이 상대적으로 
낮을 때 적용한다. 후자의 예로는 콘택트렌즈와 인공수정체가 있다. 
방법 1과 2 모두, 용매의 양은 시험검체의 용출 중에 사용된 용매의 양과 동일하며 시험 용출액

과 같은 농도 과정을 따른다. 이 용매 공시험액은 시험의 각 단계를 위한 음성 대조군으로 사용된
다.
E.2.2.2 방법 I에 따른 시험검체 준비 
방법 1의 경우, 용출은 10-20배 용량을 가진 적합한 용매(예비 용출 시험에서 결정된 대로)로 시
험검체를 덮고 실온에서 교반(진탕)하여 수행한다.  용매는 또 다른 플라스크에 채취한다. 용매는 
3회 교체하고[예를 들어, (4 ± 1)시간, (8 ± 1)시간, 또는(24 ± 2) 시간], 시험물질로부터 용출
된 물질의 침출과 안정성에 따라 24시간∼72시간 이내에 실온에서 교반을 반복한다.   
채취한 용매를 증발시켜 잔류물을 얻는다. 감압(reduced pressure) 조건 하에서도 조정된 증발을 
보장하는 가능한 한 최저의 온도에서 회전증발기(rotary evaporator)를 사용한다.  
상기 예비 용출 시험의 용해도 실험에 의해 결정된 대로 적합한 용매(올리브오일/아세톤/에탄올
/DMSO)에서 잔류물을 용해시켜 GPMT의 피내 유도 단계와 국소 유도 단계에 사용하는 10 
%(w/w) 및 20 %(w/w)의 시험 용액을 준비한다.  
GPMT에서 유발단계의 경우에는 10 %(w/w) 용액을 용매로 준비한다. 10 % 용액은 1 %, 0.1 
%, 0.01 % 및 0.001 % 시험용액을 얻기 위해 용매와 추가로 희석한다. 
E.2.2.3 방법 2에 따른 시험검체 준비 
방법 2의 경우, 용출은 적합한 용매(예비 용출 시험에서 결정된 대로)의 10-20배의 용매로 시험
검체를 덮고 실온에서 (24 ± 2)시간 동안 진탕하여 수행한다. 용매는 플라스크 하나에 채취한다. 
용출 과정은 매번 동일한 양의 신선한 용매를 사용하여 24시간∼72시간 내에 3회 반복한다. 용출
액은 플라스크 하나에서 혼합하고 용매는 증발시킨다.  
피내 유도 단계의 경우, 얻어진 용출액은 용출액의 밀리미터(ml) 잔류 수치가 사용된 검체의 원래
의 그램(g) 수의 절반보다 약간 적거나 같을 때까지 증발시키거나(예를 들어, 시험 검체 10g이 용
출과정을 거치는 경우, 용출액은 약 5ml로 내려갈 때까지 증발시킴), 잔류물을 얻을 때까지 완전
히 증발시킨다. 잔류물을 얻은 경우에는 이것을 적합한 용매(예비 용출 시험에서 결정된 대로)로 
5ml까지 용해시킨다. 이 용액은 200% 시험 용액으로 간주한다.     
이외에, 100 % 시험용액은 200% 시험용액을 용매와 희석하여 준비한다. 
국소유도단계의 경우에는 100% 시험 용액을 사용한다. 피내 및 국소 유도 단계의 경우에는 
200%와 100% 시험용액에서 용매는 올리브오일로 대체하는데 시험용액과 동일한 양의 올리브오일
을 혼합하고 질소기체의 기류하에서 용매를 증발시킨다.
유발단계의 경우에는 100 %, 50%, 25%, 12.5% 및 6.25% 시험용액을 사용한다. 100% 시험용
액은 용매와 희석하여 50 %, 25 %, 12.5 % 및 6.25 % 시험용액을 얻는다. 유발단계의 경우, 시
험용액에서 용매는 올리브오일로 대체하지 않는다. 
E.3 기니 피그 극대화 시험(GPMT)

E.3.1 일반사항
GPMT는 아래에 설명된 유발단계를 제외하고 6.3에 기술된 대로 시행해야 한다. 용매 용출 방법
을 사용하는 유발단계는 폐쇄 드레싱이 없이 수행해야 한다.  
E.3.2 유발단계
폐쇄 첩포 적용 후 2주일이 지나면 모든 시험동물 및 대조동물을 시험검체로 유발시킨다. 
방법 1의 경우에는 10 %(w/w), 1 % 및 0.1 % 시험용액의 0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)을 각각의 시
험동물과 음성 대조동물의 오른쪽 옆구리에 국소적으로 적용한다. 이외에 0.01% 및 0.001 % 시험
용액의 0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)을 음성 대조 용매를 각각의 시험동물과 음성 대조동물의 왼쪽 옆
구리에 국소적으로 적용한다. 
방법 2의 경우에는 100%, 50% 및 25% 시험용액의 0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)을 각각의 시험동물
과 음성 대조동물의 오른쪽 옆구리에 국소적으로 적용한다. 이외에 12.5%와 6.25% 시험용액의 
0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)과 음성 대조 용매를 각각의 시험동물과 음성 대조동물의 왼쪽 옆구리에 
국소적으로 적용한다. 
방법 1과 방법 2의 경우 모두, 양성 대조 동물은 왼쪽 옆구리에 에탄올 0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)
을 적용하고, 오른쪽 옆구리에 0.1% DNCB가 들어있는 에탄올 0.1ml 부분표본(aliquot)을 적용한

배경 정보
F.1 자극성 시험에 대한 배경 정보
덩치가 작은 동물의 피부 자극성 시험은 사람의 피부 자극 및/또는 점막 조직 자극을 일으킬 
가능성이 있는 원자재를 식별하는 데 도움을 주기위하여 실시한다. 주요한 자극제는 심한 
자극, 수포 및/또는 괴사, 염증의 출현을 특징으로 하는 직접 손상 효과의 결과로 피부에 
염증성 변화를 일으키는 원자재이다.
토끼는 토끼의 피부 자극성에 관한 정보가 Registry of Toxic Effect of Chemical Material 
(RTECS)에 다수 입증되어 있기 때문에 가장 선호되고 있는 동물이다. RTECS 등록된 2000개 
이상의 정보는 85%가 토끼에 대한 시험결과이며, 7.5%는 사람에 대한 시험결과이며, 4%는 마
우스, 3%는 기니피그에 관한 시험결과이다. 즉, 공개적인 논문에 제시되어 있는 대다수의 유용한 
자료들은 토끼를 이용해 얻은 것들이다. 비록 염증이 일어나지 않은 부위라도 염증이 일어난 부위
와 동일 반응이 일어난 것일 수 있으므로 시험부위에 반드시 염증이 일어날 필요는 없다.
피부 자극성 시험에서는 숙주, 시험 투여량, 첩포 크기, 폐쇄의 정도, 노출 시간, 용매, 해석 시간
과 해석 품질의 차이에 따라 다양한 결과가 나온다. 그러므로 사람의 피부 자극성 시험에 있어서
는 잘 알려져 있는 양성 대조 원자재와 음성 대조 원자재를 포함시켜서 시험결과를 비교하는 것이 
중요하다. 순도 ≥ 99%의 소디움도데실설페이트(sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS)는 임상 연구에서 
널리 사용되어 왔기 때문에 자극성에 대한 양성 대조군으로 선호되고 있다. 또한 이 물질은 기타 
부작용을 일으키지 않으며, 광범위하고 쉽게 이용할 수 있다. SDS와는 다른 방식으로 작용하는 
노나논산 (nonanoic acid)도 마찬가지로 양성 대조군으로 이용할 수 있다.
SDS 노출은 자원자 패널을 조정하고, 기준점으로 작용한다. SDS는 EU 표준 (88/ 379 / 1988
년 6월 7일의 EEC 이사회 지침)에 따라 피부 자극제로 분류되었다. 그러나 SDS의 자극성이 피
부 자극제로 간주해야 하는 반응 역치 수준에 있는 지 또는 이에 밀접해 있는 지는 명확하지 않
다. 따라서 순수한 원자재를 사용하는 것보다는 최소한 하나 이상의 지역 그룹 (EU)이 피부에 대
한 유의적인 급성 자극으로 간주하고 있는 SDS의 최소 수준, 즉 20% (질량 농도)의 수용성 제제
를 기준으로 삼는 것이 보다 적절하다.
시험동물을 이용한 피부 자극성 시험은 체외 모델의 개발 및 지원자의 사용 빈도가 증가됨에 
따라 점차 감소하고 있다. 생물공학 또는 비침습의 객관적인 측정 방법을 이용하여 자극 반응을 
정량화하고 있기 때문에 주관적 육안 해석 기준에 의존하는 일은 점점 더 줄어들고 있다. 그러나 
지난 10년간의 경험은 알비노 토끼의 드레이즈 (Draize) 피부 자극성 시험을 통해 얻어진 것들이
다.  털을 자른 등 부분의 손상되지 않은 부위에 거즈 첩포(patch)를 붙이고 그 아래에 시험원자
재를 넣는다. 이를 3마리 토끼에 적용한다. 접착테이프로 첩포를 안전하게 고정시키고, 동물들의 몸
통을 (4 ±0.5)시간 동안 밀폐형 드레싱이나 또는 반밀폐형 드레싱으로 감싸둔다. 4시간이 지나면 첩
포를 제거하고, 시험부위를 깨끗하게 닦은 후 1시간 후에 홍반과 부종의 반응 등급을 매긴다. 


- 325 -
이와 마찬가지로 (24 ± 2)시간, (48 ± 2)시간, (72 ± 2)시간 마다 반응 등급을 매긴다. 
토끼 안자극성 시험은 사람의 안자극성을 예측하기 위하여 개발되었다. 드레이즈 (Draize)는 안
자극성 평가를 돕기 위하여 등급 체계를 발표하였다. 눈 손상에 대한 평가를 돕기 위하여 도해가 
들어 있는 지침이 발표되었다. 
안자극에 미치는 영향을 조사하기 위한 대안으로 체외 방법이 개발 중에 있으나, (참고문헌 [26] 참조) 
ICCVAM에서 최근 평가한 4가지 체외 대체 시험 시스템 중 2 가지는 심각한 자극 및 부식을 위
한 체내 동물시험을 대체할 수 있도록 충분히 발전되었다.  BCOP 시험법(Bovine Corneal 
Opacity and Permeability test)과 ICCVAM 시험방법 평가보고가 그것이다[107]. 약한 자극제
(irritnats)에 대해서는 체내 시험이 여전히 필요할 수 있다. 
Research Institute for Fragrance Material Monographs의 향료와 방향유에 의한 피부 자극의 
광범위한 사람 대상 자료는 Food and Cosmetic Toxicology에 발표되었다. 참고문헌 [5]에는 추가
적인 배경 정보가 제시되어 있다. OECD 지침 프로그램에 있는 화학 물질들에 대해 사람에게 미치는 
국소적인 피부 영향과 관련된 OECD 지침을 개발해야 한다는 필요성은 아직 합의되지 못한 상태
이다.
F.2 피부 감작을 위한 감작성 시험
사람에게서 감작은 1회 또는 반복적인 피내 노출 이후에 나타나며, 면역 체계 요소에 의해 시작
되고, 유도된다. 가장 중요한 것은 합텐 (화학 물질)이 피부에 실제로 존재해야하며, 침투할 수 
있어야 한다는 것이다. 합텐은 면역원성 복합체를 형성하는 피부 단백질과 반응을 한다. 표피/피부 
경계에 있는 랑게르한스 세포 (Langerhans cells)는 특정한 림프구에 대한 항원을 만들어 면역 
반응이 일어나도록 활성화시킨다. 이들 가운데 비율이 낮은 림프구는 오래 살아있는 기억세포이며, 
이들은 항 참조가 진행되는 동안 주요한 활성 인자로 작용한다. 따라서 나중에 재-노출되면 활
성화된 림프구에 의해 분비된 림포카인과 손상 부위에 모인 여타의 염증 세포들이 매개하는 부
작용의 원인이 될 수 있다. 
1895년에 야다손 (Jadassohn)은 임상 환자들을 수은 접촉 알레르기에 노출시키기 위하여 첩포
(patch) 시험방법을 이용하였다. 이러한 혁신적인 접근법은 사람과 동물의 접촉 알레르기를 예
측하고 진단하려는 이후의 시험들의 과학적인 근거가 되었다. 화학 물질의 잠재적인 감작성을 평
가하기 위한 예상적/예측적 방법은 기니피그를 이용한 피부 감작성 시험을 완전히 입증해낸 란트
슈타이너 (Landsteiner)와 체이스(Chase)의 선구적인 연구에 뒤이어 개발되었다.
매그누슨과 클리그만은 기니피그 시험의 다양한 변수를 조사하고, 피내 주사(프루인드 완전 보조
제, FCA를 이용하거나 이용하지 않은)를 한 다음 동일한 부위에 시험원자재를 국소적으로 적용하
는 기니피그 극대화 시험 (GPMT) 과정을 제시하였다. 시험원자재가 비자극성인 경우에는 본래의 
시험과정에 앞서 사전 처리를 해야 한다. “약하다”는 의미에는 양성 반응자의 발생률이 0이라는 
의미가 포함되어 있기 때문에, 정의에 의해 그것은 약한 감작제를 검출한다. 이는 민감한 시험방
법으로 광범위하게 사용되고 있다. 프루인드 완전 보조제의 사용으로 시험방법의 민감도가 증대

되었으며, 일부의 경우에서는 문제가 되는 화합물의 잠재적 감작성이 과대평가될 수도 있다.
1965년에 뷰러 (Buehler)는 사람에게 사용되는 과정을 모방하고, 노출을 최적화하는 방법으로 
폐쇄형 첩포 (폐쇄를 시키는)의 사용을 옹호하였다 (사람의 반복 손상 첩포 시험방법 : HRIPT), 
폐쇄형 첩포 과정은 민감하고, 중간정도부터 심각한 정도 까지의 감작제를 정확하게 예측할 수 있
는 것으로 나타나, HRIPT의 과정 동안 예상되는 부작용에 대한 사람의 노출을 피할 수 있도록 
한다. 제시된 자료에 의해 피내 주사와 개방형 국소 적용보다 폐쇄 방법이 우수한 것으로 나타났다. 
면역 체계를 자극하기 위하여 보조제를 사용하지 않았다. 이 방법은 가장 약한 감작제를 검출할 
만큼 충분히 민감하며, 위험 평가 과정에 사용해도 될 만큼 충분히 유연한 기법으로 인정받고 있
다. 그러나 폐쇄형 첩포(patch) 시험 (뷰러 시험) 방법은 GPMT에 비해서는 민감도가 떨어진다.
미국의 폐쇄형 첩포 방법과 유럽의 GPMT는 가장 빈번하게 사용되고 있는 안전성 평가 방법이다. 
이들은 또한 OECD와 EU의 현행 시험 지침에서도 선호하고 있는 시험방법이기도 하다. 기니피그 
감작 평가에서 얻어지는 결과들은 시험결과에 대한 실험실간의 편차를 나타낼 수 있는 동물관련 
요소 및 기술적인 요소에 의해 좌우되는데, 그러한 요소들의 예에는, 동물의 혈통, 성별, 나이, 
시험 환경 상태, 동물의 시험부위, 털 제거 방법 (자르기/면도) 또는 화학적 탈모, 첩포 모양, 
시험원자재의 양, 폐색의 질, 노출 시간과 조직 반응 해석법 등이 있다. 이외에도 수많은 시험방
법들이 사용되고, 조사되고 있으며, 지지자들의 옹호를 받고 있다. 이들 가운데에는 현재 조사자들
에 의한 적절한 검증과 승인만 있다면 규제를 위한 목적에 적합한 것으로 간주되는 것들도 있다. 
어떠한 경우에도 시험과정은 원본 참조에 따라 실시되어야 한다. 기타 시험방법에 대한 목록은

수 있는 투여량-반응 관계를 입증해 주었다. 그러나 LLNA로는 자극성 물질과 알레르기성 물질을 
구분하기가 어렵다는 사실도 보고되었다. 그 결과 자극성과 알레르기성을 모두 갖추고 있는 물질
일 경우에 LLNA는 알레르기성을 과대평가하거나, 자극제에 대해 가양성을 나타낼 수도 있다. 그
러나 LLNA는 시험 기간이 보다 짧고, 종점이 보다 객관적이며, 시험에 필요한 물질의 양이 보다 
적고, 프루인드 완전 보조제 주사법이 생략되어 있기 때문에 기니피그 평가법에 비해 진보한 방
법이다. 유세포 분석 검사와 세포 활성 표지자 분석법을 이용해 시험과정을 진보시킬 수 있다. 독
성학에 대한 LLNA 정례 방법에는 사실상 이들을 표준으로 할 수 있는 지의 여부가 결정되어 있
지 않다. 반면, LLNA는 보다 한정된 범위 내에서 시험 용매를 선정하도록 한다. 대부분의 시험에
는 아세톤과 올리브유를 혼합한 물질이 사용되고 있다. 최근의 연구는 다른 용매를 사용하면 결
과도 달라질 수 있다는 사실을 보여주고 있다. 더욱이 LLNA에서는 림프절을 채취하기 이전에 
유도 처리를 하고 그 후에 동물들을 안락사 시키기 때문에 교차 반응성 유형이나 유발단계를 시
험할 수가 없다. 
림프절 평가 방법의 대안은 발바닥에 피하 투여를 하는 오금림프절 검사 (popliteal lymph node 
assay; PLNA)이다. 오금림프절 검사에서는 림프절 활성화를 직접 측정하는 것 외에 시험대상 
화학물질이 유발시키는 면역제어를 보다 명확하게 하기 위하여 표지 항원을 이용한다.
위험성 평가 과정은 단일 모델이나 일률적인 접근법에 의존해서는 안 되며, 또한 사용자의 안전을 
최대한으로 보장하기 위하여 신중하게 시행되어야 한다. 일반적으로 위험성 평가는 동물 시험 
모델과 사람 시험 모델 모두를 필요로 한다. 이론적으로 증명되고 및/또는 승인된 경우에는 
모델과 접근법을 유연하게 선정할 수 있어야 한다.
적절하게 시행되고, 시험농도에 사용 조건 이상의 충분한 안전 요인이 있다면 기니피그의 음성 시
험은 마지막 시험이 될 수 있다. 그러나 완제품의 사용량을 충분히 고려하지 않고 발병률 및/또는 심
각성만을 바탕으로 시험원자재의 등급을 분류하는 일은 삼가 하여야 한다.
제품에 대한 알레르기 반응의 위험성, 즉 다시 말해 발병률과 강도는 일반적으로 다음의 4가지 
요소에 따라 결정된다; 화학물질 알레르겐이 감작에 미치는 영향, 제품에 들어있는 알레르겐의 
양, 생체 이용률, 노출조건, 화학물질의 상대적인 감작 가능성은 기존의 감작 수준을 유도하는데 
필요한 최소한의 유도 농도로 규정할 수 있다. 농도가 낮을수록 더 강력한 감작제이다. 제품에 
들어 있는 잔여 알레르겐의 수준이 GPMT로 구한 최소 유도 농도를 초과하는 경우, 사용자들에
게서 알레르기성 접촉 피부염이 상당수 발견되었다.
한편, 혼합물과 제품에 대한 예측적 시험은 훨씬 덜 검증되었고, 제품 구성물질의 시험 후에 실시
될 수 있다. 따라서 시험 설계와 결과에 대한 분석은 불확실성한 면이 있지만, 몇몇의 사례들은 
이러한 시험방법의 가능성을 입증해주고 있기도 하다. 사람에게 접촉성 피부염을 일으키는 스웨터

에서 용출한 아세톤 용출액의 동물 시험에서 알레르겐 (포스겐 클로로페닐히드라존, phosgene 
chlorophenylhydrazones)이 입증되었다. 또 다른 사례는 사람한테 접촉성 피부염을 일으키는 고
무장화에서 용출한 아세톤/클로로폼 용출액의 동물 시험인데 이 시험에서는  메르캅토벤조티아졸 
(mercaptobenzothiazole)과 디벤조티아질이황화물 (dibenzothiazyldisulfide)이 원인 알레르겐인 
것으로 밝혀졌다. 적합한 유기 용매 사용의 중요성이 명확하게 입증되었는데, 그 예로 생리식염수 
용출물은 기니피그의 피부 감작성을 유도해내지 못했지만, 유기 용매로 용출한 용출액은 기니피그의 
피부 감작성을 유도해냈다.
일본의 의료용 물질과 기기의 기본적인 생물학적 시험에 관한 지침 (Guidelines of Basic 
Biological Test of Medical Material and Devices, 1995)에서는 유기 용매로 검체를 준비하
는 과정을 채택하였는데, 잔류물을 얻기 위하여 용매를 증발시키고, 동물의 피부 감작성을 유
도할 수 있는 잔류물(혼합물)의 최소 희석 비율을 가지는 원자재로부터 산출된 잔류물의 비율을 
비교함으로써 위험성을 평가하는 방법을 채택하고 있다. 
피부 감작을 시험하기 위한 체외 방법이 아직까지 통상적으로 사용되고 있지 않지만, 화장품에 대
한 동물시험의 이용을 금지하는 유럽의 새로운 규정에 비춰볼 때, 감작제의 확인을 위해 새로운 
전략이 이용될 수 있을 것 같다. (참고문헌 [14], [108], [111], [112], [113] 참조)

을 사용하는 것이 대부분의 국제적인 규제 지침과도 일치하며 타당한 것으로 받아들여진다. 
아급성정맥내시험(subacute intravenous studies)은 일반적으로 24 시간 초과 14 일 미만(> 
24 h but < 14 d)의 처리기간으로 정의한다.
2.9 아만성전신독성(subchronic systemic toxicity)
실험동물 수명의 일부 기간 동안 시험검체를 반복적 또는 연속적으로 투여한 후에 나타나는 부작
용(adverse effects)
주) 아만성독성시험은 설치류에서는 대개 90 일이고, 다른 종에 있어서는 수명의 10 %를 넘
지 않는다. 아만성 정맥내 시험은 일반적으로 처리기간을 14 일에서 28 일까지로 정의한다. 
2.10 만성전신독성(chronic sytemic toxicity) 
실험동물 수명의 상당 기간동안 시험검체를 반복 또는 연속적으로 투여한 후에 나타나는 부작
용(adverse effects)

가의 대상이 되는 용출물의 일부
3 일반적인 고려사항


- 338 -
3.1 일반사항
의료기기의 적절한 시험의 선택을 위해서는 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 따라, 접촉방법 및 접촉기
간을 고려해야 한다.
시험은 최종 완제품으로 수행해야 하고, 완제품으로 시험이 부적절한 경우, 원자재 및/또는 완제
품을 대표할 수 있는 구성품에 대하여 수행해야 한다. 시험검체는 의료기기의 일반적인 제조 
및 공정과정의 조건을 반영해야한다. 예외의 조건이 필요할 경우, 해당 조건을 그 타당성과 함
께 시험 보고서에 기록하여야 한다. 위해요소(hazard)를 확인하기위해 시험검체의 과장된 노출
이 필요할 수도 있다. 
시험계획을 세울 때에는 pH, 안정성(stability), 점도(viscosity), 삼투압(osmolality), 완충 능력
(buffering capacity), 용해성(solubility) 및 무균성(sterility)과 같은 시험검체의 물리적 특성 
및 화학적 특성을 고려해야한다.
동물실험이 필요한 경우에는 제2장(ISO 10993-2)에 따라 타당성 있고 실제 사용 가능한 동물
실험의 대체, 사용하는 실험동물의 수의 감소, 실험동물 고통의 최소화와 관련한 대안을 마련
하고 확인하는 것이 필요하다. 체내(in vivo) 급성독성시험의 경우 초기 투여량 계산에는 체외
(in vitro) 세포독성시험 자료를 이용하는 것이 유용하다.
3.2 실험동물 종의 선택 
의료기기의 전신독성시험을 위한 특정 실험동물을 선택함에 있어서 절대적인 기준은 없다. 그
러나 이용하는 동물 종에 대해 과학적으로 그 이용의 타당성을 규명해야 하며, 이용하는 동물 
종은 제 2장(ISO 10993-2)에 부합해야 한다. 경구, 정맥내, 피부 및 흡입 경로를 이용한 의료
기기의 급성 전신독성 시험에는 마우스나 랫드를 이용하는 것이 선호되며, 추가적으로 피부 
및 이식에 대한 연구에는 토끼를 이용할 수 있다. 시험에 필요한 동물 종의 수와 선택에 영향
을 주는 많은 요소들을 감안하여, 비설치류 종을 이용하여 시험을 할 수도 있다. 
일련의 각기 다른 시험기간으로 전신독성시험 (예, 급성, 아급성, 아만성 및/또는 만성 전신독
성)을 할 때 단일 종이나 계통을 사용하는 것이 선호된다. 이는 종과 계통간의 다양성을 조절
할 수 있고, 시험기간에만 관련된 평가를 용이하게 한다. 여러 종이나 계통을 이용한다면 그 
선택사항에 대한 타당성을 문서화해야한다.
3.3 실험동물의 상태 
일반적으로 그 원산지가 알려져 있고, 미생물학적으로 건강한 상태에 있으며, 실험목적으로 사
육된 건강하고 젊은 성체 동물을 사용한다. 시험 시작 단계에서 같은 성별 내의 개체 간 체중
의 차이는 평균체중의 ± 20 %를 넘지 않도록 한다. 암컷을 이용할 경우에는 교배시킨 경험이 
없고(nulliparous), 현재 임신하지 않은 것을 사용한다. 해당 동물을 선택한 근거를 밝혀야 한
다.
3.4 실험동물의 관리 
승인된 동물 관리 지침에 따라 동물을 보호하고 관리해야한다. 해당 동물은 투여(treatment)하
기 전에 정해진 기간 동안 실험실 조건에 순화시켜야 한다. 의미 있는 연구 결과를 얻기 위해


서는 환경 조건의 통제와 적절한 동물 관리 기술이 필요하다. 독성을 나타내거나 독성에 영향
을 미치는 것으로 알려진 사료의 성분 및 사육시설의 깔짚 재료를 적절하게 규명하고, 그것들
이 시험결과에 영향을 미칠 가능성을 고려한다.
3.5 시험군의 크기와 수 
3.5.1 시험군의 크기
전신독성시험의 정확성은 투여량 당 사용된 동물의 수에 따라 크게 달라진다. 요구되는 정확도
의 정도와 투여군 당 동물의 수는 시험의 목적에 따라 달라진다. 
시험군의 크기는 처리기간에 따라 필연적으로 늘려서 시험이 종료될 때 각 시험군 당 동물의 
수는 전체적인 생물학적 평가를 할 수 있을 만큼 충분해야한다. 그러나 동물의 수는 의미 있
는 결과를 얻을 수 있는 최소한의 동물의 수를 이용한다.[제2장(ISO 10993-2) 참고] 모든 방
법을 고려한 권장되는 최소 시험군의 크기는 표 15에 제시되어 있다.
표 15 권장되는 최소 시험군 크기

| 시험의 유형 | 설치류 | 비설치류 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 급성a | 5 | 3 |
| 아급성 | 10 (암수 각 5 마리)a | 6 (암수 각 3 마리)a |
| 아만성 | 20 (암수 각 10 마리)a | 8 (암수 각 4 마리)a |
| 만성 | 40 (암수 각 20 마리)b,c | c |
| a 단일성별에 대한 시험이 가능하다. 어떤 의료기기가 한 가지 성별에 대해서만 사용된다면, 그 성별로 시험한다. b 단일 투여량 시험군 시험이 추천된다. 과장된 투여량 시험군이 추가로 포함될 경우 권장되는 시험군의 크기는 성별 당 10 마리로 줄일 수 있다. c 만성시험의 시험군 크기에 대하여 통계 전문가의 상담을 받는 것을 추 천한다. 실험동물의 수는 의미 있는 결과를 제공하기 위해 필요한 최 소한으로 한다. 시험 종료 시점에는 결과의 적절한 통계적 평가를 위 한 충분한 수의 동물이 남아있어야 한다. |  |  |

3.5.2 시험군의 수 
독성 위해요소(hazard)의 존재 유무를 설명하기 위해 단일 종에서 적절한 투여량의 시험검체
를 처리한 단일 시험군을 이용할 수 있다(즉, 한계시험). 그러나 다른 다중 투여량 시험 또는 
투여량 반응시험에서는 독성반응을 설명하기 위해서는 여러 시험군이 필요하다. 
아래의 예와 같이 투여를 과장할 필요가 있을 경우에는 시험군의 수를 늘릴 수 있다.
- 임상적으로 노출되는 표면 부위의 다양화
- 노출기간의 다양화
- 용출 가능한 부분 또는 개별 화학물질의 다양화
- 339 -

- 340 -
- 24 시간 내 투여 횟수의 다양화
이외에도 투여를 과장할 수 있는 다른 방법을 사용할 수 있다. 사용하는 방법은 타당성을 밝
혀야 한다.
3.5.3 처리대조군(treatment controls)
시험목적, 시험물질의 특성 및 노출방법에 따라, 음성대조군, 용매대조군 및/또는 모의처리
(sham-treated)대조군을 모든 전신독성시험에 포함시킨다. 이러한 대조군은 시험검체 준비와 
처리 절차를 따라야 한다.
3.6 노출경로(route of exposure) 
의료기기 또는 그 용해물(leachable substance)을 다양한 노출경로를 통해 신체에 접촉시킬 
수 있다. 시험의 노출경로는 가능한 의료기기의 사용과 임상적으로 가장 연관성 있게 해야 한
다. 대체 노출경로를 이용한다면 그 타당성을 밝혀야 한다. 투여경로의 예는 부록 A에 제시되
어 있다.
3.7 검체의 준비
검체의 준비와 안정성에 대한 지침은 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 설명되어 있다.
3.8 투여(Dosing) 
3.8.1 시험검체 투여
시험절차는 시험물질의 독성과 직접적인 관계가 없는 생리적 변화 혹은 동물복지와 관련된 문
제를 피하도록 설계한다. 1 일 단회 투여로 충분한 양이나 농도의 투여가 불가능하다면, 24 
시간을 넘지 않는 기간동안 투여량을 더 적은 양으로 나누어 투여할 수 있다.
시험검체는 생리학적으로 적합한 온도에서 전달되어야 한다. 일반적으로 실내온도 또는 체온
이 이용된다. 편차는 타당성이 있어야 한다.
비경구 경로로 투여되는 용출용매는 생리학적으로 적합해야한다. 필요한 경우, 미립자
(particulate)를 제거하기 위해 검체를 여과하고, 이를 문서화한다.
반복노출 전신독성시험에서 동물을 보정(restraint)하는 시간은 일반적으로 하루 4 시간에서 6 
시간 사이로 제한한다. 보정(restraint)의 방법이나 기간은 과학적 목적을 충족시키는데 필요한 
범위 내에서 최소한으로 하고, 실험동물의 복지를 저해하지 않도록 해야 한다. 예외사항이 있
는 경우에는 타당성이 입증되어야 한다.
 
동물을 보정(restraint)시킬 필요가 있는 경우에는 해당 시험을 시작하기 전에 동물을 보정
(restraint)장치에 순화시키도록 한다.
3.8.2 투여량(Dosage volumes)
투여량에 대한 지침은 부록 B에 요약되어 있다. 다중 투여 시험군을 이용하는 경우, 매 투여 


- 341 -
시 양(volume)이 일정하도록 농도를 조절해서 투여량 사이의 차이를 최소화 한다. 부록 B에 
제시된 것보다 많은 투여량을 사용할 경우에는 그 타당성을 밝혀야 한다. 
경구투여 시 과량을 투여하는 것은 위장에 과잉 부담을 줄 수 있고, 소장으로 바로 넘어갈 수 
있다고 보고되었으므로 피하도록 한다. 또한 많은 양을 투여할 경우 식도로 역류될 수 있다. 
근육내 투여의 경우에도 동물의 크기와 근육의 위치에 따라 투여량이 제한된다. 동물의 종에 
따른 근육내 투여량은 부록 B에 설명되어 있다.
정맥내 일시주사(Bolus intravenous injection)의 양은 약 1 분 정도의 짧은 시간 동안 주입한
다. 주사 속도는 중요한 요인이고, 설치류에서는 2 ml/min을 넘지 않아야 한다.
많은 양을 투여할 때는 천천히 또는 일정한 시간을 두고 주사하거나, 정맥내로 투여할 수 있
다. 실험동물이 임상적으로 두드러진 변화를 나타내는 경우에는 계산된 속도와 상관없이 투여 
속도를 줄이거나 투여를 중단해야 한다. 
용해성(solubility)이나 자극성(irritancy) 등에 의해 제한을 받는 시험검체는 정맥내 주사 속도
를 느리게 할 필요가 있다.  
임상적으로 필요한 경우 연속적으로 주입 할 수 있다. 투여량과 투여 속도는 해당 물질에 따
라 결정되고, 표준수액요법(standard fluid therapy practice)을 고려한다. 한 가지 방법으로 
단회 투여량은 2 시간 동안 순환혈액 양의 10 % 미만(< 10 %)으로 한다. 장기간 투여에서의 
핵심고려사항은 실험동물을 최소한 효과적으로 보정(restraint)하는 것이다.
피하에 투여하는 시험물질에 관해서는 부록 B를 참조한다. 흡수율과 흡수량은 시험검체의 조
성에 따라 달라진다.
3.8.3 투여 빈도(Dosage frequency)
투여 빈도는 임상적 관련성에 근거하여야 한다. 과장된 절차를 명확하게 설명하고 그 타당성
을 입증해야 한다.
급성전신독성시험에서 동물은 시험검체에 24시간 내에 주어진 투여량에 단회 노출되거나, 이 
투여량을 여러 차례로 나누어 노출되도록 한다. 
반복노출시험에서 시험검체는 시험기간 동안 매일, 즉 일주일에 7일 동안 동물에게 투여해야 
한다. 다른 투여 계획도 적합할 수 있지만, 그 경우에는 타당성을 밝혀야 한다.
3.9 체중과 사료/음수 소비량
시험물질의 영향으로 체중과 사료 및 음수 소비량이 변할 수 있다. 따라서 시험검체를 투여하
기 직전에 동물의 개별 체중을 측정해야 하고,(예: 보통 단일 또는 급성 투여의 경우 24 시간 
이내, 반복노출 시험의 경우에는 7 일 이내) 시험 전반에 걸쳐 일정한 간격으로 그리고 시험이 
종료되는 시점에 측정해야한다. 체중에 따라 투여 할 경우, 가장 최근에 측정한 체중 값을 이


- 342 -
용해야한다.
장기간 반복노출시험에서는 필요한 경우 사료와 음수 소비량 측정을 고려해야 한다.
3.10 임상 관찰(Clinical observations)
임상적 관찰은 일관된 기록을 위해 훈련받은 자가 한다. 관찰 빈도와 기간은 독성반응의 특성
과 강도, 증상 발현의 비율 및 회복기간에 따라 결정한다. 특히 급성독성시험의 경우 시험 초
기에 관찰 빈도를 늘릴 필요가 있다. 특히, 임상적 이상증상이 나타나는 경향이 있거나 사망이 
지연되는 경향이 있는 경우 독성반응이 나타나고 사라지는 시간, 반응의 지속시간 및 사망시
점이 중요하다. 동물에게 불필요한 고통을 주는 것을 막기 위해 인도적 실험종료 시점
(humane endpoints)에 안락사 시킨다. 일반적인 임상 관찰에서는 투여 이후에 영향이 최고일 
것으로 예상되는 기간을 고려해야한다. 
관찰을 할 때마다 체계적으로 기록해야한다. 각 동물 별로 기록해야 한다. 
생존능력 또는 명백한 임상적 증상은 케이지에서 관찰(cage-side observations)하고, 관찰내
용은 임상적 영향에 대한 일반적인 실험실 용어를 사용하여 하루에 최소 한 번은 기록해야한
다(부록 C 참조).
장기 반복노출시험의 경우에는 유병률과 사망률 관찰내용은 하루에 최소 두 번은 기록해야한
다. 장기 반복노출시험의 경우에는 임상적 이상증상의 광범위한 검사(screening)를 1주일에 
최소 한 번 하는 것을 고려할 수 있다.
3.11 임상병리(Clinical pathology)
조직, 기관 및 다른 계(system)에 나타나는 독성영향을 조사하기 위해서 혈액학 및 임상 화학
분석이 수행된다. 임상증상이 관찰되는 경우, 계획한대로 동물을 안락사 시키기 직전, 또는 안
락사 과정 중에 반복노출시험에 사용된 동물로부터 채취한 혈액 샘플에 대해 위와 같은 분석
을 해야 한다. 혈액 샘플을 채취하기 전에 동물을 절식시키는 것이 필요할 수 있다. 과학적으
로 필요한 경우, 장기 반복노출시험의 마지막 한 주 동안에 시간 별로 채뇨(예, 16시간에서 
24시간)하여 요분석을 해야 한다. 
혈액학, 임상 화학 및 요분석 평가를 위한 파라미터는 부록 D에 제시되어 있다.
3.12 해부학적 병리(Anatomic pathology)
임상증상이 관찰되는 경우, 급성전신독성시험에서는 육안병리학적 평가를 수행한다.
반복노출시험에 사용된 모든 동물에 대해서는 전신의 외부 표면, 모든 구멍(orifices), 두개강
(cranial cavities), 흉강(thoracic cavities) 및 복강(abdominal cavities)과 내부 장기
(contents)를 포함하는 상세하고 총체적이고 자세한 육안 부검(gross necropsy)을 해야 한다. 
무게 측정을 위해 적출한 기관은 붙어있는 조직을 적절하게 제거하고, 건조해지는 것을 피하여 
가능한 한 신속히 젖은 상태의 무게를 측정한다.
부록 E에서는 무게를 측정하고 조직병리학적 검사를 위해 적절한 고정액에 보존해야 하는 조


직을 제시하고 있다. 
각 유형의 시험을 위한 최소한의 관찰 사항이 표 16에 요약되어 있다.

비임상시험관리기준(good laboratory practice, GLP)에서는 실험실에서 연구를 계획, 수행, 
감시, 기록 및 보고하기 위한 조직, 절차 및 조건에 대해 다룬다. 이 기준은 시험결과의 품질
과 유효성을 향상시킨다. 또한 이 기준은 교역 국가들 간의 양해각서(memoranda of 
understanding, MOU)를 촉진함으로써 국제 조화를 위한 노력을 지원한다. 전신독성시험은 이
와 같은 기준에 의해 수행해야한다.
4 급성전신독성(Acute systemic toxicity)
4.1 일반사항
급성전신독성은 의도된 임상경로의 급성노출로 발생할 수 있는 건강상의 위해요소(hazard)에 
대한 일반적인 정보를 제공한다. 급성독성시험은 아급성/아만성 및 다른 시험의 투여계획을 세
우는데 있어서 초기 단계가 될 수 있고, 어떤 물질의 의도된 임상적 노출경로를 통한 독성작
용 유형에 대한 정보를 제공할 수 있다. 급성전신독성시험에서 시험검체를 투여한 이후 그 영
향(예: 임상적 부작용, 체중 변화, 육안병리학적 결과)과 사망을 관찰을 한다. 심각하고 지속적
인 고통이나 통증 증상을 보이는 동물은 즉시 안락사 시켜야 한다. 두드러진 통증이나 고통을 
유발하는 것으로 알려진 부식성 또는 자극성 물질은 그 사항을 보고하고, 시험을 할 필요가

동물과 비교하여 생물학적 반응이 유의하게 크지 않은 경우, 그 검체는 이 시험의 요건을 충
족하는 것이다.
5 마리의 동물을 사용하여 2 마리 이상이 죽거나, 2 마리 이상이 경련이나 탈진과 같은 증상
을 보이거나, 또는 3 마리 이상이 체중의 10 % 이상 감소하면, 그 검체는 시험의 요건을 충족
하지 않는다.
검체를 처리한 동물 중 한 마리라도 경미한 생물학적 반응을 보이고, 단 한 마리만이 중대한 
생물학적 반응을 보이거나 죽는다면, 10 마리 시험군을 이용하여 시험을 반복한다.
반복 시험에서 관찰기간 동안 검체를 투여한 10 마리 모두에서 과학적으로 의미 있는 생물학
적 반응이 용매 대조군 동물보다 크지 않으면, 이 검체는 시험요건을 충족하는 것이다.

급성전신독성시험은 시험물질의 급성노출로 인한 영향에 관한 정보를 제공할 것이다. 이 시험
결과를 인간에게 외삽하여 적용할 때, 그 유효성에는 한계가 있지만, 허용 가능한 노출에 대한 
유용한 정보를 제공할 수 있다.
5 반복노출 전신독성[아급성(subacute), 아만성(subchronic) 및 만성전신독성(chronic 
systemic toxicity)]
5.1 일반사항
급성독성은 단회 투여량(또는 제한적 노출)에 따른 부작용과 관련이 있지만, 다양한 의료기기
에 대한 인체의 노출은 반복 또는 연속적 노출의 형태이다. 반복 또는 연속적 노출의 영향은 
조직내 화학물질의 축적 또는 다른 메커니즘에 의해 잠재적으로 발생할 수 있으며, 장기적인 
시험(아급성, 아만성, 만성)을 통해 이런 영향의 잠재성을 규명하는 것이 중요하다.
반복노출 전신독성시험은 의도된 임상경로에 장기적으로 노출되어 발생 할 수 있는 건강상의 
위해요소(hazard)에 대한 일반적인 정보를 제공한다. 또한 의도된 임상적 노출경로에 의한 어
떤 물질의 독성작용 방법에 대한 정보를 제공할 수 있다. 
반복노출 전신독성시험은 독성영향, 표적장기, 가역성 또는 다른 영향에 대한 자세한 정보를 


- 348 -
제공하고, 안전성 평가를 위한 기초를 제공할 수 있다. 이러한 시험결과는 임상 및 해부병리학
적 검사 지침의 범위에 반영되는 중요한 정보를 제공한다.
반복노출시험은 일반적으로 재시험 기준을 제공하지 않는다. 또한 관찰된 자료에 대한 통계학
적 평가가 적합하도록 시험군의 크기를 계획한다.(표 15 참조)
반복노출시험은 기간이 다양하므로 시험검체는 안정성(stability)이 보장되는 방법으로 준비한
다.
5.2 시험계획
5.2.1 준비 
건강하고 젊은 성체 동물은 최소 시험시작 5 일 전에 실험실 조건에 순화시킨다.  동물을 무작
위로 선택하여 투여군(treatment group)을 정한다.
5.2.2 실험동물
5.2.2.1 종의 선택
일반적으로 설치류(마우스, 랫드)를 이용한다. 동물 모델의 특징(연령, 체중 등)은 3.2와 3.3 
항에 제시되어 있다. 비설치류를 이용할 경우에는 그 타당성을 과학적으로 밝혀야 한다. 
5.2.2.2 수와 성별
시험군의 수와 유형, 시험군 당 동물 및 성별은 3.5.1 항에 제시되어 있다. 과학적 근거를 밝
혔을 경우, 최종 안락사 시점 이후의 미리 정한 기간 동안 위성대조군(satellite controls)과 함
께 고농도 투여 수준으로 처리한 위성동물(satellite animals)의 사용을 고려한다. 이 시험군은 
그 대조군과 함께 가역성, 지속성 또는 지연된 독성의 영향을 포함하는 처리에 따른 영향을 검사
하는데 이용할 수 있다. 아만성시험의 경우에는 위성동물(satellite animals)을 최소한 28 일 
이상 유지시켜야 한다.
5.2.2.3 사육시설과 사료의 조건
실험동물 사육시설의 온도와 상대습도는 그 종에 적합하게 한다.(예, 랫드의 경우 (22±3) °C, 상
대습도(RH) 30 % ∼ 70 %) 일반적으로 인공조명은 연속적으로 12 시간 동안은 밝게 하고, 
12 시간 동안은 어둡게 한다.
사료 공급의 경우, 시판 중인 표준 실험실 사료를 이용할 수 있으며, 음수는 무제한으로 공급
할 수 있다. 동물은 필요한 경우, 성별에 따라 그룹을 나누거나 개별적으로 적절하게 수용한
다. 그룹 사육의 경우에는 한 케이지 당 수용하는 동물은 5 마리를 넘지 않아야 한다. 
5.2.3 시험조건
5.2.3.1 투여수준(Dose levels) 
인체 안전성 수립의 목적 이외에도 반복노출 전신독성시험의 실험동물과 다른 시험자원


- 349 -
(resource)의 사용에서 투여량-반응 영향을 시험하기 위해 여러 시험군 사용의 타당성을 제시
한다. 투여수준은 3.8 항을 따르도록 한다.
의료기기의 독성시험에 이용되는 투여량은 위험평가(risk assessment)의 결과와 관련하여 정
의하여야 하며, 해당되는 경우, 안전성 요소와 임상적 노출 투여량의 균형을 유지해야 한다. 
좀 더 긴 기간 동안 시험하는 경우에는 최소 3 가지 투여수준과 적절한 대조군을 포함시킨다. 
대조군은 시험검체가 투여되지 않는 것을 제외하고는 시험군과 동일한 방법으로 다룬다.
반복노출 전신독성을 이용한 일반적인 화학시험과는 달리, 의료기기를 이용한 반복노출시험은 
투여량-반응 영향을 유발하지 않을 수 있다. 따라서 최고 농도 투여수준에서 독성영향이 반드
시 나타나는 것은 아니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 일련의 투여량 범위를 사용하면 인체 안전성 한
계에 대한 유효한 평가를 할 수 있다.
5.2.3.2 시험방법
시험기간 동안 1 주일에 7 일간 동물에게 시험검체를 투여하는 것이 이상적이다. 기간이 긴 
반복 노출 시험의 경우에는, 1 주일에 5 일을 기본으로 투여하는 것도 허용되나, 기록을 남기
고 타당성을 밝힌다.
5.2.4 체중
체중은 투여 직전, 시험 기간에 따라 필요한 경우에는 처음 투여 후 매주 그리고 시험 종료시
점에 측정한다.
5.2.5 임상적 관찰
반복투여 전신독성시험의 관찰기간은 시험기간에 적절해야 한다. 관찰 빈도와 관찰 유형의 세
부사항은 3.10 항과 부록 C에 설명되어 있다. 모든 경우에 있어서 시험으로 인한 동물의 소실
을 최소화하기 위해 적절한 빈도로 관찰하고, 필요한 조치를 취해야한다(예, 죽은 동물의 부검 
또는 냉장, 약하거나 빈사상태 동물의 격리나 안락사). 부록 C에 나오는 기술어를 이용하여 피
부와 털, 눈과 점막, 그리고 호흡기계, 순환기계, 자율신경계 및 중추신경계, 체성운동계의 활
동 그리고 행동패턴 등의 변화를 케이지에서 관찰(cage-side observation)한다.
일반적으로 시험물질을 투여하기 전과 시험 종료시점에 안과경 또는 이와 동등한 장비를 이용
하여 안과학적 검사를 한다. 검사는 가급적 모든 동물에서 하는 것이 좋지만, 최소한 고농도 
투여량 시험군 및 대조군에서 한다. 양안에 변화가 관찰되면 모든 동물에 대해 검사를 수행한다. 
검사 예외 사항은 기록으로 남기고 타당성을 밝힌다.
5.2.6 병리
5.2.6.1 임상병리
다음의 검사를 수행한다.
a) 시험기간 종료 시에는 부록 C에서 설명된 혈액학적검사를 한다. 시험기간에 따라 샘플채취
를 더 자주 할 필요가 있다.


- 350 -
b) 시험기간 종료 시에는 혈액에 대한 임상생화학시험을 한다. 시험 기간에 따라 샘플채취를 
더 자주 할 필요가 있다. 모든 반복노출 시험에는 전해질 균형, 탄수화물 대사, 간 및 신장
의 기능에 대한 시험이 적절하다고 여겨진다. 시험물질의 작용방법에 대한 관찰결과가 특
정 시험의 선택에 영향을 줄 수 있다. 측정방법의 예시가 부록 D에 제시되어 있다. 관찰된 
영향에 대한 관찰을 확대시킬 필요가 있는 경우, 추가로 임상생화학시험을 이용할 수 있다.
요분석은 일상적으로는 필요하지 않고, 독성이 예측되거나 관찰될 경우에 수행한다. 측정 항목
들은 부록 D에 제시되어 있다.
정상적인 값에 대한 과거의 데이터는 기준치(baseline levels) 설정과 동시에 진행 중인 시험 
대조군의 비교에 유용하다. 과거의 기본 데이터가 부적절한 것으로 판단되면, 같은 실험실 내
의 동일한 연령, 성별, 계통 및 원산지를 갖는 동물의 정보를 수집하는 것을 고려한다.
5.2.6.2 육안병리
모든 동물에 대해 육안적 부검을 한다. 육안 부검(gross necropsy)은 전신의 외부 표면, 모든 
구멍(orifices), 두개강(cranial cavities), 흉강(thoracic cavities) 및 복강(abdominal cavities)
과 내부 장기(contents)을 포함한다. 부신, 뇌, 부고환, 심장, 신장, 간, 난소, 비장, 정소, 흉선 
및 자궁 등은 건조되어서 부정확하게 낮은 수치가 나오는 것을 피하기 위해 절개 후 가능한 신
속히 젖은 상태의 무게를 측정한다. 이후에 조직병리학적 검사를 할 필요성이 있을 수도 있으
므로, 부록 E에 제시된 기관과 조직들은 후에 조직병리학적 검사가 가능하도록 적절한 고정액
을 이용하여 보존시킨다.
5.2.6.3 조직병리
1) 대조군과 고 농도 투여량 시험군의 동물의 적출한 기관 및 조직에 대하여 전반적인 조직병
리학적 검사를 수행한다.
2) 육안으로 관찰되는 모든 병변에 대해 검사를 수행한다.
3) 저 농도 투여량과 중간 농도 투여량 시험군을 사용할 경우, 이 시험군 동물의 폐는 감염의 
여부를 파악하기 위한 조직병리학적 검사를 한다. 이런 검사를 통해 해당 동물의 건강 상태
를 유용하게 평가할 수 있다. 이 시험군 동물의 신장과 간에 대한 조직병리학적 검사가 고
려된다. 이 시험군 동물에 대한 추가적 조직병리학적 검사는 일반적으로 요구되지 않을 수 
있지만, 고 농도 투여량 시험군에서 병변을 보인 장기에 대한 추가적인 조직병리학적 검사
를 반드시 수행하여야 한다.
d) 위성시험군(satellite group)을 이용할 경우 투여군 중에서 영향을 나타낸 조직과 기관에 대
하여 조직병리학적 검사를 수행할 수 있다.
e) 일반적으로, 만성시험에 대해서는 감염원의 출현을 감시하기 위해 감시동물(sentinel 
animal)을 이용한다. 필요할 경우, 감시 시험군에 대한 혈청학적 검사와 조직학적 검사를 
수행할 수 있다.

5.3 평가기준
5.3.1 일반사항
데이터는 표 형식으로 요약해서 각 시험군에 대한 시험시작 시점의 동물의 수, 병변을 보이는 
동물의 수, 병변의 유형 및 각 유형 병변을 나타내는 동물의 비율을 보여 주도록 한다. 통계학
적 평가를 수행하되, 생물학적 타당성을 우선 고려한다. 일반적으로 승인된 통계학적 방법을 
사용할 수 있다. 통계학적 방법은 시험 계획 단계에서 선택한다.
5.3.2 결과의 평가
반복노출시험의 결과는 선행된 연구의 결과와 연계하여 평가하고, 독성영향과 육안적 부검 결
과 및 조직병리학적 결과 측면에서 고려한다. 평가에는 시험물질의 투여량과 이상반응의 존재
여부 및 시험물질의 투여량과 이상반응의 발생률과 심각도 사이의 관계를 포함하여야 한다. 
관찰하는 이상반응에는 행동적 및 임상적 이상증상, 표적장기에서의 육안으로 관찰되는 병변 
및 현미경 관찰의 변화, 사망의 영향과 기타 일반적이거나 특정한 영향이 포함되어야 한다. 
5.4 최종 보고서
4.4 항에서 정하고 있는 정보를 최종 보고서에 포함시켜야 한다. 그 외에도 다음의 정보를 제
공하한다.
- 혈액학적 시험 및 관련 기초 자료의 결과
- 임상 화학 시험 및 관련 기초 자료의 결과
- 조직병리학적 검사 결과
- 결과에 대한 통계학적 평가 및 생물학적 유의성에 대한 논의
장기 전신독성시험에서는 시험물질에 대한 반복노출의 영향에 관한 정보를 제공한다. 이 시험
결과를 인간에게 외삽하여 적용할 때, 그 유효성에는 한계가 있지만, 인체노출 허용범위에 대
한 유용한 정보를 제공할 수 있다.

투여경로(Routes of administration)
A.1 일반사항
몇 가지 투여경로가 A.2 ∼ A.10에 설명되어 있다. 다른 투여경로가 임상적으로 더 관련성이 있
는 경우, 그 경로를 이용한다. 가장 관련성 있는 투여경로를 이용해야 한다. 대체 투여경로를 이용
할 경우에는 타당성을 밝혀야 한다. 적합한 시험계획을 위해 전문가의 상담을 추천한다.
 
A.2 피부(Dermal)
피부 경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 표면접촉형 의료기기에 적합하다. 시험검체를 경구투여하는 것
은 바람직하지 않다.
A.3 이식(Implantation)
이식에 의한 전신독성시험은 이식되는 의료기기에 적합하다. 이 시험은 일반적인 부위나 특수한 
부위에 적용하여 원자재를 직접 시험하는데 적합하다. 시험물질의 모양 및 표면질감(texture)을 
고려한다. 이식방법은 제 6장(ISO 10993-6)에 설명되어 있다. 
A.4 흡입(Inhalation)
흡입경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 휘발성의 화학증기의 침출이 유도되는 접촉환경을 갖는 의료기기 
또는 흡입될 가능성이 있는 에어로졸/미립자 형태의 시험검체에 적합하다. 이 투여 경로에 대한 자
세한 절차는 흡입독성학(inhalation toxicology) 전문 문헌에서 볼 수 있다. 
A.5 피내(Intradermal)
피내경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 화학적 침출(chemical leaching)이 유도되는 피내 접촉환경을 갖
는 의료기기에 적합하다. 시험검체는 일반적으로 주사를 이용하여 피내 부위에 직접 투여한다. 여
러 처리부위를 이용할 경우에는 명확하게 설명하고, 그 타당성을 밝힌다.
A.6 근육내(Intramuscular)
근육내경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 화학적 침출(chemical leaching)이 유도되는 근육조직 접촉환
경을 갖는 의료기기에 적합하다. 시험검체는 일반적으로 주사나 외과적 이식 방법으로 근육 조직
에 직접 투여한다. 주사하거나 이식한 시험검체로 인한 근섬유의 긴장(tension)과 이에 따른 신경 
손상에 의한 통증의 가능성과 기능 소실을 최소화하도록 적절한 부위를 선택한다. 예를 들어, 비
수용성 조성을 갖는 경우 24 시간 이상 한 곳에 남아있을 수 있으므로, 반복투여시험에서는 투여
부위를 번갈아 가면서 사용한다. 여러 처리부위를 이용할 경우에는 명확하게 설명하고, 그 타당성
을 밝힌다.
A.7 복강내(Intraperitoneal)
복강내경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 화학적 침출(chemical leaching)이 유도되는 체액경로
(fluid-path) 또는 복강(peritoneal cavity) 접촉환경을 갖는 의료기기에 적합하다. 이 경로는 비극


- 353 -
성 기름 추출물 같이 정맥내로 주사해서는 안되는 경우와 미립자가 존재하는 경우에 적절하다.  
이 경로는 정맥내 주사를 위해 여과를 하는 것 보다 바람직하다. 시험검체는 일반적으로 복강에 
직접 투여한다. 투여 빈도를 계산할 때는 이 경로로 투여한 시험물질은 주로 문맥순환(portal 
circulation)을 통해 흡수되므로, 전신순환(general circulation) 전에 간을 거친다는 점을 고려한
다. 위장이나 장에 주사하지 않도록 주의 한다.
A.8 정맥내(Intravenous)
정맥내 경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 화학적 침출(chemical leaching)이 유도되는 직접 또는 간접 
체액 경로(fluid-path) 또는 혈액 접촉환경을 갖는 의료기기에 적합하다. 시험검체는 일반적으로 
혈관계에 장착하거나 직접 투여한다. 미립자가 존재하는 경우에는 복강내 경로에 의한 전달 또는 
검체의 여과를 고려한다. 가장 흔히 이용되는 실험동물 종을 이용한 정맥내 시험에서 권장되는 투
여량과 투여 속도는 부록 B에 제시되어 있다.
시험검체를 혈관 밖으로 주사할 가능성을 최소화하기 위해 주의를 기울인다. 5 분 이상 주사할 경
우에는 나비침(butterfly needle)이나 정맥내캐뉼러(intravenous cannula)의 사용을 고려한다.
A.9 경구(Oral)
경구경로에 의한 전신독성시험은 직접 또는 간접적으로 구강내 점막과 접촉하는 의료기기 또는 
장(enteral)에 적용되는 제품에 적합하다. 시험검체는 일반적으로 위내삽관(gavage)을 이용하여 
투여한다. 일반적으로 시험검체 투여 전에 실험동물을 절식시킨다. 절식 기간은 수 시간에서 하룻
밤 동안 할 수 있으며, 대사율이 높은 동물은 그 기간을 짧게 한다. 절식 기간이 지나면 동물의 
체중을 측정하고, 시험검체를 체중을 기준으로 하여 투여한다. 시험검체를 투여한 후 추가로 3 시
간에서 4 시간 동안 사료를 주지 않을 수 있다. 특정 기간 동안에 걸쳐서 조금씩 투여할 경우, 그 
기간에 따라 동물에게 사료와 음수를 공급할 필요가 있다.
A.10 피하(Subcutaneous)
피하경로에 의한 전신독성은 화학적 침출(chemical leaching)이 유도되는 피하 접촉환경을 가진 
의료기기에 적합하다. 시험검체는 주사하거나 이식하여 피하 부위에 직접 투여하는 것이 일반적이
다. 여러 처리부위를 이용할 경우 명확하게 설명하고, 그 타당성을 밝힌다.

B.1 일반사항
인도적인 동물실험의 원칙에서는 모든 생리학적 또는 병리학적 부작용(adverse effect)을 최소화
하거나 없애기 위해 모든 노력을 기울일 것을 요구한다. 표 B.1의 값은 해당 문헌에 보고된 최대 
허용기준이다. 이 값들은 본 장의 권장사항은 아니지만 시험자는 체중/체표면적, 투여속도, 시험검
체의 물리ㆍ화학적 및 생물학적 특성과 동물의 계통과 같은 요소들과 관련하여 상한값을 적용한
다. 이러한 조절 요소들을 고려하면서, 투여량을 최소화하기 위한 노력을 한다.

물질 매개성 발열원에 대한 정보 
(Information on material-mediated pyrogens)
발열성은 화학물질이나 다른 물질의 열을 발생시킬 수 있는 능력이다. 발열성 반응은 물질매개성, 
엔도톡신 매개성, 또는 그람양성균 및 균류의 구성성분과 같은 물질에 의해 매개될 수 있다. 본 
장은 물질 매개성 발열성에 대해 다루고 있다.
모든 새로운 의료기기에 대하여 체내(in-vivo) 발열성을 시험할 필요는 없다. 그러나 새로운 화학
물질이나 과거에 발열성 반응을 유발했던 물질이 포함되어 있는 원자재에 대해서는 물질 매개성 
발열성을 평가한다. 엔도톡신 오염이 발열성 반응의 원인이 될 수 있으므로, 물질 매개성 발열성 
반응과 혼동하지 않도록 한다.
- 엔도톡신 매개성 발열성(Endotoxin-mediated pyrogenicity)
그람음성균의 생물학적 활성을 갖는 엔도톡신에서 기인하는 발열성의 형태로서 일반적으로 의료기
기 제조공정 중의 발열 유도성 오염이다. 이는 토끼시험을 수행하지 않고, 엔도톡신 특이적 LAL 
(Limulus Amevocyte Lysate)시험으로 의료기기 내의 엔도톡신의 양을 측정하여 평가 할 수 있다. 
16)
  
- 물질 매개성 발열성(Material-mediated pyrogenicity)
이 유형의 발열성은 엔도톡신 관련 요소로부터 기인되지 않은 경우에 해당된다. 다음은 엔도톡신
과 관련 없이 발열성 반응을 일으키는 것으로 알려진 물질의 목록이다:
- 내인성 발열물질(예, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, INF-γ)
- 프로스타글란딘 (prostaglandin)
- 유도물질 (예, polyadenylic, polyuridylic, polybionosinic 및 polyribocytidylic acids)
- 체온 조절 중추의 기능을 교란시키는 물질(예, LSD, 코카인, 모르핀)
- 산화적인산화의 유리인자(uncoupling agents of oxidative phosphorylation) (예, 4, 
6-dinitro -o-cresol, dinitrophenol, picric acid)
- 
N-phenyl-β-naphthylamine및 
aldo-α-naphthylamine[열 
반응 
메커니즘(febrile 
mechanism)이 알려져 있지 않음]
- 박테리아 엔도톡신(예, TSST-1, SEA, Spe F, Spe C)
- 신경전달물질(예, 노르아드레날린, 세로토닌)
- 일부 경우, 니켈 염과 같은 금속
2) LAL testing: AAMI/ST72 - Bacterial Endotoxin - Test methodologies, routine monitoring, and alternatives to 
batch testing.  


- 361 -
물질 매개성 발열성을 감지하기 위해서는 토끼 발열원 시험(발열성의 활성을 감지할 수 있는 범위
가 넓음)을 추천한다. 토끼를 이용한 발열성 시험 방법은 대한약전, 미국약전(United States 
Pharmacopoeia), 유럽약전(European Pharmacopoeia) 및 일본약전(Japanese Pharmacopoeia)
에 설명되어 있다. LAL 시험은 이 물질들의 발열성을 측정하는데 적합하지 않다. 
비 엔도톡신 발열성을 감지하기 위한 다른 방법이 개발되고 그 유효성이 입증되면, 그 방법으로 토
끼시험을 대체하는 것을 고려할 수 있다.
최근에는 단핵세포/대식세포에서 방출된 사이토카인(cytokine)을 기본으로 그람음성균 및 그람양
성균의 구성성분과 균류와 관련된 발열성을 감지 할 수 있는 시험법이 개발되었다. 이 시험방법은 
물질 매개성 발열성에 대해서는 검증되지 않았다.

4 표준물질(Reference materials)
4.1 개요
표준물질(RMs)은 각각의 실험실에서 결정할 수 있다. 화학적, 물리적 및 생물학적 특성의 정도는 
개별 실험실에서 결정한다. 상업적으로 이용 가능한 품목을 표준물질로 이용할 수도 있다.
인증된 표준물질(CRMs)은 고순도, 중요특성, 사용목적에의 적합성 및 일반적 활용성 등을 고려하
여 선정한다. 중요한 화학적, 물리적 그리고 생물학적 특성은 3곳 이상의 실험실에서 협동 시험을 
실시하여 결정하여야 하며, 판매자를 통하여 조사자(연구자)가 이용할 수 있도록 해야 한다.
주) 최소한 5년 동안 공급받을 수 있는 표준물질이나 인증된 표준물질을 선택하는 것이 중요하다. 
이러한 사항은 사용자가 공급자에게 확인하는 것이 바람직하다. 또한 차선책으로 표준물질 또는 
인증된 표준물질의 출처, 조성, 공정과정에 대한 문서를 확보하여 물질의 균일성을 보증할 수 있
다.
4.2 생물학적 안전성 평가를 위한 표준물질의 인증
4.2.1 표준물질의 품질증명은 특정한 재현성이 있는 시험조건 하에서 물질의 생물학적 반응을 정
성적으로 수치적으로 확립하는 과정이다. 그 물질에 대한 생물학적 반응 범위는 실험실 시험을 
통해 확립하여야 한다.
4.2.2 표준물질의 공급자는 그 물질에 대하여 보증하여야 한다. 화학적 특성과 물리적 특성의 정
도는 공급자가 결정한다. 특정한 시험이나 과정을 위하여 표준물질을 검정하는데 필요한 생물학
적 특성은 표준물질을 사용하는 개별 실험실에서 확인한다. 상업적으로 이용 가능한 물질의 적합
함이 증명되고 인증된 경우에는 이들을 표준물질로 이용할 수 있다.
4.2.3 표준물질의 인증은 지정된 시험조건 하에서 원자재의 생물학적 반응의 정성값이나 수치를 
확립하는 과정이다. 이러한 과정을 통해 특정 반응에 대한 시험의 정당성을 입증하고, 인증서를 
발급한다. 실험실간 시험을 통해 물질의 생물학적 반응을 입증하여야 한다.
5 표준물질의 실험대조군(experimental control)으로의 사용
5.1 음성반응 및/또는 양성반응을 재현성 있게 나타내어 시험과정이 적합함을 입증하기 위해 생
물학적 시험에서는 표준물질이나 인증된 표준물질을 대조물질로 이용하여야 한다. 이러한 방법에 
사용된 물질이 각각의 생물학적 시험방법에 적합하게 사용될 수 있는지를 각 시험과정을 통해 규


- 367 -
명하여야 한다. 특성이 규명된 후 한 종류의 표준시험방법 또는 반응에 대해 인증된 물질이 검증 
없이 다른 시험방법에 대한 표준물질로 사용되어서는 안 된다. 예를 들면 지연성 과민반응에 대
해 특성이 규명되고 인증된 물질을 추가적 검증 없이 세포독성 시험방법의 표준물질로 사용해서
는 안 된다.
주) 표준물질을 이용하면 실험실 간의 반응을 비교할 수 있으며, 개별 실험실 내 시험결과의 재현
성을 평가하는데 도움이 된다. 생물학적 반응을 비교하는 경우에는 반응의 범위를 가진 표준물질
을 이용하는 것이 바람직하다. (예: 최소, 중간 또는 극심한 정도)
5.2 실험대조군으로 사용된 표준물질은 실험실과 제조업자의 확립된 품질보증과정에 적합하여야 
한다. 표준물질의 출처, 제조자, 등급, 유형을 확인하여야 한다. 표준물질은 "7. 시험검체 및 표준
물질 준비”에 따라 처리한다.
5.3 표준물질을 실험대조군으로 사용하는 경우에는 시험 검체와 물질의 종류(고분자, 세라믹, 금
속, 콜로이드 등)가 같아야 한다. 그러나 유전독성 평가와 면역 지연성 과민 평가와 같은 기전 기
반의 시험과정(mechanistically based test procedures)에서는 순수한 화학물질을 실험대조군으
로 이용할 수 있다.
6 시험검체 선정

들의 용출물에 대해 시험을 시행하여야 한다(제1장 참조). 이 때, 시험검체 선택의 타당성을 입증
해야 한다.
주) 의도된 사용부위에서(in-situ) 경화되는 원자재의 경우에는, 경화된 상태와 경화되지 않은 상
태를 대표할 수 있는 다른 시험 검체가 필요할 수 있다.
6.2 용출을 해야 하는 경우에도 6.1항의 시험검체 선정 과정을 적용한다. 
7 시험검체 및 표준물질 준비
7.1 오염방지를 위하여 시험검체와 표준물질을 신중하게 다룬다. 제조과정에서 생긴 잔류물은 의
료기기, 의료기기의 일부분 또는 부품으로 간주한다.

시험검체는 제조업자가 권고하는 방법으로 멸균을 하여야 하며, 시험 과정에 필요한 경우 무균기
법으로 다루어야 한다.


- 368 -
3) 멸균하기 전에 시험검체를 세척하여야 하는 경우에는 시험검체의 취급과 선정 시 세척 과정과 
세제의 영향을 고려하여야 한다. 
7.2 시험 과정에 멸균된 시험검체가 필요한 경우에는 멸균 또는 재멸균 과정이 시험검체와 표준
물질에 미치는 영향을 고려하여야 한다.
7.3 9.3.3.b)항에 명시된 바와 같이 시험검체와 표준물질을 조각으로 잘라야 하는 경우에는 안쪽 
면 또는 잘린 표면과 같이 자르기 전에 노출되지 않는 표면을 고려하여야 한다. 시험을 위하여 
의료기기의 대표적인 부분을 자르는데 사용되는 도구는 오염을 방지하기 위하여 사용할 때 마다 
세척하여야 한다.
8 의료기기의 대표 부분 선정
8.1 의료기기의 전체부분을 시험할 수 없는 경우에는 완제품을 구성하는 각각의 개별 원자재를 
완제품에서의 비율대로 시험검체를 준비하여야 한다.
1) 표면이 코팅되어 있는 의료기기의 시험검체에는 코팅 원자재와 기질(코팅된 부분 아래층 원자
재)이 모두 포함되어야 한다. 기질 부분이 조직(tissue)과 접촉하지 않는 부분이라고 해도 시험검체
에 포함되도록 하여야 한다. 
2) 접착제, 무선주파수를 이용한 접합(radiofrequency seals) 또는 용매 봉합제를 사용하여 환자
와 접촉을 하는 의료기기를 제조한 경우에는 대표적인 접합 및/또는 봉합된 부분을 시험검체에 
포함하여야 한다.
8.2 합성 원자재는 합성이 완성된 원자재로 시험하여야 한다. 
8.3 하나의 의료기기에 다른 원자재가 포함되어 있는 경우에는 시험검체의 선정 시 공동작용과 
상호작용에 대한 잠재성을 고려하여야 한다.
8.4 생물학적 반응을 일으킬 잠재성이 있는 의료기기의 부품에 대해서는 시험시스템의 노출이 최
대가 되도록 시험검체를 선택하여야 한다.
9 검체의 용출물 준비
9.1 일반사항
시험과정에 의료기기의 용출물이 필요한 경우, 용출용매와 용출조건은 완제품의 사용, 완제품의 
특성 및 시험 목적(예들 들어, 위해 요소 식별, 위험성 추정, 위험성 평가)에 적합한 것이어야 한
다. 원자재, 용해물(leachables), 잔류물의 물리·화학적 특성도 용출조건 선택 시 고려하여야 한
다.

다음 중 한 가지 조건하에서 시행한다(부록 C.5도 참조) 
1) (37 ± 1) ℃에서 (72 ± 2) 시간 동안 
2) (50 ± 2) ℃에서 (72 ± 2) 시간 동안 
3) (70 ± 2) ℃에서 (24 ± 2) 시간 동안
4) (121 ± 2) ℃에서 (1 ± 0.1) 시간 동안 
주) (37±1) ℃에서 (24 ± 2) 시간 동안 조직 배양용 배지에서의 용출은 세포독성시험에 대해서는 
허용될 수 있다. (제5장 세포독성 참조)
위의 용출조건은 선례를 바탕으로 한 것으로, 의료기기 및 원자재의 위험을 추정하기 위해 잠재
적 위해를 측정하는데 사용되어 왔다. 임상적 사용 동안 일어날 수 있는 용출을 모방하거나, 잠재
적 위해를 충분하게 측정할 수 있는 다른 조건을 사용할 수도 있으며, 이 경우 용출조건에 대해 
상세하게 기술하고, 타당성을 입증하여야 한다.
용출은 시간, 온도, 표면적 대 부피의 비율, 용출매체 그리고 원자재의 상평형에 영향을 받는 복
잡한 과정이다. 가속 용출법이나 과장 용출법을 사용하는 경우에는 고온조건 또는 용출 동역학상
의 다른 조건과 용출용매의 영향을 신중하게 고려하여야 한다.
예들 들어, 온도를 높이는 조건을 사용할 경우에는 두 가지 가능성이 있다.
1) 상승된 온도의 에너지는 고분자의 교차결합 및/또는 고분자의 중합을 증대시킬 수 있으며, 그
로 인해 고분자에서 이동할 수 있는 자유 단량체의 양은 감소될 수 있다.
2) 상승된 온도는 의료기기의 사용조건에서는 일반적으로 발견되지 않는 원자재 분해물을 생성시


킬 수 있다.
9.3.2 사용 조건하에서 용해되거나 재흡수되는 원자재의 경우에는, 9.3.1항에 나오는 용출 조건을 
따라야 한다. 가능한 한, 과장된 노출을 모의하기위해 적절한 용출 용매와 적절한 시간 및 온도 
조건으로 용출하여야 한다. 완벽한 용해(complete dissolution)가 바람직 할 수 있다.
9.3.3 표준 표면 면적을 이용하여 필요한 용출량을 결정할 수 있다. 면적에는 검체의 양쪽 면을 
결합한 면적이 포함된다. 형체가 정해지지 않은 불규칙한 표면은 제외되며 검체의 형태 때문에 
표면 면적을 결정할 수 없는 경우에는 질량/부피(용출 액체의 부피)를 이용할 수 있다. 표 17 참
조
1) 다른 “표면적 대 부피 용출비율”을 사용할 수 있다. 임상적 사용 또는 잠재적 위해의 결과를 
모방하여 비율을 정할 수 있다. (예를 들어 다공성 원자재의 평가와 관련된 표면적 대 부피 용출
비율)
2) 어떤 경우(예: 9.3.4항 참조)를 제외하고, 용출 전에 용출매체에 잘 잠기도록 하기 위하여 원
자재를 작은 조각으로 잘라야 한다. 중합체의 경우에는 약 10 mm × 50 mm 또는 5 mm × 25 
mm의 조각이 적합하다.
표 17 표준 표면적과 용출액 부피

| 두께 mm | 용출 비율 (표면적 또는 질량/부피) ±10 % | 시험물질 형태의 예시 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| < 0.5 | 6 ㎠/ml | 박막(film), 박판(sheet), 튜브 벽(tubing wall) |
| 0.5에서 1.0 | 3 ㎠/ml | 튜브 벽, 판자(slab), 작게 주형된 품목 |
| > 1.0 | 3 ㎠/ml | 보다 크게 주형된 품목(들) |
| > 1.0 | 1.25 ㎠/ml | 탄성체 마개(elastomeric closures) |
| 불규칙한 모양의 고형 의료기기 | 0.2 검체(sample)g/ml | 분말, 환약, 거품, 비흡수성 주형된 품목 |
| 불규칙한 모양의 다공성 의료기기 (저밀도 원자재) | 0,1 g/ml | 막(membranes) |
| 주) 현재까지는 흡수성물질과 하이드로콜로이드물질의 시험에 대한 표준화된 방법 이 없고, 다음의 프로토콜이 제안된다. 원자재 또는 검체 0.1 g 또는 1.0 ㎠ 당 흡수하는 용출용매의 부피를 측정한다. 그 다음, 원자재 또는 검체를 위의 조건으로 용출할 때, 0.1 g 또는 1.0 ㎠ 당 원자재 가 흡수하는 용출용매 부피만큼을 추가하여 용출한다. |  |  |

9.3.4 손상되지 않은 표면과 잘린 표면 간 용출 특성이 서로 다를 수 있으므로, 가능한 한 탄성
체, 코팅된 원자재, 합성물, 판형 등은 손상시키지 않고 원형 그대로를 이용하여 시험하여야 한다.
주) 제조 과정의 결과에 따라 다수의 탄성체의 표면 특성은 가공하기 전의 원자재의 표면 특성과 
차이가 있을 수 있다.
9.3.5 극성용매와 비극성용매를 사용하여 용출하여야 한다. 용출용매의 예시는 다음과 같다.
1) 극성 용매 : 물, 생리 식염수 ; 혈청이 없는 배양 배지
2) 비극성 용매 : 다양한 약전에 품질이 규명되어 있는 신선한 식물성 정제유 (예들 들어, 면실유
나 참기름)
3) 첨가 용매 : 에탄올/물, 에탄올/식염수, 폴리에틸렌 글리콜400(polyethylene glycol 400) (생
리적 삼투압으로 희석된), 디메틸 설폭사이드(dymethyl sulfoxide), 혈청이 있는 배양 배지
주) 원자재와 생물학적인 부분에 대한 용출용매의 영향이 알려져 있는 경우에는 의료기기의 특성 
및 용도 또는 위해요소(hazard)를 식별하기 위한 방법에 적절한 다른 용출용매를 대안으로 사용
할 수 있다.
9.3.6 용출은 교반이나 순환을 시키면서 시행하여야 한다. 정적인 조건에서 용출하는 것이 적절할 
경우, 그 방법의 타당성을 입증하고 구체적으로 기술하여 보고하여야 한다. 
9.3.7 액상 용출물은 가능한 한 기타 조성의 변화나 용출용기에 흡착되는 것을 방지하기 위하여 
준비한 후 바로 사용하여야 한다. 용출물을 24 시간 이상 보관하는 경우에는 보관 조건 하에서의 
용출물의 안정성과 균질성을 입증하여야 한다.
9.3.8 용출물의 pH는 이론적 근거가 제시되지 않는 한 조정해서는 안 된다.
9.3.9 부유 입자를 제거하기 위하여 용출물을 여과, 원심 분리 또는 다른 방법으로 처리하여서는 
안 된다. 그러나 그러한 과정이 필요한 경우에는 이론적 근거를 제시하여야 한다. 
9.3.10 위해요소(harzard)를 확인하기 위해 과장 용출 조건을 사용하여 용해물의 노출량을 증가
시킬 것을 고려하여야 한다. 용출 조건과 용출 용매는 원자재의 물리화학적 특성 및/또는 용출될 
것으로 예측되는 저분자 질량 화학물질을 바탕으로 선정하여야 한다.
9.3.11 사용 조건에서 용해나 재흡수가 되지 않을 것으로 예상되는 원자재나 의료기기의 경우에
는 중합원자재나 의료기기를 용출하는데 사용되는 용제는 중합체 조성을 분해시키지 않아야 한
다. 휘발성 용제를 사용할 경우 중합원자재에 아주 약한 연화(예들 들어, 10 % 이하의 용해) 이
상의 변화가 있어서는 안 된다. 시험에 이용하기 전에, 잔류물이 생물학적 평가에 부정적인 영향
을 미치지 않는 범위까지 용제를 제거하여야 한다(예를 들어, 피부 자극이나 단백질 변성을 일으키
는 영향) 사용 조건하에서 용해되거나 재흡수되는 원자재 또는 의료기기의 경우에는 9.3.2항에 따
른다.


- 372 -
9.3.12 의료기기가 수용성 액체상태인 경우에는 용출을 하지 않고 액체상태의 의료기기를 직접 시험
검체로 사용한다.
9.3.13 사용방법상 의료기기내에 액체를 순환시켜 사용하는 경우(예, 체외순환기기)에는, 의료기
기에 액체를 재순환(re-circulation) 시켜 용출할 수 있다. 가능하다면 하나 또는 그 이상의 조건
을 과장해야 한다(예, 온도, 시간, 부피, 흐름 비율). 용출 방법을 선택한 근거를 보고해야 한다.
9.4 위해요소(hazard) 확인 및 위험 추정(risk estimation)을 위한 과장 사용조건에서의 용출 조건
9.4.1 ISO 14971(Medical devices - Application of risk management to medical devices)에 
따라 의료기기 용출물의 준비 및 시험을 위한 검체(검액) 설계 및 준비과정에서 제조과정의 변경 
또는 제조과정의 불충분한 관리로 인해 발생하는 위해를 고려하여야 한다. 특히 미량원소, 세제, 
소독제와 같은 제조과정상의 잔류물에 주의를 기울여야 한다.
9.4.2 과장 용출법으로 시험된 제품의 요건 내에서 잠재적 독성이 나타나는 경우에는 모의 사용 
용출법으로 더 시험할 필요가 없다.
9.4.3 의도된 사용부위(in-situ)에서 중합되는 제품의 경우, 경화 과정 중 고분자의 반응성분에 의
한 잠재적인 독성 정보를 제공할 수 있도록 시험검체는 의도한 임상 조건을 대표할 수 있어야 한
다. 필요한 경우, 시험용출물은 구성성분을 혼합한 후 중합체의 동력학을 근거로 하여 다양한 시
간대별로 준비되어야 하고, 예상되는 경화 시간에서의 용출물도 포함되어야 한다. 경화 이후의 원
자재를 시험할 경우에는 그 근거를 밝혀야 한다.
체내에서 경화되는 원자재의 평가를 위해 용출하는 경우, 체내에서 원자재의 경화가 시작되는 시점
부터 용출이 일어나도록 하여야 한다.
원자재를 직접적으로 이용하는 시험방법, 예들 들어, 직접접촉에 의한 세포독성 또는 한천확산법
에 의한 세포독성, 이식시험, 일부 유전독성시험 그리고 직접 접촉 용혈성 시험의 경우 원자재의 
체내 경화를 포함하여 임상적으로 사용하는 것처럼 시험 방법에 사용하여야 한다.
주) 원자재 또는 제품의 지정된 크기나 무게로 시험을 할 수 있도록 임상적 전달 시스템을 변형
시킬 수 있다.

시험검체의 용출원리
C.1 의료기기를 용출하는 목적은 용해물의 잠재적 위해요소를 입증하고(hazard identification), 
용해물이 사람의 건강상태에 미치는 위험성을 평가하기 위해 생물학적 시스템에 대한 용해물의 
생물학적 반응을 측정하는데 적합한 시험검체를 제공하는 것이다. 의료기기의 용출물을 준비하는 
경우에는 시험방법의 예측가능성(시험 목적, 이론적 근거, 민감도 등)뿐만 아니라 완제품의 특성과 
사용방법에 적합한 용출용매 및 용출조건을 이용하여야 한다. 따라서 시험 시스템에서의 용출조건
과 용출물의 적용은 제품의 실제 사용조건뿐만 아니라 시험의 목적과 예측가능성을 완벽하게 반
영한 것이어야 한다. 
사용방법상 액체를 순환시켜 사용하는 의료기기의 경우(예: 체외순환 의료기기), 적절한 용출 기
법을 고려할 때 품목별 기준규격을 참조할 수 있다.
의료기기의 위험(risk)을 평가하고, 위해요소(hazard)를 확인하기 위하여 과장된 사용조건에서 및/
또는 실제 사용조건에서 생물학적 시험을 수행한다. 용출은 여러 가지 시험목적에 따라 아래와 같
이 달라진다.
a) 과장용출법은 위해요소(hazard)를 확인하는데 적합하며,
b) 모의사용용출법은 인체에의 위해를 평가함에 있어서 사용상의 안전을 위한 요건을 제시하기에 
유용하다.
c) 완전용출(exhaustive extraction)은 이식되는 의료기기의 안전성을 평가하고, 환자에게 방출될 
수 있는 화학물질의 상한 한계를 추정하는데 적용된다. 
C.2 본 장에서 용출가능물질(extractable substance(s))의 양은 용출시간, 온도, 시험물질의 표면
적 대 용매부피의 비율 그리고 용매의 특성과 관련이 있는 것으로 추정한다.
C.3 용출시간은 용출된 물질의 양을 최대화하기에 충분하여야 한다. 비표준 조건이나 또는 기타 
검증되지 않은 조건 대신 용출 시간과 온도에 대한 표준 조건을 사용할 것을 권고한다. 
C.4 대안적인 방법은 용출가능물질을 충분히 얻기 위하여 용출을 반복하여 농축하는 것이다. 이
러한 방법은 위해 요소를 확인하는데 적합하다.
C.5 용출 온도는 시험물질에 따라 다를 수 있다. 사용과정 중 용해되거나 재흡수되는 원자재를 
제외하고는 용출로 인하여 시험물질이 현저하게 분해되어서는 안된다. 용출 온도는 시험물질의 물
리화학적 특성에 좌우된다. 예들 들어, 중합체에 대한 용출온도는 유리 전이 온도보다 낮아야 한
다. 유리 전이 온도가 사용 온도보다 낮은 경우에는 용출 온도가 녹는점보다 낮아야 한다. 권장 
조건은 9.3.1항에 제시되어 있다.


- 378 -
다음의 사례들은 9.3.1항에 대한 해석을 설명하기 위하여 제시된 것들이다.
a) 연화점(softening point)이나 녹는점(melting point)이 (121 ± 2) ℃보다 낮은 원자재는 녹는
점보다 낮은 표준 온도에서 용출한다. (예들 들어, 초저밀도의 폴리에틸렌)
b) 가수분해가 일어나는 원자재는 가수분해의 양이 최소화되는 온도에서 용출한다. (예를 들어, 
폴리아미드는 (50 ± 2) ℃에서 용출한다)
c) 증기 멸균 처리를 하고, 보관하는 동안 액체를 담고 있는 원자재는 (121 ± 2) ℃에서 용출한
다(예들 들어, 미리 채워져 있는 투석기).
d) 체온에서만 사용되는 원자재는 원자재 분해 없이 최대한 용출할 수 있는 온도에서 용출한다. 
(예들 들어, 고정된 조직(fixed tissue)은 (37 ± 1) ℃에서 용출을 하여야 하는 반면, 세라믹 이식
물은 (121 ± 2) ℃에서 용출할 수 있다.)
주의-본 장의 시험 방법을 단백질로 이루어진 의료기기원자재에 적용할 때는 용출 과정 중 용출
되는 원자재의 생물학적 특성이 변하지 않도록 세심한 주의를 기울여야 한다.
C.6 의료기기 표면적에 대한 용매ㆍ용제의 부피 비율은 다음 항목에 적합하여야 한다.
a) 화학적 분석이나 생물학적 시험에 적합한 투여량으로 용출할 수 있는 물질(들)의 양을 최대한
으로 얻는데 충분하여야 한다. (다시 말해 생리적 한도 내에서의 투여량)
b) 인체에 의료기기를 사용하는 동안의 잠재적 위해 요소를 입증하는데 충분하여야 한다.
c) 원자재가 용매에 충분히 잠겨야 한다. 
특정의료기기에 대한 조건대신 9.3.3항에 제시된 용매의 양과 표준 면적을 사용할 것을 권고한다. 
일부 시험방법에서는 시험의 민감도를 높이기 위하여 용출물을 농축하여야 한다.
주) 용출물의 농축으로 에틸렌 옥사이드와 같은 휘발성 물질의 손실이 생길 수 있다. 
C.7 용매로 선정된 용제는
a) 특정한 생물학적 시험 시스템에 사용하기에 적합하여야 한다.
b) 의료기기를 임상적으로 사용하는 동안 일어나는 용출을 모방하여야 한다.
c) 용출물의 양을 최대화하여야 한다.
특정의료기기에 대한 용매 대신에 9.3.5항에 명시된 표준 극성 용매와 표준 비극성 용매를 사용
할 것을 권고한다.
주) C.5와 C.6절에 제시된 조건의 표준화를 통해 생물학적 시험에서 얻어진 자료를 표준화된 데
이터베이스 개발 및 위험 추정 등 다른 유형의 활용에 사용할 수 있다.
C.8 체내에서 용해되거나 재흡수되는 물질의 경우:


- 379 -
a) 표 17에 나오는 조건을 따른다.
b) 9.3.1항에 나오는 온도/시간을 따른다.
c) 여과나 원심분리와 관련하여 9.3.9항을 따른다.
C.9 의도된 사용부위(in-situ)에서 조합되는 제품의 시험검체 준비
의도된 사용부위(in-situ)에서 중합되는 제품의 용출물 준비방법에 대한 표준방법은 없다. 적합한 
용출물 준비하기 위해서는 개별 부품, 중합시간, 사용목적 및 용출용매를 고려해야 한다. 시험을 
위한 적합한 용출물을 준비하기 위해서 중합 동력학(polymerization kinetics)을 이용하는 것이 
바람직하다. 검체를 용출하는데 적합한 용매를 선택할 때는 경화되지 않는 부품을 고려해야 한다
C.10 완전용출에 관한 설명(comments on exhaustive extraction)
완전용출(exhaustive extraction)에 걸리는 시간은 기 결정된 온도 및 시간에서 연속적인 일련의 
용출을 수행하여 결정한다. 즉 일정시간 동안 용출한 후 그 용출액을 분석하고 신선한 용출용매로 
교체하여 주어 다시 일정 시간 동안 검체를 용출시키고, 그 용출액을 분석하는 일련의 과정을 반
복하여 결정한다. 용출되는 화학물질의 양이 처음 용출단계에서의 용출된 양의 1/10이 되면 용출
과정이 완료된 것으로 간주하여 전체 용출된 물질에 대하여 10 % 교정된 값을 적용할 수 있다.

환경에서 시험방법을 설계할 때 필요한 일반 요건에 대한 지침을 제시한다.
본 장에서는 분해 산물을 생성하는 두 가지 방법으로 모의환경에서의 실시간 분해 시험과 스
크리닝 방법으로서의 가속 분해 시험을 설명한다. 체내 사용위치에서 중합되는 원재료의 경우
에는 중합된 상태거나 경화된 것을 이용하여 시험한다. 얻어진 자료는 고분자의 생물학적 평
가에 사용된다. 본 규격은 비흡수성 고분자만을 고려한다. 흡수성 고분자의 경우에는 비슷하
지만 적절히 변경된 과정들을 적용할 수 있다.
본 장에서는 고분자 의료기기 완제품이 화학적으로 변경되어 생성되는 분해 산물만을 다룬다. 
사용하는 동안 기계적 응력(mechanical stress), 마모(wear), 전자기방사선(electromagnetic 
radiation) 또는 효소, 기타 단백질 및 세포 활동과 같은 생물학적 요인들에 의해 유도된 의료
기기의 분해에는 적용되지 않는다.

고분자 원재료의 환경응력균열 (ESC)
B.1 일반사항
환경응력균열(ESC)은 화학적 또는 생물학적 환경에 대한 노출과 잔류 또는 가해진 응력으로 유발
되는 고분자재료의 균열(crack) 현상이다. 이러한 균열들은 균열  사이를 이어주는 물질(bridging 
material)에 의해 그물모양으로 균열이 퍼져나가는 크레이징 현상을 보일 수도 있다. 균열의 특성
은 사용된 고분자의 종류에 따라 달라질 수 있다. 이외에도 균열에 의해 저분자량 분해 산물이 발
생할 수 있다. ESC 시험의 목적은 의료기기에 사용할 원재료가 환경적으로 응력 균열될 가능성이 
있는지를 측정하는 것이다. ESC 시험을 통해 응력균열을 확인한 경우, 다른 방법을 사용하여 부
산물의 화학적 특성, 생물학적 시험 및 독성학적 위험 평가를 해야 한다.
B.2 영향을 받은 고분자의 유형
ESC는 여러 해 동안 다양한 고분자계에서 나타났다. 의료기기에 사용되는 고분자계 중에서 ESC
가 관찰되었던 예로 폴리우레탄(Polyurethanes), 폴리메타크릴레이트(polymethacrylates), 폴리올
레핀(polyolefins), 폴리스티렌(polystyrenes) 및 폴리카보네이트(polycarbonates)가 있다. 사용된 
고분자의 화학적 성질이 원자재의 ESC에 영향을 미치는 유일한 요인은 아니며, 원재료의 미세구
조도 영향을 미친다. 고분자의 비결정영역(amorphous region)은 결정 영역(crystalline region) 
보다 ESC에 더 민감하다. 의료기기 제조 중에 고분자의 가공과정에서 최종 원재료의 미세구조에 
영향을 미쳐 잔류 응력이 유도될 수 있다. 결과적으로, 최종 원재료의 미세구조와 잔류 응력을 통
해 부분적으로 ESC에 민감할 수 있는 정도를 측정한다.
B.3 시험 모델
B.3.1 ESC는 응력과 환경 요인이 나타날 때만 발생하므로, 시험 중인 의료기기에 대한 시험 시스
템 모델을 통해 두 요인을 규정해야 한다. 
B.3.2 시험 시스템 모델을 개발할 때는 제조공정 중에 생기는 고분자의 내부응력과 의료기기 완
제품의 사용 중에 생길 수 있는 응력의 유형을 고려해야 한다. 예를 들어, 사용 중에 주기응력
(cyclic stresses)이 생기는 의료기기(예; 좌심실 보조 장치)는 사용 중에 정적 응력(static 
stress)만 발생하는 의료기기와는 다른 시험 모델이 필요하다. 이러한 고려사항을 통해 적용할 응
력 모델의 최종 선정하여야한다.
B.3.3 임계 변형 수준(critical strain level) 아래에서는 ECS가 발생하지 않을 것이다. 따라서 응
력 모델은 이 수준 이상의 변형을 허용해야 한다. 이 임계 변형 수준은 원재료와 환경에 따라 다
르다. 최고의 시나리오와 최악의 시나리오가 모두 시험 시스템 모델 설계의 일부분이 될 수 있다. 
B.3.4 시험이 이루어질 적합한 환경 모델(즉, 시약 또는 시험용액)의 개발에 관한 논의를 위해서
는 3.1.4를 참조한다. 
주) 가수분해 과정(hydrolytic mechanisms)의 경우에는 에스테라아제(esterase), 우레아제
(urease) 또는 파파인(papain) 같은 액체 및/또는 효소를 포함한 용액이 적합할 수 있다. 산화과

정의 경우에는 물과 AgNO3, 예를 들어, 0.1 mol/L AgNO3 용액을 사용할 수 있다. 그러나 은 미
립자는 생물학적 평가를 촉발시키고 이에 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 또한 산화과정의 경우에는 희석한 
과산화수소 용액과 코발트(II) 염의 혼합물, 예를 들어 5%∼10%의 H2O2 및 0.05 mol/L ∼ 0.1 
mol/L 염화코발트를 사용할 수 있다.  
B.3.5 동물 모델이 가장 타당한 환경 모델이 될 수 있다(예를 들어, 제6장 참조). 
B.4 결과 평가
B.4.1 생물학적 영향 
ESC는 다양한 생물학적 영향을 미치는 분해산물을 방출할 수 있다. 본 규격은 이러한 영향들을 
시험하는 가장 좋은 방법을 결정할 수 있는 지침을 제공한다. 특히 제1장은 사용자가 시험 시 고
려해야 하는 생물학적 영향의 유형에 대한 지침을 제공한다. 이러한 영향에는 독성학적 영향
(toxicological effects)과 국소 조직 영향(local tissue effects)이 포함되지만 이에 국한된 것은 
아니다. 
B.4.2 의료기기 성능 
의료기기의 성능은 ESC의 결과로 저하될 수 있다. 사용자는 의료기기가 ESC 후에 여전히 의도된 
대로 성능을 발휘하는지 확인하기 위해 의료기기의 성능을 평가해야 한다. 의료기기 개별 규격과 
ISO 14971은 사용자가 이런 확인을 하는데 도움이 될 수 있다.
B.5 결과 보고 
B.5.1 시험 시스템 모델을 선정하게 된 이론적 근거를 기록해야 한다. 
B.5.2 모델 시험 시스템에 대한 상세한 설명에는 최소한 다음과 같은 정보를 포함해야 한다. 
1) 시험된 원재료 
2) 의료기기 완제품과 시험 검체와의 관련성
3) 적용한 응력의 수준 및 유형
4) 환경의 선정
5) 시험 기간 
6) 시험 결과(본 규격의 다른 장을 따라 실시하는 시험은 개별 규격에서 요구하는 보고 계획서를 
사용해야 한다).

1 적용범위
본 장에서는 정량을 위하여 세라믹(유리 제품을 포함)에서 분해 산물의 용액을 얻는 두 가지 
방법을 기술한다. 또한 분해 산물을 확인하기 위하여 이 용액의 분석과 관련된 지침을 제시한

을 다루고 있는 제품 개별 표준을 가장 먼저 고려하여야 한다. 
본 장에서는 체외 시험을 실시하는 동안 세라믹의 화학적 분해로 생성되는 분해 산물만을 다
룬다. 외부 에너지나 기계적 응력으로 유도된 분해는 포함되지 않는다. ISO 6872와 ISO 9693
에는 화학적 분해 시험이 포함되어 있지만, 분해 산물의 분석은 다루지 않는다.
의료기기에 사용된 세라믹의 범위와 결과의 정확도와 정밀도에 대한 다른 요건 때문에 확인된 특정 
분석 기법은 없다. 더 나아가 본 장에서는 분해 산물의 허용 수준에 관한 특정한 요건을 제
시하지 않는다.
이 원자재들은 생물 의학적 응용을 목적으로 하지만, 본 장에서는 이들의 분해 산물에 대한 
생물학적 작용(biological activity)은 다루지 않는다.
2 정의
본 장에서는 다음 용어 및 정의뿐만 아니라 제1장(ISO 10993-1) 및 제8장(ISO 10993-9)에 수
록되어 있는 용어 및 정의를 적용한다.
2.1 세라믹(ceramics): 비금속의 무기 화합물인 일반적으로 결정화된 물질

3.2 치과용 의료기기의 시험
3.2.1 개요
본 장은 조직 환경에 최악으로 노출되는 상황을 모방하고자 하는 시험에 적용된다. 구강에 노


- 397 -
출되는 치과용 세라믹 (예들 들어 세라믹 베니어링 물질)의 경우에는 ISO 6872에 제시되어 
있는 시험 환경이 더 적합하다. 그러나 치과용 임플란트 스템(stems)과 같이 구강에 노출
되지 않는 의료기기의 경우에는 본 장의 3.4항을 적용하여야 한다.
3.2.2 구강에 노출되는 치과용 의료기기의 시험방법
구강에 노출되는 치과용 의료기기의 경우에는 ISO 6872 : 1995의 8.4에 제시되어 있는 방법을 
극한 용액 시험방법으로 이용하여야 한다. 
3.2.3 시편(specimen)의 특성규명
시편의 특성은 3.4.4에 설명되어 있는 바에 따라 규명하여야 한다. 시편의 밀도가 이론상 최
대 밀도 값의 99%이상이고, 시편의 평균 표면 거칠기(Ra)가 5㎛ 이하인 경우에는 직접적인 기하
학적 측정으로 표면적을 계산할 수 있다.
표면적을 지나치게 과소평가하는 것을 피하기 위하여 기하학적 측정에서는 표면 거칠기가 심
하지 않아야 한다.
3.2.4 분석
분석을 위하여 3.4.7.6에서 3.4.7.11에 설명되어 있는 바에 따라 잔류물에서 여과액을 분리
하여야 한다.
3.3 일반적 시험 기법
3.3.1 질량 측정
최소한 정밀도가 0.0005g인 저울을 이용하여 질량을 측정하여야 한다. 모든 질량은 6번 반복
하여 측정하여야 한다. 
3.3.2 건조 기법
측정된 질량 값의 변화가 < 0.1%가 될 때까지 (100 ± 2)℃ 온도의 오븐에서 계속하여 건조
하여야 한다. 일반적으로 이러한 과정은 하룻밤 동안 건조를 시키고, 다음날 2시간 간격마다 
질량을 측정하여 수행한다.
3.4. 극한 용액 시험방법
3.4.1 원리
극한 용액 시험은 pH가 낮은 구연산 완충액을 주로 이용하는 시험방법이다. 여기에서는 최악
의 저급한 사용 환경을 pH값 3으로 정의한다. pH가 3 이하인 환경에 노출되는 의료기기의 경
우에는 pH가 이보다 낮은 용액을 이용하여야 하며, 그 타당성을 제시하여야 한다. 극한 용액과 
시험 시편 사이에 화학적 반응이 일어나는 경우에는 유사한 pH에서 다른 극한 용액 시험의 
타당성을 입증하고, 실행하여야 한다. 
3.4.2 적용 범위
본 시험은 모든 세라믹에 적용할 수 있다. 원자재가 혈액 pH (대략 pH 7.35에서 pH 7.45) 에


- 398 -
서 존재할 것이기 때문에 모든 원자재에 있어 낮은 pH에서의 분해 기전이 혈액 pH에서의 기
전과 동일하지 않을 수 있다는 사실에 주목하여야 한다. 그러나 그럼에도 불구하고, 이러한 엄
격한 시험은 분해 산물이 생길 수 있는 극단적인 조건이기 때문에 대부분의 원자재를 선별하는 
체로 이용할 수 있다.
용액에서 원자재를 원자재의 용해성 한도까지 용해시킬 것을 권고한다. 용해성 한도 종점까지 
시험을 가속시키기 위하여 과립상 시편에 대해 시험을 실시한다.
3.4.3 극한 시험검체 준비
3.4.3.1 시편 구성
원자재의 용도에 적합한 방법에 따라 제작한 시편을 과립 모양으로 만들어야 한다. 시편이 세
라믹 코팅제인 경우에는 기질 물질에서 이를 제거하고, 적합한 크기의 과립 모양으로 만들어
야 한다. 일부 조건 (예들 들어, 얇은 코팅)에서는 세라믹 물질의 양이 극한 시험을 시행하기
에 불충분할 수 있다. 이러한 경우에는 시험의 규모를 축소하여 시험 용액 20ml당 1g의 비율
로 준비한 검체를 이용할 수 있다. 이러한 과정을 마치고 나면 대안적으로 선정한 크기의 검체
를 이용하기 위하여 질량 측정의 정밀도와 정확성을 적합한 범위로 조정하여야 하며, 타당성
을 입증하여야 한다. 
3.4.3.2 과립 제작(Granulation)
텅스텐 카바이드(tungsten carbide) 재질의 막자 사발과 공이로 분쇄하여 과립을 제작하여야 
한다.
3.4.3.3 크기 결정
과립 모양의 시편은 ISO 3310-1에 기술된 것과 같은 건조선별 방법을 사용하여 400㎛의 선
별체는 통과하여야 하고, 315㎛의 선별체에는 남아있어야 한다.
이러한 크기의 과립을 제작할 수 없는 경우,(예들 들어, 코팅제를 분쇄하여야 하기 때문에) 본 장
의되어 있는 크기보다 작은 과립을 사용하여야 하며, 그 크기를 기록하여야 한다.
주) 본 절에 설명되어 있는 것보다 작은 크기의 입자를 사용하는 경우에는 용해가 증대될 수 
있으며, 따라서 용해 산물의 양은 감소되지 않을 것이고, 생물학적 안전성에 관한 위험(risk) 
분석도 손상을 입지 않을 것이다.
3.4.3.4 시편 준비
시작 물질의 질량은 3.4.4.3항에 제시되어 있는 원자재의 용해도 특성에 따라 결정된다.
- 용해성이 낮은 과립 모양의 물질의 경우에는 (5.00 ± 0.05)g을 이용하여야 한다.
- 용해성이 높은 과립 모양의 물질의 경우에는 (10.00 ± 0.05)g을 이용하여야 한다.

100ml에서 완전히 용해될 것으로 예상되는 경우에는 용해성이 높은 원자재로 간주하여야 한
다.
- (5.00 ± 0.05)g의 원자재가 100ml에서 완전히 용해되지 않을 것으로 예측되는 경우에는 
용해성이 낮은 원자재로 간주하여야 한다.
- 정보를 이용할 수 없는 경우에는 고 용해성 물질로 간주하여야 한다.
3.4.4.4 미세 구조와 X-선 특성규명
X-선 회절 분석기를 이용하여 X-선 회절법을 실시하여야 한다. 해상도와 재현성은 0.02°이
상이 되어야 한다. 미세 구조 분석은 ISO 6474에 설명되어 있는 바에 따라 실시하여야 한다.

구연산 완충액은 신선하게 준비하여야 하며, pH는 (37 ± 1)℃의 온도에서 pH 3.0 ± 0.2가 되어
야 한다. 용액은 다음에 따라 준비하여야 한다.
1000ml 용적 측정용 플라스크에 담긴 500ml 물에 21g의 구연산 1수화물(monohydrate)을 
용해시킨다. 1 mol/l의 수산화나트륨 용액을 200ml 첨가하고, 물 (ISO 3696, 등급 2)로 눈금

둔다. 회전 운동이나 상하운동을 이용하여 2Hz로 용기를 교반시켜야 한다. 120시간 이전에 
시험 시편이 완전히 용해되는 경우에는 시험을 종료하고, 시험보고서에 시간을 기록한다. 
3.4.7.5 용기와 시편을 옮긴 후 실온에서 냉각시킨다.

제14장 금속과 합금 소재 의료기기에서 얻어진 분해산물의 확인과 정량
(관련규격: ISO 10993-15:2000)
1 적용범위
본 장은 임상적으로 사용할 준비를 마친 금속성 의료기기나 또는 이에 상응하는 원자재 검체
에서 분해 산물을 확인하고 정량하기 위하여 시험의 설계에 필요한 일반 요건에 대한 지침을 
제시한다. 이는 완성된 금속성 의료기기가 체외 가속 분해 시험에서 화학적 변화를 일으켜 생
성되는 분해 산물에만 적용할 수 있다. 이들 시험에서는 가속화된 특성으로 인하여 시험결과가 
체내에서의 이식물이나 원자재의 작용을 반영하지 않을 수 있다. 기술된 화학적 방법들은 추가
적인 평가를 위한 분해 산물 생성법이다.
본 장은 기계적 응력을 사용하여 유도한 분해 산물에는 적용되지 않는다. 
주) 마모와 같이 기계적으로 유도된 분해는 적당한 제품별 개별 규격을 적용할 수 있다. 제품
군 표준이 분해 산물을 확인하고 정량하기에 적합한 제품 특정 방법론을 제시하고 있는 경우에
는 이들 표준을 고려하여야 한다.
의료기기에 사용되는 금속성 원자재는 광범위하기 때문에 분해 산물을 정량하기 위한 특정한 분
석 기법이 없다. 본 장에서는 특정한 금속이나 합금에 함유되어 있는 미량 원소 (< 10-6)의 확
인은 다루지 않으며, 본 장에 제시되어 있는 분해 산물의 허용 수준에 필요한 특정 요건도 다
루지 않는다.
본 장에서는 분해 산물의 생물학적 작용(biological activity)을 다루지 않는다. 대신 제1장
(ISO 10993-1)과 제16장(ISO 10993-17)에서 적용할 수 있는 항을 참조

3 분해 시험방법
3.1 개요
의료기기에 있는 금속과 합금의 분해 산물을 확인하고 정량하기 위하여 두 과정의 조합이 기
술되어있다. 시험과정의 선정에 관한 타당성은 의료기기의 기능에 따라 입증하여야 한다.
설명된 첫 번째 과정은 변전위 시험(potentiodynamic test)과 정전위 시험(potentiostatic 
test)이 조합된 시험이다. 두 번째로 설명되는 과정은 침지 시험이다. 
변전위 시험은 전위/전류 밀도 곡선에서 특정한 지점의 (Ea와 Ep)를 측정하고, 연구 중에 있
는 원자재의 일반적인 전기화학적 작용을 측정하는데 사용한다. 
침지 시험은 분석해야 하는 분해 산물을 생성하기 위하여 시험원자재를 화학적으로 분해하는
데 사용한다.
분해로 인하여 금속 기질에서 코팅제가 손실될 가능성이 있는 경우에는 코팅제뿐만 아니라 기
질 원자재의 잠재적 분해 산물도 고려하여야 한다. 이외에도 비금속성 원자재로 코팅된 금속 
기질을 시험하는 경우에는 코팅제의 잠재적 분해 산물을 측정하기 위하여 제12장(ISO 
10993-13) 및/또는 제13장(ISO 10993-14)의 요건을 고려하여야 한다.
분해 산물의 확인과 정량은 해당되는 경우, 제15장(ISO 10993-16)에 따른 독성 동태학적 시
험과 생물학적 반응을 평가하는데 있어 근거를 형성한다.
3.2 전제 조건
전기화학적 분해 반응의 속도는 검체 상태 및 준비, 시험 기구와 시험 조건의 작은 변화에도 
민감하다. 따라서 전기화학적 분해 시험은 경험이 많고 자격이 있는 사람이 적합한 시설을 갖
추고 있는 실험실에서 시행하여야 한다. 여기에는 시험 장치의 보정과 적합한 관리가 포함된다. 
장치의 사용방법 및 작업조건에 대한 타당성을 입증하여야 한다.
주) 안정성, 예열 시간, 등등과 관련하여 전기화학적 시험 조건을 충족하고 있는지의 여부는 [1]
에 일치하고 있는지를 통하여 입증할 수 있다.
4 시료 및 검체 준비
4.1 검체 문서화
시험 중에 있는 원자재(들)의 일반적인 조성을 문서로 제시하여야 한다.
4.2 시험 용액(전해질)
사용하려는 시험 용액 (전해질)은 의료기기의 용도에 적합한 것이어야 한다. 모든 화학 물질의 등
급은 분석 등급(analytical grade)이어야 하며, ISO 3696에 따라 2등급의 물로 용해하여야 한

다. 
우선적으로 선택해야 하는 전해질은 염화나트륨이 0.9%인 등장 수용액이다. 인공 타액이나 인
공 혈장과 같은 다른 전해질을 이용할 수도 있다. 대신 사용할 수 있는 성분의 사례는 부록 
C에 제시되어 있다.
시험보고서에 전해질 선택의 타당성이 입증되어야 한다. 0.9% 염화나트륨 수용액이 아닌 다른 
전해질을 사용하는 경우에 해당 pH를 명시하여야 한다.
4.3 시험검체의 준비
4.3.1 시험검체
화학적 분해 시험의 민감도는 원자재 조성의 차이와 원자재 공정 그리고 표면 처리 과정과 관
련이 있다. 검체 채취 과정과 검체 모양 그리고 표면 준비가 무엇보다 중요하다. 검체는 완성
된 의료기기를 대표하는 것이어야 한다.
4.3.2 검체 채취
각각의 화학적 시험을 위하여 제11장(ISO 10993-12)에 제시되어 있는 바에 따라 최소한 두
개의 검체를 준비하여야 한다. 시험결과에서 중요한 편차가 발견되는 경우에는 편차의 원인을 
밝혀야 하며, 보다 많은 검체를 시험하여야 한다. 
제조 조건에 의하여 금속 검체가 이방성(anisotropic)을 띠는 경우, 단일 표면 노출과 연관이 
있는 시험에는 가로 제작 방향과 세로 제작 방향 모두에 평행이 되도록 자른 검체를 포함하여
야 한다.
4.3.3 검체 모양
대표적인 의료기기와 비교할 수 있는 방법으로 준비되는 경우에는 원형 막대 또는 직사각형 막
대 또는 단일 자유 표면이나 평평한 쿠폰(flat coupons)을 분해 시험에 표준 검체로 이용할 
수 있다. 검체가 실제 의료기기의 성분인 경우에는 어느 모양이나 상태여도 무방하나, 잘 관리
된 조건 하에서 시험을 수행하고, 기록하여야 한다.
전해질에 노출된 검체의 표면적은 분해 속도의 반복적인 측정과 정확성을 보증하기 위하여 전
체 기하학적 표면에 대하여 10% 이상의 정확도까지 측정하여야 한다. 
4.3.4 검체 표면 상태
원자재의 표면 상태는 전기화학적 작용에 영향을 미칠 수 있기 때문에 시험검체의 표면 상태는 완
성된 의료기기와 동일하여야 하며, 시험보고서에 이를 기록하여야 한다. 서로 다른 원자재
를 시험한 결과를 비교하기 위하여 시험검체의 표면 상태는 동일한 것이어야 한다.

전해 전지 모형도는 부록 B에 제시되어 있다.
5.2 검체 준비
시험 표면만을 전해질과 접촉시키기 위하여 방수 전극 홀더에 시험검체를 놓는다. 검체와 장
비 사이에 틈이 생겨 틈새 부식이 발생할 수 있는 조건이 생기지 않도록 주의한다. 시험을 하
기 전에 에탄올에서 10분에서 15분 동안 초음파로 시료를 세척한다. ISO 3696에 따라 2등급
의 물로 신중하게 헹구고 난후 곧바로 시험 전지 안으로 옮긴다. 
5.3 시험 조건
시험 용액 (전해질)으로 시험 전지를 채운다. 전기화학적 작용이 10℃에서 50℃의 온도 범위에 민
감한 경우에는 전해질 전지를 (37 ± 1)℃로 유지한다. 시험을 시작하기 전에 30분 이상 약 
100 ㎤min-1의 속도로 산소가 포함되지 않은 질소나 또는 아르곤으로 기포를 생성시켜 전해
질에서 산소의 수준을 감소시킨다. 농도 기울기(gradients)를 피하기 위하여 기계적 수단이
나 가스로 기포를 만들어 전해질을 교반하여야 한다. 가스 교반법을 이용하는 경우에는 활성화
된 시험 표면에 가스 기포가 부착되지 않도록 주의를 기울여야 한다. 
자기 교반기는 종종 전기화학적 시험 전지에 장애를 일으킨다. 자기 교반기를 사용하는 경우

에는 시험 장비의 유효성을 입증하기 위하여 자기 교반기가 시험 전지에 미치는 영향을 측정
하여야 한다 (3.2 참조).
5.4 변전위 측정
작동 전극(working electrode)을 침지시키고 2시간 후에 개방형 회로 전위를 측정한다. 변전위를 
측정하기 위해서는 이 전위가 시작 전위가 되어야 한다. 전위 상승 속도의 효과가 적은 경
우의 시험을 제외하고, 전위 상승 속도가 스위프율 증가에 의해 10 mVㆍs-1 까지 가속될 수 
있는 시험의 경우 스위프율(sweep rate)은 1.0 mVㆍs-1이 되어야 한다. 검체의 과부동태 범
위(transpassive range)를 평가하기 위하여 최대 2000 mV나 최대 전류 밀도 1.0 mAㆍ㎝-2 
중 어느 것이나 먼저 도달하는 수치를 가지고 전위/전류 밀도 곡선을 기록한다(그림 5 참조). 
일관성을 확보하기 위하여 반대 방향으로 스캔하여 적어도 개방형 회로 전위까지 계속 반대로 
진행한다. 2000 mV나 1.0 mAㆍ㎝-2까지 시험을 반대로 반복한다. 곡선이 재현되지 않는 경
우에는 (5 ∼ 10) 번 순환시킨다. (5 ∼ 10) 번 순환한 이후에도 전위/전류 밀도 곡선이 일관
되게 유지되지 않는 경우에는 시험 기구, 전극 기능, 원자재 고유의 특성, 등등과 같이 원인이 
될 수 있는 요인들을 조사한다. 로그 전류 밀도/전위 곡선 또한 기록하여야 한다(그림 5 참
조). 마지막 순환에서 파괴전위(breakdown potential; Ep)를 기록한다(그림 5 참조).
전기화학적 시험을 하는 동안 귀금속은 부동태 상태가 되는 금속(passivating metals)과는 다
르게 작용할 수 있다. 따라서 다른 금속 시스템에서 파괴전위(breakdown potential; Ep)를 측
정할 때는 신중하여야 한다.
5.5 정전위 측정
본 방법은 전해질로 용해할 수 있는 분해 산물을 정성적으로 그리고 정량적으로 측정할 수 있
도록 해준다.
시험 시간 동안 일정한 전극 전위에서 새로운 시험검체를 고정시키고 전류 밀도/시간 곡선을 
기록한다. 분해 산물을 측정하는데 사용하는 전위는 파괴전위(breakdown potential; Ep) + 
50mV 이어야 한다. 시험된 원자재에 따라 분극 기간은 1시간 또는 5시간이 되어야 하며, 이
를 기록하여야 한다. 나중에 계산에 사용할 전해질의 양을 측정하고 기록한다.

체(들)을 완전히 덮을 수 있도록 유리 용기의 크기를 선정하여야 한다.


- 412 -
생물학적 오염으로 인하여 자료가 손상되지 않아야 한다. 예들 들어, 전해질은 무균 상태에서 준
비해야 할 수도 있다 
주) 전해질의 양과 표면적은 의도한 분석 방법에 사용하기에 충분한 것이어야 한다.
최대 지지선 또는 지지점을 제외하고 검체가 유리 표면에 닿지 않도록 주의를 기울여야 한다. 
시험검체가 작은 경우에는 하나의 시험검체로 적당한 표면적/부피 율에 도달할 수 없을 것이
다. 따라서 시험검체가 반드시 두개 이상의 조각으로 구성되어야 하는 경우에는 각각의 조각이 
서로 닿지 않도록 하여야 한다.
6.3 침지 시험과정
시험을 시작하는 시점에서 시험검체가 담겨 있는 전해질의 pH를 측정한다. 증발되는 것을 막
기 위하여 시험 전지를 단단하게 밀봉하고, (7 ± 0.1)일 동안 (37 ± 1) ℃의 온도로 유지한
다. 검체를 제거한 후 남아 있는 전해질의 pH를 측정한다.
7 분석
저배율 현미경 (>50 × )으로 시험검체의 상태를 관찰하고, 기록한다. 표면의 중요한 변화를 
기록한다. 해당되는 경우, 표면에 대한 보다 자세한 분석을 실시하여야 한다.

3 독성동태 시험의 설계 원리


- 420 -
3.1 독성동태 시험은 사례별로 설계하여야 한다.
3.2 시험 방법은 시험을 시작하기 전에 작성하여야 한다. 이러한 방법에는 시험방법을 포함하여 
시험 설계가 명확하게 제시되어야 한다. 명확하게 제시하여야 하는 세부적인 부분은 제3.3항
에서 제3.8항, 그리고 제4항에 제시되어 있다. 
3.3 독성동태 시험에 사용할 방법을 결정하기 위하여 용출시험(leaching studies)의 결과를 고
려하여야 한다. 화학적 특성과 물리화학적 특성, 원자재의 표면 형태와 용출물의 생화학적 특성
에 대한 정보도 또한 고려하여야 한다.
주) 용출물의 방출 정도와 속도는 표면에서의 농도, 원자재 내에서 표면까지의 이동, 생리학적 
환경에서의 용해도와 유속에 좌우된다.
3.4 잠재적인 독성이 있는 분해 산물이나 특성이 규명된 용출물(leachable)로 독성동태 시
험을 시행할 것을 권고한다. 그러나 혼합물에 대한 독성동태 시험은 특정한 조건 하에서 실행 
가능하다. 용출액(extract liquid)이나 의료기기나 원자재를 분쇄하거나 가루로 만든 형태는 예
외적인 환경에서 사용할 수 있으며, 시험 설계 시에 타당성을 입증하여야 한다.
3.5 분석 방법은 생물학적 체액과 조직에서 대사 물질과 용출물(leachable) 그리고 분해 산물을 
검출하고, 이들의 특성을 규명할 수 있는 것이어야 한다. 이를 위해서 관련된 본 규격(의료기
기 생물학적 안전에 관한 공통기준 규격) 또는 ISO 10993의 다른 장을 참고하여야 한다. 이
는 시험보고서에 모두 기록하여야 한다(4.1.11 참조). 정량적 분석 방법은 세부적이고, 민감하
며 재현할 수 있는 것이어야 하며, 분석 물질의 예측 농도 범위 이상으로 선형성을 나타내는 자
료를 산출하여야 한다. 분석 방법의 타당성을 보고서에 제시하여야 한다.  
3.6 시험 설계는 측정할 분석 물질 수준에서 생리학적 체액, 조직 또는 배출물을 명확하게 제
시하여야 한다.
주) 혈액은 채취하기에 편리하기 때문에 종종 흡수 시험과 동역학적 매개 변수에 대한 체액으
로 선정된다. 전혈, 혈청 또는 혈장 중 어느 것을 분석할 것인지를 제시하고, 이러한 선정의 
타당성을 입증하여야 한다. 순환 단백질이나 적혈구의 결합은 체외에서 측정할 수 있다.
3.7 시험보고서에는 검체에서의 분석대상물질의 결합에 대한 정보(예들 들어, 양과 친화도)가 포
함되어야 하며, 분석대상물질의 농도가 과소평가되지 않았음을 입증하여야 한다.
3.8 동역학적 매개 변수를 측정할 수 있도록 적절한 간격을 가지는 충분한 자료점이 있어야 
한다. 이론적으로 여기에는 몇몇의 말기 반감기가 포함되어야 한다. 실제로 분석 방법의 제약으
로 인하여 절충을 해야 할 수도 있다.
4 시험방법에 관한 지침
4.1 일반적 고려사항


- 421 -
4.1.1 적합한 성별과 종으로 시험을 실시하여야 한다. 건강하고 젊은 동물 성체를 최소한 7 일 
동안 시험 조건에 순응시켜야 한다. 개별대사우리를 사용하는 경우에는 각각의 동물을 개별 대
사 우리로 옮긴 후 최소 24시간동안 순응시켜야 한다. 환경조건은 동물의 사용과 관리에 제시된 
지침(제2장 실험동물관리)을 준수하도록 한다. 
별도의 규정이 없는 한 시험기간 동안 일반 실험동물용 동물사료와 식수를 자유롭게 주도록 
한다. 실험동물은 각각의 시험기간 별로 무작위 군 분리 하여야 한다. 소동물의 경우 최소한 
군당 3마리를 이용하여야 하며, 대동물의 경우 최소한 군당 2마리를 이용하여야 한다. 명시된 
적절한 시점에 동물을 안락사 시켜야 한다.
4.1.2 관련 검체 안의 시험물질에 적합한 것으로 입증된 평가 과정이 존재하고, 시험물질의 대
사 특성이 잘 규명되어 있는 경우에는 비 방사능 표지 시험물질이 유용할 수 있다.
4.1.3 필요한 경우 시험물질은 대사적으로 안정한 위치에서 가급적이면 14C나 또는 3H 그
리고 적정한 방사 화학적 순도 (>97 %)로 방사능 표지를 하여야 한다. 3H를 이용하는 경우
에는 삼중수소 교환(tritium exchange) 의 가능성을 고려하여야 한다. 해당되는 경우에는 방
사능으로 표지된 화합물을 비 방사능 표지 물질로 희석하여야 한다.
4.1.4 방사능으로 표지된 화합물을 이용하는 경우에는 시험물질의 특정한 활동이나 방사 화
학적 순도를 미리 알고 있어야 한다.
4.1.5 시험물질은 적합한 경로를 통해 투여하여야 한다. 이러한 경로는 의료기기의 사용목적에 
적합한 것이어야 한다. 시험물질(용출물 혹은 분해 산물)의 물리 화학적 특성을 고려하여 적합
한 용매를 사용하여 준비하여야 하며, 시험에 적절한 투여경로 및 용량을 적용하여야 한다. 제
안된 투여조건에서의 검체의 안정성에 대한 정보가 확보되어야 하며 이를 보고서에 기술하여
야 한다.
주) 시험 설계에는 흡수율의 비교를 위하여 다른 경로(들)의 포함을 요구할 수 있다. 
4.1.6 투여량 평형 시험의 경우 시험동물은 대사 우리(metabolism cages)에서만 사육하여야 
한다.
4.1.7 사후 방출 미생물이나 자발적인 변성을 예방하기 위하여 소변과 배설물은 온도가 낮은 
용기(또는 분석을 방해하지 않도록 보존제가 담겨 있는 용기)에 채집하여야 한다. 전혈이나 혈
장을 분석하는 경우에는 적합한 항응고제를 이용하여 채혈하여야 한다.
4.1.8 가능하다면 어느 곳에서든 투여하기 전에 대조 표준을 채집하여야 한다. 일부 시험에서
는 시험동물에서 대조 표준(예들 들어, 조직)을 채집하는 것이 불가능하며, 이들은 대조군에서 
얻어야 한다.
4.1.9 채집 시간은 수행하려는 시험의 유형에 적합하여야 하며, 필요하다면, 분, 시간, 하루, 
주 또는 달의 기간으로 실행할 수 있다. 배설물과 관련된 시험의 경우에는 일반적으로 최소한 


- 422 -
96 시간 동안 24 시간을 주기로 한다. 혈액 검체가 필요한 경우에는 최대 72시간 동안 수 분에
서 수 시간까지의 제시된 스케쥴 예정 범위에 따라 혈액을 채혈한다.
4.1.10 적합한 우수 실험실 기준(good laboratory practice)에 따라 독성동태 시험을 실시하
여야 한다. 
4.1.11 시험보고서에는 다음의 관련 정보들이 포함되어야 한다.
1) 실험동물의 계통, 공급처, 연령, 성별, 사육환경조건, 사료
2) 시험물질과 검체, 순도, 안정성, 형태(formulation), 투여한 양
3) 투여 경로를 포함한 시험 조건
4) 분석 방법, 용출법, 검출법, 검증
5) 원자재의 전반적인 회수율
6) 매 시점마다 결과에 대한 도표 작성
7) 품질 기준이나 우수 실험실 기준 이행 상태
8) 결과에 대한 검토
9) 결과의 해석
4.2 특정한 유형의 시험에 대한 지침
4.2.1 개요 
4.2.1.1 위험평가에 필요한 정보를 얻기 위하여 시험을 설계하여야 하며, 이에 따라 일반적으로 
모든 측면을 시험할 필요는 없다.  
4.2.1.2 흡수, 분포, 대사, 배설 시험은 하나의 시험으로 몇몇의 측면을 총체적으로 시험하거나 
이들 측면 가운에 하나를 개별적으로 시험할 수 있다.
4.2.1.3 시험의 설계에 따라 흡수율, 혈장농도 대 시간 곡선 하의 면적(area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve), 1차 모멘트 혈장 농도 대 시간곡선 하의 면적
(area under the first moment plasma concentration versus time curve) 분포량, cmax, 
tmax, 반감기, 평균 체류 시간, 배설율 및 제거율을 포함한 여러 가지 동역학적 매개변수를 결
정할 수 있다.   
4.2.1.4  동역학적 매개변수는 특정한 분자들에 대해서만 결정할 수 있으므로, 평가 방법은 이
러한 분자들에 민감하고 특정한 것이어야 한다. 관련 화합물의 정확한 동역학적 매개변수는 
정맥내 투여를 한 후에만 결정할 수 있다. 따라서 동역학적 매개변수 시험의 설계에 제한된 
정맥내 투여 시험을 포함해야 할 수도 있다. 이는 소량의 흡수된 투여량을 계산할 수 있도록 
해주며, 다른 시험에서 추정된 매개변수를 수정하는데 이용한다. 
4.2.1.5 적합한 동역학적 모델을 이용하여 동역학적 매개변수를 결정하여야 한다. 동역학적 매
개변수를 추정할 수 있는 컴퓨터 프로그램은 다양하다. 사용하기 전에 소프트웨어의 타당성을 


- 423 -
입증하여야 하며, 이러한 입증 사항을 문서로 기록하여야 한다. 모델링에서 프로그램에 도입된 
가설과 선택사항들을 문서화하여야 한다.
4.2.2 흡수
흡수는 시험물질의 물리 화학적 형태와 용액(vehicle) 그리고 투여 경로에 따라 좌우된다. 
이는 혈액, 혈청, 배설물 그리고 조직의 농도를 통하여 추정할 수 있다. 완전한 생체 이용율 
시험을 고려하여야 한다. 기타 필요한 정보와 방사능 표지 물질의 이용 가능성 그리고 평가 
방법에 따라 적합한 유형의 시험을 선정한다. 흡수상(absorption phase)에서 충분한 검체를 
채집할 수 있는 경우에만 동역학적 매개변수 시험에서 확실한 흡수율 상수를 산정할 수 있다.
주) 체외 방법이 화학 물질의 피부 흡수와 위장 흡수에 대한 중요한 정보를 제공해 줄 수 
있다.
4.2.3 분포
4.2.3.1 일반적으로 분포 시험에는 방사능으로 표지된 화합물이 필요하다. 시험은
- 해부된 조직에서 측정된 수준을 정량하며,
- 전혈 자기 방사법(WBA; whole-body autoradiography)을 이용하여 정성 분석하고,
- WBA(whole-body autoradiography) 표준 등급을 이용하여 준정량 할 수 있다.
4.2.3.2 일반적으로 분포 시험에서 검체를 추출하는 시간은 시험물질의 배설에 따라 tmax,, 24 
시간, 168 시간 또는 그 이상의 긴 시간 동안이어야 한다. 추가적인 자료가 필요한 경우에는 중
간 시간을 이용할 수 있다. 대체적으로 검체는 초기의 흡수상(phase of absorption)과 배설상
(phase of elimination)에서 자주 추출한다. 그러나 동역학적 매개변수를 최상으로 추정할 수 
있기 때문에 (이론상으로 반감기 3에서 4) 배설상(elimination phase)에서 더 많이 추출해야만 
한다. 주요한 결정요소는 분석감도이다.
4.2.4 대사와 배설
4.2.4.1 대사 우리(metabolism cages)는 시험 기간 내내 소변과 배설물을 따로 채집할 수 있는 
것이어야 한다. 최대 14일 까지 시험을 하는 경우에는 시험의 마지막까지 매 24 시간마다 소
변과 배설물을 따로따로 채집하여야 한다. 일부 시험 설계에서는 그 사이에 동물이 희생될 수
도 있다. 시험물질이나 시험물질의 대사 물질이 급속하게 배설될 것 같은 경우에는 24 시간 
전에 검체를 채집할 수 있다. 보다 장기간 동안 시험하는 경우에는 단기 시험에서와 마찬가지
로 최초의 기간에 검체를 추출하여야 한다. 그 이후에는 평가 기간 당 24 시간을 주기로 지
속적으로 검체를 추출하여야 한다.
주) 장기간(prolonged periods) 동안 대사 우리(metabolism cages)를 사용하는 것은 동물 
복지에 해로울 수 있다. 장기간 시험의 경우, 불연속 적으로 검체를 채취할 수 있으며, 이
러한 결과를 연속적인 검체 수집으로 외삽 할 수 있다.


- 424 -
4.2.4.2 동물의 시체 및/또는 개별 동물의 표적 기관은 분석을 위하여 보관하여야 하며, 혈
장 및 전혈에서의 농도를 분석하기 위하여 혈액을 채혈 하여야 한다. 희생되어야 하는 시간에 
대사 우리에서 검체를 채집한 후에는, 우리(cage)와 올가미를 적합한 용액으로 세척하여야 한
다. 발생되는 세척물을 함께 모아서 부분 대표성분으로 분석을 위하여 보존할 수 있다.
4.2.4.3 방사능 표지 화합물을 사용하는 경우 [아래의 주) 참조]에 시험물질의 회수율 또는 예
측된 회수율은 이론적으로 (100 ± 10) %가 되어야 한다. 각 부분에 있는 시험물질의 양은 적
절한 환경에서 방사능으로 표지된 화합물과 방사능으로 표지되지 않은 화합물에 대하여 적합
한 것으로 입증된 과정에 따라 분석하여야 한다. 방사능으로 표지된 화합물을 사용하는 경우
에는 특정한 평가 방법을 사용하지 않는 한, 모 성분(parent compound)과 대사산물을 모두 
평가하는 것이 바람직하다. 방사능으로 표지된 화합물을 배설물(대변 및/또는 소변)이나 인체에서 
충분하게 회수할 수 없는 경우에는 배설되는 공기의 채취를 고려하여야 한다. 
주) 명시된 회수 범위를 모든 경우에 달성할 수 있는 것은 아니며, 보고서에 차이가 나는 이유
를 설명하고, 검토하여야 한다.
4.2.4.4 생물학적 환경에서의 방사능 수준은 예를 들어, 액체섬광계수법으로 측정하여야 한다. 
그러나 이것이 화합물과 대사 물질의 혼합 농도를 나타내고, 그것으로부터 어떤 동역학적 매
개 변수도 유도해 낼 수 없음에 유의하여야 한다. 대사 물질의 분리를 반드시 고려하여야 하
는 경우에는 다수의 용출 과정과 크로마토그래피 과정(예들 들면, 고성능액체 크로마토그래피, 
박층 크로마토그래피, 가스-액체 크로마토그래피와 같은)이 포함되기도 하며, 원자재 결과물의 
특성을 화학적인 방법과 물리화학적 기법(예들 들면, 질량 분광법, 핵자기 공명 분광법)으로 
규명하여야 한다.
조직, 세포, 균질 현탁액 그리고 분리된 효소를 체외 대사 시험에 사용하는 경우에는 이를 문서
화하여야 한다. 이들 방법은 화합물을 적합한 부위에 이용할 수 없는 경우 체내에서 일어나지 
않을 수도 있는 잠재적인 대사를 규명해준다. 체내와 비교된 체외 대사의 속도와 정도에는 종
종 차이가 있다.

부록 A
(규정)
독성동태 시험 시 고려하여야 하는 환경
A.1 사용되는 대부분의 의료기기에는 잠재적인 위해 요소가 존재한다. 화학적 특성평가(chemical 
characterization)는 화학적 위험 요소(잠재적 위험)를 규명하며(제17장, ISO 10993-18과 ISO 
14971 참조), 이는 독성동태 시험에 앞서 고려되어야 한다. 하지만 화학적 특성평가에서 확인된 
모든 확인 가능한 의도되거나 의도되지 않은 용출물 그리고 분해 산물에 대한 독성동태 시험이 
필요하거나 가능한 것은 아니며, 이는 모든 의료기기에 대해서 마찬가지다. 
A.2 의료기기의 생물학적 평가 방법의 일부분으로써 독성동태 시험의 필요성은 의료기기의 사용
목적과 함께 최종산물과 이의 구성 화학물질 그리고 의도되거나 의도되지 않은 용출물과 분해 산
물을 참작하여 고려되어야 한다.  
활성 성분과 용출물 및/또는 분해 산물 간에 있을 수 있는 독성동태 상호작용도 고려해야 한다. 
A.3 적절하게 검증되고, 합리적이며 실질적으로 이용 가능하며, 신뢰성 및 재현이 확보 된 체외 
방법의 적용이 체내 시험보다 우선적으로 고려되어야 한다(제1장, ISO 10993-1). 적절한 시험방
법이 있는 경우 체외 시험법(예: 조직, 균등질 또는 세포)은 가능성보다는 개연성 있는 분해 산물
의 연구에 적용되어야 한다. 제2장(ISO 10993-2)은 고려해야 하는 모든 체내 시험에 적용된다.  
A.4 다음과 같은 경우에는 독성동태 시험을 고려하여야 한다.
1) 의료기기가 생체 흡수 되도록 설계되어있는 경우
2) 의료기기가 영구 접촉 이식물이며, 생분해 또는 상당히 부식되는 것(금속원자재)으로 알려져 있
거나 또는 그럴 가능성이 있는 경우 및/또는 의료기기에서 용출물의 이동이 발생하는 경우
3) 잠재적 독성 또는 반응성 분해 산물과 용출물의 상당한 양이 임상적으로 사용하는 동안 의료
기기에서 인체로 방출될 수 있거나 방출되는 것으로 알려져 있는 경우나 그럴 가능성이 있는 
경우
4) 활성 성분의 상당한 양이 의료기기에서 방출되는 것으로 알려져 있는 경우나 그럴 가능성이 
있는 경우
주) ‘상당한 양’이라는 의미는 조사대상 화학 물질의 특성에 좌우된다.
A.5 다음과 같은 경우에는 독성동태 시험을 실시하지 않는다.
1) 분해 산물과 용출물(leachable)에 관련된 충분한 독성동태 자료나 독성 자료가 이미 존재하는 
경우

3 허용 한도의 확립에 관한 일반 원리
3.1 의료기기에서 용출 가능한 것으로 확인된 물질에 대한 허용 한도를 확립하는 과정에는 다
음과 같은 과정이 포함된다.
1) 다음을 통하여 용해물(leachable substance)과 관련 있는 생물학적 위험을 평가(4항 참조)
 - 자료 수집과 중요 건강상 종점(critical health endpoints)의 확인
 - 노출 기간과 주입 경로에 따라 특정한 허용 흡입량(TI) 결정
 - 자극성이 적합한 종점인 경우 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)의 결정
2) 다음을 통하여 용해물(leachable substance)에 대한 환자의 허용 노출량 결정(5항 참조)
 - 적절한 환자 체중(mB) 측정
 - 의료기기 활용 인자(UTF)를 바탕으로 하는 체중과 허용 흡입의 산출량을 수정
3) 해당되는 경우, 유익성을 적용하고, 실행가능성을 결정. 실행가능성 평가에서 허용 노출량
(TE)이 기술적으로도 타당하고, 경제적으로도 타당하다고 결정된 경우에는 허용 노출량(TE)이 
허용 한도가 된다. 허용 노출량(TE)이 경제적으로나 기술적으로 타당하지 않은 경우(6항 참조)
에는 허용 한도를 확립하기 위하여 유익성 평가를 바탕으로 하는 허용 노출량(TE)을 사례별 
근거를 통해 더 수정하여야 한다.(7항 참조)


- 432 -
3.2 이용 가능한 과학적 자료를 근거로 정보에 입각한 결정을 내릴 수 있는 경험과 지식이 풍
부한 사람이 전문적인 판단을 통하여 본 장의 요건을 실행하여야 한다. 여기에는 결정된 허
용 한도의 타당성과 의료기기의 유익성 그리고 사용에 대한 정보와 더불어 의료기기의 독성학
적 위험 평가와 독성학적 자료를 해석해 본 경험이 필요하다.
3.3 의료기기의 안전성은 허용될 수 없는 건강상의 위험이 없어야 하는 것을 말한다. 특정한 
용해물(leachable substance)에 내포되어 있는 건강상 위험에 대한 분석은 의료기기를 임상적
으로 사용하는 동안 위해한 용해물(leachable substance)이 인체에 방출되어 손상을 주는 것을 
적절한 정도로 막을 수 있는 노출 한도를 확립할 수 있게 해준다. 어떠한 상황에서도 적합한 
것으로 간주되는 보호의 정도는 의료기기의 사용에서 유래되는 유익성의 중요도와 실질적인 위
험 감소 그리고 확인된 위해 요소의 특성과 같은 다수의 인자들에 의해 좌우된다. 따라서 건강
상 위험의 허용정도에 관한 평가에서는 몇몇의 복합적인 인자들을 조사하고 비교 평가하여야 
한다. 위험 평가의 신뢰도는 평가된 자료의 양 및 질과 상관관계를 가진다.
3.4 가장 광범위하게 의료기기에서 용출될 수 있는 물질은 피부 흡수에서부터 음식물 섭취, 흡
입, 직접 전신 투여에 이르기까지 서로 다른 경로를 통하여 인체에 유입될 수 있다. 이외에도 
의료기기는 사용 기간에 따라 세 가지 범주 가운데 하나로 분류될 수 있다. 차례로 각각의 사
용량 범위는 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 설명되어 있는 바와 같이 복합적인 노출 경로에 따라 한
도가 다양할 수 있다. 그러므로 특정한 용해물(leachable substance)에 대한 전반적인 허용 한
도는 단기 한도(short-term limit), 장기 한도(prolonged limit) 그리고 수명 한도(lifetime 
limit)의 세 가지가 있을 수 있다. 다양한 노출 경로로부터 각각의 한도 내로 보호 받아야 한다. 
이를 달성하기 위하여 각각의 적합한 사용 범주 내에서 각각의 노출 경로에 대한 허용 흡입량
(TI)을 개별적으로 계산한다. 일정한 사용량 범위에 대하여 각각의 특정 경로의 허용 흡입량(TI)
은 다양할 수 있다. 용해물(leachable substance)의 독성학적 영향을 가장 잘 나타내기 위하여 
흡입 경로나 사용량 범위에 대한 가장 낮은 허용 흡입량(TI)값의 사용을 허용하기 위해 많은 
경우 독성학적 자료는 충분히 일관성을 가질 수 있다.
3.5 허용 한도를 확립하는 첫 번째 단계는 건강에 위해한 요소를 내포하고 있을 수 있는 물질
을 확인하는 것이다. 위해 요소가 있는 물질을 선정한 후에는 허용 흡입량의 확립과 더불어 
허용 한도를 확립하는 과정을 시작한다.
주) 잠재적인 위해 요소 잔류물을 확인하기 위하여 ISO 14971과 같은 국제 표준이나 기타 위
해 요소 확인 체계를 이용할 수 있다.
4 특정한 용해물(leachable substances)의 허용 흡입량(TI) 확립
4.1 개요
독성학적 자료의 검토는 ‘관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)’을 확립하는데 필요한 정보를 제
공해준다. 변경 인자 접근법은 적합한 허용 흡입량을 확립할 수 있도록 비종양성 종점에 대한 
자료에 이용한다. 변경 인자 접근법이나 정량적 접근법은 종양 자료에서 허용 흡입량을 결정하


- 433 -
는데 이용할 수 있다.(4.5 참조) 변경 인자는 위험 평가에 있어서 고유한 불확정성, 확인된 위
해 요소의 심각성 그리고 평가된 자료의 유형/질/양을 고려하여야 하며, 기타 고려 사항들 가운
데에서 적합하다고 간주되는 안전성 보증의 수준을 고려하여야 한다.
확인된 위해요소는 나타난 독성효과의 유형과 다양한 노출경로에서의 투여량의 측면에서 물질
의 독성을 평가함으로써, 그 특성을 규명하여야 한다.
4.2 허용흡입량(TI)을 계산하기 위한 노출량의 고려
4.2.1 사용되는 자료
다음의 자료는 4항에서 허용흡입량(TI)을 계산하는 요소로 그리고 이후에 8항에서 허용 한도
를 계산하기 위한 활용 인자와 적합한 체중을 측정하는 요소로 사용한다.
a) 용해물(leachable substance)에 대한 환자의 노출 기간(4.2.2 참조)
b) 용해물(leachable substance)에 대한 일반적인 환자의 노출 경로(4.2.3 참조)
4.2.2 노출 기간의 고려
특정 의료기기의 노출 기간은 제1장(ISO 10993-1)을 참고하고 적합한 자료를 분석하여 분류
한다.
본 장에 따라 관리되는 용해물(leachable substance)의 경우(예를 들면, 에틸렌 옥사이드 멸균 
잔류물), 영구접촉/지속노출/제한노출에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)이 필요할 수 있다. 비특정 의료기
기를 염두에 두고 용해물(leachable substance)에 대하여 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하거나 모든 
의료기기에 해당하는 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하는 경우, 잔류물의 생물학적 영향을 바탕으로 필
요한 경우, 제한노출과 지속노출에 대한 강제제약(binding constraint)으로써의 편위(excursion)
로 영구접촉 허용흡입량(TI)을 계산한다. 특정한 기간 범주로 분류된 의료기기의 종류에 대하여 허
용흡입량(TI)을 확립하거나 의료기기에 존재하는 용해물(leachable substance)에 대하여 허용
흡입량(TI)을 확립하는 경우에는 용해물(leachable substance)의 생물학적 영향을 바탕으로 필
요한 만큼 더 짧은 기간의 편위(excursions)로 분류하여 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립한다.
예들 들어, 영구접촉 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하는데 이용할 수 있는 만성 자료가 존재하지 않는 
경우와 같이 특정 범주의 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하는데 이용할 수 있는 자료가 존재하지 않는 
경우에는 단기 시험 자료를 더 큰 변경 인자와 함께 사용할 수 있다.
만일 의료기기가 하나 이상의 범주에 속해 있다면, 허용흡입량(TI)은 보다 엄격한 범주를 근거
로 하여야 한다.
4.2.3 노출 경로의 고려
비특정 경로를 염두에 두고 용출 물질에 대하여 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하거나 복합적인 경로를 


- 434 -
포함하여 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하는 경우에는, 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 따라 가능한 정도까지 
주어진 노출 기간 범주 내에서 각각의 잠재적인 노출 경로에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)을 계산한
다. 주어진 노출 기간 범주 내에서 다양한 노출 경로에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)이 10의 인자 내에 
있는 경우, 가장 낮은 허용흡입량(TI)을 전체 노출기간 범주에 대한 모든 노출 경로의 허용흡
입량(TI)으로 사용할 수 있다. 그러나 허용흡입량(TI)이 10 배 이상으로 바뀌는 경우, 노출 기
간 범주에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)이 하나 이상이 되어야 한다.
의료기기 부류나 특정 의료기기의 용해물(leachable substances)에 대하여 허용흡입량(TI)을 
확립하는 경우에는 각각의 적합한 노출 경로 범주와 관련된 의료기기의 투여 경로에 대해서만 허
용흡입량(TI)을 계산한다.
특정 경로에 대하여 이용할 수 있는 자료가 없는 경우, 자료가 있는 다른 경로의 허용흡입량
(TI)을 자료가 없는 경로에 사용할 수 있다. 불확정 인자 3(UF3)의 요소로 설명되는 불확정
성을 부가하여 그러한 정량적 경로 대 경로를 외삽하도록 한다.
4.3 자료의 수집과 평가
평가를 위해 용해물(leachable substances)을 선정하면 이용 가능한 관련 자료를 수집하여야 
한다. 이러한 자료에는 다음과 같은 것들이 포함된다.
1) 화학적 특성과 물리적 특성
2) 존재(occurrence)와 이용
3) 약리학
4) 독성동태(흡수, 분포, 대사 그리고 배출)
5) 독성학
6) 사람에게 미치는 영향
한도를 설정하는데 이용하는 자료는 질이 우수하고, 타당한 것이어야 한다. 사용 가능한 모든 
정보는 물질에 대한 전반적인 독성 수준의 이해라는 맥락에서 고려하여야 한다. 기본적인 접근
법은 제한노출이나 단기노출의 한도를 설정하기 위하여 급성자료(예들 들면, 14 일이나 그 이
하의 기간 동안의 시험에서 얻은 자료)를 사용하여야 한다는 전제를 바탕으로 한다. 아만성 
영향 자료(예들 들면, 1 개월에서 3 개월의 시험에서 얻은 자료)는 지속노출 한도에 관한 근
거가 되어야 하며, 수명 영구 노출 한도를 설정하기 위해서는 단기자료나 아만성자료 보다는 
만성자료나 수명자료(lifetime data) (예들 들어, 6 개월 또는 이보다 장기간의 시험에서 얻은 
자료)를 이용하는 것이 좋다. 장기자료는 단기한도를 설정하는데 유용할 수 있다. 이용 가능한 
경우에는 동물 자료 보다는 사람에 대한 자료를 이용하는 것이 좋다.
임상적 부작용을 확인하고, 이들 영향에 대한 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAELs)를 확립하
기 위하여 자료를 평가하여야 한다. 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)을 결정하기 위한 
자료가 불충분한 경우, 만일 추가적으로 삽입된 불확정성이 적절하게 조정된다면, 최소한으로 
관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL) 또는 다른 값을 다음의 계산에 이용할 수 있다. 노출의 형태와 시
험 모델에서 독성 영향이 발생할 가능성과 관련이 있을 수 있으므로, 가능하다면, 관찰되지 않


- 435 -
는 부작용 수준(NOAEL)을 결정하는데 도움이 되도록 투여 반응 관계를 조사하여야 한다. 해당
되는 경우, 예들 들어, 구강, 피부 또는 조직 접촉, 비경구성 그리고 흡입과 같은 복합적 노출 
경로에 대한 자료를 평가하여야 한다. 하나의 흡입 경로로만 노출될 가능성이 있는 경우, 비록 
다른 경로에 대한 자료라고 할지라도 가장 관련성이 높은 경로에 대한 적절한 자료를 고려하
여야 한다.
사람에게 노출하려는 경로를 고려하여 부작용을 일으키는 투여량뿐만 아니라 한도를 설정하기 위
한 근거로 가장 적합하다고 간주되는 부작용을 입증하여야 한다. 건강 기반 허용 한도를 계산
하는데 사용하기 위하여 가장 적합한 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 또는 특히 최소한
으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL) 또는 다른 값을 선정하여야 한다. 선정된 값은 전문적인 
판단을 근거로 하는 모든 부작용에 대한 평가를 반영한 것이어야 한다. 독성 영향의 적용성과 임
계성. 시험 노출의 경로, 시험 자료의 신뢰도와 이종간에 차이가 있는 것으로 알려진 감수성, 노출
된 경로, 사람에 대한 노출 기간 그리고 적합한 기타 인자들을 고려하여 관찰된 독성 영향에 대
한 가장 높은 관찰되지 않는 부작용 수준(NOAEL) 또는 최소의 부작용 수준을 근거로 작성하여야 
한다. 투여 수준을 선정하기 위한 이론적 근거를 문서로 제출하여야 한다.
4.4 비종양성 종점에 대한 허용흡입량(TI) 설정
4.4.1 개요
각각의 적합한 예상 경로와 노출 기간에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)은 NOAEL, LOAEL 또는 기타 측
정된 값을 이용하여 계산하여야 한다. 각각의 허용흡입량(TI)을 계산할 때는 위험분석에 고
유한 불확정성과 확인된 위해 요소의 심각성 정도를 고려하여야 한다.
가능하다면 언제든지 변경 인자 접근법(modifying factor approach)을 이용하여야 계산하여야 
한다. 이러한 접근법은 가장 중요한 부작용의 안전성 허용 최저한도를 제시하기 위하여 전문적
인 판단을 근거로 결정된 불확정 인자를 사용하는 것과 결부되어 있다.
변경 인자 접근법을 이용하여 하루당 체중 킬로그램으로 표시되는 허용흡입량(TI) 값을 계산하
기 위한 공식은 아래의 방정식(1)에 제시되어 있다.

변경 인자는 UF1, UF2, 그리고 UF3 이다(불확정 인자 UF1, UF2, 그리고 UF3를 설명하고 있는 
4.4.2 참조).
예상되는 사용자군의 가장 광범위한 부분에서 사용하는 것을 바탕으로 한도를 확립하여야 한
다. 예들 들어, 사용자들이 대부분 건강한 성인 남성인 경우에는 성인 남성에 대한 노출을 근
거로 계산하여야 한다. 임신한 여성이나 또는 신생아와 같이 특정한 집단이 이용하는 의료기
기인 경우에는 그러한 집단을 근거로 계산하여야 한다. 이를 계산하기 위하여 사용하여야 하는 
호흡율, 체중 등등에 대한 대표적인 가설은 부록 A에 수록되어 있다.

4.4.2 불확정 인자의 결정
4.4.2.1 개요
불확정 인자의 계산에는 다수의 다양한 고려 사항들이 포함된다. 이들 인자는 대리종 또는 사
람군에서 얻어진 결과를 통하여 화학 물질이 사람에게 미칠 수 있는 영향을 추정하는데 내재
해 있는 불확정성을 고려한다. 이러한 고려 사항은 위해 분석에서 정량화가 어렵다. 사람 자료에 
사용하는 불확정 인자는 동물 자료에 사용하는 것보다 작다. 불확정 인자는 영구노출에 대한 
허용흡입량(TI)을 결정하기 위하여 만성자료를 사용할 때가 아만성 자료를 사용할 때보다 더 
작다. 또한 최소한으로 관찰된 부작용 수준(LOAEL)을 이용할 때보다는 관찰되지 않는 부작용 
수준(NOAELs)을 이용하는 경우에 불확정 인자는 더 작다. 각각의 불확정 인자가 미치는 영향
의 정도나 수치를 선정된 인자에 대한 타당성과 함께 문서로 제출하여야 한다. 적합한 불확정 
인자의 선정 시 고려하여야 하는 일부 사항들에는 사람 간의 차이와 종 외삽법 그리고 아래에 
설명된 바와 같은 기타 불확정성이 포함된다.
4.4.2.2 불확정 인자 1(UF1)
UF1는 사람 사이의 개인적 차이를 설명해 준다. 허용흡입량(TI) 값을 유추하고자 하는 경우에
는 UF1를 고려하여야 한다. 사람간의 차이를 평가하는 경우에는 언제나 실제 자료를 이용하는 
것이 바람직하다. 독성 시약에 대한 사람의 반응에서 나타나는 개인적 차이의 특성을 규명하기 
위한 시험 자료가 없어 동물에게서 보고된 영향을 근거로 안전성을 평가했던 경우에는 역사적
으로 사람 간의 변이성을 완전히 분류하기 위하여 불확정 인자 내정 값(default) 10을 이용해 
왔다. 그 결과 노출된 환자군에서 부작용을 시험했던 경우에는 심지어 1정도의 현저하게 감소
된 불확정 인자도 적합할 수 있다.
사람 사이의 차이가 최소한이라고 판단된 경우에는 불확정 인자 1에 가까운 값을 선정하여야 한
다. 사람 사이의 차이가 현저한 것으로 판단되는 경우에는 불확정 인자 10에 가까운 값을 선정
하여야 한다. 사람 사이의 차이가 중간 정도인 것으로 판단되는 경우에는 중간 정도의 불확정 
인자를 이용하여야 한다. 특이과다감수증(Idiosyncratic hypersusceptibility)은 일반적으로 허
용흡입량(TI) 값에 대한 근거로 이용하지 않는다. 결과적으로 사람 간의 개인적인 차이에 대한 
불확정 인자는 예외적으로 민감한 부분 모집단을 고려할 필요가 없을 것이다. 불확정 인자의 
크기와 타당성을 확립함에 있어 인체 내에서 원자재를 취급하는 방법 또한 고려하여야 한다.
4.4.2.3 불확정 인자 2(UF2)
UF2는 사람 외의 다른 종에서 유추한 자료에서 외삽한 것을 설명해 준다. UF2는 다른 종과 사
람 사이에 고유한 차이를 고려하여야 한다. 사람과 시험 종 사이의 관계에 대한 세부적인 정보
와 자료를 이용하는 것이 바람직하다.
독성의 이종간 차이에 대한 세부적인 정보가 없는 경우에는 안전성 인자에 10배를 곱하는 것이 
적합할 것이다. 물질의 독성동력학과 독성이 잘 알려져 있고, 사람과 시험 모델이 유사한 경
우에는 이러한 차이에 보다 작은 불확정 인자를 이용하여야 한다. 이와 마찬가지로 독성학적으로 


- 437 -
중요한 차이인 것으로 판단되는 경우에는 보다 큰 불확정 인자를 이용하여야 한다. 불확정 인자
의 크기와 타당성을 확립함에 있어 인체 내에서 원자재를 취급하는 방법 또한 고려하여야 한다.
4.4.2.4 불확정 인자 3(UF3)
1과 100 사이의 불확정 인자인 UF3는 시험 자료의 품질과 타당성을 설명해 준다. 자료의 품
질이 우수하고, 타당한 경우에는 인자 1을 이용하여야 한다. 인자(UF3)는 시험의 설계와 자료
의 품질을 고려한 전문적인 판단을 근거로 하여야 한다.
이러한 사항은 다음의 상황과 같은 불확정성을 위하여 고려되어야 한다. 그러나 이것으로만 한
정되지는 않는다.
1) 장기 노출 또는 영향에 외삽하기 위하여 이용된 단기 시험
2) NOAEL 자료 대신에 LOAEL 자료만 있는 경우
3) 입증 시험이 없는 경우
4) 종점을 평가하기에 부적합한 동물 모델의 이용
5) 부적절한 노출 경로
6) 노출 비율
7) 자료 근거의 신뢰성
허용흡입량(TIs)을 확립하는 경우에는 또한 건강상 위해 요소의 심각성을 고려하여 적합하다
고 간주된 안전성의 보증 정도도 역시 고려하여야 한다. 건강상 위해 요소가 사망과 같은 것일 
경우, 매우 심각한 손상이나 표적 기관에 미치는 돌이킬 수 없는 영향은 예측된 결과이거나 종
점으로 사용되고, 이런 경우 증가된 허용치를 고려하여야 한다. 이와 유사하게, 종점이 독성학적으
로 그다지 중요하지 않은 경우에는 감소된 허용치를 고려하여야 한다. 불확정 인자의 크기와 타당
성을 확립함에 있어 인체 내에서 원자재를 취급하는 방법 또한 고려하여야 한다.
이용할 수 있는 관련 자료의 품질과 양이 제한되어 있는 경우, 인자 100과 같거나 100에 가까운 
인자를 선정하여야 한다. 허용흡입량(TI)에 대한 근거로 사용하는 시험이 적합하게 실행되고 사
용하려는 목적에 따라 잘 설계되었다고 판단되는 경우, 인자 1과 같거나 1에 가까운 인자를 선
정하여야 한다. 중간 정도의 상황은 중간 정도의 인자를 선정하여야 함을 의미할 것이다. 급성 
동물 자료만이 영구 노출에 대한 허용흡입량(TI) 값을 계산하는 근거가 되는 경우, 보다 위 
범위의 인자가 100이상으로 확대될 것이다.
4.4.3 변경 인자의 결정
변경 인자(MF)는 불확정 인자 (UF1 ㆍ UF2 ㆍ UF3)의 산출량으로써 계산되어야 한다[아래의 
방정식 (2) 참조]. 이러한 변경 인자는 TI와 차례로 각각의 사용량에 대한 허용 노출량(TE)을 
결정하는 근거로 사용하여야 한다. 
MF =  UF1 ․ UF2 ․ UF3 
(2)
대부분의 경우에는 10과 1000 사이의 변경 인자는 충분히 지켜야 한다. 몇몇의 경우에, 특히 


- 438 -
이용할 수 있는 자료가 빈약하거나 적합하지 않고, 중요한 위해 요소가 확인된 경우에는 
10000만큼 높은 변경 인자가 필요할 수 있다. 일부의 경우에는, 10 이하의 변경 인자의 타당성을 
입증하기에 충분할 만큼 사소한 종점 또는 충분한 사람에 대한 자료가 있을 수 있다. 치명상에 
대한 급성 자료만을 이용할 수 있는 경우에는 영구 접촉에 대한 허용흡입량(TI)을 확립하기 
위하여 10000보다 큰 변경 인자가 필요할 수도 있다. 변경 인자가 10000 이상이 되는 상황은 
분석과 고려에 있어 불명확함의 정도가 높다는 것을 나타내며, 그러한 상황에 대한 추가적인 
자료가 긴급하게 필요하다는 것을 의미한다. 내정 값(default) UFs를 사용하는 것에 대한 대안
으로 생리적 근거를 바탕으로 제작된 약물 동력학(PBPK) 모델은 사람 사이의 개인적 차이(UF1)
를 설명하고, 종 안에서 이종간의 외삽법(UF2)을 실시하는데 이용할 수 있다. PBPK 모델을 이용
하면 불확정성이 감소될 수 있으며, 변경인자(MF)가 서로 다르게 나타날 수 있다.
4.5 종양성 종점에 대한 허용흡입량(TI) 설정
4.5.1 발암성 용해물(leachable substances)에 대한 과정
일단 측정을 하고난 이후에, 허용 노출량(TE)을 계산하는데 필요한 적합한 영구 노출 허용흡
입량(TI)을 결정하기 위하여 비종양성 종점에 대한 허용흡입량(TI) 값에 따라 종양에 대한 허용
흡입량(TI)을 평가하여야 한다.
발암성이 있는 것으로 간주된 용해물(leachable substances)의 경우 종양을 근거로 하는 허
용흡입량(TI)을 
측정하는 
적합한 
방법을 
결정하기 
위하여 
증거의 
가치 
시험
(weight-of-evidence test)을 이용하여야 한다. 증거의 가치 시험(weight-of-evidence test)에는 
다음의 질문에 대한 대답이 포함된다.
- 원자재가 유전 독성 발암 물질인가
- 종양의 유형이 사람과 관련이 있는 것인가
- 기존의 생체기질(biodisposition) 자료가 사람에게 외삽하는 것을 입증해 주는가
- 역학적인 정보가 사람과의 관련성을 입증하는가
4.5.2 증거의 가치 시험(weight-of-evidence test)을 통과한 물질에 관한 선택 사항
증거의 가치 시험(weight-of-evidence test)에서 원자재가 유전 독성 발암 물질이고, 종양 생체 
분석에서 관찰된 종양의 유형이 사람과 관련이 있으며, 생체기질(biodisposition) 및/또는 역
학적인 정보가 사람과의 관련성을 입증하는 것으로 나타나는 경우에는 다음의 두 가지 접근법 
가운데 한 가지를 이용하여야 한다.
1) 10-4의 현저한 위험 수준과 함께 통계적 모델을 이용하여 정량적인 위해 평가 과정을 근거
로 종양 허용흡입량(TI)을 결정한다.
주) 선형 다단계 모델(linear multistage model)을 사용하는 경우에는 낮은 투여량이 비선형성
일 가능성, DNA 복구 기전으로 인해 생물학적 경계(thresholds)가 생길 수 있는 가능성, 그
리고 기타 항상성 과정을 고려하여야 한다.


- 439 -
2) 종양 허용흡입량(TI)을 결정하지 않는다. 환자에 대한 노출량을 합리적으로 실행할 수 있을 정
도로 낮게 감소시키고, 위험 관리 과정(risk management procedures)을 이용하여 종양 위험
을 적극적으로 관리한다.
주) 자세한 정보는 ISO 14971을 참조(Medical devices-Application of risk management to 
medical devices)
4.5.3 증거의 가치 시험(weight-of-evidence test)이 실패하거나 애매한 경우의 과정
증거의 가치 시험(weight-of-evidence test)에 실패한 경우에는 변경 인자 접근법을 이용하여야 
한다. 만일 증거의 가치 시험이 애매하다면, 변경 인자와 정량적 위해성 평가 기법을 모두 이용
하여 종양 허용흡입량(TI)을 결정하여야 한다. 변경 인자 접근법을 사용하는 경우, 4.3항에 제
시되어 있는 방법을 종양 유전자 반응에 이용하여야 한다.
가능한 한, 생리적 근거를 바탕으로 제작된 약물 동력학(PBPK) 모델은, 적용한 투여량보다
는 조사 대상 표적 기관에 전달된 투여량을 계산하는데 사용하여야 한다. 그리고 적용된 투
여량보다는 전달된 투여량을 위해성을 계산하는데 이용한다.
4.6 접촉 허용 수준(TCLs)의 확립
4.6.1 개요
자극성 자료에 대한 검토는 자극성을 고려하여야 하는지의 여부와 해당되는 경우 비자극 수준 
(NIL)을 확립하여야 하는지의 여부를 결정하는데 필요한 정보를 제시해준다. 비자극 수준(NIL)
을 구할 필요가 있다고 결정되면, 변경 인자 접근법을 이용하여 접촉 허용 수준을 밝힐 수 있
다. 접촉 허용 수준(TCLs)은 일부 용해물(leachable substances)의 경우에 필요할 것으로 예
상되고, 특정 용도에 사용되는 일부 의료기기에 대해서만 필요할 수 있다. 이러한 상황에서 사
용될 접촉 허용 수준(TCLs)은 허용 한도에 대한 이원적인 강제제약(binding constraint)이 될 
것이다. 더욱이 자극을 예방하는 것이 충분히 제한적이어서 전신독성에 근거한 허용한도가 불필요
한 상황이 있을 수도 있다.
이러한 접근법은 알레르기성 접촉 피부염에 기반한 TCL 값의 유도를 위한 것이 아니라 해부
학적으로 또는 약물 동태학적으로 고립된 조직(예를 들면, 뇌, 눈)에서 자극성 이외의 국부효과
를 위한 것이다.
4.6.2 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)을 계산하기 위한 노출량 고려
허용 접촉 수준(TCL)은 특정 의료기기 사용 패턴으로 인해 손상된 피부, 눈, 점막 또는 표면
과 같이 인체조직과의 직접적인 접촉에 의한 자극 반응을 보이는 용출물질에 대하여 필요할 수 
있다. 환자군을 고려하여야 한다.
허용 접촉 수준(TCL)은 조직에 반복 접촉하는 경우에 필요할 수 있다. 예들 들어, 원자재는 1회 


- 440 -
사용에 의한 일정한 농도에서는 자극을 일으키지 않을 수 있지만, 반복 사용에 의하여 자극을 일으
킬 수 있다.
4.6.3 자극 종점에 대한 허용 접촉 수준(TCL) 설정
4.6.3.1 개요
비자극 수준(NIL), 최소한의 자극 수준(MIL) 또는 기타 유사한 수준에서 각각의 관련 접촉 조직
에 대한 TCL을 계산하여야 한다. 이들 자료를 이용할 수 있는 경우에는 언제든지 각각의 TCL
을 계산할 때 비자극 농도에서 반복 노출을 통해 일어나는 자극의 정도를 고려하여야 한다. 변
경 인자 접근법을 이용하여 TCL을 계산하여야 한다. 이러한 접근법은 자극성에 대한 안전성 허
용 최저한도를 제시하기 위하여, 전문적인 판단을 근거로 결정한 불확정 인자를 사용하는 것과 결
부되어 있다. 변경 인자 접근법을 이용하여 평방 센티미터당 밀리그램으로 표시되는 TCL을 계
산하는 공식은 다음과 같다.
        
            NIL 또는 MIL
TCL = ――――――――――――――――
(3)
 
    MFTCL․A
              
MFTCL : 변경 인자(UF4 ㆍ UF5 ㆍ UF6).
NIL : 비자극 수준(밀리그램)
MIL : 최소한의 자극 수준(밀리그램)
A : 인체 접촉 표면적(평방 센티미터)
특정한 사용자군의 가장 광범위한 부분을 근거로 자극성 한도를 확립하여야 한다. 일반적인 용
도 이외의 용도로 사용하는 경우에는 사용하려는 의료기기에 대한 부분 모집단을 이용한다.
4.6.3.2 불확정 인자의 결정
자극의 생물학적 위험을 측정하기 위하여 사용되는 방법은 전신 독성에 사용하는 방법과는 차
이가 있다. 주요한 차이는 불확정성의 정도이다. 일반적으로 적합한 시험 모델에서 자극이 일어
나지 않는 경우, 사람이 사용하는 경우에도 자극이 일어나지 않을 것이다. 따라서 복합적인 불
확정성 인자와 큰 안전성 최저한도를 사용하는 것이 보다 제한적이다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 
불확정 인자의 선정에는 몇 가지 사항을 고려해야 한다.
- 불확정 인자 4(UF4)
UF4는 사람 사이의 개별적인 차이를 설명해 준다. TCL 값을 구하는 경우에는 UF4를 고려하여
야 한다. 사람의 차이를 평가하는 데에는 실제 자료(actual data)를 이용하는 것이 더 바람
직하다. 자극을 일으키는 용해물(leachable substance)에 대한 사람 반응의 개별적 차이를 규명
하기 위한 시험 자료가 부재한 경우에는 3에서 10의 범위에 있는 불확정 인자를 이용하여야 
한다.


- 441 -
- 불확정 인자 5(UF5)
UF5는 사람보다는 다른 종에서 유추된 자료에서 외삽된 것을 설명해 준다. UF5는 다른 종과 사
람 사이의 고유한 차이를 고려하여야 한다. 언제나 사람과 시험 종 사이의 관계에 대한 세부적
인 정보와 자료를 이용하는 것이 바람직하다. 그러한 세부적인 정보가 부재한 경우에는 이종간 
차이 불확정 인자(UF5) 3을 이용하여야 한다.
- 불확정 인자 6(UF6)
UF6은 시험 자료의 품질과 타당성을 설명해 준다. MILs 대 NILs를 이용하는 경우에는 불
확정 인자(UF6) 3이나 또는 그 이상이 필요할 수 있다. 이와 유사하게 실행된 시험 또는 불충
분하게 설계된 시험을 바탕으로 결과가 도출된 경우이거나 관련 자료의 양이 제한되어 있는 경
우에는 UF6를 3까지 적용할 수 있다. 따라서 자료의 품질과 타당성이 모두 빈약한 경우에는 
UF6는 9 또는 그 이상이 될 수 있다.
4.6.3.3 허용 접촉 수준(TCL) 변경 인자의 결정
제시된 방정식(3)에 따라 불확정 인자(UF4ㆍUF5ㆍUF6)의 산출량으로써 TCL 변경 인자 (MFTCL)
를 계산하여야 한다. 이러한 변경 인자는 TCL에 대한 근거로 이용하여야 한다. 대부분의 경우에 
변경 인자는 30 또는 그 이하로도 충분하여야 하지만, 비자극 농도가 확립되어 있지 않거나 이
용할 수 있는 자료가 빈약한 또는 부적합한 경우에는 이보다 클 수도 있다.
4.7 혼합물의 위험 평가
본 장은 의료기기에서 방출되는 각각의 용해물(leachable substances)에 대한 허용 한도를 유
추하는 데 사용한다. 그러나 환자가 어떤 시각에 하나의 잔류물에 노출되는 경우는 거의 없다. 
보다 현실적인 시나리오는 동일한 시간에 의료기기에서 방출되는 복합적인 성분에 동시에 노출된
다는 것이다. 이렇듯 복합적인 성분에 동시에 노출되면 일부 물질의 중요한 독성이 증가하거나 
감소할 수 있는 잠재성을 갖게 된다. 그러나 의료기기에서 방출된 성분의 비율이 이들 성분
에 대한 대표적인 허용흡입량(TI) 값보다 아래에 있는 경우에는 혼합물 조성 사이에서 상승효
과가 발생할 가능성이 적어진다. 혼합물의 위험 평가를 다루는 방법은 부록 B에 제시되어 있다. 
5 허용 노출량(TE)의 계산 
5.1 개요
많은 의료기기의 사용에 의해 일정한 용해물(leachable substances)에 노출될 수 있다. 용해물
(leachable substances)에 대한 TI를 밝혀낸 후에는 허용 노출량을 결정하기 위하여 의료기기
를 사용하는 경로 및 용해물(leachable substances)을 발생시킬 수 있는 다른 의료기기에 노출
될 잠재성을 고려하여 적합한 허용흡입량(TI)으로 조절할 필요가 있다.
허용 노출량(TE)을 결정하기 위하여 사용하는 활용 인자(UTF)와 적합한 체중을 측정을 위하여 
다음의 인자들을 평가하여야 한다. 


- 442 -
a) 의료기기에 노출된 특정한 집단
b) 노출된 집단에서 지배적인 체중
c) 의료기기의 사용 형태
d) 복합적인 의료기기로부터 나오는 동일한 용해물(leachable substances)에 환자가 노출될 잠
재성
국부적인 영향은 일반적으로 의료기기의 사용에 따라 감소되거나 증가되지 않으므로 허용 접촉 
수준(TCL)을 사용에 따라 조정하여 사용하지 않는다. 그보다는 오히려 허용 한도를 설정하는데 
자극성이 요인이 되는 경우 TCL을 잔류물/의료기기 복합체에 대한 허용 노출량으로 이용한다. 
TCL을 이용하는 경우, TCL은 일반적으로 상호 강제 허용 노출량(mutually binding TE)으로 
취급된다. 자극성이 강제제약(binding constraint)을 나타내는 경우에는 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)이 
허용 노출량(TE)이 되지만, 용인할 수 없는 자극성은 하루 동안이라도 허용해서는 안 되기 때문에 
의료기기당 밀리그램으로 표시한다.
활용 인자는 의료기기의 종류 또는 의료기기에서 환자에게 노출되는 잔류물의 일반적인 경로
를 반영하여야 한다. 만일 노출 범주에 대한 모든 허용흡입량(TIs)을 나타내기 위하여 하나의 
허용흡입량(TI)만을 선정하였다면, 일부 허용 범위로 특정 경로 의료기기에 대한 활용 인자를 계
산할 수 있어야 한다. 일정한 기간 범주에 속해있는 모든 경로에 대하여 하나의 TI만을 사용
한 경우에는 의료기기의 특정한 경로를 분류하기 위하여 개별적인 TI를 계산할 수 있으며, 의
료기기 또는 의료기기 범주에 대한 활용 인자의 근거로 TI를 이용할 수 있다.
5.2 노출군
5.2.1 체중
덩치가 큰 의료기기는 성인들이 사용하는 것이다. 따라서 다른 집단이 의료기기를 사용하지 않는 
한, 70 kg을 이용하여 허용 노출량(TE)을 계산하여야 한다. 그러한 경우에 TE는 가장 보편적인 
사용 유형에서 유추한 체중을 근거로 하여야 하며, 특히 신생아와 같이 특출하게 민감한 집
단이 사용하는 의료기기라면 특별한 사항들을 함께 고려하여야 한다. 사용할 수 있는 다양한 
체중은 부록 A를 참조한다. 
5.2.2 신생아와 아동이 사용하는 의료기기
신생아의 경우에는 원자재의 주된 배출 경로가 미숙할 가능성과 보다 많은 양이 누적될 가능
성을 고려하여야 한다. 신생아가 사용하는 의료기기에 대한 TIs를 계산하는 경우에는 위해 요
소가 있는 원자재에 노출된 신생아 시험에서 유추된 자료가 보다 바람직하다. 그러한 자료를 
TIs를 계산할 때 사용할 수 없는 경우에는 성인 자료를 통해 계산한 TIs를 이용하여 TE를 계
산하여야 한다. 
그러한 의료기기에 대한 체중으로 신생아의 경우에는 3.5 kg의 체중을, 아동의 경우에는 10 
kg을 이용하여 TE를 계산하여야 한다. 


- 443 -
5.3 사용 유형에서 활용 인자의 계산
5.3.1 개요
활용 인자(UTF)를 곱하여 허용 흡입량 TI의 산출량과 체중을 조정한다. 
치료 장치의 부분으로 사용되는 용도를 포함하여 관련 집단에 대한 의료기기의 일반적인 사용 
유형을 결정하여야 한다. 가능한 경우 의료기기의 예측된 사용 유형을 고려하여 활용 인자를 
유추하여야 한다. 여기에는 동반 노출 인자(CEF)와 비례 노출 인자(PEF)도 필요하다. 방정식 
(4)에 제시된 바에 따라 이들 인자를 모두 곱하여 활용 인자(UF)를 구한다. 
UTF = CEF ․ PEF
(4)
5.3.2 동반 노출 인자(Concomitant exposure factor, CEF)
복합적인 용도의 의료기기에서 발생하는 특정한 용해물(leachable substance)에 노출되는 정
도를 평가한다. 다음의 원리에 따라 이러한 평가에 대한 조건으로 0.2와 1.0 사이에서 동반 
노출 인자 (CEF)를 결정한다.
1) 활용 인자가 알려져 있지 않은 경우에는 CEF 0.2를 이용한다.
2) 용해물(leachable substance)을 방출할 수 있는 다수의 의료기기(즉, 다시 말해 연간 판매
된 의료기기의 최소 5 % 또는 단일 의료 과정에서 의료기기가 5 개 이상인)를 이용하는 경우
에는 다음에 따라 CEF를 계산하여야 한다.
  a) 허용흡입량(TI)의 산출량과 체중(mB)을 방정식 (5)에 제시되어 있는 바와 같이 과정을 
진행하는 동안 의료기기에서 방출될 것으로 예측되는 용해물(leachable substance)의 총
량으로 나눈다. 
                    TI ㆍ mB
     CEF = ―――――――――――――
(5)
      mproc
             
   TI : 하루당 체중(kg)당 밀리그램으로 표시하는 허용 흡입량이다.
   mB : 킬로그램으로 표시하는 체중이다.
   mproc 
: 과정이 진행되는 동안, 하루당 밀리그램으로 표시되는 방출되는 용해물(leachable 
substance)의 총량이다.
  b) 허용흡입량(TI)의 산출량과 체중(mB)을 방정식 (6)에 제시되어 있는 바와 같이 수명 기간 동
안 모든 의료의 용해물(leachable substance)에 보통 사람들이 날마다 노출될 것으로 예
측되는 평균값으로 나눈다.
                     TI ㆍ mB

    TI : 하루당 체중(kg)당 밀리그램으로 표시하는 허용 흡입량이다.
    mB : 킬로그램으로 표시하는 체중이다.
    mlife : 수명 동안,  방출되는 용해물(leachable substance)의 질량으로, 하루 노출 평균을 밀리
그램으로 표시한다.
  c) 내정 값(default value) 0.2
3) 용해물(leachable substance)을 방출하는 의료기기가 극소수인 경우(즉, 다시 말해 연간 판
매된 의료기기의 5 % 이하이거나 단일 의료 과정에서 의료기기가 5 개 이하인)를 이용하는 경
우에는 CEF 1.0을 이용하여야 한다.
5.3.3 비례 노출 인자(Proportional exposure factor, PEF)
노출 범주의 전체 기간 동안 의료기기를 사용하지 않는 상황을 고려하여 활용 인자(UTF)를 상
향 조정할 수 있다. 이를 용이하게 하기 위하여 비례 노출 인자(PEF)는 의료기기에 실제로 노
출될 것으로 예측되는 동안의 노출 범주의 비율로 계산하여야 한다. 식 (7)에서 보는 바와 같
이, PEF는 노출 범주에서의 날 수를 의료기기가 폐기 전에 사용된 날 수로 나눈 값과 같다.
            nexp
PEF = ――――――――――
(7)
            nuse
nexp : 노출 범주에서의 일수이다. 
nuse : 의료기기의 사용 일수이다. 
의료기기의 일수를 다양하게 사용하는 경우에는 타당한 상위 한도를 이용하여야 한다. 타당
한 상위 한도를 결정할 수 없는 경우에는 PEF 내정 값(default) 1을 이용한다.
5.4 허용 노출량
의료기기를 사용하는 방식을 고려하여 허용 흡입량 TI를 조정한다. 허용 노출량 TE는 허용 흡
입량의 산출물과 체중 그리고 활용 인자이다.
TE = TI ․ mB ․ UTF
(8)
TE : 환자의 체중을 고려하고 의료기기의 활용을 계산에 넣은 후의 허용 노출량이다. 일반적
으로 하루당 밀리그램으로 표시한다.
TI : 의료기기의 평가를 근거로 변형한 후의 허용 흡입량이다. 일반적으로 하루 체중 킬로그램


- 445 -
당 밀리그램으로 표시한다.
mB: : 지정된 환자군의 체중이다. 세부적인 정보가 존재하지 않는 경우에는 mB = 70kg을 이용한
다.  
UTF : 의료기기의 사용 빈도수와, 동일한 용출 물질을 함유하고 있는 것으로 예측할 수 있는 다른 
의료기기와 결합하여 사용하는 빈도수를 고려하기 위하여 사용되는 활용 인자이다. 
6 실행 가능성 평가
6.1 실행 가능성은 재가공업자 또는 제조업자의 허용 노출량을 얻을 수 있는 능력을 의미한다. 실
행 가능성에는 두 가지 부분이 있다.
a) 기술적 실행 가능성과
b) 경제적 실행 가능성
기술적 실행 가능성은 비용에 상관없이 한 가지 의료기기 또는 의료기기들에 대한 허용 노출
량을 얻을 수 있는 능력을 의미한다.
경제적 실행 가능성은 비합리적인 경제적 문제로 의료기기를 규제하지 않으면서 허용 노출량을 만
족시킬 수 있는 능력을 의미한다. 사람 건강의 증진, 향상 또는 유지에 미치는 영향의 정도에 
따른 허용 한도를 선정할 때에는 비용과 이용가능성의 관계를 고려하여야 한다.
6.2 허용 한도를 구할 수 있는 실행 가능성이 있는 경우에는 유익성 평가를 실시하지 않는다. 1
에 대한 유익성 인자 내정 값(defaults)과 허용 한도는 허용 노출량과 동일하다. 허용 노출량을 만
족시키는 것이 기술적으로나 경제적으로 불가능한 경우에는 유익성 평가를 실시하여야 한다. 유익
성의 고려에 대한 이론적 근거를 문서로 제시하여야 한다.
7 유익성 평가
7.1 의료기기에 적합한 것으로 간주되는 안전성 보증의 정도는 모든 의료기기가 건강에 유익
하게 이용된다는 사실을 인정하는 것이다. 의료기기의 사용에서 예측되는 건강상 유익성이 보
다 큰 경우에는 위해성도 더 많이 용인될 수 있다. 그러나 본 부분의 목적을 위하여 허용 노출
량을 초과하는 경우에는 사례별 근거를 바탕으로 유익성만을 고려한다. 치료에서 예측되는 특
정한 건강상 유익성과 균형을 이루고, 용해물(leachable substance)에 의하여 사람의 건강을 
향상시키고, 증진시키며, 유지시키는 것과 조화를 이룰 수 있는 정도가 크게 감소되는 경우, 기
기에 존재하는 용해물(leachable substance)에서 발생하는 독성이 허용할만한 것으로 간주된
다면, 그러한 경우에 한해서만 건강상 유익성을 고려한 인자를 도입하여 허용 노출량(TE)을 변
경한다.
7.2 의료기기에 대한 위해 평가를 적용하는 경우에는 건강상 위험이 없는 의료 과정은 존재하
지 않으며, 의료기기의 사용과 관련된 위험은 의료기기를 사용하여 발생하는 건강상 유익성
과 균형을 이룬다는 것을 고려하여야 한다.
7.3 원자재나 공정에서 발생하는 독성 요소인 용해물(leachable substance)을 대체 원자재를 


- 446 -
이용하거나 공정 방법에 따라 손쉽게 예방할 수 없는 경우에는 의료기기의 사용에서 발생하는 유
익성의 중요성을 고려하여야 한다. 허용 한도를 계산하는데 사용된 유익성 인자의 크기와 필요
성에 관한 타당성을 문서로 입증하여야 한다. 그러한 경우에 허용 한도는 허용 노출량(TE)의 
산출량과 유익성 인자(BF)이다. 
8 허용 한도
8.1 허용 노출량(TE)을 계산하고 실행가능성과 유익성을 바탕으로 허용 노출량(TE)을 변
경한 후에 각각의 허용 노출량(TE)에 대한 허용 한도를 계산한다. 모든 허용 한도를 충족시켜
야 한다.
8.2 다음의 일반적인 공식을 이용하여 각각의 허용 한도 AL을 계산한다. 
AL = TE ․ BF
(9)
AL : 의료기기에 노출되어 인체에 흡입되는 경우, 하루를 기본으로 허용할 수 있는 것으로 간
주되는 가장 큰 용해물(leachable substance)의 양으로 하루당 밀리그램으로 표시한다 
(2.1 참조).
주) 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)에 근거한 경우 허용 노출량(TE)은 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)과 같
고 허용 한도는 평방 제곱 센티미터당 밀리그램으로 표시된다.
TE : 하루당 밀리그램으로 표시하는 허용 노출량이다. 
주) 허용 접촉 수준(TCL)에 근거한 경우 평방 제곱 센티미터당 밀리그램으로 표시된다.
BF : 유익성 인자이다.
8.3 허용 한도도 마찬가지로 의료기기당 밀리그램으로 표시할 수 있다. 하루당 밀리그램으로 
표시하는 전신 한도(systemic limits)나 자극을 일으키는 물질에 대한 인체 표면 접촉을 근거
로 하는 의료기기당 질량에 대한 허용 한도를 전환하는 방법은 부록 C에서 참조할 수 있다.

제 17장 원자재의 화학적 특성
(관련규격: ISO 10993-18:2005)
1 적용범위
본 장에서는 원자재의 확인과 원자재를 구성하고 있는 구성성분의 확인 및 정량에 관한 기본 틀
을 기술한다. 원자재의 화학적 특성에 관한 정보는 다음과 같은 사항에 적용될 수 있다.
- 의료기기의 생물학적 안전성 평가(제1장, ISO 10993-1)
- 위험평가 관련 허용한도 준수여부를 판단하기 위해 의료기기의 용해물 수준 평가 
- 임상적으로 허용된 원자재와의 동등성 판단
- 원형제품과 완제품간의 동등성 판단
- 특정 임상 의료기기에 사용될 수 있는 새로운 원자재의 검색
주) 본 장은 제8장, 제12장, 제13장, 제14장(ISO 10993-9, 10993-13, 10993-14, 
10993-15)에서 다루고 있는 분해산물의 확인과 정량에 대해서는 언급하고 있지 않으며, 인체
와 직접 혹은 간접적으로 접촉하는 의료기기를 대상으로 한다. 또한 의료기기의 생물학적 안전
성 평가 시, 원자재 공급자 및 의료기기 제조업자에게 제공될 목적으로 작성되었다.
2 정의
본 장에서는 다음 용어 및 정의뿐만 아니라 제1장(ISO 10993-1)에 수록되어 있는 용어 및 정의
를 적용한다.
2.1 공급자(supplier)
의료기기의 제조에 사용되는 초기 원자재를 공급하거나 제조하는 사람 또는 회사
2.2 제조업자(manufacturer)
의료기기의 고안, 제조, 포장 및 기재사항에 대해 책임이 있는 자연인 혹은 법인
2.3 부분품(component)
그 자체가 의료기기는 아니지만 의료기기의 일부를 구성하는, 초기 원자재로부터 만들어진 물
건
2.4 가공업자(converter)
원자재를 반제품으로 가공하거나 조립하는 사람 또는 회사
2.5 화학적 특성(chemical characterization)
원자재의 확인 및 의료기기의 원자재나 완제품에 들어 있는 화학물질의 확인 및 정량 
2.6 완전용출법(exhaustive extraction)
일련의 용출과정에서 잔류물이 처음 검출된 양의 10 % 미만일 때까지 용출함


주) 용출은 시간, 온도, 표면적 대 부피비율, 용출배지 및 원자재의 상평형에 영향을 받는 복잡
한 과정이다. 원자재의 상평형은 원자재의 비결정상태와 결정상태의 상대적인 양을 조절한다. 
비결정상의 경우, 유리전이온도, Tg는 비결정상에서의 고분자 사슬의 유동성 및 확산속도를 결
정한다. 확산속도는 보통 유리전이온도 이상에서 높고, 결정상에서 가장 낮다.
용출 조건이 원자재의 상평형을 변경시켜서는 안 된다. 상변경이 용출되는 물질의 형태 및 양
에 영향을 줄 수 있기 때문이다. 완전 용출을 이용할 경우, 높은 온도나 그 밖에 다른 조건이 
용출역학 및 용출물질 확인에 미치는 영향을 신중히 고려하여야 한다. 예를 들어, 높은 온도를 
이용하여 용출할 경우, 다음의 사항을 고려하여야 한다.
a) 높은 온도의 에너지로 인해 중합체의 교차 결합이 증가할 수 있고, 그로인해 중합체간의 이
동 가능한 자유단량체의 양이 감소할 수 있다.
b) 온도의 상승으로 인해 완제품의 사용조건에서 사용 시 발견되지 않는 분해 물질이 생성될 수 
있다.
c) 온도의 상승으로 인해 완제품에서 전형적으로 발견되는 용해물이 없어질 수 도 있다.
2.7 모의용출법(simulated extraction)
의료기기의 일반적 사용과 관련하여, 환자 및 사용자에 대한 잠재적 위험을 평가하기 위한 용
출이다. 실제로 의료기기를 사용하는 것과 같은 상황을 모의하기 위해 적절한 용출배지와 용출
방법을 사용해야 한다.

a) 임상적으로 사용이 확립된 원자재와의 동등성
b) 완제품 의료기기와 원형 의료기기 간의 동등성
원자재의 화학적 특성을 밝히는 과정에 대한 개관은 본 장에 제시되어 있고, 위험평가와 관
련한 개관은 부록 A에 제시되어 있다.
원자재의 화학적 조성을 기술하기 위해 정성적인 자료가 확보되어야 하며, 생물학적 안전성과 
관련하여 원자재의 정량적인 자료도 확보되어야 한다. 일부 의료기기의 경우 원자재 명세서
에 화학적 조성이 제시되어 있으나, 고분자와 같은 원자재의 경우, 복잡한 구조들을 가지고 있
기 때문에 원자재 공급자로부터 조성에 관한 상세정보를 입수하여야 한다. 이러한 상세정보가 
없다면, 적절한 분석기법을 이용하여 원자재 조성에 관한 정보를 얻어야 한다.
의료기기 제조에 사용되는 원자재의 구성성분을 확인할 경우, 각 구성성분 고유의 독성을 연구
할 수 있다. 이와 같이 얻어진 원자재에 관한 자료는 해당 의료기기의 생물학적 안전성 평가의 
일부 자료로 의료기기 제조업자에게 사용될 수 있다. 따라서 원자재 공급자가 특정 상업적 거
래 또는 공급계약 하에 의료기기 제조업자에게 제공되는 원자재의 조성을 사전 통보 없이 변경
할 경우, 이를 단속하여야 한다. 또한, 제조업자는 제품의 생물학적 안전에 관한 모든 통보된 
변경의 결과에 대하여도 평가하여야 한다.
의료기기 제조공정에 사용되는 모든 원자재 및 첨가제는 생물학적으로 이용 가능한 것이어야 
하나, 의료기기 사용으로 인한 위험을 평가하기 위해 완제품의 실제적인 사용 조건하에서 이용 
가능한 구성성분의 범위를 증명하는 정보를 확보해야 한다. 이 정보는 원자재의 용출물 시험
으로부터 얻을 수 있다. 적절한 용출 조건(모의 용출법)은 의료기기의 실제적인 사용법 하에서 
용출될 수 있는 구성성분을 확인하는데 사용된다. 용출물은 의료기기의 생물학적 안전을 평가
하기 위해 정량 및/또는 정성 분석될 수 있다. 
의료기기 제작에 요구되는 원자재의 화학적 특성은 의료기기의 임상적 사용 기간과 특성을 고
려하여야 하고, 의료기기의 생물학적 안전을 평가하는데 필요한 정보에 근거하여 독성위험 평가
자에 의해 결정되어야 한다. 이외에도 사용되는 원자재의 물리적 형태 또한 고려되어야 한다
(액상, 젤 형태, 고분자 형태, 금속, 세라믹 및 생물학적 원천으로부터 유래한 조성물).
본 장에 제시된 원자재의 특성을 성공적으로 규명하기 위해 재료학자, 분석화학자 및 독성 위
험평가자 간에 친밀한 협력이 요구된다. 이런 관계 하에서, 재료학자와 분석화학자는 독성위험

평가자가 의료기기의 생물학적 안전을 결정할 수 있도록 원자재의 정성 및 정량 정보를 제공
해 주어야 한다.
5 원자재의 특성규명 절차
5.1 일반사항
원자재의 화학적 특성에 관한 자료는 위험평가 및 부록 A에 제시되어 있는 5단계의 순차적 과
정을 통해 생성된다. 각 단계마다 화학적 특성규명에 필요한 요건 및 지침이 5.2에서 5.6에 명
시되어 있다. 독성학적 평가에 필요한 정보를 제공하기 위해 적절한 분석 방법을 선택해야 한
다. 만약 적절한 분석 방법이 없는 경우, 적절한 새로운 방법을 개발하여야 한다. 새로운 방법
을 개발하기 전에 이미 유사한 시험방법이 존재할 수도 있으므로, 기존의 표준, 모노그래프, 관
련 논문 또는 기타 관련된 과학적 문서 등을 참고하여야 한다.
사용된 분석 방법은 검증되고, 정당화되고, 보고되어야 한다.(7항 참조) 분석 방법은 다음과 같
이 정당화된 분석 특성과 관련하여 적절함이 검증되어야 한다.
- 정확성(accuracy)
- 정밀성(precision)
- 특이성(specificity)
- 검출한계(limit of detection)
- 정량한계(limit of quantification)
- 선형성(linearity)
- 범위(range)
- 엄격성(ruggedness)
- 견고성(robustness)
- 시스템 적합성(system suitability)
분석절차의 각 단계에서 얻은 자료가 위험평가의 기초로 사용되기에 타당한지 여부를 결정하여
야 한다. 본 절차는 완제품의 화학적 특성에 대한 요구조건 외에 의료기기에 사용된 각 원자재
를 고려하여 수행하여야 한다.
주 1) 2단계와 4단계, 5.3과 5.5 각각은 위험평가 과정의 일부로, 본 장의 범위 밖의 것이다. 이들 
과정에 대한 정보는 위험평가와 원자재 특성규명간의 중요한 연관성을 보여주기 위한 정보로 활용된
다.
주 2) 원자재 공급업자는 적절한 분석 방법을 제공할 수 있어야 한다. 구성 성분에 대한 초기 자
료가 없는 경우에 가장 적절한 분석방법을 선택할 수 있도록 초기 원자재 및 첨가제의 특성 관
련 문헌 연구가 권장된다.
5.2 단계 1 - 정성적 정보
원자재/의료기기 그리고 이들의 사용목적을 기술한다. 문서화된 원자재/의료기기에 대한 정성


- 460 -
적 기재사항은 완성된 의료기기에 사용된 첨가제 및 공정상의 잔류물을 포함하여 완제품 구성에 
필요하다. (제1장의 4.3항과 5항 및 본 장의 부록 B 참조) 정성적 자료는 원자재의 특성뿐만 
아니라 임상적 사용기간 및 침습정도에 따른 의료기기 범주를 반영하여야 하고 정당화 되어야 
한다.
정성적 자료는 가능한 한 각각의 원자재에 대한 명세서, 공급자, 배치(batch), 롯트(lot) 등 세부
사항을 포함해야 한다. 사용목적에 따른 표준화된 원자재를 사용할 경우에도 본 요건을 만족해야 
한다.
의료기기 제조업자는 초기 원자재의 공급자로부터 원자재의 정성적 및 정량적 구성 정보를 우
선적으로 확보해야 한다. 추가 공정 첨가제에 관한 정성적 정보 또한 가공업자나 부분품 제조
업자 등 해당 제조 관련자로부터 획득하여야 한다. 원자재의 구성은 적용 가능한 원자재 표준
을 따라야 하고, 제조업자는 이를 명시하여야 한다. 원자재 구성성분으로부터 야기되는 독성을 
확인할 수 있는 충분한 정보를 이 단계에서 획득해야 하며, 위험평가를 위해서도 사용해야 한
다.
5.3 단계 2 - 원자재 동등성
원자재가 동일한 임상적 노출/사용 방법, 동일한 제조 및 멸균 공정을 가지는 의료기기에 사용
된 것과 동일한지 여부를 결정하기 위해 충분한 정성적 정보가 필요하다.
주) 독성학적 동등성에 관한 예는 부록 C 참조
5.4 단계 3 - 정량적 정보
원자재의 정성적 분석만으로 독성학적 위험평가에 대한 충분한 자료를 제공하지 못하기 때문
에 정량적 화학 조성이 확립되고, 문서화되어 위험평가에 제공되어야 한다.
5.5 단계 4 - 정량적 위험평가
이미 존재하는 독성학적 정보와 함께(제16장, ISO 10993-17 참조) 위험 평가를 수행하기 위
해 충분한 정량적 정보를 확보해야 한다.
5.6 단계 5 - 존재하는 화합물에의 임상적 노출 추정
특정 화합물의 일정량이 예상되는 임상적 노출로 미루어 보아 독성을 일으킬 여지가 있다면, 
그 화합물에의 노출속도가 측정되어야 하고, 노출되는 총 용량이 추정되어야 한다. 용출조건은 
문서화되고 정당화되어야 한다.
주 1) 용출 필요성 정도는 인체 접촉 특성 및 노출되는 정도에 따라 달라진다. 접촉기간이 증가
하고, 침습접촉이 증가할수록 용출 동역학에 대한 정보를 제공해 주는 분석이 필수적이다.
용출물은 민감하고 선택적인 방법을 이용하여 분석하여야 하며, 우려되는 화합물 수준을 정량하


여야 한다.
주 2) 일부의 경우에 용해물은 시험 뿐만 아니라, 수학적 모델에 의해 결정할 수 있다.
6 화학적 특성규명 파라미터 및 방법
6.1 일반사항
본 장의 5항 및 부록 A 부분은 독성학적 위험평가에 사용될 수 있는 단계적인 화합물의 정성 및 
정량적 특성규명 방법에 대해 설명한다. 6.2에서 6.5는 주요 의료기기 원자재 등급 각각에 대한 
정성 및 정량적 매개변수의 예 및 규명 방법의 예를 제시하고 있다.
의료기기의 다양성으로 인해 원자재에 대하여 확인된 모든 매개변수가 모든/일부 의료기기 사
용에 요구되는 것은 아니다. 5.2에서 언급했듯이 요구되는 특성규명의 정도는 사용목적 하에서 
임상적으로 노출되는 기간 및 침습성에 의해 결정된다.
5항의 단계 1과 3에서 (5.2와 5.4), 재료학자 및 분석학자(독성위험 평가자와 협의를 진행하여
야 하는 사람)는 의료기기 또는 원자재의 평가에 적절한 매개변수를 결정해야 한다. 또한, 특정 
매개변수의 산입 또는 배제에 대하여 문서화해야 한다. 특성규명 자료는 모든 적절한 매개변수 
선택과 관련하여 요구된다.

이러한 방법은 일반적으로, 의료기기에 사용되는 화합물의 위험 추정에 쓰이지만, 그 예측가능성
은 매우 제한적이다. 몇몇의 예가 아래에 제시되어 있다.

참고문헌 [13]에 제시되어 있는 시험방법은 pH 2와 pH 9의 20 ℃물에서 그리고 pH 7의 37 ℃ 
물에서 고분자의 용액/용출 형태를 결정하는 방법에 대해 기술하고 있다. 총 유기탄소(Total 
organic content : TOC) 분석법은 수용액상(aqueous phase)에 존재하는 모든 고분자 종류를 결정
하는데 추천되는 방법이다. 기타 특이적 방법 또한 기술되어 있다.

정량적이며 특이적인 분석법이 수행되어야 한다. 완전용출법을 이용하여 최악의 노출 상황에서의 
위험를 평가해야 하고, 모의용출법을 이용하여 예상되는 임상적 노출의 위험을 평가하여야 한다. 
사용하려는 분석방법의 특이성, 민감성 정도 및 정량 한계는 요구되는 위험평가의 수준에 적합하

독성관련 동등성 판단에 관한 원리
임상적으로 잘 정립된 기존 원자재를 대치하는 새로운 원자재의 독성학적 동등성 판단을 위해 5.3(단
계 2)의 화학적 특성규명 자료가 위험평가에 사용되었다. 동등성 판단을 하는데 적용되는 주요 원리
는 제시된 원자재가 임상적으로 잘 정립된 원자재보다 독성학적으로 생물학적 안전과 관련하여 나쁘
지 않아야 한다. 다음의 목록은 독성학적 동등성에 부합하는 예 그리고 4항과 5항에 약술되어 있는 
위험평가 과정에 도움이 되는 지침으로 제공된 예를 포함하고 있다.
a) 제시된 원자재의 원자재 구성 및 용출물 프로파일이 임상적으로 정립된 원자재와 동등
b) 제시된 원자재가 사용목적, 인체 접촉기간 및 침습성과 관련하여 기존에 존재하는 표준에 부합
c) 제시된 원자재가 사용하고자 하는 침습성보다 상대적으로 더 침습성이 큰 인체 노출에서 이미 정립
되어 있음
d) 제시된 원자재로부터 나온 용해물이 제16장(ISO 10993-17)을 이용하여 정립한 허용한도를 초과하
지 않음
e) 제시된 원자재가 임상적으로 잘 정립된 원자재 보다 독성학적으로 더 안전한 구성성분 및 잔류물을 
함유하고 있음(비슷한 임상적 노출을 가정하였을 경우)
f) 제시된 원자재가 임상적으로 잘 정립된 원자재와 독성학적으로 동등한 구성성분 및 잔류물을 
함유하고 있음(비슷한 임상적 노출을 가정하였을 경우)
g) 제시된 원자재와 임상적으로 정립된 원자재간의 유일한 차이가 원자재로부터 나오는 용해물 구성성
분의 양 및 형태가 변하지 않으면서, 첨가제/오염물질/잔류물이 감소 또는 제거된 경우
h) 제시된 원자재와 임상적으로 정립된 원자재간의 유일한 차이가 상대적 양이 변하지 않으면서, 후자와 
비교하여 용출되는 물질의 양을 감소시키는 공정조건을 사용하는 경우
