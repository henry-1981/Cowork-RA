GUIDELINES
ON A MEDICAL DEVICES VIGILANCE SYSTEM

The present guidelines are part of a set of guidelines relating to questions of application of
EC-Directives on MEDICAL DEVICEs. They are legally not binding. The guidelines have
been carefully drafted through a process of intensive consultation of the various interested
parties (competent authorities, Commission services, industries, other interested parties)
during which intermediate drafts were circulated and comments were taken up in the
document. Therefore, this document reflects positions taken by representatives of interested
parties in the MEDICAL DEVICEs sector.

Revision 8 of MEDDEV 2.12-1 explicitly includes IVF/ART devices within the scope of the
vigilance system and provides clarity in relation to devices that are not intended to act
directly on the individual. The revised guidance will be applicable as of July 2013.

1 FOREWORD
These guidelines on the Medical Device Vigilance System are part of a set of Medical Device
Guidelines that promote a common approach by MANUFACTURERs and Notified Bodies
involved in the conformity assessment procedures according to the relevant annexes of the
directives, and by the National Competent Authorities charged with safeguarding public
health.
They have been carefully drafted through a process of consultation with various interested
parties during which intermediate drafts were circulated and comments were taken up in the
documents. Therefore, it reflects positions taken in particular by representatives of National
Competent Authorities and Commission Services, Notified Bodies, industry and other
interested parties in the MEDICAL DEVICEs sector.
The guidelines are regularly updated accordingly with regulatory developments. The latest
version of the guidelines should always be used. This revision of these guidelines has:


carefully considered and transposed into the European context the Global Harmonisation
Task Force (GHTF)1 international regulatory guidance documents on vigilance and post
market surveillance;
addressed the introduction of European medical device database EUDAMED;
amended the document in light of experience with previous clauses.




These guidelines are not legally binding. It is recognised that under given circumstances, for
example, as a result of scientific developments, an alternative approach may be possible or
appropriate to comply with the legal requirements.
Nevertheless, due to the participation of the aforementioned interested parties and of experts
from National Competent Authorities, it is anticipated that the guidelines will be followed
within the Member States and, therefore, work towards uniform application of relevant
directive provisions and common practices within Member States.
However, only the text of the Directives is authentic in law. On certain issues not addressed
in the Directives, national legislation may be different from these guidelines.

2

INTRODUCTION

These guidelines describe the European system for the notification and evaluation of
INCIDENTs and FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTIONS (FSCA) involving MEDICAL
DEVICEs, known as the Medical Device Vigilance System.
The principal purpose of the Medical Device Vigilance System is to improve the protection of
health and safety of patients, USERs and others by reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence
of the INCIDENT elsewhere. This is to be achieved by the evaluation of reported INCIDENTs
and, where appropriate, dissemination of information, which could be used to prevent such
repetitions, or to alleviate the consequences of such INCIDENTs.
These guidelines are intended to facilitate the uniform application and implementation of the
Medical Device Vigilance System requirements contained within:
 the Directive for Active Implantable Medical Devices (AIMD), 90/385/EEC
 the Directive for Medical Devices (MDD), 93/42/EEC
 the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive (IVDD), 98/79/EC.

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA), FIELD SAFETY NOTICE (FSN), USE
ERROR and ABNORMAL USE are concepts used in this guideline to enhance and clarify the
European Medical Device Vigilance System while promoting harmonisation with GHTF
provisions.
The Medical Device Vigilance System is intended to facilitate a direct, early and harmonised
implementation of FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION across the Member States where
the device is in use, in contrast to action taken on a country by country basis.
Corrective action includes, but may not be confined to: a device recall; the issue of a FIELD
SAFETY NOTICE; additional surveillance/modification of devices in use; modification to
future device design, components or manufacturing process; modification to labelling or
instructions for use.

3 SCOPE
These guidelines describe the requirements of the Medical Device Vigilance System as it
applies to or involves:






MANUFACTURERs2
National Competent Authorities (NCA)
the European Commission
Notified Bodies
USERs and others concerned with the continuing safety of MEDICAL DEVICEs

These guidelines cover the actions to be taken once the MANUFACTURER or National
Competent Authority receives information concerning an INCIDENT involving a MEDICAL
DEVICE. Information on INCIDENTs which should be reported under the Medical Device
Vigilance System may come to the attention of MANUFACTURERs via the systematic
procedure to review experience gained from devices in the post-production phase, or by
other means (see annexes II, IV, V, VI, VII of MDD and annexes III, IV, VI and VII of IVDD).
The term "post-marketing surveillance" as referred to in Annexes 2, 4, 5 in AIMD has the
same meaning as the aforementioned "systematic procedure".
These guidelines cover Article 8 (AIMD), Article 10 (MDD) and Article 11 (IVDD) outlining the
obligations of Member States upon the receipt of INCIDENT reports, from
MANUFACTURERs or other sources, concerning any MEDICAL DEVICE. They also include
guidance to National Competent Authorities about the issue and receipt of information from
National Competent Authorities outside Europe who are involved in the GHTF National
Competent Authority Report (NCAR) exchange programme.
These guidelines are relevant to INCIDENTs occurring within the Member States of the
European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland and Turkey with regard to:


a) devices which carry the CE-mark



b) devices that do not carry the CE-mark but fall under the directives scope (e.g. custom
made devices)



c) devices that do not carry the CE mark because they were placed on the market before
the entry into force of the medical devices directives.

2

including their Authorised Representatives and persons responsible for placing on the
market, see section 4 on definitions.
5

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance



d) devices that do not carry the CE-mark but where such INCIDENTs lead to
CORRECTIVE ACTION(s) relevant to the devices mentioned in a), b) and c).

These guidelines cover FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION relevant to CE-marked
devices which are offered for sale or are in use within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey.
These guidelines make no recommendations on the structure of the systems by which
MANUFACTURERs gather information concerning the use of devices in the post-production
phase, of which the Medical Device Vigilance System is an integral part. Such
recommendations are outside the scope of this document.

3.1

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

3.1.1










FOR MANUFACTURERS

The MANUFACTURER or his AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE shall notify the
relevant National Competent Authority about INCIDENTs and FIELD SAFETY
CORRECTIVE ACTIONs when the reporting criteria are met (see section 5.1 and 5.4).
The MANUFACTURER has the responsibility for investigating INCIDENTs and for taking
any CORRECTIVE ACTION necessary (see section 5.2 and 5.3).
The MANUFACTURER should ensure that these guidelines are made known to their
AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVEs within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey, persons
responsible for placing devices on the market and any other agents authorised to act on
their behalf for purposes related to medical devices vigilance, so that the
MANUFACTURERs' responsibilities may be fulfilled.
The MANUFACTURER should ensure that their AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE
within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey, persons responsible for placing devices on the
market and any other agents authorised to act on their behalf for purposes relating to
medical devices vigilance, are kept informed of INCIDENT reports as appropriate.
Where an INCIDENT occurs as a consequence of the combined use of two or more
separate devices (and/or accessories) made by different MANUFACTURERs, each
MANUFACTURER should submit a report to the relevant National Competent Authority
(see section 5.1)
MANUFACTURERs must keep the Notified Body advised of issues occurring in the post
production phase affecting the certification (see the relevant annexes of the relevant
directives and section 7 of this document). This would include relevant changes derived
from the vigilance system.

The act of reporting an INCIDENT to a National Competent Authority is not to be construed
as an admission of liability for the INCIDENT and its consequences. Written reports may
carry a disclaimer to this effect.
When placing on the market of a particular model of MEDICAL DEVICE ceases, the
MANUFACTURER’s vigilance reporting obligations under the Medical Device Directives
remain. However, a MANUFACTURERs legal trading arrangements change with mergers
and acquisitions etc. Where the vigilance and other post market surveillance obligations are
being transferred to another legal entity it is important that post market surveillance activities
continue and that Competent Authorities are appraised of the implications and provided with
new contact details as soon as possible, so that any detrimental effects on the functioning of
the vigilance system are minimised.
For a complete description of the MANUFACTURER’s role in the Medical Device Vigilance
System, see section 5 of these guidelines.

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

3.1.2

FOR MANUFACTURERS OF DEVICES THAT ARE NOT INTENDED TO
ACT DIRECTLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL

Vigilance reporting may be more difficult for medical devices which do not generally come
into contact with patients. For example, for the majority of diagnostic devices, IVDs and
IVF/ART medical devices, due to their intended use, it can be difficult to demonstrate direct
HARM to patients, unless the device itself causes deterioration in state of health. HARM to
patients is more likely to be indirect - a result of action taken or not taken on the basis of an
incorrect result obtained with an IVD, a diagnostic device or as a consequence of the
treatment of cells (e.g. gametes and embryos in the case of IVF/ART devices) or organs
outside of the human body that will later be transferred to a patient. Software qualified as
medical devices may also lead to indirect HARM (incorrect information generated by
software).
Any event which meets all three basic reporting criteria A – C listed under section 5.1.1 is
considered an INCIDENT and must be reported to the relevant National Competent
Authority. Where the manufacturer of an IVD, IVF/ART or diagnostic medical device identifies
such an event that has or could result in INDIRECT HARM (as defined in section 4.11) and
that led or might have led to death or serious deterioration in state of health, they should
submit a Manufacturer’s INCIDENT Report (in accordance with section 5.1.6) to the relevant
Competent Authority.
Any action taken by the manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the
state of health associated with the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE that is already placed on the
market should be reported through a Field Safety Corrective Action Report (as defined in
section 5.4.4). Such actions, whether associated with direct or indirect harm, should be
reported.
It may be difficult to determine if a serious deterioration in the state of a patient’s health was
or could be the consequence of an erroneous result obtained with an IVD or a diagnostic
device, the consequence of an inappropriate treatment of reproductive cells with an IVF/ART
device or the consequence of an error by the USER or third party. In cases of doubt a report
should be submitted (see section 5.1).
In the case of potential errors by USERs or third parties, labelling and instructions for use
should be carefully reviewed for any possible inadequacy. This is particularly true for devices
used for self-testing where a medical decision may be made by the patient. Inadequacies in
the information supplied by the MANUFACTURER that led or could have led to HARM to
USERs, patients or third parties should be reported.
In particular, it can be extremely difficult to judge events in which no HARM was caused, but
where HARM could result if the event was to occur again elsewhere.

3.1.3

FOR NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES

For the purposes of Medical Devices Vigilance System, Member States are represented by
appointed National Competent Authorities, their vigilance contact points being listed on the
European Commission web site:
http://ec.europa.eu/health/medical-devices/links/vigilance_contact_points_en.htm

7

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance



The National Competent Authority monitors the investigation of the INCIDENT carried out
by the MANUFACTURER.
The National Competent Authority should take any further action that may be necessary
to supplement the actions of the MANUFACTURER.
Depending on the outcome to the investigation, any information necessary for the
prevention of further INCIDENTs (or the limitation of their consequences) should be
disseminated by the National Competent Authority.
Member States should ensure that organisations and individuals involved in purchasing
MEDICAL DEVICEs and in the provision of health-care are aware that their co-operation
is vital in providing the first link in the vigilance chain. In order to enhance the efficiency of
the Medical Device Vigilance System, National Competent Authorities should encourage
the reporting of INCIDENTs by the USER and other professionals involved in the
distribution, the delivery or putting in to service of the device. This includes organisations
and individuals responsible for providing calibration and maintenance for MEDICAL
DEVICEs. Such reports may be made directly to the MANUFACTURER or to the National
Competent Authority as well depending on national practice.





Information held by National Competent Authorities in connection with the Medical Device
Vigilance System is to be held in confidence, as defined by the relevant articles of the
directives3. However, any INCIDENT report should be available on request, and in
confidence, to the other European Competent Authorities and to other National Competent
Authorities participating in the GHTF exchange programme.
For a complete description of the National Competent Authority’s role in the Medical Device
Vigilance System, see section 6 of this guideline.

3.1.4


FOR USERS

USERs should report INCIDENTs with MEDICAL DEVICEs to the MANUFACTURER or
to the National Competent Authority depending on national practice.
Once corrective (or other) action is identified, hospital administrators, medical
practitioners and other health-care professionals, and USER representatives responsible
for the maintenance and the safety of MEDICAL DEVICEs, can take the necessary steps.
Such steps should, where practicable, be taken in co-operation with the
MANUFACTURER.



For a complete description of the USER’s role in the Medical Device Vigilance System, see
section 9 of this guideline.

4 DEFINITIONS
4.1

ABNORMAL USE

Act or omission of an act by the OPERATOR or USER of a MEDICAL DEVICE as a result of
conduct which is beyond any means of risk control by the MANUFACTURER.
Reference: EN IEC 60601-1-6

4.2

3

AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE

AIMD 15, MDD 20 and IVDD 20
8

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Any natural or legal person established in the Community who, explicitly designated by the
MANUFACTURER, acts and may be addressed by authorities and bodies in the Community
instead of the MANUFACTURER with regard to the latter’s obligations under the directive.

4.3

CORRECTIVE ACTION

Action to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or other undesirable situation.
NOTE1: There can be more than one cause for non-conformity.
NOTE 2: Corrective action is taken to prevent recurrence whereas preventive action is taken
to prevent occurrence.
Reference: EN ISO 9000:2000, 3.6.5

4.4

DRUG / DEVICE COMBINATION PRODUCT

A MEDICAL DEVICE incorporating a medicinal product or substance where the action of the
medicinal product or substance is ancillary to that of the device. In this case, the lead
directive are the Medical Devices Directives (AIMD, MDD).

4.5

EUDAMED

The European database for MEDICAL DEVICEs EUDAMED is to centralise:
 data relating to registration of MANUFACTURERS and MEDICAL DEVICES placed on
the Community market,
 data relating to certificates issued, modified, supplemented, suspended,,withdrawn or
refused,
 data obtained in accordance with the vigilance procedure,
 data concerning clinical investigations.
Reference: Article 14a of MDD and article 10 of IVDD.

4.6

FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION (FSCA)

A FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION is an action taken by a MANUFACTURER to
reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of
a MEDICAL DEVICE that is already placed on the market. Such actions, whether associated
with direct or indirect harm, should be reported and should be notified via a FIELD SAFETY
NOTICE.
NOTE 1:
The FSCA may include
-

the return of a MEDICAL DEVICE to the supplier;
device modification;
device exchange;
device destruction;
retrofit by purchaser of MANUFACTURER's modification or design change;
advice given by MANUFACTURER regarding the use of the device and/or the follow
up of patients, users or others (e.g. where the device is no longer on the market or
9

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

has been withdrawn but could still possibly be in use e.g. implants or change in
analytical sensitivity or specificity for diagnostic devices).
NOTE 2
A MANUFACTURER can as part of ongoing quality assurance or an investigation at the
manufacturing site identify a failure of a device to perform according to the characteristics
specified in the information for use provided by the MANUFACTURER. If the failure might
lead to or might have led to death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated
with the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE and has an impact on a product that has already been
placed on the market the MANUFACTURER must initiate a FSCA.
Examples of failure modes may include software anomalies (e.g. incorrect correlation
between patient sample and the obtained result), invalid controls, invalid calibrations or
reagent failures (e.g. contamination, transcription errors and reduced stability).
NOTE 3
A device modification can include:
□ permanent or temporary changes to the labelling or instructions for use.
For example:
- advice relating to a change in the way the device is used e.g. MANUFACTURER
advises revised quality control procedure such as use of third party controls or more
frequent calibration or modification of control values for the device.
- changes to storage conditions for sample to be used with an IVD
- advice issued to users relating to a change in the stated shelf life of an IVF/ART
device e.g. IVF/ART MANUFACTURER informs users of an error on the labelling of
their device which indicates a shelf life longer than the validated shelf life for the
product.
□ software upgrades following the identification of a fault in the software version already
in the field. (This should be reported regardless of whether the software update is being
implemented by customers, field service engineers or by remote access)
NOTE 4
Advice given by the manufacturer may include modification to the clinical management of
patients/samples to address a risk of death or serious deterioration in state of health related
specifically to the characteristics of the device.
For example:
- for implantable devices it is often clinically unjustifiable to explant the device.
Corrective action taking the form of special patient follow-up, irrespective of whether
any affected un-implanted devices remain available for return, constitutes FSCA.
- for diagnostic devices (e.g. IVD, imaging equipment or devices), corrective action
taking the form of the recall of patients or patient samples for retesting or the
review of previous results constitutes FSCA.
NOTE 5:
This guideline uses the definition of FSCA as synonym for recall mentioned in article 10(1),
paragraph 1b) of the MDD and Article 11 IVD Directive since there is no harmonised
definition of recall.

4.7

FIELD SAFETY NOTICE (FSN)

A communication to customers and/or USERs sent out by a MANUFACTURER or its
representative in relation to a Field Safety Corrective Action.

10

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

4.8

HARM

Physical injury or damage to the health of people, or damage to property or the environment.
Reference: ISO/IEC Guide 51:1999

4.9

IMMEDIATELY

For purposes of this guideline, IMMEDIATELY means without any delay that could not be
justified.

4.10 INCIDENT
“Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as
well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly,
might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient, or USER or of other persons or to a
serious deterioration in their state of health.”
Reference: Article 10 of the MDD
Note 1: There is a similar definition in Article 8 of the AIMD and Article 11 IVD Directive with
minor wording differences.
Note 2: A description of “serious deterioration in the state of health” is given in section 5.1.1.
(C) of this document.

4.11 INDIRECT HARM
In the majority of cases, diagnostic devices IVDs and IVF/ART medical devices will, due to
their intended use, not directly lead to physical injury or damage to health of people (HARM –
see section 4.8). These devices are more likely to lead to indirect harm rather than to direct
harm. HARM may occur as a consequence of the medical decision, action taken/not taken on
the basis of information or result(s) provided by the device or as a consequence of the
treatment of cells (e.g. gametes and embryos in the case of IVF/ART devices) or organs
outside of the human body that will later be transferred to a patient.

Examples of indirect harm include
 misdiagnosis,
 delayed diagnosis,
 delayed treatment,
 inappropriate treatment,
 absence of treatment
 transfusion of inappropriate materials.
Indirect harm may be caused by
 imprecise results
 inadequate quality controls
 inadequate calibration
 false positive or
 false negative results.
11

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

For self-testing devices, a medical decision may be made by the USER of the device who is
also the patient.

4.12 INTENDED PURPOSE
The use for which the device is intended according to the data supplied by the
MANUFACTURER on the labelling, in the instructions and/or in promotional materials.
Reference: Article 1.2 (h) of the IVDD and Article 1.2 (g) of the MDD

4.13 MANUFACTURER
The natural or legal person with responsibility for the design, manufacture, packaging and
labelling of a device before it is placed on the market under his own name, regardless of
whether these operations are carried out by that person himself or on his behalf by a third
party.
Reference: Article 1.2 (f) of the IVDD and Article 1.2 (f) of the MDD

4.14 MEDICAL DEVICE
For the purpose of the Medical Devices Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC and 98/79/EEC,
any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other Article, whether used alone or in
combination, including the software necessary for its proper application intended by the
MANUFACTURER to be used for human beings for the purpose of:
-

diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease,
diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or
handicap,
investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a
physiological process,
control of conception,

and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by
pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its
function by such means.

4.15 OPERATOR
Person handling equipment.

4.16 PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING
PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING is an alternative reporting regime that is agreed
between the MANUFACTURER and the National Competent Authority for reporting similar
INCIDENTs with the same device or device type in a consolidated way where the root cause
is known or an FSCA has been implemented..

12

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

4.17 SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT
Any event type which results in imminent risk of death, serious deterioration in state of
health, or serious illness that requires prompt remedial action.
This would include:
 events that are of significant and unexpected nature such that they become alarming
as a potential public health hazard, e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD). These concerns may be identified by either the
National Competent Authority or the MANUFACTURER.
 the possibility of multiple deaths occurring at short intervals.
Reference: GHTF SG2 N54

4.18 TREND REPORTING
A reporting type used by the MANUFACTURER when a significant increase in events not
normally considered to be INCIDENTs according to section 5.1.3. occurred and for which
pre-defined trigger levels are used to determine the threshold for reporting.
NOTE: Appendix C of GHTF SG2 document N54 '" Global Guidance for Adverse Event
Reporting for Medical Devices" provides useful guidance.

4.19 UNANTICIPATED
A deterioration in state of health is considered UNANTICIPATED if the condition leading to
the event was not considered in a risk analysis.
NOTE: Documented evidence in the design file is needed that such analysis was used to
reduce the risk to an acceptable level, or that this risk is well known by the intended USER.

4.20 USE ERROR
Act or omission of an act, that has a different result to that intended by the
MANUFACTURER or expected by the OPERATOR of the MEDICAL DEVICE.

4.21 USER
The health care institution, professional, carer or patient using or maintaining MEDICAL
DEVICES.

5 MANUFACTURERS´ ROLE
5.1

INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM

The MANUFACTURER or their AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE must submit an initial
INCIDENT report to the National Competent Authority for recording and evaluation. Each
initial report must lead to a final report unless the initial and the final report are combined into
one report. But not every INCIDENT report will lead to a corrective action.
13

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

As a general principle, there should be a pre-disposition to report rather than not to report in
case of doubt on the reportability of an INCIDENT.
Reference to the following considerations may be made in the report, or should be kept on
file by the MANUFACTURER in the case of a decision not to report.
INCIDENTs which occurred outside the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey do not lead to a
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION relevant to these geographic areas do not need to
be reported. Incidents which occurred outside the EEA , Switzerland and Turkey led to a
FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION relevant to the above-mentioned geographical
areas must be reported as a FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION.
Where
appropriate,
MANUFACTURERs
should
notify
their
AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE, persons responsible for placing devices on the market and any other
agents (e.g. distributors) authorised to act on their behalf of INCIDENTs and FSCA reported
under the Medical Device Vigilance System.
If the MANUFACTURER is located outside the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey, a suitable
contact point within should be provided. This may be the MANUFACTURER's AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE, persons responsible for placing devices on the market or any other
agent authorised to act on their behalf for purposes relating to Medical Devices Vigilance.
Any report should not be unduly delayed because of incomplete information.

5.1.1 CRITERIA FOR INCIDENTs TO BE REPORTED BY MANUFACTURERS TO
COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
Any event which meets all three basic reporting criteria A – C listed below is considered as
an INCIDENT and must be reported to the relevant National Competent Authority. The
criteria are that:
A: An event has occurred
This also includes situations where testing performed on the device, examination of the
information supplied with the device or any scientific information indicates some factor that
could lead or has led to an event.
Typical events include, but are not limited to:
a) A malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance.
A malfunction or deterioration should be understood as a failure of a device to perform in
accordance with its INTENDED PURPOSE when used in accordance with the
MANUFACTURER’s instructions.
b) For IVDs where there is a risk that an erroneous result would either (1) lead to a patient
management decision resulting in an imminent life-threatening situation to the individual
being tested, or to the individual’s offspring, or (2) cause death or severe disability to the
individual or fetus being tested, or to the individual’s offspring, all false positive or false
negative test results shall be considered as events.
For all other IVDs, false positive or false negative results falling outside the declared
performance of the test shall be considered as events.
14

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

c) Unanticipated adverse reaction or unanticipated side effect
d) Interactions with other substances or products
e) Degradation/destruction of the device (e.g. fire)
f) Inappropriate therapy
g) An inaccuracy in the labelling, instructions for use and/or promotional materials.
Inaccuracies include omissions and deficiencies. Omissions do not include the absence of
information that should generally be known by the intended USERs.
NOTE: see ISO TS 19218 adverse event type and cause/effect coding for further details on
events.
B: The MANUFACTURER’s device is suspected to be a contributory cause of the
INCIDENT
In assessing the link between the device and the INCIDENT the MANUFACTURER should
take account of:





the opinion, based on available evidence, of healthcare professionals;
the results of the MANUFACTURER's own preliminary assessment of the INCIDENT;
evidence of previous, similar INCIDENTs;
other evidence held by the MANUFACTURER.

This judgement may be difficult when there are multiple devices and drugs involved. In
complex situations, it should be assumed that the device may have caused or contributed to
the INCIDENT and the MANUFACTURERs should err on the side of caution.
C: The event led, or might have led, to one of the following outcomes:



death of a patient, USER or other person
serious deterioration in state of health of a patient, USER or other person.

A serious deterioration in state of health can include (non exhaustive list):
a) life-threatening illness,
b) permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure,
c) a condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b).
Examples: - clinically relevant increase in the duration of a surgical procedure,
- a condition that requires hospitalisation or significant prolongation of
existing hospitalisation.
d) any indirect harm (see definition under section 4.11) as a consequence of an
incorrect diagnostic or IVD test result or as a consequence of the use of an IVF/ART
device when used within MANUFACTURER´s instructions for use (use errors
reportable under section 5.1.5.1 must also be considered).
e) foetal distress, foetal death or any congenital abnormality or birth defects.

NOTE :
Not all INCIDENTs lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The non-occurrence of
such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of
healthcare personnel.
15

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

It is sufficient that:



an INCIDENT associated with a device happened, and
the INCIDENT was such that, if it occurred again, it might lead to death or
serious deterioration in health.

Examples of reportable INCIDENTs are given in Annex 1.

5.1.2

CONDITIONS FOR PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING UNDER THE
MEDICAL DEVICE VIGILANCE SYSTEM

There are a number of occasions when a National Competent Authority may accept from a
MANUFACTURER or AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE periodic summary or trend
reports, after one or more initial reports have been issued and evaluated by the manufacturer
and the National Competent Authority. This should be agreed between MANUFACTURERs
and individual National Competent Authorities and submitted in an agreed format and
frequency for certain types of device and INCIDENT.
When a MANUFACTURER has received the agreement of a National Competent Authority to
switch to periodic summary reporting or trend reports, he shall inform the other concerned
CAs of the agreement and of its modalities. Periodic summary reporting can only be
extended to other competent authorities upon agreement of the individual national competent
authority.
A form for Periodic Summary Reporting is provided in Annex 6 .

5.1.2.1 INCIDENTS DESCRIBED IN A FIELD SAFETY NOTICE
INCIDENTs specified in the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE that occur after the MANUFACTURER
has issued a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE and conducted a field safety corrective action need
not be reported individually. Instead, the MANUFACTURER can agree with the coordinating
National Competent Authority on the frequency and content of the Periodic Summary Report.
The Periodic Summary Report must be sent to all affected National Competent Authorities
and the coordinating National Competent Authority.
Example:
A MANUFACTURER issued a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE and conducted a FIELD SAFETY
CORRECTIVE ACTION of a coronary stent that migrated due to inadequate inflation of an
attached balloon mechanism. Subsequent examples of stent migration were summarised in
quarterly reports concerning the FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION and individual
INCIDENTs did not have to be reported.

5.1.2.2 COMMON AND WELL-DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS
Common and well-documented INCIDENTs (identified as such in the risk analysis of the
device and which have already led to incident reports assessed by the MANUFACTURER
and the relevant National Competent Authority) may be exempted from reporting individually
by the National Competent Authority and changed to PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING.
However, these INCIDENTs shall be monitored and trigger levels determined. Trigger levels
for interim reporting should also be agreed with the relevant National Competent Authority.
An interim report should be made whenever trigger levels are exceeded.

16

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Periodic summary reporting can only be extended to other competent authorities when it has
the agreement of individual national CA's.

5.1.3

CONDITIONS WHERE REPORTING UNDER THE MEDICAL DEVICE
VIGILANCE SYSTEM IS NOT USUALLY REQUIRED

5.1.3.1 DEFICIENCY OF A DEVICE FOUND BY THE USER PRIOR TO ITS USE
Regardless of the existence of provisions in the instructions for use provided by the
MANUFACTURER, deficiencies of devices that are always detected (that could not go
undetected) by the USER prior to its use do not need to be reported under the vigilance
system.
This is without prejudice to the fact that the user should inform the MANUFACTURER of any
deficiency identified prior to the use of a MEDICAL DEVICE.
Examples:


The packaging of a sterile single use device is labelled with the caution 'do not
use if the packaging is opened or damaged'. Prior to use, obvious damage to
the packaging was observed, and the device was not used.



Intravenous administration set tip protector has fallen off the set during
distribution resulting in a non-sterile fluid pathway. The intravenous
administration set was not used.



A vaginal speculum has multiple fractures. Upon activating the handle, the
device fell apart. The device was not used.



In an IVD testing kit a bottle labelled lyophilised is found to be fluid, this is
discovered by the USER prior to use.

5.1.3.2 EVENT CAUSED BY PATIENT CONDITIONS
When the MANUFACTURER has information that the root cause of the event is due to
patient condition, the event does not need to be reported. These conditions could be preexisting or occurring during device use.
To justify no report, the MANUFACTURER should have information available to conclude
that the device performed as intended and did not cause or contribute to death or serious
deterioration in state of health. A person qualified to make a medical judgement would accept
the same conclusion. It is recommended that the MANUFACTURER involves a clinician in
making the decision.
Examples:


Early revision of an orthopedic implant due to loosening caused by the patient
developing osteolysis, which is not considered a direct consequence of the
implant failure. This conclusion would need to be supported by the opinion of a
medical expert.



A patient died after dialysis treatment. The patient had end-stage-renal disease
and died of renal failure, the MANUFACTURER’s investigations revealed the
device to be functioning as claimed and the INCIDENT was not attributed to the
device.
17

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

5.1.3.3 SERVICE LIFE OR SHELF-LIFE OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE EXCEEDED
When the only cause for the event was that the device exceeded its service life or shelf-life
as specified by the MANUFACTURER and the failure mode is not unusual, the INCIDENT
does not need to be reported.
The service life or shelf-life must be specified by the device MANUFACTURER and included
in the master record [technical file] and, where appropriate, the instructions for use (IFU) or
labelling, respectively. Service life or shelf-life can include e.g.: the time or usage that a
device is intended to remain functional after it is manufactured, put into service, and
maintained as specified. Reporting assessment shall be based on the information in the
master record or in the IFU.
Examples:


Loss of sensing after a pacemaker has reached end of life. Elective
replacement indicator has shown up in due time according to device
specification. Surgical explantation of pacemaker required.



Insufficient contact of the defibrillator pads to the patient was observed. The
patient could not be defibrillated due to insufficient contact to the chest. The
shelf life of the pads was labelled but exceeded.



A patient is admitted to hospital with hypoglycaemia based on an incorrect
insulin dosage following a blood glucose result. The investigation found that
the test strip was used beyond the expiry date specified by the
MANUFACTURER.

5.1.3.4 PROTECTION AGAINST A FAULT FUNCTIONED CORRECTLY
Events which did not lead to serious deterioration in state of health or death, because a
design feature protected against a fault becoming a hazard (in accordance with relevant
standards or documented design inputs), do not need to be reported. As a precondition,
there must be no danger for the patient to justify not reporting. If an alarm system is used,
the concept of this system should be generally acknowledged for that type of product.
Examples:
 An infusion pump stops, due to a malfunction, but gives an appropriate alarm
(e.g. in compliance with relevant standards) and there was no injury to the
patient.
 Microprocessor-controlled radiant warmers malfunction and provide an audible
appropriate alarm. (e.g., in compliance with relevant standards) and there was
no deterioration in state of health of the patient.
 During radiation treatment, the automatic exposure control is engaged.

Treatment stops. Although patient receives less than optimal dose, patient is
not exposed to excess radiation.
 A laboratory analyser stops during analysis due to a malfunction of the sample
pipetting module, but the appropriate error message was provided for the
USER. An intervention by the user or an immediate remote intervention by the
18

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

manufacturer allowed the analyser to resume the analysis, resulting in correct
results.

5.1.3.5 EXPECTED AND FORESEEABLE SIDE EFFECTS
Expected and foreseeable side effects which meet all the following criteria:





clearly identified in the MANUFACTURER's labelling;
clinically well known* as being foreseeable and having a certain qualitative** and
quantitative predictability when the device is used and performs as intended;
documented in the device master record, with an appropriate risk assessment, prior
to the occurrence of the INCIDENT and
clinically acceptable in terms of the individual patient benefit

are ordinarily not reportable.
It is recommended that the MANUFACTURER involves a clinician in making this decision.
If the MANUFACTURER detects a change in the risk-benefit-ratio (e.g. an increase of
frequency and/or severity) based on reports of expected and foreseeable side effects that led
or might lead to death or serious deterioration of state of health, this must be considered as a
deterioration in the characteristics of the performance of the device. A trend report must be
submitted to the NCA where the MANUFACTURER or its AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE has his registered place of business.
Rationale: At the moment side effects are not covered by the INCIDENT definition in
the directive unless the change in the risk-benefit-ratio is considered as a
deterioration in the performance of the device.
NOTES:
* Some of these events are well known in the medical, scientific, or technology field; others
may have been clearly identified during clinical investigation or clinical practice and labelled
by the MANUFACTURER.
** The conditions that lead to the side effect can be described but they may sometimes be
difficult to predict numerically.
Conversely, side effects which were not documented and foreseeable, or which were not
clinically acceptable in terms of individual patient benefit should continue to be reported.
Examples:


A patient who is known to suffer from claustrophobia experiences severe
anxiety in the confined space of a MRI machine which subsequently led to the
patient being injured. Potential for claustrophobia is known and documented in
the device product information.



A patient receives a second-degree burn during the use in an emergency of an
external defibrillator. Risk assessment documents that such a burn has been
accepted in view of potential patient benefit and is warned in the instructions
for use. The frequency of burns is occurring within range specified in the
device master record.

19

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance



A patient has an undesirable tissue reaction (e.g. nickel allergy) previously
known and documented in the device product information.



Patient who has a mechanical heart valve developed endocarditis ten years
after implantation and then died. Risk assessment documents that endocarditis
at this stage is clinically acceptable in view of patient benefit and the
instructions for use warn of this potential side effect.

 Placement of central line catheter results in anxiety reaction and shortness of
breath. Both reactions are known and labelled side effects.

5.1.3.6 NEGLIGIBLE LIKELIHOOD OF OCCURRENCE OF DEATH OR SERIOUS
DETERIORATION IN STATE OF HEALTH
INCIDENTs where the risk of a death or serious deterioration in state of health has been
quantified and found to be negligibly small need not be reported if no death or serious
deterioration in state of health occurred and the risk has been characterised and documented
as acceptable within a full risk assessment.
If an INCIDENT resulting in death or serious deterioration in state of health has happened,
the INCIDENT is reportable and a reassessment of the risk is necessary. If reassessment
determines that the risk remains negligible small previous INCIDENTs of the same type do
not need to be reported retrospectively. Decisions not to report subsequent failures of the
same type must be documented. Changes in the trend, usually an increase, of these nonserious outcomes must be reported.
Example:
 MANUFACTURER of a pacemaker released on the market identified a

software bug and quantified the probability of occurrence of a serious
deterioration in state of health with a particular setting to be negligible. No
patients experienced adverse health effects.

5.1.4 TREND REPORTS
On identifying a significant increase or trend of events or INCIDENTs that are usually
excluded from individual reporting as per chapter 5.1.3 a report should be made to the
relevant National Competent Authority. To enable this, the MANUFACTURER should have
suitable systems in place for proactive scrutiny of trends in complaints and INCIDENTs
occurring with their devices.
A trend report to the National Competent Authority where the MANUFACTURER or its
AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE has its registered place of business should be made
where there is a significant increase in the rate of:




already reportable INCIDENTs
INCIDENTs that are usually exempt from reporting
events that are usually not reportable

irrespective of whether PERIODIC SUMMARY REPORTING has been agreed.
A form for Trend Reporting is provided in Annex 7 .
20

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

5.1.5 REPORTING OF USE ERROR AND ABNORMAL USE
As with all reported device complaints, all potential USE ERROR events, and potential
ABNORMAL USE events dealt with in paragraph 5.1.5.3, should be evaluated by the
MANUFACTURER. The evaluation is governed by risk management, usability engineering,
design validation, and corrective and preventive action processes.
Results should be available, upon request, to regulatory authorities and conformity
assessment bodies.

5.1.5.1 REPORTABLE USE ERRORS
USE ERROR related to MEDICAL DEVICEs, which did result in death or serious
deterioration in state of health or SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT, should be reported
by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority.
USE ERRORs become reportable by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent
Authority when a MANUFACTURER:
- notes a significant change in trend (usually an increase in frequency), or a significant
change in pattern (see appendix C of GHTF SG2 N54) of an issue that can potentially
lead to death or serious deterioration in state of health or public health threat)
- or initiates a FSCA to prevent death or serious deterioration in state of health or
SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT

5.1.5.2 USE ERROR WHERE REPORTING UNDER THE MEDICAL DEVICE
VIGILANCE SYSTEM IS NOT USUALLY REQUIRED.
USE ERROR related to MEDICAL DEVICEs, which did not result in death or serious
deterioration in state of health or SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT, need not be
reported by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority. Such events should
be handled within the MANUFACTURER’s quality and risk management system. A decision
to not report must be justified and documented.

5.1.5.3 CONSIDERATION FOR HANDLING ABNORMAL USE
ABNORMAL USE needs not be reported by the MANUFACTURER to the National
Competent Authority under the reporting procedures. ABNORMAL USE should be handled
by the health care facility and appropriate regulatory authorities under specific appropriate
schemes not covered by this document.
If MANUFACTURERs become aware of instances of ABNORMAL USE, they may bring this
to the attention of other appropriate organisations and healthcare facility personnel.

5.1.6

DETAILS TO BE INCLUDED IN MANUFACTURER REPORTS

Annex 3 comprises the essential details of an INCIDENT to be included in any report made
by a MANUFACTURER, AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE or person(s) responsible for
placing on the market on their behalf to a National Competent Authority and should be used
for Initial, Follow-up and Final Incident Reports. In the interests of efficiency, reporting by
electronic means (email, on-line database system, xml etc.) is encouraged.

21

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

If the initial report is made by oral means (e.g. telephone), it should always be followed as
soon as possible by a written report by the MANUFACTURER or the AUTHORISED
REPRESENTATIVE.
The report may also include a statement to the effect that the report is made by the
MANUFACTURER without prejudice and does not imply any admission of liability for the
INCIDENT or its consequences.

5.1.7 TIMESCALE FOR THE INITIAL REPORTING OF AN INCIDENT
Upon becoming aware that an event has occurred and that one of its devices may have
caused or contributed to that event, the MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER must
determine whether it is an INCIDENT.
The following time lines apply in a case of:
Serious public health threat: IMMEDIATELY (without any delay that could not be justified)
but not later than 2 calendar days after awareness by the MANUFACTURER of this threat.
Death or UNANTICIPATED serious deterioration in state of health: IMMEDIATELY
(without any delay that could not be justified) after the MANUFACTURER established a link
between the device and the event but not later than 10 elapsed calendar days following the
date of awareness of the event.
Others: IMMEDIATELY (without any delay that could not be justified) after the
MANUFACTURER established a link between the device and the event but not later than 30
elapsed calendar days following the date of awareness of the event.
If after becoming aware of a potentially reportable INCIDENT there is still uncertainty about
whether the event is reportable, the MANUFACTURER must submit a report within the
timeframe required for that type of INCIDENT.
All report times refer to when the National Competent Authority must first be notified. The
relevant contact points are available from the Commission’s web site.

5.1.8 TO WHOM TO REPORT
In general, the report should be made to the National Competent Authority in the country of
occurrence of the INCIDENT unless specified differently in this guideline.

5.2

HANDLING OF USER REPORTS SUBMITTED TO THE MANUFACTURER
BY A NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY

If the MANUFACTURER receives a USER report from a National Competent Authority he
shall check this report against the reporting criteria of chapter 5.1 and
-

submit an Initial INCIDENT (or Follow-up/Final) Report to the relevant National
Competent Authority, if the event fulfils the relevant reporting criteria or
if the MANUFACTURER considers the event not to fulfil the reporting criteria, provide the
National Competent Authority with a justification why this is not reportable to the National
Competent Authority with details of what use will be made of the information. (e.g. added
to complaints file).

22

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

5.3

INVESTIGATIONS

5.3.1

PRINCIPLES

The MANUFACTURER normally performs the investigation, while the National Competent
Authority monitors progress. Timeframe(s) for follow up and/or final reports should be
defined.
If the MANUFACTURER is not able to perform the investigation of an INCIDENT then he
should inform the National Competent Authority without delay.
The National Competent Authority may intervene, or initiate independent investigation if
appropriate. This should be in consultation with the MANUFACTURER where practicable.
Note: The above principles are generalised and do not take account of interventions by
judicial or other agencies.

5.3.2

ACCESS TO THE DEVICE SUSPECTED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE
INCIDENT

A MANUFACTURER may consult with the USER on a particular INCIDENT before a report
has been made to the National Competent Authority (see section 6.1). The
MANUFACTURER may also need to have access to the device suspected to have
contributed to the INCIDENT for the purpose of deciding whether the INCIDENT should be
reported to the National Competent Authority. The MANUFACTURER should in such cases
make reasonable efforts to gain access to the device and may request support from the
Competent Authorities to gain access to the device so that testing can be performed as soon
as possible. Any delay can result in loss of evidence (e.g. loss of short term memory data
stored in the device software; degradation of certain devices when exposed to blood)
rendering future analysis of the root cause impossible.
If the MANUFACTURER gains access to the device, and his initial assessment (or cleaning
or decontamination process) will involve altering the device in a way which may affect
subsequent analysis, then the MANUFACTURER should inform the National Competent
Authority before proceeding. The National Competent Authority may then consider whether
to intervene. Due to the frequency of these requests, a statement introduced in the Initial
Vigilance report should cover this requirement, e.g. “The MANUFACTURER will assume
destructive analysis can begin 10 days following issuance of this Initial INCIDENT Report,
unless the National Competent Authority contacts the MANUFACTURER within this time
frame opposing a destructive analysis of the device”.
NOTE: This section also applies to samples and any other useful information associated with
the INCIDENT.

5.4

OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION AND FOLLOW-UP

5.4.1 PRINCIPLES
The MANUFACTURER shall take the action necessary following the investigation, including
consultation with the National Competent Authority and performing any FSCA - see section
5.4.
The National Competent Authority may take any further action it deems appropriate,
consulting with the MANUFACTURER where possible - see section 6.2.3.
23

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

5.4.2

FOLLOW-UP REPORT

The MANUFACTURER shall provide a follow-up-report to the National Competent Authority
if the investigation time reaches the time line given to the National Competent Authority
within the initial report.

5.4.3

FINAL REPORT

There shall be a final report which is a written statement of the outcome of the investigation
and of any action.
Examples of actions may include:





no action;
additional surveillance of devices in use;
preventive action on future production;
FSCA.

The report is made by the MANUFACTURER to the National Competent Authority(ies) to
whom the MANUFACTURER sent the initial report.
If the National Competent Authority performs the investigation then the MANUFACTURER
shall be informed of the result.
A recommended format for the MANUFACTURER's final report is given in annex 3.

5.4.4

FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION

The Medical Device Directives require the MANUFACTURER to report to the National
Competent Authority any technical or medical reason leading to a systematic recall of
devices of the same type by the MANUFACTURER. Those reasons are any malfunction or
deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any
inadequacy in the instructions for use which might lead to or might have led to the death of a
patient or USER or to a serious deterioration in his state of health.
The term "withdrawal" used in the AIMD is interpreted in the same way. This guideline uses
the definition of a FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION as a synonym for recall or
withdrawal since there is no longer a harmonised definition of these terms.
Removals from the market for purely commercial non-safety related reasons are not
included.
In assessing the need for the FSCA the MANUFACTURER is advised to use the
methodology described in the harmonised Risk Management standard EN ISO 14971: 2000.
In case of doubt, there should be a predisposition to report and to undertake a FIELD
SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION.
FSCA taken on a basis of INCIDENTs occurred outside the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey
affecting devices covered by the MDD are included in this guideline.
FSCA should be notified to the customers via a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE.
24

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Where a Notified Body was involved in the conformity assessment procedure of the device, it
is recommended to inform them about the FIELD SAFETY CORRECTIVE ACTION.

5.4.4.1 NOTIFICATION TO NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
The MANUFACTURER should issue a notification (see below) to the Competent Authorities
of all countries affected at the same time and also to the National Competent Authority
responsible for the MANUFACTURER or AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE. Use the
format recommended in annex 4.
This notification should include all relevant documents necessary for the National Competent
Authority to monitor the FSCA, e.g.
 Relevant parts from the risk analysis
 Background information and reason for the FSCA (including description of the device
deficiency or malfunction, clarification of the potential hazard associated with the
continued use of the device and the associated risk to the patient, USER or other
person and any possible risks to patients associated with previous use of affected
devices.)
 Description and justification of the action (corrective/preventive)
 Advice on actions to be taken by the distributor and the USER (include as
appropriate:
 identifying and quarantining the device,
 method of recovery, disposal or modification of device
 recommended patient follow up, e.g implants, IVD
 a request to pass the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to all those who need
to be aware of it within the organisation and to maintain awareness
over an appropriate defined period.
 a request for the details of any affected devices that have been
transferred to other organisations, to be given to the
MANUFACTURER and for a copy of the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to
be passed on to the organisation to which the device has been
transferred.)
 Affected devices and serial / lot / batch number range
 In the case of an action concerning lots or parts of lots an explanation why the other
devices are not affected
 Identity of the MANUFACTURER/AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE.
MANUFACTURERs should also include a copy of the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to the
Competent Authorities along with the notification. This should be done before or at the same
time as FSCA is being issued.
The MANUFACTURER or other responsible on his behalf should inform the coordinating
Competent Authority once the FSCA has been completed in both, the EEA, Switzerland and
Turkey. This should include information on the effectiveness of the action per country
involved (e.g., percentage of devices recalled)
It is recommended that MANUFACTURERs should provide a draft of the Field Safety
Notification to a relevant National Competent Authority, e.g. where the MANUFACTURER or
the AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE has his registered place of business, where most of
the affected devices are on the market or any other appropriate National Competent
Authority.
Normally, the MANUFACTURER should allow a minimum of 48 hours for receipt of comment
on the Field Safety Notification unless the nature of the FSCA dictates a shorter timescale
e.g. for SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT.
25

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

It is recommended to copy the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to the Notified Body involved in the
conformity assessment procedure of that device.

5.4.4.2 CONTENT OF THE FIELD SAFETY NOTICE
Unless duly justified by the local situation, a uniform and consistent FIELD SAFETY NOTICE
should be offered by the MANUFACTURER to all affected EEA member states, Switzerland
and Turkey.
The MANUFACTURER should use a distribution means ensuring the appropriate
organisations have been informed, e.g. by confirmation of receipt.
The FIELD SAFETY NOTICE should be on a company letterhead, be written in the
language(s) accepted by the National Competent Authority(s) and include the following:
1. A clear title, with “Urgent FIELD SAFETY NOTICE” followed by the commercial name of
the affected product, an FSCA-identifier (e.g. date) and the type of action (e.g. see
chapter 4 definition of a FSCA).
2. Specific details to enable the affected product to be easily identified e.g. type of device,
model name and number, batch/lot or serial numbers of affected devices and part or
order number.
3. A factual statement explaining the reasons for the FSCA, including description of the
device deficiency or malfunction, clarification of the potential hazard associated with the
continued use of the device and the associated risk to the patient, USER or other person
and any possible risks to patients associated with previous use of affected devices.
4. Advice on actions to be taken by the USER.
Include as appropriate:
 identifying and quarantining the device,
 method of recovery, disposal or modification of device
 recommended review of patients previous results or patient follow up, e.g
implants, IVD
 timelines.
5. A request to pass the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE to all those who need to be aware of it
within the organisation and to maintain awareness over an appropriate defined period.
6. If relevant, a request for the details of any affected devices that have been transferred to
other organisations, to be given to the MANUFACTURER and for a copy of the FIELD
SAFETY NOTICE to be passed on to the organisation to which the device has been
transferred.
7. If relevant, a request that the recipient of the FIELD SAFETY NOTICE alerts other
organisations to which incorrect test results from the use of the devices have been sent.
For example failure of diagnostic tests.
8. Confirmation that the relevant National Competent Authorities have been advised of the
FSCA.
9. Any comments and descriptions that attempt to
a) serve to play down the level of risk in an inappropriate manner
b) advertise products or services
26

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

should be omitted.
10. Contact point for customers how and when to reach the designated person.
An acknowledgment form for the receiver might also be included (especially useful for
MANUFACTURER’s control purposes).

By following the recommendations above the clarity of FIELD SAFETY NOTICEs will be
improved. This will reduce the likelihood of Competent Authorities either requesting
MANUFACTURERs issue revised FIELD SAFETY NOTICEs or issuing separate National
Competent Authority communications.
A template for a FIELD SAFETY NOTICE is provided in annex 5.

6. RESPONSIBILITIES OF NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY
The National Competent Authority should send an acknowledgement of receipt of the report
to the sender.
The National Competent Authority shall evaluate the report in consultation with the
MANUFACTURER, if practicable (see section 5.2 and 5.3), advise as appropriate and
intervene if necessary.

6.1 ACTIONS ON A REPORT FROM USERS OR OTHER SYSTEMS
A report which appears to meet the criteria of section 5.1.1, received by a National
Competent Authority from a USER reporting system or other source, shall be copied by the
National Competent Authority to the MANUFACTURER without delay or translation. In doing
so, patient confidentiality should be maintained.
Once the MANUFACTURER has been so informed and has determined that the event fulfils
the three basic reporting criteria of section 5.1.1, the subsequent procedure is the same, as
far as practicable, as that described in section 5 of these guidelines.

6.2 RISK EVALUATION AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS

6.2.1 RISK EVALUATION BY THE NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY
The risk assessment of an INCIDENT or FSCA reported may include where relevant:


Acceptability of the risk, taking into account criteria such as: causality, technical/other
cause, probability of occurrence of the problem, frequency of use, detectability,
probability of occurrence of HARM, severity of HARM, INTENDED PURPOSE and
benefit of the product, requirements of harmonised European standards, the Medical
Device Directives safety principles (see annex I, clause 2 of the directives 93/42/EEC
and 98/79/EC and clauses 5 and 6 of directive 90/385/EEC), potential USER(s),
affected populations etc.



Need for (what) corrective action
27

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance



Adequacy of measures proposed or already undertaken by the MANUFACTURER

This assessment should be carried out in cooperation with the MANUFACTURER.

6.2.2 MONITORING OF MANUFACTURERS SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS
The National Competent Authority normally monitors the investigation being carried out by
the MANUFACTURER. However, the National Competent Authority may intervene at any
time. Such intervention shall be in consultation with the MANUFACTURER where
practicable.
Aspects of the MANUFACTURER's investigation which may be monitored include, for
example:





course (direction the investigation is taking);
conduct (how the investigation is being carried out);
progress (how quickly the investigation is being carried out);
outcome (whether the results of device analysis are satisfactory ).

Facts which may be needed include, for example:




the number of devices involved;
the length of time they have been on the market;
details of design changes which have been made.

Liaison may be needed with:





Notified Bodies (involved in the attestation leading to the CE marking);
USER(s);
other Competent Authorities;
other independent bodies, test houses etc.

Competent Authorities may also monitor experience with the use of devices of the same kind
(for instance, all defibrillators or all syringes), but made by different MANUFACTURERs.
They may then be able to take harmonised measures applicable to all devices of that kind.
This could include, for example, initiating USER education or suggesting re-classification.

6.2.3 NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY ACTIONS
For drug device combination products regulated under the medical device directives, the
National Competent Authority receiving the INCIDENT report should establish a link with any
other relevant National Competent Authority or the EMEA, if required.
The National Competent Authority should take coordinating action to ensure that an
investigation is carried out if several MANUFACTURERs are involved.
National Competent Authority´s actions as a result of a report of the MANUFACTURER or
AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE may include, for example:
 no further action;
 gathering more information (for example by commissioning independent reports);
 making recommendations to MANUFACTURERs (for example to improve information
provided with the device);
28

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance








keeping the Commission and other Competent Authorities informed (for example on
FSCA and other actions to be taken). The information may be in the format of a National
Competent Authority Report (see annex 8) or similar;
consulting with the relevant Notified Body on matters relating to the conformity
assessment;
consulting the Commission (for example if it is considered that re-classification of the
device is necessary);
further USER education;
further recommendations to USER(s);
any other action to supplement MANUFACTURER action.

6.3

CO-ORDINATION BETWEEN COMPETENT AUTHORITIES

6.3.1 CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A COORDINATING NATIONAL COMPETENT
AUTHORITY IS NEEDED
Competent Authorities should determine a single coordinating National Competent Authority
under the following circumstances:




INCIDENTs of similar types occurring in more than one country within the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey;
FSCA conducted in more than one country within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey,
whether or not a reportable INCIDENT has occurred.
information available on a FSCA conducted outside the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey
where there is uncertainty whether the FSCA affects the member states within the EEA,
Switzerland and Turkey or not, e.g. a Competent Authority Report issued outside EEA
Switzerland and Turkey (for example via the GHTF NCAR Exchange Program) or
information published on a CA website outside the EEA , Switzerland and Turkey.

6.3.2 DETERMINATION OF THE COORDINATING NATIONAL COMPETENT
AUTHORITY
The co-ordinating Competent Authority should be the one that is responsible for the
MANUFACTURER or his AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE, unless otherwise agreed
between Competent Authorities e.g. the National Competent Authority:



which has a particular high interest in consulting other Competent Authorities or is
already undertaking investigation on INCIDENTs and therefore initiates the coordination.
in the State where the Notified Body which made the attestation leading to CEmarking, is situated.

6.3.3 THE TASKS
AUTHORITY

OF

THE

CO-ORDINATING

NATIONAL

COMPETENT

The coordinating National Competent Authority should, where relevant:


inform the MANUFACTURER, the other affected Competent Authorities as described in
6.3.1 and the Commission about taking the lead;

29

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance










coordinate and monitor the investigation with the MANUFACTURER on behalf of other
Competent Authorities;
consult with the Notified Body which made the attestations which led to the CE marking
and coordinate with other National Competent Authorities within the EEA, Switzerland
and Turkey;
discuss with the MANUFACTURER the principles, need for and circumstances of
corrective actions to be taken within the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey ;
reach agreement, where possible, with MANUFACTURER and amongst National
Competent Authorities about implementing a uniform FSCA in all affected European
countries;
Feedback to the Competent Authorities and the Commission the conclusion from
inquiries within the EEA member states, Switzerland and Turkey e.g. with respect to
multiple INCIDENTs in different countries which do not lead to corrective actions at the
latest with the closure of the file; MANUFACTURER will be informed according to section
6.4;
Agree with the MANUFACTURER about content and periodicity of PERIODIC
SUMMARY REPORTING for INCIDENTs covered by FSCA
Distribute the closure information.

Such an arrangement would not affect the rights of an individual National Competent
Authority to perform its own monitoring or investigation, or to instigate action within its
Member State in accordance with the provisions of the relevant directives. In doing so, the
coordinating National Competent Authority and the Commission should be kept informed
about these activities.

6.3.4 SAFEGUARD CLAUSE
The application of the Medical Device Vigilance System does not affect the responsibilities of
the Member States laid down in the Safeguard Clause (Article 7 of AIMD, Article 8 of MDD
and Article 8 of IVDD).
The Safeguard Clause procedures remain applicable regardless of the Medical Devices
Vigilance System.

6.3.5 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION BETWEEN National COMPETENT
AUTHORITIES
Information shall be disseminated between National Competent Authorities and copied to the
Commission when:
A) a FSCA is performed by the MANUFACTURER;
B) a National Competent Authority requires the MANUFACTURER to perform an FSCA or
to make changes in an FSCA that the MANUFACTURER has already initiated;
C) there is a serious risk to the safety of patients or other USERs, but where no corrective
action has yet been established, although measures are under consideration;
D) the MANUFACTURER does not provide a final report in a timely manner.
This information is called National Competent Authority Report (NCAR).
National Competent Authorities should use their discretion where corrective action is taken
by a MANUFACTURER which is not considered to be essential to protect the safety of
patients or other USERs. Under these circumstances a National Competent Authority Report
may not be necessary. In cases of doubt there should be a pre-disposition on the part of
National Competent Authorities to disseminate the NCAR.
30

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

The NCAR concerning A) above should be disseminated by the National Competent
Authority responsible for the MANUFACTURER or its AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE.
The NCAR concerning B), C) and D) above should be disseminated by the National
Competent Authority requesting the FSCA or changes within the FSCA, or identifying the
serious risk and considering measures, or expecting the final report, respectively.
This NCAR should be distributed by the NCA IMMEDIATELY (without any delay that could
not be justified) but not later than 14 calendar days after being informed by the
MANUFACTURER.
The format for dissemination of information between National Competent Authorities and the
Commission is given in Annex 8 and is the GHTF SG2 N79 format with minor changes. The
MANUFACTURER's report may be circulated with the Competent Authority Report. The use
of Eudamed to exchange NCARs is mandatory.
The appropriate "reason for report" should be identified on the National Competent Authority
Report. National Competent Authorities receiving reports should pay particular attention to
the "reason for report" and any "recommendations" given by the National Competent
Authority issuing the report. A number of reports may not require any immediate further
action. Wherever possible, National Competent Authorities should direct enquiries relating to
the investigation arising from the report to the National Competent Authority providing the
notification, who will co-ordinate communication with the MANUFACTURER or Notified Body.
National Competent Authority Reports are intended for dissemination between National
Competent Authorities and the Commission only, and are not for onward distribution to
USERs or other interested parties unless otherwise subject to national provisions and
practices (Article 20 of MDD and Article 19 of IVDD).
Competent Authorities must, where appropriate, consult the MANUFACTURER when
preparing a NCAR, and must inform the MANUFACTURER when one is issued.

6.3.6 DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION OUTSIDE National COMPETENT
AUTHORITIES by a National Competent Authority
Careful consideration should be given to the mode of communication, the drafting and the
dissemination of information by the National Competent Authorities. The possible positive
and negative effects of the information to be disseminated should be considered when
drafting advisory notifications and when selecting the means and medium by which the
message is transmitted.
When the MANUFACTURER has informed one or multiple National Competent Authorities in
advance of the start of an FSCA (see section 5.4) this information should be held confidential
by the National Competent Authority until the information becomes public.
In general, preference should be given to notification communicated directly to medical
practitioner or health-care facilities concerned, over communication to the public.
In some cases dissemination of information directly to the public may be needed e.g. to
suggest that patients or USERs contact their medical practitioner for further, more specific
advice.

31

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Where appropriate, it is recommended that the communication includes a statement
indicating that medical practitioners or other health-care professionals should be consulted
and that the information is intended for medical professionals only.
Consideration should be given to the preparation of a press statement for use by all National
Competent Authorities.
The above considerations apply also to dissemination of information
MANUFACTURER in consultation with the National Competent Authorities.

by

the

Interfaces with communication media should be coordinated wherever practicable between
the MANUFACTURER and the National Competent Authorities.

6.4 COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION
The National Competent Authority shall place the MANUFACTURER's final report on file and
make any other observations necessary. The files investigation may then be endorsed as
"complete".
If a National Competent Authority itself conducts an investigation, the MANUFACTURER
(and, where appropriate, other National Competent Authorities) shall be informed of progress
and of the results.
The MANUFACTURER’s final report shall also be copied to any National Competent
Authorities who were informed by a National Competent Authority of the initial report.
The National Competent Authority should inform the MANUFACTURER when the
investigation is complete, or if no investigation by the MANUFACTURER is required by the
National Competent Authority (Note: this does not preclude the MANUFACTURER
investigating as part of their ongoing quality assurance procedures).
Records of INCIDENT reports shall be retained to enable the investigation to be reopened if
necessary, and to facilitate systems for trend analysis.

7 THE ROLE OF THE NOTIFIED BODIES
Even though the Notified Bodies do not play a key operational role in the Medical Device
Vigilance System, the overall performance of the Medical Device Vigilance System is
supported by the Notified Body activity in the following areas:





Assessment of vigilance procedures
Audit of the implementation of the vigilance procedures, and link with other systems
e.g. Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) , FSCA
Assessment of the impact of vigilance issues on the certification granted
Liaise with the National Competent Authority if required, e.g. specific
investigations/audits based on a request of the National Competent Authority

Further guidance on these areas is provided by Notified Bodies Operation Group documents
or Notified Body recommendations.

8 THE ROLE OF THE COMMISSION
32

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

The Commission shall ensure that appropriate coordination and cooperation is put into place
between the Competent Authorities of all Member States to allow the Medical Device
Vigilance System to deliver the high level of protection for the health and safety of patients
and USERs.


In order to reinforce a common understanding and a common approach towards the
identification and resolution of vigilance cases, the Commission shall:



facilitate the exchange of experience and best practices between the National
Competent Authorities of the Member States,
facilitate the transmission of relevant data through the appropriate data exchange
system,
when appropriate, in cooperation with National Competent Authorities, develop and
organise training programs.




9

USERS ROLE WITHIN THE VIGILANCE SYSTEM

There is no legal requirement within the directives obliging USERs to have an active role in
the Vigilance System. Yet for the successful operation of the vigilance system their
involvement is vital. It is through the USERs that suspected INCIDENTs are made known to
the MANUFACTURERs and it is with their close involvement and co-operation that the
implementation of FSCAs is made possible.
The involvement of USERs is promoted and encouraged through the relationship the
MANUFACTURER develops with his customer (the USER). Annex 11 details some key
areas that the MANUFACTURER should promote with the USER. These areas may also be
reinforced by separate advice from National Competent Authorities.

33

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

ANNEXES
10.1

ANNEX 1- EXAMPLES OF INCIDENTS AND FIELD SAFETY
CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WHICH THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD
REPORT

The following examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are for the guidance of the
MANUFACTURER in determining whether a report should be made to a National Competent
Authority. The examples are intended to show that there is a considerable judgmental
element in the decision on whether to report.
EXAMPLES OF REPORTABLE INCIDENTS
1. A patient dies after the use of a defibrillator and there is an indication of a problem with the
defibrillator. The INCIDENT should be reported.
2. A patient receives a burn during the use, in accordance with the MANUFACTURER's
instructions, of surgical diathermy. If the burn is significant, this should be reported as such a
serious deterioration in state of health is not normally expected. The INCIDENT should be
reported.
3. An infusion pump stops, due to a malfunction of the pump, but fails to give an appropriate
alarm; there is no patient injury. This should be reported as in a different situation it could
have caused a serious deterioration in state of health. The INCIDENT should be reported.
4. An infusion pump delivers the wrong dose because of an incompatibility between the
pump and the infusion set used. If the combination of pump and set used was in accordance
with the instructions for use for either pump or set, then the INCIDENT should be reported.
5. An aortic balloon catheter leaked because of inappropriate handling of the device in use,
causing a situation which was potentially dangerous to the patient. It is believed that the
inappropriate handling was due to inadequacies in the labelling. The INCIDENT should be
reported.
6. A catheter fractured during insertion, with no suggestion of inappropriate handling. The
fracture occurred in such a position that the broken part could easily be withdrawn. However,
this was clearly a fortunate circumstance as if the catheter had fractured in a slightly different
position then surgical intervention would have been necessary to retrieve the broken end.
The INCIDENT should be reported.
7. Glass particles are found by the user in a contact lens vial. The INCIDENT should be
reported.
8. Loss of sensing after a pacemaker has reached end of life. Elective replacement indicator
did not show up in due time, although it should have according to device specification. The
INCIDENT should be reported.
9. On an X-ray vascular system during patient examination, the C arm had uncontrolled
motion. The patient was hit by the image intensifier and his nose was broken. The system
was installed, maintained, and used according to MANUFACTURER’s instructions. This
INCIDENT should be reported.
10. The premature revision of an orthopaedic implant is required due to loosening. Although
no cause is yet determined, this INCIDENT should be reported.
34

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

11. User discovers that insufficient details are provided on cleaning methods for reusable
surgical instruments used in brain surgery, despite obvious risk of transmission of CJD. The
INCIDENT should be reported.
12. A batch of out-of-specification blood glucose test strips is released by
MANUFACTURER. A patient uses the strips according to the MANUFACTURER’s
instructions, but the readings provide incorrect values leading to incorrect insulin dosage.
This INCIDENT should be reported.
13 A customer reports a wrong assignment of analytical results to patient codes by an
automated analyzer. An evaluation could reproduce the effect and indicated that a data
mismatch could occur. Due to the data mismatch a patient may obtain a wrong diagnosis /
treatment. This INCIDENT should be reported.
14. During maintenance of a self-testing analyzer for patients it was detected that a screw
which places the heating unit of the analyzer in exact position had come loose. Due to this
fact, it may happen that the heating unit leaves its position and the measurement is
performed under non exact temperature, which would lead to wrong results. As this could
lead to wrong treatment of the patient this incident should be reported.
15. A user discovers that an IVF culture medium is contaminated resulting in degeneration of
the cells. This INCIDENT should be reported.

EXAMPLES OF REPORTABLE FSCA.
15. The MANUFACTURER of a pacemaker has identified a software bug in a pacemaker
that has been placed on the market. The initial risk assessment identified the risk of a serious
deterioration in state of health as remote. Subsequent failure results and the new risk
assessment carried out by the MANUFACTURER indicate that the likelihood of occurrence
of a serious deterioration in state of health is not remote. The FSCA should be reported.
16. Fatigue testing performed on a commercialised heart valve bio prosthesis demonstrates
premature failure, which resulted in a risk to public health. The FSCA should be reported.
17. A defect is discovered in one (hitherto unopened) sample of a batch (lot) of a contact lens
disinfecting agent that could lead to incidence of microbial keratitis in some patients. The
MANUFACTURER initiates a FSCA of this batch. This should be reported as an FSCA.
18. During stability testing of a CRP test the internal quality control found that after several
months of storage false increased values are measured with neonatal samples. This could
lead to the wrong diagnosis of the existence of an inflammatory illness and to a wrong
treatment of the patient. The MANUFACTURER issues information to the field that a reduced
onboard stability has to be taken into account. The FSCA should be reported.
19. A MANUFACTURER has noticed that starting from control lot XX a lower recovery is
obtained and re-assigns the control value. Users are informed of this new value by means of
warning stickers and a customer communication. The FSCA should be reported.
20. A MANUFACTURER of an immunohematology analyzer received complaints of an ABO
blood grouping system results being attributed to the wrong patient identification. The error
proved to be due to the analyzers software, which was subsequently updated. The FSCA
should be reported.

35

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

21. IVF/ART MANUFACTURER informs users of an error on the labelling of their device
which indicates a shelf life longer than the validated shelf life for the product. The FSCA
should be reported.

ANNEX 8 - NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY REPORT FORMAT
v.01.13

NATIONAL COMPETENT AUTHORITY REPORT
This form should be used for the exchange of medical device information
between NCAR participants only. Completed forms should not be released to
the public.
1. Is this report confidential?

Yes [ ] No [ ]

Instructions for Filling in National Competent Authority Report
The form should be completed in English
The NCAR participant filling in and sending the NCAR is responsible for the quality of the content as
well as the appropriateness of sending such a message and the scope of its distribution. Guidance on
which issues should be selected for exchange between NCAR participants is given in Section 5
above. Before releasing any information, careful note should be taken of the SG2 N8 (Guidance on
How to Handle Information Concerning Vigilance Reporting Related to Medical Devices).
58

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

This form should be completed by NCAR participants only, when exchanging safety information about
relevant measures and/or recommendations relating to the prevention of adverse incidents concerning
medical devices. This form is designed for exchanging information between NCAR participants; it
should not be passed directly on to patients, users, third persons or the public – instead, if there is a
need to communicate to this audience another form of notice should be used. It is not to be used for
advising of single incidents, unless those incidents have a clear implication for public health. In such
cases, the implied recommendation is for other NCAs to be aware and take such local actions they
find appropriate.
If the NCAR report concerns a specific manufacturer’s device, then the manufacturer or authorized
representative should be consulted about the NCARs content and distribution prior to it being sent –
preferably by providing a copy for the manufacturer or authorized representative to comment on. This
will help to ensure the accuracy of the NCAR. An appropriate time frame for receiving manufacturer’s
comments should be communicated. However, this process should not be allowed to cause
unnecessary delay. If an NCAR concerns a range of devices from different manufacturers then the
NCA should make efforts to contact and obtain comment from all relevant manufacturers or authorized
representatives known to be on their markets.
There are differing reporting obligations for various NCAR participants. In general, NCAR participants
shall send reports directly to the NCAR Secretariat for appropriate global distribution. The NCAR
secretariat will include the originator of the NCA report as confirmation of distribution.
The EEA States must exchange reports with each other in accordance with current European
Directives for medical device. They should also send the report to the NCAR Secretariat for further
distribution to all other (non EEA) NCAR participants. There are instances where reports are sent only
to EEA participants of the NCAR program. This may cause a discontinuity in the numbering of reports
received from EEA participants. When an NCAR is not to be distributed to all NCAR participants a note
of this should be made on the next NCAR that is issued by the originating NCA to all NCAR
participants (see Notes on Field 26b).
On the rare occasions-when there are time critical issues of significant public health threat or concernin addition to sending the report to the NCAR Secretariat, NCA’s may send reports directly to countries
participating in the NCAR exchange who are known to have the subject device in national distribution.
In such circumstances, the issuing NCA should ensure that the form is completed fully and contains the
correct sequential reference, preferably by contacting the NCAR Secretariat.
Field:
1-

Please be sure to check Yes or No for confidentiality. This tells the recipient NCA if the
information provided can be released publicly or must be held strictly confidential.
2Use the rules for numbering NCARs,(* use the ISO 3166 for country codes) which
incorporates a two-letter code of the issuing country to fill in this item. For example: CA-200410-19-004 is a report from Canada sent 19 October 2004 and is the 4th report for 2004. Each
NCAR should be given a new, unique NCAR number. If an NCAR relates to a previously
exchanged NCAR (i.e : is an update), the original NCAR number should be specified in field 4.
3 Insert any local reference number used by your NCA relevant to this report, here.
4If there have been previous NCARs exchanged relating to this one, regardless of source,
insert their NCA exchange numbers here.
5 Insert the manufacturer’s reference/recall number here, if applicable.
6Identify person and organization sending the NCAR. This should be the single point of contact,
previously identified to the NCAR Secretariat.
7Identify contact person for any information / technical discussion of the topic.

List all countries known to have received the device. Put considerable care and effort into
obtaining accurate information from the manufacturer for this field.
List the marketed trade name(s) in other countries, if different.
Indicate to whom the report has been sent. Care should be taken to indicate the correct
distribution for the NCAR. Confidential NCARs should only be sent via the NCAR Secretariat
to full NCAR participants not all NCAR participants. EEA European Economic Area , EC
European commission and EFTA European federation trade associates NCAR participants
should indicate direct distribution of the NCAR to EEA states, EC and EFTA NCAs in
accordance European Medical Device Directives. NCAs outside the exchange program that
are being sent the NCAR by the originating NCAR participant should also be listed.
Where NCAR report numbers are not sequential, participants should include the number of
the last report issued to all NCAR participants

ANNEX 11- GUIDANCE TO MANUFACTURERS WHEN INVOLVING
USERS IN THE VIGILANCE SYSTEM

Reporting Guidance
What: Encourage users or those given specific responsibility for reporting incidents that have
occurred with medical devices and that meet the criteria within these guidelines to report the
incidents to the Manufacturer and or to the Competent Authority in accordance with national
guidance.
When: Encourage users to report all adverse incidents as soon as possible. Serious cases
ought be reported by the fastest means possible. Initial incident reports should contain as
much relevant detail (e.g. equipment type, make and model) as is immediately available, but
reporting ought not be delayed for the sake of gathering additional information.
How: Encourage the user the use reporting forms in accordance with national guidance and
to provide contact details when reporting to the manufacturer or the Competent Authority.
What to do with the device: All items, together with relevant packaging materials, ought to
be quarantined; they ought not be repaired, or discarded. The device should be returned to
the manufacturer in accordance with their instructions unless otherwise required by national
or other legal requirements. In some member states the Competent Authority may be
required to be given opportunity then to carry out its own investigation. Medical devices
ought not to be sent to Competent Authorities unless it has been specifically requested.
Users ought to contact the manufacturer to obtain information relating to the procedure for
returning the suspect device. The device should be appropriately decontaminated, securely
packaged, and clearly labelled, including the CA or manufacturer reference number if
needed.
Further local information: Encourage reporters to cooperate with the manufacturer and the
Competent Authority by providing further information concerning incidents should they
become available e.g. relevant outcomes of internal investigations concerning the device or
patient outcomes e.g. subsequent death.

Field Safety Corrective Action Guidance
Importance of FSNs: Field Safety Notices are an important means of communicating safety
information to medical device users in all healthcare areas. Field Safety Notices may also be
used to provide updated information and request feedback.
It is therefore important that users are encouraged to develop effective closed loop systems
that ensure the dissemination of the Field Safety notices and the timely completion of the
actions outlined.
Distribution: Healthcare organisations should be encouraged to help ensure that the FSN
reaches all in the organisation that needs to be aware and/or take the recommended action.
Action: encourage users responsible for the maintenance and the safety of medical devices
to take the actions advised in the manufacturer’s field safety notice. These actions ought to
be taken in co-operation with the manufacturer where required. They may also include
associated actions recommended by the Competent Authority in connection with the FSCA,
including providing any requested feedback.

63

MEDDEV 2 12-1 rev. 8 Vigilance

Access to devices: Encourage users responsible for the maintenance and the safety of
medical devices to a) facilitate manufacturer access to the device if this is required, and b)
work with the manufacturer when needing to balance the individual risks and benefits for any
dependent patients using affected devices.
