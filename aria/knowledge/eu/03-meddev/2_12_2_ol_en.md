This document is intended to be a guide for manufacturers and Notified Bodies on
how to carry out Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) studies in order to fulfil
Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) obligations according to Section 3.1 of Annex II,
Section 3 of Annex IV, Section 3 of Annex V, Section 3.1 of Annex VI or Section 4
of Annex VII of the Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) and Section 3.1 of
Annex 2, Section 3 of Annex 4, Section 3.1 of Annex 5 of the Active Implantable
Medical Devices Directive (90/385/EEC). These Sections refer to requirements of
Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC and Annex 7 of Directive 90/385/EEC, respectively.

25
26
27

Attention is drawn to paragraph 8 of Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC which spells
out the provisions of Article 15 that are not applicable to clinical investigations
conducted using CE-marked devices within their intended use.

28
29
30
31
32

Similarly when PMCF studies are conducted using CE marked devices within their
intended use, the provisions of section 2.3.5 of Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC do
not apply. However, the provisions of Directive 93/42/EEC concerning information
and notification of incidents occurring following placing devices on the market are
fully applicable.

1. Introduction

34
35

While clinical evidence is an essential element of the premarket conformity

36

assessment process to demonstrate conformity to Essential Requirements, it is

37

important to recognise that there may be limitations to the clinical data available in

38

the pre-market phase. Such limitations may be due to the duration of pre-market

39

clinical investigations, the number of subjects and investigators involved in an

40

investigation, the relative heterogeneity of subjects and investigators and/or the

41

controlled setting of a clinical investigation versus the full range of clinical conditions

42

encountered in general medical practice.

43
44

A precondition for placing a product on the market is that conformity to the relevant

45

Essential Requirements, including a favourable benefit/risk ratio, has been

46

demonstrated. The extent of the data that can be gathered in the pre-market phase

47

does not necessarily enable the manufacturer to detect rare complications or problems

48

that only become apparent after wide-spread or long term use of the device. As part of

49

the manufacturer’s quality system, an appropriate post-market surveillance plan is key

50

to identifying and investigating residual risks associated with the use of medical

51

devices placed on the market. These residual risks should be investigated and assessed

52

in the post-market phase through systematic Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)

53

study(ies).

54
55

Clinical data obtained from post-market surveillance and during PMCF studies by the

56

manufacturer are not intended to replace the pre-market data necessary to demonstrate

57

conformity with the provisions of the legislation. However, they are critical to update

58

the clinical evaluation throughout the life-cycle of the medical device and to ensure

59

the long term safety and performance of devices after their placing on the market.

60
61

PMCF studies are one of several options available in post-market surveillance and

62

contribute to the risk management process.

2. Scope

68
69

The objective of this document is to provide guidance on the appropriate use and

70

conduct of PMCF studies to address issues linked to residual risks. The intention is

71

not to impose new regulatory requirements.

72
73

PMCF studies are an important element to be considered in PMCF or PMS plans. The

74

principles for PMCF studies set out in this guidance are not intended to replace PMCF

75

or PMS plans. They are or may be applicable to PMCF studies conducted for other

76

purposes.

77
78

This document provides guidance in relation to:

79

i)

the circumstances where a PMCF study is indicated;

80

ii)

the general principles of PMCF studies involving medical devices;

81

iii)

the use of study data (for example to update instructions for use and labelling);
and

82
83

iv)

the role of a notified body for medical devices in the assessment of PMCF plans
and of the results obtained from the plans as part of conformity assessment.

84
85
86

This document does not apply to in vitro diagnostic devices.

evaluate specified outcomes for a population defined by a particular disease,

170

condition, or exposure and that serves predetermined scientific, clinical or

171

policy purpose(s).

172
173

Note: The term “device registry” as defined in this guidance should not be

174

confused with the concept of device registration and listing. (See GHTF

175

SG1N065)

176
177

Post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study:

178

A study carried out following the CE marking of a device and intended to

179

answer specific questions relating to clinical safety or performance (i.e. residual

180

risks) of a device when used in accordance with its approved labelling.

181
182

PMCF plan:

183

The documented, proactive, organised methods and procedures set up by the

184

manufacturer to collect clinical data based on the use of a CE-marked device

185

corresponding to a particular design dossier or on the use of a group of medical

186

devices belonging to the same subcategory or generic device group as defined

187

in Directive 93/42/EEC. The objective is to confirm clinical performance and

188

safety throughout the expected lifetime of the medical device, the acceptability

189

of identified risks and to detect emerging risks on the basis of factual evidence.

5. Circumstances where a PMCF study is indicated

196
197

Following a proper premarket clinical evaluation, the decision to conduct PMCF

198

studies must be based on the identification of possible residual risks and/or unclarity

199

on long term clinical performance that may impact the benefit/risk ratio.

200
201

PMCF studies may review issues such as long-term performance and/or safety, the

202

occurrence of clinical events (e.g. delayed hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis),

203

events specific to defined patient populations, or the performance and/or safety of the

204

device in a more representative population of users and patients.

205
206
207

Circumstances that may justify PMCF studies include, for example:


innovation, e.g., where the design of the device, the materials, substances,

208

the principles of operation, the technology or the medical indications are

209

novel;

210



market clinical evaluation and re-certification has been completed;

211
212

significant changes to the products or to its intended use for which pre-



high product related risk e.g. based on design, materials, components,
invasiveness, clinical procedures;

213
214



high risk anatomical locations;

215



high risk target populations e.g. paediatrics, elderly;

216



severity of disease/treatment challenges;

217



questions of ability to generalise clinical investigation results;

218



unanswered questions of long-term safety and performance;

219



results from any previous clinical investigation, including adverse events
or from post-market surveillance activities;

220
221



identification of previously unstudied subpopulations which may show

222

different benefit/risk-ratio e.g. hip implants in different ethnic

223

populations;

224



premarket follow-up time scales and the expected life of the product;

225
226
227

continued validation in cases of discrepancy between reasonable



risks identified from the literature or other data sources for similar
marketed devices;

228



interaction with other medical products or treatments;

229
230



verification of safety and performance of device when exposed to a larger
and more varied population of clinical users;

231



emergence of new information on safety or performance;

232



where CE marking was based on equivalence.

233
234

PMCF studies may not be required when the medium/long-term safety and clinical

235

performance are already known from previous use of the device or where other

236

appropriate post-market surveillance activities would provide sufficient data to

237

address the risks.

238
239
240
241

242
243

6. Elements of a PMCF study

244
245

Post-market clinical follow-up studies are performed on a device within its intended

246

use/purpose(s) according to the instructions for use. It is important to note that PMCF

247

studies must be conducted according to applicable laws and regulations and should

248

involve an appropriate methodology and follow appropriate guidance and standards.

249
250

PMCF studies must be outlined as a well designed clinical investigation plan or study

251

plan, and, as appropriate, include:

252

 clearly stated research question(s), objective(s) and related endpoints;

253

 scientifically sound design with an appropriate rationale and statistical analysis
plan;

254
255

 a plan for conduct according to the appropriate standard(s);

256

 a plan for an analysis of the data and for drawing appropriate conclusion(s).

257
258

Objectives of PMCF studies

259

The objective(s) of the study should be stated clearly and should address the residual

260

risk(s) identified and be formulated to address one or more specific questions relating

261

to the clinical safety or clinical performance of the device. A formal hypothesis

262

should be clearly expressed.

263
264

Design of PMCF studies

265

PMCF studies should be designed to address the objective(s) of the study. The design

266

may vary based on the objective(s), study hypothesis research question and endpoints

267

and should be scientifically sound to allow for valid conclusions to be drawn.

268
269

PMCF studies can follow several methodologies, for example:

270



the extended follow-up of patients enrolled in premarket investigations;

271



a new clinical investigation;

272



a review of data derived from a device registry; or

273



a review of relevant retrospective data from patients previously exposed to

274
275

the device.

276

PMCF studies should have a plan describing the design and methodologies

277

appropriate for addressing the stated objectives. The clinical investigation plan/study

278

plan should identify and where needed justify at a minimum:

279



the study population (corresponding to the CE-mark scope);

280



inclusion/exclusion criteria;

281



rational and justification of the chosen study design including use of
controls/control groups (where relevant; randomised or not);

282
283



the selection of sites and investigators;

284



study objectives and related study endpoints and statistical considerations;

285



the number of subjects involved;

286



the duration of patient follow-up;

287



the data to be collected;

288



the analysis plan including any interim reporting where appropriate to
ensure continuous risk management based on clinical data; and

289
290



procedures/criteria for early study termination;

291



ethical considerations;

292



methods of quality control of data where appropriate.

293
294

The points above may not all apply to a retrospective data review.

295
296
297

Implementation of the PMCF study, analysis of data and conclusion(s)

298

The study should:

299
300
301
302
303
304
305
306
307

 be executed with adequate control measures to assure compliance with the
clinical investigation or study plan;
 include data analysis with conclusions drawn according to the analysis plan by
someone with appropriate expertise; and
 have a final report with conclusions relating back to original objective(s) and
hypothesis/hypotheses.

308

7. The use of study data

309
310

The data and conclusions derived from the PMCF study are used to provide clinical

311

evidence for the clinical evaluation process. This may result in the need to reassess

312

whether the device continues to comply with the Essential Requirements. Such

313

assessment may result in corrective or preventive actions, for example changes to the

314

labelling/instructions for use, changes to manufacturing processes, changes to the

315

device design, or public health notifications.

316
317

8

The role of the notified body in PMCF

318

When auditing the quality system of the manufacturer in the framework of one of the

319

conformity assessment annexes of Directive 90/385/EEC or of Directive 93/42/EEC,

320

the Notified Body (NB) shall review the appropriateness of the manufacturer’s

321

general post-market surveillance procedures and plans, including plans for PMCF, as

322

relevant.

323
324

The Notified Body shall verify that PMCF as part of the overall clinical evaluation is

325

conducted by or on behalf of the manufacturer by appropriately competent assessors

326

(as per section 10.3 of MEDDEV 2.7/1).

327
328

The NB shall verify that clinical investigations conducted as part of PMCF plans are

329

conducted in accordance with the relevant provisions of Annex X (as per Article 15.8

330

of 93/42/EEC), related guidance and relevant standards.

331
332

The NB shall as part of its assessment of a specific medical device5:


333

verify that the manufacturer has appropriately considered the need for

334

PMCF as part of post market surveillance based on the residual risks

335

including those identified from the results of the clinical evaluation and

336

from the characteristics of the medical device in accordance with section 5

337

of the guidance;


338

verify that PMCF is conducted when clinical evaluation was based
exclusively on clinical data from equivalent devices for initial conformity

339

5

in accordance with Annex II.4, Annex II.7, Annex III, Annex V.6 and Annex VI.6 of Directive
93/42/EEC and Annex II.4, Annex II.7, Annex III and Annex V.6 of Directive 90/385/EEC

340

assessment and that PMCF addresses the residual risks identified for the

341

equivalent devices;

342



assess the appropriateness of any justification presented by a manufacturer

343

for not conducting a specific PMCF plan as part of post market surveillance

344

and seek appropriate remedy where the justification is not valid;

345



assess the appropriateness of the proposed PMCF plan in demonstrating the

346

manufacturer’s stated objectives and addressing the residual risks and issues

347

of long term clinical performance and safety identified for the specific

348

device;

349



verify that data gathered by the manufacturer from PMCF, whether

350

favourable or unfavourable, is being used to actively update the clinical

351

evaluation (as well as the risk management system);

352



consider whether, based on the specific device assessment, data obtained

353

from PMCF should be transmitted to the NB between scheduled assessment

354

activities (e.g. surveillance audit, recertification assessment);

355



consider an appropriate period for certification of the product in order to set

356

a particular time point at which PMCF data will be assessed by the NB or

357

specific conditions relating to certification for subsequent follow up. (This

358

decision may be based on the residual risks, the characteristics presented in

359

section 5 and the clinical evaluation presented at the time of initial

360

assessment. Conditions the NB may consider could include the need for the

361

manufacturer to submit interim reports between certification reviews, of the

362

clinical data generated from the PMCF and post-market surveillance

363

system).
