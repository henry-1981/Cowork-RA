Introduction 
Pursuant to  
-  section 6a of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC (amended by Directive 2007/47/EC) and to  
-  section 5a of Annex 1 to Directive 90/385/EEC (amended by Directive 2007/47/EC), 
the demonstration of conformity with Essential Requirements for a medical device must include a 
clinical evaluation, which is conducted in accordance with Annex X to Directive 93/42/EEC or with 
Annex 7 to Directive 90/385/EEC. 
 
This document promotes a common approach to clinical evaluation for medical devices regulated 
by directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. It does not concern in vitro diagnostic devices. 
The depth and extent of clinical evaluations should be flexible and appropriate to the nature, 
intended purpose, and risks of the device in question. Therefore, this guidance is not intended to 
impose device-specific requirements. 
This document uses the terms "must", "shall", "have to" where these terms are used in the 
Directives. "Should" is used in other instances. 
 
 
2. 
Scope 
This guide is not legally binding; only the text of the Directives is authentic in law. It is recognised 
that under given circumstances, for example as a result of scientific developments, an alternative 
approach may be possible or appropriate to comply with the legal requirements. 
Nevertheless, due to the participation of interested parties and of experts from national Competent 
Authorities, it is anticipated that this guide will be followed within the Member States, thereby 
supporting uniform application of relevant provisions of EU Directives and common practices. 
On certain issues not addressed in the Directives, national legislation may be different from this 
guide. 
This guide is regularly updated according to regulatory developments. The latest version of the 
guide should always be used. This version is a complete revision of the previous texts. 
The medical device legislation in Europe is currently being significantly revised. A new Regulation 
of the European Parliament and of the Council on medical devices will be published, which may 
result in changes to important concepts or definitions relating to clinical evaluation. Parts or all of 
this document are likely to be revised. Some contents (such as contents about notified bodies) are 
likely to be removed and integrated in other series of documents.

6. 
General principles of clinical evaluation 
6.1. What is clinical evaluation? 
Clinical evaluation is a methodologically sound ongoing procedure to collect, appraise and analyse 
clinical data pertaining to a medical device and to analyse whether there is sufficient clinical 
evidence to confirm compliance with relevant essential requirements for safety and performance 
when using the device according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use. 
In exceptional cases where an instruction for use is not required, the collection, appraisal, and 
analysis are conducted taking into account generally recognised modalities of use.  
The requirements for clinical evaluation apply to all classes of medical devices. The evaluation 
should be appropriate to the device under evaluation, its specific properties, and its intended 
purpose. 
Benefits and risks should be specified, e.g. as to their nature, probability, extent, duration and 
frequency. Core issues are the proper determination of the benefit/risk profile in the intended target 
groups and medical indications, and demonstration of acceptability of that profile based on current 
knowledge/ the state of the art in the medical fields concerned. 
Clinical evaluation is a responsibility of the manufacturer and the clinical evaluation report is an 
element of the technical documentation of a medical device. 
 
For compliance with European medical device directives,  
• 
the clinical evaluation addresses the following Essential Requirements: 
- Annex 1 sections 1, 2, 5 of AIMDD (for active implantable medical devices), or 
- Annex I sections 1, 3, 6 of MDD (for medical devices);  
see Appendix A7 (Analysis of the clinical data - compliance to specific Essential 
Requirements);  
 
• 
the evaluation must follow defined and methodologically sound procedures as described in:  
- Annex 7 of AIMDD (for active implantable medical devices), or 
- Annex X of MDD (for medical devices);  
 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 10 of 65 
• 
where demonstration of conformity with essential requirements based on clinical data is not 
deemed appropriate, an adequate justification has to be given. The justification is included 
in the clinical evaluation report with contents according to: 
- Annex 7 section 1.5 of AIMDD (for active implantable medical devices), or 
- Annex X section 1.1d of MDD (for medical devices). 
Conformity to the Essential Requirements can only be assumed when the following items are 
aligned with each other:  
- the information materials supplied by the manufacturer (the labelling, instructions for 
use, available promotional materials, including accompanying documents foreseen by 
the manufacturer)  
- the clinical evaluation (the device description used for the clinical evaluation, other 
contents of the clinical evaluation report)  
- the available clinical data (such as results of Clinical Investigations, publications, PMS 
studies, etc.). 
 
Particularly, evaluators should address if the following points are adequately supported by 
sufficient clinical evidence: 
- the intended purpose described in the information materials supplied by the 
manufacturer (including for all medical indications); 
- the clinical performance and benefits described in the information materials supplied by 
the manufacturer (including, for example, any claims on product performance and 
safety); 
- measures for risk avoidance and risk mitigation described in the information materials 
supplied by the manufacturer (including, for example the declaration of the residual risks, 
contraindications, precautions, warnings, instructions for managing foreseeable 
unwanted situations); 
- the usability of the device for the intended users and the suitability of the information 
materials supplied by the manufacturer for the intended users (including, if applicable, 
for lay or disabled persons); 
- instructions for target population groups (including, for example, pregnant women, 
paediatric populations).  
 
6.2. When is clinical evaluation undertaken and why is it important? 
Clinical evaluation is conducted throughout the life cycle of a medical device, as an ongoing 
process.  
Usually, it is first performed during the development of a medical device in order to identify data 
that need to be generated for market access. Clinical evaluation is mandatory for initial CE-marking 
and it must be actively updated thereafter. 
Clinical evaluation is necessary and important because it ensures that the evaluation of safety and 
performance of the device is based on sufficient clinical evidence throughout the lifetime that the 
medical device is on the market. This ongoing process enables manufacturers to provide notified 
bodies and competent authorities with sufficient clinical evidence for demonstration of conformity of 
the device with the Essential Requirements throughout its lifetime (for example for CE marking, 
fulfilment of post-market surveillance and reporting requirements, or during surveillance 
procedures). 
 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 11 of 65 
6.2.1. Clinical evaluation undertaken for the development of a medical device 
Premarket research and development are guided by clinical evaluation and risk management. 
Typically, manufacturers carry out clinical evaluations to 
• 
define needs regarding clinical safety and clinical performance of the device; 
• 
in case of possible equivalence to an existing device, evaluate if there are clinical data 
available and determine equivalence; for additional information, see Appendix A1 
(Demonstration of equivalence); 
• 
carry out a gap analysis and define which data still need to be generated with the device 
under evaluation, whether clinical investigations are necessary and if so, to define the study 
design; for additional information, see Section 10 (Analysis of the clinical data) and 
Appendix A2 (When should additional clinical investigations be carried out?).  
 
As the initial clinical evaluation identifies the questions to be answered by a clinical investigation, 
the clinical evaluation process should generally commence in advance of any clinical 
investigation1. 
 
6.2.2. Clinical evaluation for initial CE-marking 
Clinical evaluation is required to be carried out for the conformity assessment process leading to 
the CE-marking and placing on the market of a medical device. The purpose is to: 
• 
document that there is sufficient clinical evidence to demonstrate conformity with the 
Essential Requirements covering clinical performance and clinical safety; 
• 
identify aspects that need to be addressed systematically during post-market surveillance 
(PMS), e.g. in post market clinical follow-up studies (PMCF Studies) required under the 
medical device directives. Typically, these aspects include estimation of residual risks and 
uncertainties or unanswered questions (such as rare complications, uncertainties regarding 
long-term performance, safety under wide-spread use). 
 
6.2.3. Updating the clinical evaluation  
a. Frequency of updates 
The manufacturer should define and justify the frequency at which the clinical evaluation needs 
to be actively updated.  
When doing so, the manufacturer should typically consider: 
• 
whether the device carries significant risks 
(e.g. based on design, materials, components, invasiveness, clinical procedures, high-risk 
anatomical locations, high-risk target populations (e.g. paediatrics, elderly), severity of 
disease/ treatment challenges). 
• 
whether the device is well established, taking into consideration: 
- innovation; 
                                                
 
1  Including for the planning of clinical investigations and production of documents described in standard EN 
ISO 14155 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 12 of 65 
- relevant changes in clinical sciences, materials sciences or other sciences related to the 
device under evaluation; 
- the current level of confidence in the evaluation of clinical performance and clinical 
safety of the device; the manufacturer should consider 
- the data available from clinical investigations, PMCF studies, registries or other 
systematic studies (including the number of devices used, if that usage was 
representative of the usage in the market, the results to date);  
- the total number of devices used so far in the market, and expected reporting rates 
under the vigilance system. 
• 
whether there are risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions, in the medium or long-
term, that would influence the frequency of updates. 
• 
design changes or changes to manufacturing procedures (if any). 
 
The clinical evaluation is actively updated:  
• 
when the manufacturer receives new information from PMS that has the potential to change 
the current evaluation;  
• 
if no such information is received, then 
- at least annually if the device carries significant risks or is not yet well established; or 
- every 2 to 5 years if the device is not expected to carry significant risks and is well 
established, a justification should be provided. 
When involvement of notified bodies is required, updates are usually coordinated with the 
notified body. Typically, they are aligned with the timetable for surveillance audits and the 
renewal of the certificates. 
 
b. General considerations on updating the clinical evaluation 
Manufacturers are required to implement and maintain a PMS system that routinely monitors 
the clinical performance and clinical safety of the device as part of their quality management 
system2. The scope and nature of such PMS should be appropriate to the device and its 
intended purpose. 
PMS regularly generates new data (e.g. safety reports, results from published literature, 
registries, PMCF studies, and other data about device usage). Those data need to be evaluated 
for information that has a potential to change the evaluation of the risk/benefit profile, and the 
clinical performance and clinical safety of the device. Those data are required to be fed into the 
clinical evaluation process in a timely manner.  
In accordance with the Directives, the clinical evaluation and the clinical evaluation report must 
be actively updated with data obtained from post-market surveillance3. 
 
When updating the clinical evaluation, the evaluators should verify:  
• 
if the benefit/risk profile, undesirable side-effects (whether previously known or newly 
emerged) and risk mitigation measures are still

- compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety and acceptable according 
to current knowledge/ the state of the art; 
- correctly addressed in the information materials supplied by the manufacturer of the 
device; 
- correctly addressed by the manufacturer's current PMS plan; 
• 
if existing claims are still justified; 
• 
if new claims the manufacturer intends to use are justified. 
 
While clinical evaluation requires data from PMS activities, it also generates new information 
that have to be fed into the PMS and risk management process. Clinical evaluation can 
therefore result in changes to the manufacturer’s risk management documents, instructions for 
use (IFU) and PMS activities. 
If the manufacturer concludes there is not sufficient clinical evidence to be able to declare 
conformity with the Essential Requirements, the manufacturer will need to : 
• 
stop placing the devices on the market until conformity is restored, and  
• 
take necessary corrective and preventive action. 
 
6.3. How is a clinical evaluation performed? 
The clinical evaluation is based on a comprehensive analysis of available pre- and post-market 
clinical data relevant to the intended purpose of the device in question, including clinical 
performance data and clinical safety data. 
There are discrete stages in performing a clinical evaluation: 
• 
Stage 0: Define the scope, plan the clinical evaluation (also referred to as scoping and the 
clinical evaluation plan). 
• 
Stage 1:  Identify pertinent data. 
• 
Stage 2:  Appraise each individual data set, in terms of its scientific validity, relevance and 
weighting. 
• 
Stage 3:  Analyse the data, whereby conclusions are reached about  
- compliance with Essential Requirements (including ER1, ER3, ER6) on performance 
and safety of the device, including its benefit/risk profile, 
- the contents of information materials supplied by the manufacturer (including the label, 
IFU of the device, available promotional materials, including accompanying documents 
possibly foreseen by the manufacturer),  
- residual risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions (including on rare 
complications, long term performance, safety under wide-spread use), whether these are 
acceptable for CE-marking, and whether they are required to be addressed during PMS.  
• 
Stage 4: Finalise the clinical evaluation report 
The clinical evaluation report summarises and draws together the evaluation of all the 
relevant clinical data documented or referenced in other parts of the technical 
documentation. The clinical evaluation report and the relevant clinical data constitute the 
clinical evidence for conformity assessment. 
 
Each of these stages is covered in separate sections later in this document (see the figure below). 
During the course of a clinical evaluation the stages are often iterative. Indeed, the appraisal and 
analysis stage may uncover new information and raise new questions, with a need to widen the 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 14 of 65 
scope of the evaluation, refine the clinical evaluation plan, and to retrieve, appraise and analyse 
additional data.  
 
 
Figure: Stages of a clinical evaluation and references to sections and appendices of this 
document. 
 
6.4. Who should perform the clinical evaluation? 
The clinical evaluation should be conducted by a suitably qualified individual or a team.  
The manufacturer should take the following aspects into consideration: 
• 
The manufacturer defines requirements for the evaluators that are in line with the nature of 
the device under evaluation and its clinical performance and risks. 
• 
The manufacturer should be able to justify the choice of the evaluators through reference to 
their qualifications and documented experience, and to present a declaration of interest for 
each evaluator. 
• 
As a general principle, the evaluators should possess knowledge of the following: 
- research methodology (including clinical investigation design and biostatistics); 


- information management (e.g. scientific background or librarianship qualification; 
experience with relevant databases such as Embase and Medline); 
- regulatory requirements; and 
- medical writing (e.g. post-graduate experience in a relevant science or in medicine; 
training and experience in medical writing, systematic review and clinical data appraisal).  
•
 
With respect to the particular device under evaluation, the evaluators should in addition 
have knowledge of: 
- the device technology and its application; 
- diagnosis and management of the conditions intended to be diagnosed or managed by 
the device, knowledge of medical alternatives, treatment standards and technology (e.g. 
specialist clinical expertise in the relevant medical specialty). 
•
 
The evaluators should have at least the following training and experience in the relevant 
field: 
- a degree from higher education in the respective field and 5 years of documented 
professional experience; or 
- 10 years of documented professional experience if a degree is not a prerequisite for a 
given task.  
 
There may be circumstances where the level of evaluator expertise may be less or different; this 
should be documented and duly justified. 
 
 
7. 
Definition of the scope of the clinical evaluation (Stage 0) 
Before a clinical evaluation is undertaken the manufacturer should define its scope, based on the 
Essential Requirements that need to be addressed from a clinical perspective and the nature and 
history of the device. This is also referred to as scoping.  
The scope serves as a basis for further steps, including the identification of pertinent data. The 
manufacturer sets up a description of the device under evaluation, and a clinical evaluation plan.  
A clinical evaluation is required to be critical
4
. Therefore, it needs to identify, appraise and analyse 
both favourable and unfavourable data. 
Depending on the stage in the lifecycle of the product, considerations for setting up a clinical 
evaluation plan should include different aspects. Typical examples are listed below.

It is important to recognise that there is considerable diversity in the types and history of 
technologies used in medical devices and the risks posed by them. Many devices are developed or 
modified by increments, so they are not completely novel. It may be possible to draw on the clinical 
experience and literature reports of the safety and performance of an equivalent device to establish 
the clinical evidence, thereby reducing the need for clinical data generated through clinical 
investigation of the device under evaluation. Similarly, it may be possible to use compliance with 
harmonised standards to satisfy the clinical evidence requirements for devices based on 
technologies with well established safety and performance characteristics. 
 
8. 
Identification of pertinent data (Stage 1) 
8.1. Data generated and held by the manufacturer 
Data generated and held by the manufacturer typically include the following items (not a complete 
list): 
•
 
All pre market clinical investigations 
•
 
All clinical data generated from risk management activities and the PMS programmes which 
the manufacturer has implemented in Europe and in other countries, including the following 
items (not a complete list): 
- PMCF studies, such as post market clinical investigations and any device registries 
sponsored by the manufacturer

- the literature search and evaluation reports for PMS 
- incident reports sent to the manufacturer (including the manufacturer’s own evaluation 
and report) 
- complaints regarding performance and safety sent to the manufacturer, including the 
manufacturer’s own evaluation and report 
- analysis of explanted devices (as far as available) 
- details of all field safety corrective actions 
- use as a custom made device 
- use under compassionate use/ humanitarian exemption programs 
- other user reports 
• 
Relevant pre-clinical studies (e.g. bench test reports including verification and validation 
data) 
 
With regard to those data: 
• 
All data generated and held by the manufacturer need to be identified. 
• 
Complete data need to be entirely disclosed and made available to the evaluators; this 
includes data from Europe and other countries; it includes clinical studies as well as use 
data. 
• 
All data sets should be documented (adequately summarised11, appraised, analysed and 
referenced) in the clinical evaluation report. 
 
8.2. Data retrieved from literature  
Literature searching is used to identify data not held by the manufacturer that are needed for the 
clinical evaluation.  
Literature searching identifies potential sources of clinical data for establishing: 
• 
Clinical data relevant to the device under evaluation, which are data that relate either to the 
device under evaluation or to the equivalent device (if equivalence is claimed). 
• 
Current knowledge/ the state of the art. 
Includes applicable standards and guidance documents, data that relate to benchmark 
devices, other devices, critical components and medical alternatives or to the specific 
medical conditions and patient populations intended to be managed with the device. The 
data are typically needed in order to 
- describe the clinical background and identify the current knowledge/ state of the art in 
the corresponding medical field,  
- identify potential clinical hazards (including hazards due to substances and technologies, 
manufacturing procedures and impurity profiles),  
- justify the validity of criteria used for the demonstration of equivalence (if equivalence is 
claimed),  
- justify the validity of surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints are used).  
 
The following aspects should be considered for literature searching: 
                                                
 
11  to the extent that it can be critically reviewed by others 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 19 of 65 
• 
The searching strategy should be thorough and objective, i.e. it should identify all relevant 
favourable and unfavourable data. 
For some devices, clinical data generated through literature searching will represent the 
greater part (if not all) of the clinical evidence. Thus, when conducting a literature review a 
comprehensive search should be conducted. If a comprehensive search is not deemed 
necessary, reasons should be documented. 
• 
Several searches with different search criteria or focus are usually necessary to obtain the 
necessary data. For additional information, see Appendix A4 (Sources of literature). 
• 
A literature search and other retrieval of data are carried out based on a search protocol. 
The search protocol documents the planning of the search before execution. For additional 
information, see Appendix A5 (Literature search and literature review protocol, key 
elements) and Appendix A6 (Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that lack 
scientific validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety). 
• 
Once the searches have been executed, the adequacy of the searches should be verified 
and a literature search report should be compiled to present details of the execution, any 
deviations from the literature search protocol, and the results of the search.  
• 
It is important that the literature search is documented to such degree that the methods can 
be appraised critically, the results can be verified, and the search reproduced if necessary. 
 
Abstracts lack sufficient detail to allow issues to be evaluated thoroughly and independently, but 
may be sufficient to allow a first evaluation of the relevance of a paper. Copies of the full text 
papers and documents should be obtained for the appraisal stage. 
The literature search protocol(s), the literature search report(s), and full text copies of relevant 
documents, become part of the clinical evidence and, in turn, the technical documentation for the 
medical device.  
 
 
9. 
Appraisal of pertinent data (Stage 2) 
9.1. General considerations 
In order to determine the value of the data identified in stage 1, the evaluators should appraise 
each individual document in terms of its contribution to the evaluation of the clinical performance 
and clinical safety of the device. 
Uncertainty arises from two sources: the methodological quality of the data, and the relevance of 
the data to the evaluation of the device in relation to the different aspects12 of its intended purpose. 
Both sources of uncertainty should be analysed to determine a weighting for each data set.  
The evaluators should therefore:  
• 
identify information contained in each document, 
• 
evaluate the methodological quality of work done by the authors and from that, the scientific 
validity of the information,  
• 
determine the relevance of the information to the clinical evaluation, and 
• 
systematically weight the contribution of each data set to the clinical evaluation. 
                                                
 
12 For example different medical indications, target populations, intended users.  


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 20 of 65 
 
9.2.  The appraisal plan 
To ensure systematic and unbiased appraisal of the data, the evaluators should set up an 
appraisal plan that describes the procedure and the criteria to be used for the appraisal. 
• 
The appraisal plan typically includes: 
- criteria for determining the methodological quality and the scientific validity of each data 
set. 
- criteria for determining the relevance to the clinical evaluation (relevance to the device 
and to the different aspects of its intended purpose). 
- criteria for weighting the contribution of each data set to the overall clinical evaluation.  
• 
The appraisal should be thorough and objective, i.e. it should identify and attribute 
adequate weighting both to favourable and unfavourable contents of each document. 
• 
The criteria adopted for the appraisal should reflect the nature, history and intended clinical 
use of the device. They should be documented and justified on the basis of current 
knowledge / the state of the art, applying accepted scientific standards.  
• 
There are many acceptable ways, both qualitative and quantitative, by which the appraisal 
can be carried out13. For many well established devices and lower-risk devices, qualitative 
data may be adequate to fulfil the requirements of the MDD and AIMDD. The evaluation 
criteria should be adjusted accordingly. 
• 
The appraisal plan should be documented in the clinical evaluation report. 
 
9.3. Conduct of the appraisal 
The evaluators should 
• 
follow the pre-defined appraisal plan strictly and apply its criteria consistently throughout the 
appraisal; 
• 
base their appraisal on the full text of publications and of other documents (not abstracts or 
summaries), so as to review all of the contents, the methodology employed, the reporting of 
results, the validity of conclusions drawn from the investigation or report, and evaluate any 
limitations and potential sources of error in the data; 
• 
document the appraisal in the clinical evaluation report to the extent that it can be critically 
reviewed by others. 
 
9.3.1. How to evaluate methodological quality and scientific validity 
The evaluators should examine the methods used to generate/ collect the data and evaluate the 
extent to which the observed effect (performance or safety outcomes) can be considered to be due 
to intervention with the device or due to 
- 
confounding influences (e.g. the natural course of the underlying medical condition / 
regression to the mean, concomitant treatments)  
                                                
 
13  For an example, refer to Appendix D of the GHTF SG5 document N2R8:2007 on Clinical Evaluation 
(Appendix D: A Possible Method of Appraisal) 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4

- 
bias 
- 
random error 
- 
inadequate disclosure of information 
- 
misinterpretation 
Some papers considered unsuitable for demonstration of adequate performance because of poor 
elements of the study design or inadequate analysis may still contain data suitable for safety 
analysis or vice versa. 
Examples of aspects that can be taken into consideration for evaluating the methodological quality 
and the scientific validity of the evidence are detailed below. 
 
a. Study design of pre-market and post-market clinical investigations  
Considerations may need to include: 
• 
adequacy of the sample size and power calculation 
• 
adequacy and relevance of endpoints (including validity of surrogate endpoints, if used) 
• 
adequacy of applied controls (including choice of the study type and of comparators, if 
applicable) 
• 
prospective randomisation of patients (in case of multiple treatment arms) 
• 
adequacy of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and of stratification of patients (e.g. in respect 
to age, medical indication, severity of the condition, gender, other prognostic factors) 
• 
distribution of prognostic factors (in case of multiple groups, were the groups comparable 
for these factors?) 
• 
blinding of patients (may include use of sham devices or sham surgery), professional users, 
outcome assessors (blinded endpoints) 
• 
adequacy of the follow-up period, including if follow-up was long enough for outcomes to 
occur, and if follow-up was frequent enough to detect temporary side effects and 
complications (such as prolonged wound healing) 
• 
reliability of the methods used for quantifying symptoms and outcomes (including validation 
of the methods) 
• 
adequate recording and reporting of serious adverse events and device deficiencies 
• 
adequate handling of medications and concomitant interventions  
• 
adequacy of procedures for retrieving complete information (e.g. procedures to be applied 
when contacts with patients are lost, disclosure of reasons for patients leaving the study, 
conduct of sensitivity analysis for determining if missing data affect conclusions)  
The evaluators should verify whether clinical investigations have been defined in such a way as 
to confirm or refute the manufacturer's claims for the device; and whether these investigations 
include an adequate number of observations to guarantee the scientific validity of the 
conclusions. 
 
b. Additional aspects for appraisal of the quality of clinical investigations generated and held by the 
manufacturer  
Where a clinical investigation has been carried out by or on behalf of a manufacturer, it is 
expected that documentation relating to the design, ethical and regulatory approvals, conduct, 
results and conclusions of the investigation needed for the clinical evaluation will be available 
for consideration, as appropriate. These may include: 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 22 of 65 
- the clinical investigation plan;  
- clinical investigation plan amendments and the rationale for these changes; 
- case report form templates, monitoring and audit records; 
- the relevant ethics committee documentation; 
- regulatory authority approvals as required by applicable regulations;  
- the signed and dated clinical investigation report (for investigations that are terminated); 
- the latest intermediate report available and the latest collation on serious adverse events 
(for investigations that are ongoing); 
- when a clinical investigation is conducted outside of the EU, an analysis whether the 
results are transferable to the European population; 
- a gap analysis, when a clinical investigation is conducted to standards different from EN 
ISO 14155; the gap analysis should contain sufficient information to be read and 
understood by an independent party. 
 
The clinical investigation plan sets out how the study was intended to be conducted. It contains 
important information about the study design such as the selection and assignment of 
participants to treatment, masking (blinding of participants and investigators) and measurement 
of responses to treatment, which may be important sources of bias that can be assessed and 
possibly discounted when trying to determine the actual performance of the device. In addition 
the clinical investigation plan sets out the intended participant follow-up, approaches to 
statistical analyses and methods for recording outcomes, which may impact on the quality, 
completeness and validity of results obtained for performance and safety outcomes. 
Also, by having the clinical investigation plan, its amendments and the clinical investigation 
report available, the evaluators will be able to assess the extent to which the investigation was 
conducted as planned and, where deviations from the original plan have occurred, the impact 
those deviations had on the veracity of the data generated and the conclusions that can be 
drawn from the investigation about the performance and safety of the device. 
The clinical investigation report should be signed by the sponsor and the coordinating or 
principal investigator to provide assurance that the report is an accurate reflection of the 
conduct and results of the clinical investigation. 
Another important consideration of the evaluation will be to assess whether the conduct of the 
investigation was in accordance with applicable regulations, and in accordance with the current 
applicable ethical standards that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical 
investigations not in compliance with applicable ethical standards, medical device standards (for 
example EN ISO 14155 or comparable standards) or regulations should not be used for 
demonstration of performance and/or safety of the device. The reasons should be noted in the 
report. 
c. Information derived from vigilance data, device registry data, case series, patient dossiers, and 
other use data 
Evaluators need to consider significant differences between sources of information in respect to:  
• 
procedures used for retrieving information about outcomes 
• 
quality aspects of registers and patient dossiers 
In case of information based on vigilance reporting, evaluators should consider that expected 
undesirable side-effects and complications of devices are not reportable under the vigilance 
reporting system. Under-reporting or lack of reporting of expected side effects or complications 
by users is common. Therefore, the vigilance system does not typically deliver adequate 
information about the true frequency of expected undesirable side-effects and complications. 
Systematic scientific data are needed for such purposes. Vigilance data, including trend 
analysis, should be used for identification of unexpected risks. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 23 of 65 
In case of information based on device registries, case series, retrospective analyses of patient 
dossiers, and other use data, the retrieval of information about outcomes may be incomplete 
and unreliable (have all the patients been considered? are the patients representative of the use 
of the device? did the register/ professional lose contact with patients if they moved on to 
different professionals? was there a passive or active follow-up of patients by the professionals 
involved? for how long?). Significant differences may exist between device registries. For 
instance, they may offer an important or limited coverage of a country. The evaluators should 
take into account the possibility of patients leaving the coverage of a registry or the follow-up of 
a professional when experiencing serious adverse outcomes. In routine practice, there are also 
significant differences in the duration of the follow-up of patients by surgeons and other 
professionals, and in the quality of patient dossiers and data retrieval.  
For clinical experience data it is important that any reports or collations of data (e.g. the 
manufacturer’s PMS reports) contain sufficient information for the evaluators to be able to 
undertake a rational and objective evaluation of the information and make a conclusion about its 
significance with respect to the performance and safety of the device in question.  
Reports of clinical experience that are not adequately supported by data, such as anecdotal 
reports or opinions, may contribute to the evaluation, e.g. for the identification of unexpected 
risks, but should not be used as proof of adequate clinical performance and clinical safety of the 
device. 
d. Data processing and statistics 
Aspects to consider may include: 
• 
suitability of methods for data processing (transforming data that are suitable for analysis), 
converting data to a consistent format, reconstructing missing statistics from other statistics, 
dealing with missing data; 
• 
exclusions from the analysis and their implications (including disclosure and adequacy of 
the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations, disclosure of results from both the 
intention-to-treat and the per-protocol populations); 
• 
adequacy of statistical methods. 
e. Quality assurance 
• 
compliance with Good clinical practice (GCP), such as EN ISO 14155 or equivalent 
standards; 
• 
compliance with the clinical investigation plan, independent monitoring and auditing; 
• 
compliance with legal requirements.  
While a publication in a renowned peer reviewed scientific journal is generally accepted as an 
indicator of scientific quality, such publication is not considered an acceptable reason for 
bypassing or reducing appraisal activities.  
f. Report quality 
Evaluators should consider: 
• 
adequacy of disclosure of methods used 
• 
adequacy of disclosure of data, including  
- completeness of the reporting of adverse events and outcomes 
- sufficient description about the distribution of prognostic factors in the study population 
and in different study arms 
- disclosure of all the results the study was originally designed to generate 
• 
validity of conclusions drawn by the authors (example: conclusions not in line with the 
results section of the document) 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 24 of 65 
 
Possible conflicts of interest of the authors of the publications should also be taken into 
consideration. 
It is recognised that, where manufacturers source clinical investigation data reported in the 
scientific literature, the documentation readily available to the manufacturer for inclusion in the 
clinical evaluation is likely to be no more than the published paper itself. In case of missing 
information, the rating of the methodological quality of a publication may need to be 
downscaled. 
 
For additional information see Appendix A6 (Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that 
lack scientific validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety).

When evaluating the relevance of collected data it is important to consider whether the data are 
intended to directly demonstrate adequate clinical performance and clinical safety of the device 
(often referred to as pivotal data), or whether the data serves an indirect supportive role.  
a. Pivotal data 
• 
Pivotal data must have the data quality necessary for demonstration of adequate clinical 
performance and clinical safety of the device under evaluation (see Appendix A6, Appraisal 
of clinical data - examples of studies that lack scientific validity for demonstration of 
adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety); 
• 
be generated either with the device under evaluation or with an equivalent device used in 
its intended purpose (for an equivalent device, equivalence must be demonstrated; see 
Appendix A1, Demonstration of equivalence).  
b. Other data 
Data that are not pivotal are generally appraised and weighted for their contribution for 
purposes such as: 
• 
identifying and defining the current knowledge/ state of the art in the corresponding medical 
field, so as to define acceptability criteria for the evaluation of the benefit/risk profile and of 
specific side-effects of the device under evaluation; 
• 
identifying hazards (including hazards due to substances and technologies), individual case 
reports may be used for identification of new and previously unknown hazards that are 
associated with the device; 
• 
justifying the validity of criteria used for the demonstration of equivalence (if equivalence is 
claimed); 
• 
justifying the validity of surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints are used).  
• 
providing input for the planning of pivotal studies. 
 
The corresponding information is, in general, summarised in a literature review section of the 
clinical evaluation report.  
c. Aspects to consider when determining relevance 
The table below shows examples of aspects that could be used for determining if and in what 
respect data are relevant to the clinical evaluation.  


 

|  | Description |  |  | Examples |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To what extent are the data generated representative of the device under evaluation? |  |  | - device under evaluation - equivalent device - benchmark device - other devices and medical alternatives - data concerning the medical conditions that are managed with the device |  |  |
| What aspects are covered? |  |  | - pivotal performance data - pivotal safety data - claims - identification of hazards - estimation and management of risks - establishment of current knowledge/ the state of the art - determination and justification of criteria for the evaluation of the risk/benefit relationship - determination and justification of criteria for the evaluation of acceptability of undesirable side-effects - determination of equivalence - justification of the validity of surrogate endpoints |  |  |
| Are the data relevant to the intended purpose of the device or to claims about the device? |  |  | - representative of the entire intended purpose with all patient populations and all claims foreseen for the device under evaluation - concerns specific models/ sizes/ settings, or concerns specific aspects of the intended purpose or of claims - does not concern the intended purpose or claims |  |  |
| If the data are relevant to specific aspects of the intended purpose or claims, are they relevant to a specific - model, size, or setting of the device? |  |  | - smallest / intermediate / largest size - lowest / intermediate / highest dose - etc. |  |  |
| - user group? |  |  | - specialists - general practitioners - nurses |  |  |

|  | - adult healthy lay persons - disabled persons - children - etc. |
| --- | --- |
| - medical indication (if applicable)? | - migraine prophylaxis - treatment of acute migraine - rehabilitation after stroke - etc. |
| - age group? | - pre-term infants / neonates / children / adolescents / adults / old age |
| - gender? | - female/ male |
| - type and severity of the medical condition? | - early / late stage - mild / intermediate / serious form - acute / chronic phase - etc. |
| - range of time? | - duration of application or use - number of repeat exposures - duration of follow-up |

 
9.3.3. How to weight the contribution of each data set 
Based on their scientific validity and relevance, the data should be weighted according to their 
relative contributions.  
Due to the diversity of medical devices, there is no single, well established method for weighting 
clinical data:  
•
 
the evaluators should identify appropriate criteria to be applied for a specific evaluation;  
•
 
these pre-defined criteria should be followed strictly by the evaluators.  
 
Typically, clinical data should receive the highest weighting, when generated through a well 
designed and monitored randomized controlled clinical investigation (also called randomised 
controlled trial), conducted with the device under evaluation in its intended purpose, with patients 
and users that are representative of the target population. 
Note: It is acknowledged that randomized clinical investigations may not always be feasible and/or 
appropriate and the use of alternative study designs may provide relevant clinical information of 
adequate weighting. 
When rejecting evidence, the evaluators should document the reasons (both for studies and 
reports that have been generated and are held by the manufacturer, and for other documents 
identified during Stage 1).

10. Analysis of the clinical data (Stage 3) 
10.1. General considerations 
The goal of the analysis stage is to determine if the appraised data sets available for a medical 
device collectively demonstrate compliance with each of the Essential Requirements pertaining to 
the clinical performance and clinical safety of the device, when the device is used according to its 
intended purpose.  
In order to demonstrate compliance, the evaluators should 
• 
use sound methods; 
• 
make a comprehensive analysis;  
• 
determine if additional clinical investigations or other measures are necessary;  
• 
determine PMCF needs. 
 
10.2. Specific considerations 
a. Use sound methods 
A literature review that describes current knowledge/ the state of the art should be prepared 
with relevant literature identified during Stage 1 and appraised during Stage 2. 
Weighting criteria developed and assigned during the appraisal stage can be used to identify 
those sets of data, which may be considered to be pivotal.  
The methods available for analysing clinical data generally are either qualitative or quantitative. 
Depending on the nature of the medical device and the circumstances, it is likely that qualitative 
(i.e. descriptive) methods will need to be used for some devices. Reliance on qualitative 
methods should be justified. Generally, available clinical data such as numbers of incidents in 
the post market phase should be assessed quantitatively in relation to current knowledge/ the 
state of the art. 
The results of the pivotal datasets should be explored, looking for consistency of results across 
particular device performance characteristics and identified risks. If the different datasets report 
similar outcomes, confidence in the robustness increases. If different results are observed 
across the datasets, it will be helpful to determine the reason for such differences. Regardless, 
all data sets should be considered and included. The reviewers should take into account the 
weighting attributed to data sets during Stage 2 when addressing conflicting information. Where 
relevant, a rationale should be given for the lack of value of a data set to the evaluation. 
In general, data that are not methodologically sound (such as single patient reports) should not 
be used for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and clinical safety of a device. 
For additional information, see Appendix A6 (Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that 
lack scientific validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or clinical safety). 
In exceptional situations, when an evaluation is based on limited data, this shall be described 
and justified in the clinical evaluation report. See additional information and specific 
considerations in Appendix A8 (Devices for unmet medical needs - aspects to consider).  
 
b. Make a comprehensive analysis 
The evaluators should: 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 28 of 65 
• 
Determine compliance with each of the Essential Requirements pertaining to the clinical 
performance and clinical safety of the device. For detailed information concerning specific 
Essential Requirements, see Appendix A7 (Analysis of the clinical data - compliance to 
specific Essential Requirements). 
• 
The evaluation includes 
- the adequacy of pre-clinical testing (e.g. bench testing, animal testing) to verify safety 
- risks to patients, users or other persons associated with the intended purpose of the 
device 
- benefits to patients 
- confirmation that the device achieves the performance(s) intended by the manufacturer, 
including all claims made by the manufacturer 
- confirmation of usability, that the design adequately reduces the risk of use error as far 
as possible, and that the design is adequate for the intended users (lay, professional, 
disabled or other users, if applicable) 
- adequacy of the information materials supplied by the manufacturer, including if risk 
mitigation measures are correctly addressed in the IFU (handling instructions, 
description of risks, warnings, precautions, contraindications, instructions for managing 
foreseeable unwanted situations) 
• 
Take into consideration all products covered by the clinical evaluation and all aspects of 
their intended purpose. Any gaps in evidence need to be identified, including in respect to 
information relevant to: 
- understanding the interaction between the device and the body; 
- the comprehensiveness of the available data, taking into account: 
- the entire range of products/ models/ sizes/ settings covered by the evaluation 
- the entire range of conditions of use and of the intended purpose 
- the estimated number of patients exposed to the device 
- the type and adequacy of patient monitoring 
- the number and severity of adverse events 
- the adequacy of the estimation of associated risk for each identified hazard 
- the severity and natural history of the condition being diagnosed or treated 
- current standards of care, including the availability and the benefit/risk profiles of other 
devices and medical alternatives 
• 
Assess if there is consistency and alignment between the clinical evaluation, the 
information materials supplied by the manufacturer, and the risk management 
documentation for the device under evaluation; any discrepancies should be identified in 
order to ensure that all the hazards and other clinically relevant information have been 
identified and analysed appropriately.  
• 
Assess if there is consistency between the documents mentioned above and current 
knowledge/ the state of the art. 
 
c. Determine if additional clinical investigations or other measures are necessary 
The evaluators should identify additional clinical investigations or other measures that are 
necessary in order to generate any missing data and eliminate compliance issues. 
Data needed to address the identified gaps should be determined so that conclusions can be 
drawn with confidence in relation to conformity with the essential requirements, including: 
- evaluation of the safety, performance and the benefit/risk profile 
- compatibility with a high level of protection of health and safety (that can be determined 
by considering current knowledge/ the state of the art, with reference to standards and 
available alternatives, risk minimisation, patient needs and preferences) 
- the acceptability of any undesirable side-effects 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 29 of 65 
- the risk of use error and the adequacy of the IFU to the intended users, 
- consistency between available information 
See Appendix A2 for detailed information on when additional clinical investigations should be 
carried out. 
 
d. Determine PMCF needs 
In order to determine needs, the evaluators should describe residual risks and any uncertainties 
or unanswered questions. The evaluators should also include aspects such as rare 
complications, uncertainties regarding medium- and long-term performance, or safety under 
wide-spread use. 
 
10.3. Where demonstration of conformity based on clinical data is not deemed 
appropriate 
Where demonstration of conformity with Essential Requirements based on clinical data is not 
deemed appropriate, adequate justification for any such exclusion has to be given: 
• 
The justification must be based on the output of the risk management process. This should 
include an evaluation of background clinical data identified from the literature, and an 
appraisal of their relevance to the device under evaluation. 
• 
The device/body interaction, the clinical performances intended and the claims of the 
manufacturer have to be specifically considered.  
• 
Adequacy of demonstration of conformity with the Essential Requirements based on 
performance evaluation, bench testing and pre-clinical evaluation in the absence of clinical 
data has to be duly substantiated.  
• 
A clinical evaluation is still required and the above information and evidence-based 
justification should be presented in the clinical evaluation report. 
 
 
11. The clinical evaluation report (CER, Stage 4) 
A clinical evaluation report shall be compiled to document the clinical evaluation and its output.  
The clinical evaluation report should contain sufficient information to be read and understood by an 
independent party (e.g. regulatory authority or notified body). Therefore, it should provide sufficient 
detail for understanding the search criteria adopted by the evaluators, data that are available, all 
assumptions made and all conclusions reached. 
The contents of the clinical evaluation report shall be cross-referenced to the relevant documents 
that support them. It should be clear which statements are substantiated by which data, and which 
reflect the conclusions or opinions of the evaluators. The report should include references to 
literature-based data and the titles and investigational codes (if relevant and available) of any 
clinical investigation reports, with cross-references to the location in the manufacturer’s technical 
documentation. 
The amount of information may differ according to the history of the device or technology. Where a 
new device or technology has been developed, the report would need to include an overview of the 
developmental process and the points in the development cycle at which all clinical data have 
been generated. 
 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 30 of 65 
It is important that the report outlines the different stages of the clinical evaluation: 
• 
Stage 0, scope of the clinical evaluation:  
- explains the scope and context of the evaluation, including which products/ models/ 
sizes/ settings are covered by the clinical evaluation report, the technology on which the 
medical device is based, the conditions of use and the intended purpose of the device; 
- documents any claims made about the device’s clinical performance or clinical safety. 
• 
Stage 1, identification of pertinent data:  
- explains the literature search strategy; 
- presents the nature and extent of the clinical data and relevant pre-clinical data that 
have been identified.  
• 
Stage 2, appraisal of pertinent data:  
- explains the criteria used by the evaluators for appraising data sets; 
- summarises the pertinent data sets (methods, results, conclusions of the authors);  
- evaluates their methodological quality, scientific validity, the relevance for the evaluation, 
the weighting attributed to the evidence, and any limitations; 
- presents justifications for rejecting certain data or documents.  
• 
Stage 3, analysis of the clinical data:  
- explains if and how the referenced information, such as confirmation of compliance with 
clinical data requirement from applicable harmonised standards and the clinical data, 
constitute sufficient clinical evidence for demonstration of the clinical performance and 
clinical safety of the device under evaluation;  
- explains whether there are adequate data for all aspects of the intended purpose and for 
all products/ models/ sizes/ settings covered by the clinical evaluation.  
- describes the benefits and risks of the device (their nature, probability, extent, duration 
and frequency);  
- explains the acceptability of the benefit/risk profile according to current knowledge/ the 
state of the art in the medical fields concerned, with reference to applicable standards 
and guidance documents, available medical alternatives, and the analysis and 
conclusions of the evaluators on fulfilment of all Essential Requirements pertaining to 
clinical properties of the device (MDD ER1, ER3, ER6; AIMDD ER1, ER2, ER5); 
- analyses if there is consistency between the clinical data, the information materials 
supplied by the manufacturer, the risk management documentation for the device under 
evaluation; 
- whether there is consistency between these documents and the current knowledge/ the 
state of the art; 
- identifies any gaps and discrepancies; 
- identifies residual risks and uncertainties or unanswered questions (such as rare 
complications, uncertainties regarding medium- and long term performance, safety 
under wide-spread use) that should be further evaluated during PMS, including in PMCF 
studies. 
 
The evaluators should check the clinical evaluation report, provide verification that it includes an 
accurate statement of their analysis and opinions, and sign the report. They should provide their 
CV and their declaration of interests to the manufacturer. 
The clinical evaluation report should be dated and version controlled. 
A suggested format for the clinical evaluation report is located at Appendix A9 (Clinical evaluation 
report - proposed table of contents, examples of contents).  
Suggestions for aspects that should be checked for the release of a clinical evaluation report are 
summarised in Appendix A10 (Proposed checklist for the release of the clinical evaluation report). 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 31 of 65 
Information on declaration of interests can be found in Appendix A11 (Information on declarations 
of interests). 
 
 
12. The role of the notified body in the assessment of clinical 
evaluation reports  
The notified body plays a key role in the assessment and verification of clinical evaluation reports 
and supporting documentation provided by medical device manufacturers to support demonstration 
of conformity of a device with the Essential Requirements of the relevant Directive.  
Detailed recommendations for notified bodies are given in Appendix A12 (Activities of notified 
bodies). These include: 
• 
guidance for notified bodies on the assessment of clinical evaluation reports provided by 
medical device manufacturers as part of technical documentation (including design 
dossiers) and  
• 
guidance for notified body in development of their internal procedures for assessment of 
clinical aspects relating to medical devices. 
In addition, documents of the Notified Bodies Operations Group (NBOG) should also be consulted. 
NBOG documents include best practice guides, checklists and forms. 
 
Pursuant to section 6a of Annex I MDD and to section 5a of Annex 1 AIMDD, the demonstration of 
conformity with the Essential Requirements must include a clinical evaluation conducted in 
accordance with Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC or with Annex 7 AIMDD. This is applicable for all 
classes of medical device. 
Where demonstration of conformity with Essential Requirements based on clinical data is not 
deemed appropriate this must be adequately justified by the manufacturer and based on the output 
of the risk management process. The device-body interaction, the intended purpose and the claims 
of the manufacturer have to be specifically considered. The adequacy of demonstration of 
conformity based on performance evaluation, bench testing and pre-clinical evaluation in the 
absence of clinical data must be duly substantiated. The notified body must review the 
manufacturer’s justification, the adequacy of data presented and whether or not conformity is 
demonstrated. Nevertheless a clinical evaluation is still required and the above information and an 
evidenced justification should be presented as the clinical evaluation for the device in question.

Appendices  
 
A1. Demonstration of equivalence 
Pursuant to Annex X of Directive MDD and Annex 7 AIMDD, the evaluation of clinical data (i.e. the 
clinical evaluation), where appropriate taking account of any relevant harmonised standards, must 
follow a defined and methodologically sound procedure based on:  
1. either a critical evaluation of the relevant scientific literature currently available relating to 
the safety, performance, design characteristics and intended purpose of the device, where: 
- there is demonstration of equivalence of the device to the device to which the data 
relates, and 
- the data adequately demonstrate compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. 
2. or a critical evaluation of the results of all clinical investigations made. 
3. or a critical evaluation of the combined clinical data provided from 1 and 2.  
 
Clinical, technical and biological characteristics shall be taken into consideration for the 
demonstration of equivalence: 
• 
Clinical: 
- used for the same clinical condition (including when applicable similar severity and stage 
of disease, same medical indication), and 
- used for the same intended purpose, and 
- used at the same site in the body, and 
- used in a similar population (this may relate to age, gender, anatomy, physiology, 
possibly other aspects), and 
- not foreseen to deliver significantly different performances (in the relevant critical 
performances such as the expected clinical effect, the specific intended purpose, the 
duration of use, etc.). 
• 
Technical: 
- be of similar design, and 
- used under the same conditions of use, and 
- have similar specifications and properties (e.g. physicochemical properties such as type 
and intensity of energy, tensile strength, viscosity, surface characteristics, wavelength, 
surface texture, porosity, particle size, nanotechnology, specific mass, atomic inclusions 
such as nitrocarburising, oxidability), and 
- use similar deployment methods (if relevant), and 
- have similar principles of operation and critical performance requirements. 
• 
Biological: Use the same materials or substances in contact with the same human tissues 
or body fluids.  
Exceptions can be foreseen for devices in contact with intact skin and minor components of 
devices; in these cases risk analysis results may allow the use of similar materials taking 
into account the role and nature of the similar material. Different aspects of equivalence 
and compliance to different Essential Requirements can be affected by materials. 
Evaluators should consider biological safety (e.g. in compliance to ISO 10993) as well as 
other aspects necessary for a comprehensive demonstration of equivalence. A justification 
explaining the situation should be provided for any difference. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 33 of 65 
For assuming equivalence,  
• 
equivalence can only be based on a single device14; 
• 
all three characteristics (clinical, technical, biological) need to be fulfilled; 
• 
similar means that no clinically significant difference in the performance and safety of the 
device would be triggered by the differences between the device under evaluation and the 
device presumed to be equivalent;  
• 
the differences between the device under evaluation and the device presumed to be 
equivalent need to be identified, fully disclosed, and evaluated; explanations should be 
given why the differences are not expected to significantly affect the clinical performance 
and clinical safety of the device under evaluation; 
• 
the manufacturer should investigate if the medical device presumed to be equivalent has 
been manufactured via a special treatment (e.g. a surface modification, a process that 
modifies material characteristics); if this is the case, the treatment could cause differences 
in respect to technical and biological characteristics; this should be taken into account for 
the demonstration of equivalence and documented in the CER; 
• 
if measurements are possible, clinically relevant specifications and properties should be 
measured both in the device under evaluation and the device presumed to be equivalent, 
and presented in comparative tabulations; 
• 
comparative drawings or pictures should be included in order to compare shapes and sizes 
of elements that are in contact with the body; 
• 
the manufacturer is expected to: 
- include the supporting non-clinical information (e.g. pre-clinical study reports) in the 
technical documentation of the device, and  
- in the clinical evaluation report, summarise the information and cite its location in the 
technical documentation; 
• 
for the evaluation of the technical characteristics, devices that achieve the same therapeutic 
result by different means cannot be considered equivalent; 
• 
for the evaluation of the biological characteristics: 
- when a detailed chemical characterisation of materials in contact with the body is 
needed, ISO 10993-18 Annex C can be used to show toxicological equivalence but this 
is just a part of the evaluation of the biological criteria; 
- sourcing and manufacturing procedures may adversely affect impurity profiles; analytical 
methods chosen to characterise medical devices should appropriately take into 
consideration knowledge concerning expected impurity profiles (tests may have to be 
repeated when production methods or sourcing are changed); 
- it may be necessary to show from histopathological studies that the same host response 
is achieved in vivo in the intended application and the intended duration of contact;  
- for animal tests, differences between species may limit the predictive value of the test; 
the choice of the test and its predictive value should be justified; 
- abrasion, if relevant, and host response to particles may also need to be considered. 
• 
the only clinical data that are considered as relevant are the data obtained when the 
equivalent device is a CE-marked medical device used in accordance with its intended 
purpose as documented in the IFU. 
                                                
 
14  Evaluators may wish to refer to several devices that are equivalent. In such a situation, equivalence of 
every single device to the device under evaluation should be fully investigated, demonstrated, and 
described in the clinical evaluation report. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 34 of 65 
Note: Exceptions can be considered. When the equivalent device is not a CE-marked 
device, information concerning the regulatory status of the equivalent device and a 
justification for the use of its data should be included in the clinical evaluation report. The 
justification should explain if the clinical data is transferrable to the European population, 
and an analysis of any gaps to good clinical practices (such as ISO 14155) and relevant 
harmonised standards.  
 
 
A2. When should additional clinical investigations be carried out? 
a. How should manufacturers and evaluators decide if there is sufficient clinical evidence?  
When clinical data are required in order to draw conclusions as to the conformity of a device to 
the Essential Requirements, the data need to be in line with current knowledge/ the state of the 
art, be scientifically sound, cover all aspects of the intended purpose, and all products/ models/ 
sizes/ settings foreseen by the manufacturer. 
If gaps are present that cannot be addressed by other means, clinical investigations should be 
planned and carried out. 
b. Considerations 
Implants and high-risk devices, those based on technologies where there is little or no 
experience, and those that extend the intended purpose of an existing technology (i.e. a new 
clinical use) are most likely to require clinical investigation data.  
For compliance with Annex X section 1.1.a MDD and Annex 7 AIMDD, clinical investigations 
with the device under evaluation are required for implantable and class III devices unless it can 
be duly justified to rely on existing clinical data alone.  
The need for clinical investigations depends on the ability of the existing data to adequately 
address the benefit/risk profile, claims, and side-effects in order to comply with the applicable 
Essential Requirements. Clinical investigations may therefore also be required for other 
devices, including for devices in class I and class IIa, and for class IIb devices that are not 
implantable. 
When deciding if additional clinical investigations need to be carried out, the manufacturer 
should perform a detailed gap analysis. The gap analysis should determine whether the existing 
data are sufficient to verify that the device is in conformity with all the Essential Requirements 
pertaining to clinical performance and clinical safety. 
Special attention should be given to aspects such as: 
- new design features, including new materials, 
- new intended purposes, including new medical indications, new target populations (age, 
gender, etc.),  
- new claims the manufacturer intends to use,  
- new types of users (e.g. lay persons), 
- seriousness of direct and/or indirect risks,  
- contact with mucosal membranes or invasiveness,  
- increasing duration of use or numbers of re-applications,  
- incorporation of medicinal substances,  
- use of animal tissues (other than in contact with intact skin),  


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 35 of 65 
- issues raised when medical alternatives with lower risks or more extensive benefits to 
patients are available or have become newly available15, 
- issues raised when new risks are recognised (including due to progress in medicine, 
science and technology) 
- whether the data of concern are amenable to evaluation through a clinical investigation, 
- etc. 
 
Data on the safety and performance of other devices and alternative therapies, including 
benchmark devices and equivalent devices, should be used to define the state of the art or 
identify hazards due to substances and technologies. This will allow the clinical data 
requirements to be established more precisely in relation to the intended purpose of a device. 
Precision in this analysis and the choice of selected medical indications and target populations 
may reduce the amount of clinical data needed from additional clinical investigations. 
 
 
A3. Device description - typical contents 
The description should be detailed enough to allow for a valid evaluation of the state of compliance 
with Essential Requirements, the retrieval of meaningful literature data and, if applicable, the 
assessment of equivalence to other devices described in the scientific literature:

- duration of use or contact with the body  
- repeat applications, including any restrictions as to the number or duration of re-
applications 
- contact with mucosal membranes/ invasiveness/ implantation

manufacturer (label, IFU, available promotional materials and accompanying documents 
possibly foreseen by the manufacturer). 
 
 
A4. Sources of literature 
There are different sources of clinical literature that can be searched for clinical evaluation. A 
comprehensive search strategy is required, normally involving multiple databases. The search 
strategy should be documented and justified. Important sources include the following: 
 
• 
Scientific literature databases 
- MEDLINE or Pubmed can provide a good starting point for a search. However, with 
possibly incomplete coverage of European Journals and reduced search features, 
comprehensiveness may not necessarily be guaranteed. 
- Additional databases may need to be used to ensure adequate coverage of devices and 
therapies in use in Europe, to identify relevant clinical trials and publications of user 
experience16, and to facilitate searches by device name and manufacturer (e.g. 
EMBASE/Excerpta Medica, the Cochrane CENTRAL trials register, etc.).  
- Information coverage and search features available in scientific databases can change 
with time. Criteria for selecting adequate databases therefore need to be defined and re-
evaluated on a regular basis. 
• 
Internet searches 
                                                
 
16  Studies yielding negative results or user experience (such as publications about risks that are based on a 
case or a case series) may not qualify for publication in high impact medical journals. Low impact journals 
available to European users and other sources may therefore need to be searched. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 37 of 65 
Searches provide important data, examples include information on: 
- harmonised standards and other standards applicable to the device in question and 
containing information on clinical performance and clinical safety. 
- Field safety corrective actions for the equivalent and/or other devices. These can be 
found on manufacturer’s web sites, internet sites of European Competent authorities, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), possibly other sites. 
- Implant registry reports. 
- Documents available in systematic review databases (e.g. the Cochrane Database of 
Systematic Reviews, Prospero international prospective register of systematic reviews). 
- Expert documents produced by professional medical associations that are important for 
assessment of current knowledge/ the state of the art, including clinical practice 
guidelines and consensus statements. 
- Meta-analyses and reviews of health technology assessment (HTA) institutes and 
networks. 
- Identification of studies via the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform 
(ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. 
 
• 
Non-published data  
Non published data are important for many devices and retrieval of such data should be 
considered, including for monitoring of any changes, e.g.  
- The label and IFU of the equivalent device (if equivalence is claimed by the 
manufacturer) and/or of benchmark devices and other devices. 
- Data provided to manufacturers from implant registries. 
- Data presented at congresses. 
 
• 
Citations referenced in scientific literature can be important and should be screened. 
Literature found to be relevant is likely to cite other literature that is of direct interest to the 
manufacturer. Additionally, it may be necessary to retrieve some of the referenced literature 
in order to appraise the scientific quality of a document. 
 
 
A5. Literature search and literature review protocol, key elements  
The output of the literature search and literature review are:  
• 
Literature on the device in question and the equivalent device. 
Note: If the manufacturer holds own clinical data for the device in question (e.g. own pre-
market clinical investigations, PMCF Studies, other PMS data), the literature is considered 
together with those data for consistent appraisal and overall analysis. 
• 
A review of the current knowledge/ the state of the art needed for the proper conduct of the 
appraisal and analysis of the clinical data of the device under evaluation and the equivalent 
device (i.e. applicable standards and guidance documents, information on the medical 
conditions that are relevant to the clinical evaluation, therapeutic/ management/ diagnostic 
options available for the intended patient population, etc.).  
 
The literature collected may relate directly to the device in question (e.g. publications of clinical 
investigations of the device in question that have been performed by third parties, its side effects or 
complications, incidence reports) and/or to equivalent device, benchmark devices, other devices 
and medical alternatives available to the intended patient population. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 38 of 65 
The literature search and literature review protocol should address the background to and the 
objective of the review, specifying the literature review questions and the methods for identification, 
selection, collection and appraisal of the relevant publications needed to address them. It should 
include the literature search methodology (literature search protocol). 
The selection of literature should be objective and justified, i.e. include all relevant data, both 
favourable and unfavourable. With respect to the clinical evaluation, it is important that the clinical 
evaluators are able to assess the degree to which the selected papers reflect the intended 
application/ use of the device.  
 
Objective, non-biased, systematic search and review methods should be used. Examples are: 
- PICO (patient characteristics, type of intervention17, control, and outcome queries) 
- Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 
- PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
Statement 
- MOOSE Proposal (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) 
 
The protocol should specify the elements described below, addressing the background, objective, 
and methods for identification, selection, and collection of the relevant publications to address the 
literature review questions.  
 
A5.1. Background to the literature search and the literature review  
This section documents the importance of and rationale for the literature review and includes, but 
is not limited to:  
- Device name/model 
- Importance of literature review to risk management process. The literature review will 
provide data on current interventions18 for the intended patient population (state of the 
art) in order to give input to the assessments of acceptable benefit/risk profiles, what is 
currently considered as providing a high level of protection of health and safety and what 
are considered acceptable side-effects.  
- Previous literature reviews  
- Importance of review to risk management process  
- Previous literature searches conducted by the manufacturer 
- If including equivalent or benchmark devices, name and model of the devices. 
- The CER will need to establish equivalence to the device under evaluation or the 
relevance of benchmark devices to the clinical evaluation. 
 
A5.2. Objective  
This section documents the research question(s), which should be consistent with the scope of the 
clinical evaluation and carefully constructed using a process (e.g. PICO):  
                                                
 
17  The term Intervention includes therapies, diagnostic measures, measures for the management of 
diseases or medical conditions. 
18  Includes therapies, diagnostic measures, measures for the management of diseases or medical 
conditions. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 39 of 65 
- Population(s)/disease(s) or condition(s) 
- Intervention(s)  
- Comparator group(s)/control(s)  
- Outcome(s)/endpoint(s)  
The inputs for the review question(s) (e.g. PICO) are the device description and the intended 
performance of the device including any claims on clinical performance and clinical safety which 
the manufacturer wants to use. Also information from the risk management process is needed as 
an input. 
 
A5.3. Methods  
The methods section of the protocol documents the plans for literature search, study selection, 
data collection, and analysis methods. It defines the literature search strategy and the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for the documents found.  
 
The protocol should include: 
• 
the literature search methodology 
The purpose of a literature search protocol is to plan the search before execution. It should 
be developed and executed by persons with expertise in information retrieval, having due 
regard to the scope of the clinical evaluation set out by the manufacturer. The involvement 
of information retrieval experts will help to optimize literature retrieval to identify all relevant 
published literature. 
The importance of a literature search protocol is for critical appraisal of the methods. The 
search strategy should be based on carefully constructed review questions.  
• 
the sources of data that will be used and a justification for their choice (see Appendix A4, 
Sources of literature)  
• 
the extent of any searches of scientific literature databases (the database search strategy); 
• 
attempts to identify all published literature 
• 
which electronic databases are to be searched, with justification  
• 
the extent of any Internet searching and searching non-published information, including the 
search strategy and justification  
• 
exact search terms and any limits  
• 
limits for start and end dates of each search  
• 
the selection/criteria (such as inclusion/exclusion criteria) to be applied to published 
literature and justification for their choice 
• 
strategies for addressing the potential for duplication of data across multiple publications; 
• 
strategies for avoiding retrieving publications of data generated and already held by the 
manufacturer 
• 
the data collection plan that defines data management practices to ensure data integrity 
during extraction (e.g. quality control/second review of extracted data by additional 
reviewer)  
• 
the appraisal plan, which defines the methods for appraising each publication, including the 
relevance of the data to the intended clinical use and the methodological quality of the data 
• 
the analysis plan, which defines the methods for analysing the data including data 
processing and transformation  
 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4

Any deviations from the literature search protocol should be noted in the literature search report.  
 
 
A6. Appraisal of clinical data - examples of studies that lack scientific 
validity for demonstration of adequate clinical performance and/or 
clinical safety 
a. Lack of information on elementary aspects: 
This includes reports and publications that omit disclosure of  
- the methods used  
- the identity of products used 
- numbers of patients exposed 
- what the clinical outcomes were 
- all the results the clinical study or investigation planned to investigate 
- undesirable side-effects that have been observed 
- confidence intervals/ calculation of statistical significance 
- if there are intent-to-treat and per protocol populations: definitions and results for the two 
populations 
b. Numbers too small for statistical significance 
Includes publications and reports with inconclusive preliminary data, inconclusive data from 
feasibility studies, anecdotal experience, hypothesis papers and unsubstantiated opinions. 
c. Improper statistical methods 
This includes 
- results obtained after multiple subgroup testing, when no corrections have been applied 
for multiple comparisons. 
- calculations and tests based on a certain type of distribution of data (e.g. Gaussian 
distribution with its calculations of mean values, standard deviations, confidence 
intervals, t-tests, others tests), while the type of distribution is not tested, the type of 
distribution is not plausible, or the data have not been transformed. Data such as 
survival curves, e.g. implant survival, patient survival, symptom-free survival, are 
generally unlikely to follow a Gaussian distribution. 
d. Lack of adequate controls 
In the following situations, bias or confounding are probable in single arm-studies and in other 
studies that do not include appropriate controls:  
- when results are based on subjective endpoint assessments (e.g. pain assessment). 
- when the endpoints or symptoms assessed are subject to natural fluctuations (e.g. 
regression to the mean when observing patients with chronic diseases and fluctuating 
symptoms, when natural improvement occurs, when the natural course of the disease in 
a patient is not clearly predictable). 
- when effectiveness studies are conducted with subjects that are likely to take or are 
foreseen to receive effective co-interventions (including over-the-counter medication and 
other therapies). 
- when there may be other influencing factors (e.g. outcomes that are affected by 
variability of the patient population, of the disease, of user skills, of infrastructure 
available for planning/ intervention/ aftercare, use of prophylactic medication, other 
factors). 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 41 of 65 
- when there are significant differences between the results of existing publications, 
pointing to variable and ill controlled influencing factors. 
In the situations described above, it is generally not adequate to draw conclusions based on 
direct comparisons with external or historic data (such as drawing conclusions by comparing 
data from a clinical investigation with device registry data or with data from published literature).  
Different study designs may allow direct comparisons and conclusions to be drawn in these 
situations, such as randomised controlled design, cross-over design, or split-body design. 
e. Improper collection of mortality and serious adverse events data 
Demonstration of adequate benefits and safety is sometimes based on mortality data or 
occurrence of other serious outcomes that limit a subject’s ability to live in his home and be 
available for follow-up contacts. In this type of study,  
- consent of the subjects for contacting reference persons/ institutions for retrieval of 
medical information should be obtained during recruitment; when subjects can no longer 
be found, outcomes should be investigated with the reference persons/ institutions;  
- the consequences of missing data on the results should be analysed (e.g. with a 
sensitivity analysis); alternatively, when patients can no longer be found and their 
outcomes cannot be identified, they should be considered to meet the SAE endpoint 
under investigation (e.g. the mortality endpoint of a study). 
In mortality studies (and other studies addressing serious outcomes) procedures for 
investigating serious patient outcomes, numbers of subjects lost to follow-up, reasons why 
subjects leave the study, and the results of sensitivity analysis should be fully disclosed in 
reports and publications.  
f. Misinterpretation by the authors 
Includes conclusions that are not in line with the results section of the report or publication, such 
as  
- reports and publications not correctly addressing lack of statistical significance/ 
confidence intervals that encompass the null hypothesis.  
- effects too small for clinical relevance. 
g. Illegal activities 
Includes clinical investigations not conducted in compliance with local regulations. Clinical 
investigations are generally expected to be designed, conducted and reported in accordance 
with EN ISO 14155 or to a comparable standard, and in compliance with local regulations and 
the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 
 
A7. Analysis of the clinical data - compliance to specific Essential 
Requirements 
While this appendix describes the needs for the clinical evaluation (MDD ER1, ER3, ER6; AIMDD 
ER1, ER2, ER5), there may be additional essential requirement(s) that need support of sufficient 
clinical evidence for the conformity assessment. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 42 of 65 
A7.1. Conformity assessment with requirement on safety 
(MDD ER1 / AIMDD ER1) 
The information materials supplied by the manufacturer (including label, IFU, available promotional 
materials including accompanying documents possibly foreseen by the manufacturer), should be 
reviewed to ensure they are consistent with the relevant clinical data appraised in stage 2 and that 
all the hazards, information on risk mitigation and other clinically relevant information have been 
identified appropriately. 
Input from the risk management and the use of standards: 
- 
Risk management documents should determine if all identified hazards are fully covered by 
harmonised standards or other relevant standards or if there are gaps needed to be 
covered by clinical data. 
- 
Risk management documents should determine if all identified risks relating to patient 
treatment, method of operation of the device or risks relating to usability have been 
minimised or if there are question regarding clinical risks that need to be solved. 
- 
Harmonised standards are generally expected to be applied in full in order to confer a 
presumption of conformity.  
- 
If technical developments provide a higher level of safety than current harmonised 
standards, then the higher level of safety should be prioritised in order to meet the Essential 
Requirements on reducing the risks as far as possible, that risks must be compatible with a 
high level of protection of health and safety, and that side effects must be acceptable (MDD 
ER2 and ER3 and ER6; AIMDD ER1 and ER5). 
 
 
Examples:  
- 
Electrical hazards should be covered by compliance to EN 60601-1 and applicable 
collateral standards regarding medical electrical equipment, so that the device will not 
compromise the safety and health of patients or users. Under these circumstances, residual 
risks regarding electrical hazards are acceptable and additional clinical data are not needed 
unless negative issues are detected during PMS activities. 
- 
Harmonised standards on usability (EN 62366 and if applicable EN 60601-1-6) are 
expected to be applied to ensure that usability aspects are taken into consideration during 
the device development. However, they do not give guidance on a detailed level of design, 
while usability aspects are known to cause or contribute to a large portion of incidents. 
Therefore, clinical data may be needed to prove that the risk of use error, due to the 
ergonomic features of the device and the environment in which the device is intended to be 
used, has been reduced as far as possible. 
 
A7.2. Conformity 
assessment 
with 
requirement 
on 
acceptable 
benefit/risk 
profile 
(MDD ER1 / AIMDD ER1) 
It is expected, 
• 
that the clinical evaluation demonstrates that any risks which may be associated with the 
intended purpose are minimised and acceptable when weighed against the benefits to the 
patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety; and 
• 
that the IFU correctly describe the intended purpose of the device as supported by sufficient 
clinical evidence; and 
• 
that the IFU contain correct information to reduce the risk of use error, information on 
residual risks and their management as supported by sufficient clinical evidence (e.g. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 43 of 65 
handling instructions, description of risks, warnings, precautions, contraindications, 
instructions for managing foreseeable unwanted situations). 
 
a. Evaluation of the description of the intended purpose of the device 
The information materials supplied by the manufacturer (including label, IFU, available 
promotional materials including accompanying documents possibly foreseen by the 
manufacturer) should be reviewed. The evaluators should evaluate if the description provided 
by the manufacturer correctly identifies those medical conditions and target groups for which 
conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements has been demonstrated through sufficient 
clinical evidence. When reading the IFU, there should be no uncertainty for users as to when a 
given medical condition or medical indication or target population is covered by the CE marking 
or when it falls entirely under the user's own responsibility (off label use). 
 
b. Evaluation of the device’s benefits to the patient  
Positive impacts of a device on the health of an individual should be meaningful (relevant for the 
patient) and measurable. The nature, extent, probability and duration of benefits should be 
considered. Benefits may include:  
• 
positive impact on clinical outcome (such as reduced probability of adverse outcomes, e.g. 
mortality, morbidity; or improvement of impaired body function), 
• 
the patient's quality of life (significant improvements, including by simplifying care or 
improving the clinical management of patients, improving body functions, providing relief 
from symptoms), 
• 
outcomes related to diagnosis (such as allowing a correct diagnosis to be made, provide 
earlier diagnosis of diseases or specifics of diseases, or identify patients more likely to 
respond to a given therapy),  
• 
positive impact from diagnostic devices on clinical outcomes, or 
• 
public health impact (such as to the ability of a diagnostic medical device to identify a 
specific disease and therefore prevent its spread, to identify phases, stages, location, 
severity or variants of disease, predict future disease onset). 
 
c. Quantification of benefit(s) to the patients 
Defining specified endpoints is indispensable for setting up clinical investigations and properly 
performing the identification, appraisal, and analysis of the clinical data.  
• 
Benefit(s) are often evaluated along a scale or according to specific endpoints or criteria 
(types of benefits), or by evaluating whether a pre-identified health threshold was achieved. 
The change in subjects’ condition or clinical management as measured on that scale, or as 
determined by an improvement or worsening of the endpoint, determines the magnitude of 
the benefit(s) in subjects. Variation in the magnitude of the benefit across a population may 
also be considered.  
• 
The clinical relevance of these changes should be discussed and justified.  
• 
Ideally, these parameters should be directly clinically relevant.  
• 
In certain cases benefits can be assumed when validated surrogate endpoints are met 
(such as obtaining certain results with laboratory tests or measurements of anatomical or 
physiological properties).  


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 44 of 65 
• 
Based on the current state of medical knowledge, the evaluators shall justify and document 
the clinical relevance of endpoints used for the clinical evaluation of a device and 
demonstrate the validity of all surrogate endpoints (if surrogate endpoints have been used).  
 
The probability of the patient experiencing one or more benefit(s) is another important aspect of 
evaluating benefits and the clinical performance of a device.  
• 
Based on the clinical data provided and on a sound statistical approach, a reasonable 
prediction of the proportion of "responders" out of the target group or subgroups should be 
made.  
• 
The data may show that a benefit may be experienced only by a small proportion of 
patients in the target population, or, on the other hand, that a benefit may occur frequently 
in patients throughout the target population. It is also possible that the data will show that 
different patient subgroups are likely to experience different benefits or different levels of 
the same benefit.  
• 
If the subgroups can be identified, the device may be indicated for those subgroups only.  
• 
In some cases, however, the subgroups may not be identifiable. Magnitude and probability 
of clinical benefits will have to be put together when weighing benefits against risks.  
• 
A large benefit experienced by a small proportion of subjects may raise different 
considerations than does a small benefit experienced by a large proportion of subjects. For 
example, a large benefit, even if experienced by a small population, may be significant 
enough to outweigh risks, whereas a small benefit may not, unless experienced by a large 
population of subjects.  
 
The duration of effect(s) (i.e. how long the benefit can be expected to last for the patient, if 
applicable to the device) 
• 
The duration should be characterised (for example as a statistical distribution) on the basis 
of sound clinical data and appropriate statistical approaches.  
• 
PMCF will be decisive to refine and corroborate reasonable predictions over time.  
• 
The mode of action may play an important role: Some treatments are curative, whereas, 
some may need to be repeated frequently over the patient’s lifetime.  
• 
To the extent that it is known, the duration of a treatment’s effect may directly influence how 
its benefit is defined. Treatments that must be repeated over time may introduce greater 
risk, or the benefit experienced may diminish each time the treatment is repeated. 
• 
The evaluation of the duration of effect should take into consideration current knowledge/ 
the state of the art and available alternatives. 
 
d. Evaluation of the clinical risks of devices  
The risk management documents are expected to identify the risks associated with the device 
and how such risks have been addressed. The clinical evaluation is expected to address the 
significance of any risks that remain after design risk mitigation strategies have been employed 
by the manufacturer. 
PMS reports are compiled by the manufacturer and often include details of the device’s 
regulatory status (countries in which the device is marketed and date of commencement of 
supply), regulatory actions undertaken during the reporting period (e.g. recalls, notifications), a 
tabulation of incidents (particularly serious adverse events/ incidents, including deaths, stratified 
into whether the manufacturer considers them to be device-related or not) and estimates of the 
incidence of incidents.  


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 45 of 65 
Post-marketing data about incidents are generally more meaningful when related to usage but 
caution is needed. The extent of user reporting in the medical devices vigilance system may 
vary considerably between countries, users, and type of incident. Considerable under-reporting 
by users is expected. However, the analyses of data within these reports may, for some 
devices, provide reasonable assurance of both clinical safety and performance.  
It may be helpful to provide a table summarising device-related incidents, paying particular 
attention to serious adverse events/ incidents, with comments on whether observed device-
related incidents are predictable on the basis of the mode of action of the device.  
To demonstrate the extent of the probable risk(s)/ harm(s), the following factors - individually 
and in the aggregate - should be addressed:  
• 
Nature severity, number and rates of harmful events associated with the use of the device: 
- Device-related serious adverse events/ incidents: Those events that may have been or 
were attributed to the use of the device and produce an injury or illness that is life-
threatening, results in permanent impairment or damage to the body, or requires medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent permanent harm to the body.  
- Device-related non-serious/ non-reportable harmful events: Those events that may have 
been or were attributed to the use of the device and that do not meet the criteria for 
classification as a device-related serious adverse events/ incidents.  
- Procedure-related incidents: Harm to the patient that results from use of the device but is 
not caused by the device itself. For example, anaesthetic-related complications 
associated with the implantation of a device. 
• 
Probability of a harmful event: The proportion of the intended population that would be 
expected to experience a harmful event; whether an event occurs once or repeatedly may 
be factored into the measurement of probability.  
• 
Duration of harmful events (i.e., how long the adverse consequences last): Some devices 
can cause temporary, minor harm; some devices can cause repeated but reversible harm; 
and other devices can cause permanent, debilitating injury. The severity of the harm should 
be considered along with its duration.  
• 
Risk from false-positive or false-negative results for diagnostic medical devices :  
- if a diagnostic device gives a false-positive result, the patient might, for example, receive 
an unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany that treatment, or might 
be incorrectly diagnosed with a serious disease;  
- if a diagnostic device gives a false-negative result, the patient might not receive an 
effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits that treatment would confer), or 
might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or condition;  
- other risks associated with false-positives and false-negatives.  
• 
It is also important to look at the totality of the harmful events associated with the device. 
The number of different types of harmful events that can potentially result from using the 
device and the severity of their aggregate effect has to be considered. When multiple 
harmful events occur at once, they have a greater aggregate effect. 
• 
Comment specifically on any clinical data that identifies hazards not previously considered 
in the risk management documentation, outlining any additional mitigation required (e.g. 
design modification, amendment of information materials supplied by the manufacturer 
such as inclusion of contraindications in the IFU). 
 
e. Evaluation of acceptability of the benefit/risk profile 
• 
Evaluate if the clinical data on benefits and risks are acceptable for all medical conditions 
and target populations covered by the intended purpose when compared with the current 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 46 of 65 
state of the art in the corresponding medical field and whether limitations need to be 
considered for some populations and/or medical conditions.  
• 
The current knowledge/ state of the art therefore needs to be identified and defined, 
possibly also relevant benchmark devices and medical alternatives available to the target 
population. Typically, documentation of the clinical background shall include the following 
information: 
- clinical background  
- information on the clinical condition(s) to be treated, managed, or diagnosed 
- prevalence of the condition(s)  
- natural course of the condition(s) 
- other devices, medical alternatives available to the target population, including evidence 
of clinical performance and safety 
- 
historical treatments 
- 
medical options available to the target population (including conservative, 
surgical and medicinal) 
- 
existing devices, benchmark devices 
• 
Sufficient detail of the clinical background is needed so that the state of the art can be 
accurately characterised in terms of clinical performance, and clinical safety profile. The 
selection of clinical data that characterises the state of the art should be objective and not 
selective of data on the basis of being favourable for the device under evaluation. 
Information should be provided on alternative approaches that have been used or 
considered and their benefits and drawbacks. Deficiencies in current therapies should be 
identified from a critical and comprehensive review of relevant published literature. The 
literature review should demonstrate if the device addresses a significant gap in healthcare 
provision. Where there is no such clinical need, the design solution needs to show an 
improved or at least equivalent benefit/risk profile compared to existing products or 
therapies. 
• 
If or when treatment comparability versus accepted therapy is not available at the time of 
placing on the market, this should be clearly described in the device IFU. 
• 
Even if a device cannot compete with an agreed first-line treatment or the best in class, it 
may add to the portfolio of acceptable treatments, as even a first-line treatment will likely 
have contraindications or non-responders.  
• 
Devices, that might not be best-in-class, might provide sufficient clinical evidence for an 
acceptable benefit/risk-profile for specific, defined subgroups or even superior clinical 
performance under specific conditions (e.g. emergency outdoor conditions).  
• 
The position within the treatment portfolio has to be specified properly in the clinical 
evaluation report and other relevant documentation.  
Example: A system for deep brain stimulation has a proven effectiveness for the treatment 
of depression. However, the implantation of electrodes in the brain is associated with major 
risks. Less invasive treatment options are available to patients suffering from depression. 
Taking into account the available treatment portfolio, the manufacturer has limited the 
medical indication of the device to "therapy resistant depression", which is reflected in the 
IFU and in other relevant documentation.

A7.3. Conformity 
assessment 
with 
requirement 
on 
performance  
(MDD ER3 / AIMDD ER2) 
The devices must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer. The ability of a medical 
device to achieve its intended purpose as claimed by the manufacturer needs to be demonstrated, 
including any direct or indirect medical effects on humans as well as the clinical benefit on patients 
resulting from the technical or functional, including diagnostic characteristics of a device, when 
used as intended by the manufacturer. 
Clinical performance includes any claims about clinical properties and safety of the device that the 
manufacturer intends to use. It is expected: 
• 
that the devices achieve their intended performances during normal conditions of use, and  
• 
that the intended performances are supported by sufficient clinical evidence. 
 
Evaluation of clinical performance can vary widely between device groups, especially between 
therapeutic and diagnostic devices. The following list gives examples of performance data relevant 
particularly to diagnostic devices:  
• 
Reproducibility of independent acquisition of images (same patient, same machine, 
different operator and interpreter). 
• 
Reproducibility of independent reporting of images (same patient, same machine, same 
images, different interpreter/analyser). 
• 
Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the test for major clinical indications; positive and 
negative predictive values according to varying pre-test probabilities. 
• 
Comparisons of performance of new iterations of diagnostic software against previous 
software versions. 
• 
Normal values by age and gender, covering all groups in which the diagnostic system may 
be used. 
 
A7.4. Conformity assessment with requirement on acceptability of undesirable side-effects 
(MDD ER6 / AIMDD ER5) 
Any undesirable side-effect must constitute an acceptable risk when weighed against the 
performances intended. 
In order to evaluate the acceptability of the side-effects of a device: 
• 
there needs to be clinical data for the evaluation of the nature, severity and frequency of 
potential undesirable side-effects; 
• 
the clinical data should contain an adequate number of observations (e.g. from clinical 
investigations or PMS) to guarantee the scientific validity of the conclusions relating to 
undesirable side-effects and the performance of the device; 
• 
in order to evaluate if undesirable side-effects are acceptable, consideration has to be given 
to the state of the art, including properties of benchmark devices and medical alternatives 
that are currently available to the patients, and reference to objective performance criteria 
from applicable standards and guidance documents. 
If there is lack of clinical data or an insufficient number of observations, conformity with the 
requirement on acceptability of undesirable side-effects is not fulfilled.  
 
Example:  


A reasonable probability (80%) of observing at least one event of an undesirable side-effect when 
15 subjects are studied requires a side-effect with an actual probability of 10%. If only 15 patients 
have been studied, from a statistical point of view, there could be serious side-effects with an 
actual probability of 10% that have not had a reasonable chance to be detected. The device would 
only be acceptable (for any type and severity of undesirable side-effects), if that magnitude is 
acceptable when weighted against the performance of the device and the current state of the art.  
The table below shows corresponding numbers for undesirable side-effects with an actual 
probability of 10%, 5% and 1%. 

|  | Case 1 | Case 2 | Case 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chance of observing at least 1 event (P) | 80% | 80% | 80% |
| Actual probability of event | 10% | 5% | 1% |
| Number of subjects studied (n) | 15 | 32 | 161 |

 
The threshold proposed as acceptable for any new device will depend on the severity and 
detectability of side effects concerned. 
 
 
A8. Devices for unmet medical needs - aspects to consider 
Like all medical devices, medical devices for unmet medical needs must fully comply with the 
Essential Requirements in order to be CE-marked. The evaluators should assess whether devices 
deliver clinical benefits to patients for 
•
 
medical conditions that are life threatening, or cause permanent impairment of a body 
function, and 
•
 
for which current medical alternatives are insufficient or carry significant risks.  
 
Corresponding devices are referred to as "breakthrough products" in this Appendix. 
a. Breakthrough products 
In exceptional cases, major benefits may justify relatively high levels of uncertainty, and access 
to the market may be granted on the basis of limited clinical evidence such as 
•
 
experience available from compassionate use/ humanitarian exemption programs, use of 
custom-made devices, results of feasibility studies;  
•
 
limited long-term data.  
 
In addition to general aspects described in this MEDDEV document, the evaluators should fully 
disclose the situation and address the following items in the clinical evaluation report: 
•
 
the exact intended purpose, including the medical indication (if applicable to the device), the 
product was developed for and whether residual risks and uncertainties or unanswered 
questions are considered acceptable in this indication (often a niche indication); 
•
 
explanations of why current medical alternatives are considered to be insufficient or to carry 
significant risks;  
•
 
explanations of the benefits delivered by the device under evaluation; 
 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 48 of 65 

 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 49 of 65 
• 
whether the IFU clearly describe 
- the exact intended purpose (including medical indications) and any limitations, 
- the limited clinical experience,  
- uncertainties or unanswered questions about residual risks and benefits to patients19; 
• 
the need to set up a stringent PMCF plan with information on 
- the type and quality of data that needs to be generated in the post-market phase in order 
to further evaluate the clinical performance and clinical safety of the device;  
- how to generate data in a timely manner and aspects thereof, including projections on 
the numbers of patients that will be managed with the device per year; 
- in the following cases, the manufacturer should aim at including all patients in PMCF 
studies: 
- a device that carries significant risks (i.e. expected to cause serious adverse 
events), or 
- a device for rare diseases.  
• 
the need to actively update the clinical evaluation report when new significant information 
become available, and in accordance with Section 6.2.3 b of the present document. 
 
In these exceptional cases, notified bodies should perform annual assessments of the updated 
clinical evaluation reports and the results of PMCF studies.  
 
b. Subsequent products 
Devices that enter the market subsequent to a therapeutic/ diagnostic breakthrough can not be 
judged by the same criteria as listed above for breakthrough devices. When performing a 
clinical evaluation for these devices, the following considerations should be taken into account: 
• 
when a device enters the market subsequent to a therapeutic/diagnostic breakthrough, 
clinical evidence is likely to have evolved rapidly since the first breakthrough device 
became available  
• 
with the evolving body of evidence, entering the market with large uncertainty may no 
longer be legitimate  
• 
if PMCF data are required, PMCF Studies should also be foreseen for devices that enter 
the market subsequent to a therapeutic/ therapeutic breakthrough 
 
 
A9. Clinical evaluation report - proposed table of contents, examples of 
contents 
Examples of contents that are shown in the table are for illustration. The contents of the clinical 
evaluation report will vary according to the nature and history of the device under evaluation. 
 
                                                
 
19  Example: “No serious long-term adverse effects have been reported to date”. This would be an 
inadequate description of limited experience and of uncertainties as to residual risks.

A10. Proposed checklist for the release of the clinical evaluation report 
The following aspects should be checked for the release of a clinical evaluation report:  
•
 
Can the report be read and understood by a third party, does it provide sufficient detail for 
understanding the data that are available, all assumptions made and all conclusions 
reached?  
•
 
If clinical data have been generated and are held by the manufacturer, are all data 
mentioned and adequately summarised in the report? 
•
 
If equivalence is claimed,  
- is demonstration of equivalence included in the report? 
- does the report disclose all the differences between the device under evaluation and the 
equivalent device?  
- does it explain why the differences are not expected to affect the clinical performance 
and clinical safety of the device? 
•
 
If the product is already in the market in Europe or elsewhere, has the latest PMS/ PMCF 
data been taken into consideration and has it been summarised and referenced in the 
report? 
•
 
In respect to current knowledge/ the state of the art,  
- has the report been updated? 
- is current knowledge/ the state of the art summarised in the report and is it adequately 
substantiated by literature? 
- does the content of the report fully correspond to current knowledge/ the state of the art? 
- does the report explain why the benefit/risk profile and the undesirable side-effects are 
acceptable in relation to current knowledge/ the state of the art?  
•
 
If the report covers several models/ sizes/ settings and/or different clinical situations, is 
there sufficient clinical evidence and are the report’s conclusions correct for 
- all the devices? 
- all its sizes, models and settings?  
(including the smallest/ largest size, highest/ lowest dose, etc.) 
- every medical indication?  
(as described in the IFU/ not excluded with contraindications in the IFU) 
- the entire target population?  
(from pre term infants to old age, for males and females, etc., if not restricted in the IFU) 
- every form, stage and severity of the medical condition, as applicable?  
 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 55 of 65 

 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 56 of 65 
(including the most severe/ most benign forms, acute/ chronic stage, if not excluded in 
the IFU) 
- all intended users?  
(including lay persons, if not excluded in the IFU, and any unusual user group) 
- the whole duration of product use, including the maximal number of repeated exposure? 
(as allowed by the IFU) 
- if there are any discrepancies as to the above, are they identified in the report’s 
conclusions? 
• 
Is conformity to each of the relevant Essential Requirements (AIMDD ER1,2,5 / MDD 
ER1,3,6 ) clearly stated and are all discrepancies identified in the report’s conclusions? 
• 
Do the information materials supplied by the manufacturer correspond with the contents of 
the report and are all discrepancies identified in the report’s conclusions? 
• 
Do the report’s conclusions identify all residual risks and uncertainties or unanswered 
questions that should be addressed with PMS/ PMCF studies? 
• 
Is the report dated? 
• 
Is the qualification of the evaluators included in the report and correct? 
• 
Does the manufacturer hold a CV and declaration of interests of each of the evaluators and 
are these up-to-date?  
 
 
A11. Information on declarations of interests 
Declarations of interests of the evaluators should be held by the manufacturer and cover relevant 
financial interests outside the current work as an evaluator. 
Declarations of interests should contain statements that clarify the extent of the declaration.  
For example: 
- 
the time span included (e.g. grants, sources of revenue or benefits paid or promised to 
be paid over the 36 months prior to the evaluation) 
- 
whether financial interests of family members are included or not (namely spouse or 
partner living in the same residence as the evaluator, children and adults for whom the 
evaluators is legally responsible)  
Typical contents: 
- employment by the manufacturer 
- participation as an investigator in clinical studies of the device, or in pre-clinical testing of 
the device 
- ownership/ shareholding possibly affected by the outcome of the evaluation 
- grants sponsored by the manufacturer 
- benefits such as travelling or hospitality (if beyond what is reasonably necessary for the 
work as an employee or external evaluator) 
- interests in connection with the manufacturing of the device or its constituents 
- interests in connection with intellectual property, such as patents, copyrights and 
royalties (whether pending, issued or licensed) possibly affected by the outcome of the 
evaluation 
- other interests or sources of revenues possibly affected by the result of the evaluation 
 
The declaration of interests should be dated and signed by the evaluator and the manufacturer.

A12. Activities of notified bodies 
A12.1. Notified body assessment of clinical evaluation by conformity assessment route 
The notified body assessment of clinical Evaluation reports and the supporting data presented by 
manufacturers is required for all medical devices. The timing and frequency of the notified body 
reviews will vary according to the risk carried by the device, how well established the device is (see 
Section 6.2.3) and the conformity assessment procedure that is applied. 
 
This includes for medical devices in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC: 
• 
An audit as part of a quality system approval procedure (Annex II, section 3): 
- 
the notified body assesses the manufacturer’s procedure for clinical evaluation, PMS plan 
and PMCF plan and (if applicable) results of PMCF. 
- 
as part of the representative sampling of devices21; for review of their technical 
documentation the notified body assesses the clinical evaluation report presented for class 
IIa22 and IIb devices as presented below for a design dossier. 
• 
A design dossier (Annex II, section 4) or type examination dossier (Annex III) assessment:  
- 
the notified body assesses the data presented in the clinical evaluation report, 
- 
assesses the validity of the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer, and 
- 
the conformity of the device to relevant essential requirements. 
 
For active implantable medical devices in accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC: 
• 
A design dossier (Annex 2, section 4) or type examination dossier (Annex 3) assessment: 
- 
the notified body assesses the data presented in the clinical evaluation report, 
- 
assesses the validity of the clinical evaluation report and the conclusions drawn by the 
manufacturer, and 
- 
the conformity of the device to relevant essential requirements. 
 
The notified body should also have documented procedures to address the review of updates to 
clinical evaluation reports during their scheduled surveillance activities and at the time of changes 
to or extensions of EC design-examination/EC type-examination certificates. The review should 
take into account aspects described in Section 6.2.3. This arises from the obligation placed on the 
manufacturer to actively update the clinical evaluation with data obtained from PMS e.g. PMCF 
and ongoing literature reviews/surveys. 
In addition, notified bodies should refer to guidance, checklists and other documents available on 
the assessment of clinical evaluations by notified bodies from the Notified Body Operations Group 
(NBOG). These should be considered in addition to this guidance. Any such checklists are 
intended only as an aide memoire for assessment and should not replace the Clinical Evaluation 
Assessment Report (CEAR) outlined below.

page 58 of 65 
A12.2. Examination of a design dossier (Annex II.4; Annex 2.4) or of a type examination 
dossier (Annex III; Annex 3) 
The notified body examines the clinical evaluation documentation submitted (relevant 
documentation referenced in previous sections of this MEDDEV), assesses the manufacturer’s 
identification, appraisal and analysis of that data, and validates the conclusions drawn by the 
manufacturer. In order to do so, the notified body should possess enough knowledge and 
experience in clinical evaluation as stated in previous sections of this document. 
 
A12.2.1. 
Decision-making by the notified body 
In reviewing the evaluation of clinical data submitted by the manufacturer, the notified body verifies 
and concludes whether or not the manufacturer has adequately: 
 
- 
supplied clinical evaluation documentation (as referenced in previous sections); 
- 
followed relevant procedures (as addressed by previous sections); 
- 
described and verified the intended characteristics and performances related to clinical 
aspects; 
- 
performed an appropriate risk analysis and estimated the undesirable side-effects which 
are aligned with the clinical evaluation; 
- 
involved appropriate clinical expertise in the clinical evaluation and in the compilation of the 
risk analysis to ensure risks and benefits associated with real clinical use are adequately 
defined;  
- 
provided a solid justification as the basis for their estimations of benefits, risks, undesirable 
side-effects, indications and contraindications of the device in question; 
- 
justified the chosen route(s) of clinical data retrieval (according to previous sections); 
- 
identified, appraised, analysed and assessed the clinical data (according to previous 
sections) and demonstrated the relevance and any limitations of the clinical data identified 
in demonstrating compliance with particular requirements of the Directive or cited in 
particular aspects of the risk analysis; 
- 
identified all clinical data, favourable and unfavourable, that is relevant to the device and 
using an appropriately robust, reproducible and systematic search strategy; 
- 
provided sufficient clinical evidence relating to the safety, including benefits to the patients, 
the clinical performance intended by the manufacturer (including any clinical claims for the 
device the manufacturer intends to use), design characteristics and intended purpose of the 
device, in order to demonstrate conformity with each of the relevant essential requirements; 
- 
conducted and provided a critical evaluation of relevant scientific literature and data relating 
to the safety, benefits, performance, design characteristics and intended purpose of the 
device; 
- 
demonstrated the equivalence of the device under evaluation to the device to which the 
data relates in all necessary areas, i.e. clinical, technical, biological and that the data 
available adequately addresses conformity to each of the relevant essential requirements (if 
a critical evaluation of relevant scientific literature is provided as the only source of clinical 
data); 
- 
designed appropriate clinical investigations, when necessary, to address specific questions 
arising from the critical review of the scientific literature and address each of the relevant 
essential requirements; 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 59 of 65 
- 
provided specific justification if a specific clinical investigation was not performed for class 
III or implantable devices; 
- 
provided evidence that clinical investigations presented are in compliance with applicable 
regulatory and ethical requirements e.g. scientific validity, ethics committee approval, 
competent authority approval; 
- 
provided detail of the PMS plan in place for the particular device and justified the 
appropriateness and adequacy of this plan; 
- 
clearly identified which areas in the clinical evaluation and related data need to be further 
addressed and confirmed in the post-market phase, with specific alignment to the PMCF; 
- 
justified the appropriateness of the planned PMCF; 
- 
justified and documented if PMCF is not planned as part of the PMS plan for the device; 
- 
identified the sources of clinical data which will be gathered from the manufacturer’s PMS 
system and PMCF; 
- 
concluded that the contents of the IFU are supported by clinical evidence (description of the 
intended purpose, handling instructions, type and frequency of risks, warnings, precautions, 
contraindications, others) and are in line with the risk analysis and clinical evaluation; 
- 
concluded on the basis of documented evidence: 
a. that the risks are acceptable when weighed against the intended benefits and are 
compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety,  
b. that the intended clinical performances described by the manufacturer are achieved by 
the device, and 
c. that any undesirable side-effect constitutes an acceptable risk when weighed against 
the performances intended.  
 
The assessment carried out by the notified body will in addition typically confirm the following 
aspects of the manufacturer’s clinical evaluation: 
- 
appraisal to determine suitability and any limitations of the data presented to address the 
essential requirements in particular relating to the safety, and performance of the device as 
outlined in previous sections; 
- 
the validity of any justification given; 
- 
characterisation and evidence-based proof of the clinical performance of the device 
intended by the manufacturer and the expected benefits for the defined patient group(s); 
- 
the application of all relevant harmonised standards or appropriate justifications if not; 
- 
identified hazards to be addressed through analysis of clinical data as described in Section 
10; 
- 
the adequate estimation of the associated risks for each identified hazard by: 
- characterising the severity of the hazard; 
- estimating and characterising the probability of occurrence of harm, impairment of health 
or loss of benefit of the treatment (documented and discussed based on scientifically 
valid clinical data); 
- the adequate description and estimation of the current state of the art in the 
corresponding medical field; 
- a justifiable and reasoned basis for estimation of risks and hazards. 
Where a device incorporates, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, may be 
considered to be a medicinal product, the notified body is responsible for verifying the usefulness 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 60 of 65 
of the medicinal substance as part of the device prior to the submission of an application for 
scientific opinion from a medicines authority. 
For drug-device combination products and products incorporating stable human blood derivatives, 
where a scientific opinion from a medicinal competent authority or from the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) has been sought, the notified body should consider any comments or 
considerations raised in the medicinal clinical assessment when making its final decision on the 
device. In the case of devices with a human blood derivative the notified body may not deliver a 
positive decision to issue a certificate if the EMA's scientific opinion is unfavourable. 
 
A12.2.2. 
The report of the notified body 
The notified body should write a Clinical Evaluation Assessment Report (CEAR) based on its 
assessment of the submitted clinical evaluation report and supporting documentation. 
If a design dossier report is applicable to the device, the CEAR may be incorporated into this report 
or referenced from it. The report should clearly identify the notified body’s assessment, verification 
on each of the critical elements and overall conclusions.  
The CEAR at a minimum should address the notified body’s assessment of manufacturer’s 
application relating to the following: 
- 
device description and product specification 
- 
intended purpose of the device 
- 
classification proposed for the device 
- 
pre-clinical evaluation data presented by the manufacturer 
- 
risk analysis and risk management and alignment with the clinical evaluation report 
- 
clinical evaluation process 
- 
clinical evaluation report authors 
- 
equivalence assessment – if data from equivalent is used 
- 
clinical investigation plans and reports 
- 
justification if no clinical investigation has been performed 
- 
instructions for use, labelling and, when necessary, the training plan for users 
- 
justification if no PMCF is planned 
- 
PMS 
- 
PMCF 
- 
planned frequency/ criteria for updates to the clinical evaluation 
- 
summary of review 
- 
conclusion on clinical benefit/risk profile 
- 
conformance of the device to the relevant Essential Requirements 
 
The CEAR should also provide details relating to the submission and notified body review 
(including staff and experts involved in the review and the aspects assessed by each, signatures of 
responsible reviewers, etc.) 
The notified body should justify and document each step of the decision making process referred in 
section A12.2.1 above.  


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 61 of 65 
The CEAR at a minimum should include a summary of the information provided by the 
manufacturer relating to the following:  
- 
Record whether the clinical evaluation documentation is complete in accordance with this 
document and adequate to demonstrate conformance to the Essential Requirements of the 
relevant Directive. 
- 
Record the notified body's verification of each step of the clinical evaluation process, from 
the planning of the clinical evaluation, choice of route(s), identification, appraisal, analysis 
and overall assessment of the clinical data, to concluding and reporting 
- 
Record the notified body’s assessment of the clinical investigation data and/or literature 
review assembled, relevant procedures and compliance to relevant standards 
- 
Verify that the device has met the claimed performance/ intended purpose and benefits, 
and that undesirable side-effects and risks have been properly evaluated  
- 
Record the notified body’s assessment of the clinical safety, clinical performance and 
benefit/risk profile 
- 
Record the notified body’s assessment of the overall conclusions drawn by the 
manufacturer from the clinical data presented 
- 
Record the notified body’s assessment of the validity of the clinical evaluation and its steps 
- 
Record the notified body’s conclusions on the clinical evaluation, documenting each step in 
the decision making process as per Section A12.2.1. 
 
A12.2.3. 
Clinical data from an equivalent device and other products 
a. Equivalent devices 
The notified body should clearly document its assessment of clinical data presented from an 
equivalent device as part of a clinical evaluation. This should critically review and conclude on 
the equivalence or not of the device under assessment to the devices presented as equivalent 
in terms of their technical, biological and clinical characteristics. The relevance of each dataset 
from an equivalent device should be clearly evident and assessed by the notified body. 
The notified body should also assess and document the level of access to the technical and 
clinical data from an Equivalent device that the manufacturer has. Relevant information may be 
commercially sensitive/ confidential and not available to the manufacturer. The notified body 
should challenge the ability of the manufacturer to access information that are relevant to the 
demonstration of equivalence. Demonstration of equivalence might be difficult or impossible in 
case of limited access to the technical documentation of the devices. 
b. Other products 
For hazard identification and when assessing the benefit/risk profile of the device, the notified 
body should consider current knowledge/ the state of the art.  
The notified body should assess the appropriateness of the use of data from benchmark 
devices, other devices, and medical alternatives.

A12.3. Evaluation as part of quality system related procedures23 
A12.3.1. 
Review of the manufacturer’s procedures  
The notified body shall, as part of the review of the manufacturer’s quality system, assess the 
establishment, maintenance and application of the manufacturer’s documented procedures for the 
evaluation of clinical data. This should cover: 
a. the proper assignment of responsibilities to suitably qualified persons involved in the clinical 
evaluation (e.g. clinical evaluator(s), information retrieval expert(s), expert(s) in clinical 
research); 
b. the integration of clinical evaluation into the quality system as a continuous process, to be 
specifically inter-related to, and informed by, pre clinical evaluation and risk management; 
c. standard operating procedures to assure proper planning, conduct, evaluation, control and 
documentation planning of the clinical evaluation, identification of clinical data (previous 
section), literature searching (previous section), collection of clinical experience (previous 
section), clinical investigation (previous section and EN ISO 14155), appraisal of clinical data 
(previous section), analysis of clinical data (previous section), concluding, reporting (previous 
section) and update of clinical evaluation, procedures, reporting and updating based on data 
from the PMS system and from PMCF (MEDDEV 2.12/2 rev.2); 
d. document control as part of overall documentation of procedures, reporting, qualifications and 
technical documentation/design dossier(s); 
e. identification and evaluation of undesirable side-effects and of clinical performance(s). This 
involves identification of known or reasonably foreseeable hazards and verification of 
unfavourable and favourable outcome(s), qualification of their severity/magnitude and of their 
probability of occurrence. (It is part of the manufacturer’s documented risk analysis based on 
both favourable and unfavourable data identified as relevant in order to give a balanced view). 
 
A12.3.2. 
Review of the technical documentation of representative samples 
The notified body is required to assess the technical documentation for class IIa and class IIb 
devices on a representative basis. The clinical evaluation report should be assessed by the notified 
body for at least one representative sample for each device subcategory for class IIa devices and 
at least one representative sample for each generic device group for class IIb devices. Further 
representative samples have to be assessed as part of the annual surveillance assessment cycle.  
Regarding the choice of representative sample(s) the notified body will consider the novelty of the 
technology, similarities in design, technology, manufacturing and sterilisation methods, the 
intended purpose, and the results of previous relevant assessments. Assessment of representative 
samples includes assessment of the clinical evaluation report and available clinical data in 
accordance with the review procedure in this document rather than solely confirming that the 
manufacturer has a clinical evaluation procedure in place or that the clinical evaluation report is 
available. 
The criteria for the technical documentation assessment on a representative basis outlined in 
NBOG BPG 2009-4 should be applied. 
                                                
 
23  According to Article 11 MDD (Annex II.3 MDD, or Annex III MDD coupled with Annex IV, V or VI), and 
Article 9 AIMDD. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 63 of 65 
When performing the assessment on samples of a manufacturer’s clinical evaluation, the notified 
body will follow the steps indicated in previous sections of this document. 
A clinical evaluation assessment report should be completed and available for each device 
sampled and assessed. 
 
A12.4. Notified body specific procedures and expertise 
A notified body should have formal procedures in place controlled by their quality system relating to 
the assessment of clinical evaluation reports and associated data provided by medical device 
manufacturers. These procedures should also cover the review of updates to the clinical evaluation 
report during their scheduled surveillance activities and at the time of changes to or extensions of 
EC design-examination/EC type-examination certificates. 
Notified bodies should establish and implement internal policies and procedures for the 
assessment of clinical evaluation reports and associated data in order to: 
a. Ensure that suitable resources, especially clinical competence necessary for such assessment, 
are available within24 the notified body to conduct and manage assessments of clinical 
evaluations for the notified body, normally a qualified medical doctor. 
Such expertise should be sufficient to conduct a complete review of the clinical data and clinical 
evaluation presented for a particular device, to identify and estimate the risks and benefits 
associated with the use of the medical devices and to identify what, if any, specific clinical 
expertise is required for the full assessment of the device. 
The assessment team should be able to assess a risk analysis, the risk management strategy 
performed by the manufacturer, and the scientific validity of clinical investigations and 
publications.  
The assessment team should have sufficient expertise in the device technology as the 
associated medical procedures. 
Such an assessment requires input from a qualified medical practitioner (for example physician, 
dentist, nurse, etc.), as appropriate for the particular device, who has clinical experience in 
using the device or similar devices, the pathology of the condition being treated, the usual 
treatment, other medical alternatives, etc. 
The notified body clinical assessor may work with external clinical experts. The notified body 
clinical assessor should ensure that any experts are appropriately aware of the relevant 
legislation, guidance and standards and to identify specific aspects of the clinical data 
evaluation for their specific review.  
Notified bodies should have robust procedures around the recruitment, selection, training, 
conflict of interest and interaction with external clinical experts including clear procedures 
around how the expert opinion is documented and integrated with the notified body assessment 
and considered as part of the overall certificate decision.  
When examining the results of clinical investigations, the assessment team shall have 
knowledge in planning, conduct and interpretation of clinical investigations. All assessors should 
be appropriately trained and qualified. 
                                                
 
24  Annex XI.3 of Directive 93/42/EEC. This presupposes the availability of sufficient scientific staff within the 
organisation who possess experience and knowledge sufficient to assess the medical functionality and 
performance of devices for which it has been notified, having regard to the requirements of this Directive 
and, in particular, those set out in Annex I. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 64 of 65 
Particular attention should be drawn to training of external experts on the conformity 
assessment procedure(s), relevant guidance, standards and the context of the assessment they 
are providing. The notified body should be responsible for reviewing the opinion of these 
experts, taking account of their level of knowledge of the provisions of the Directives.  
The opinion of an external clinical expert may form part of the assessment conducted by the 
notified body. The opinion and conclusions of the notified body, in part based on this external 
opinion, should be clearly documented. 
The impartiality and the potential for conflict of interest of an external expert reviewer should be 
assessed and documented by the notified body. 
 
b. Review the clinical evaluation report and clinical data provided by the manufacturer. The 
notified body should verify the validity of key statements made in the clinical evaluation report. 
The notified body should consider  
- statements based on published literature using the full text version of publications; 
- statements based on clinical data generated from PMS systems in particular PMCF and 
source verification of such data; 
- statements regarding equivalence to other devices using the original full text version of 
pre-market study reports assessing parameters of interest. 
- statements regarding results of own clinical investigations of the manufacturer using the 
original full text version of the clinical investigation plan and the clinical investigation 
report. 
The review of the notified body should consider the scientific validity of the clinical data set 
presented as part of the clinical evaluation and decide as to whether it provides evidence that 
the clinical benefit outweighs all associated risks.  
The data presented by the manufacturer should be scientifically robust and well presented, it 
should be complete and clear in its reasoning and should be of sufficient quality and validity to 
demonstrate the conclusions which are being drawn.  
All clinical data relevant to the device in question, both favourable and unfavourable, should be 
considered, appraised and assessed by the manufacturer and likewise by the notified body. An 
absence of unfavourable data relating to a medical device should be carefully examined.  
Clinical evaluation reports which are based on incomplete, unclear or uncertain datasets should 
not be accepted. 
Clinical Evaluation reports which are based on incomplete clinical investigations or clinical 
investigations which were halted or terminated earlier than their intended duration should be 
carefully examined and a robust justification for halting or termination should be sought. The 
original endpoints, objectives and statistical basis for the manufacturer’s clinical investigation 
are unlikely to remain valid in circumstances when an investigation is completed prior to its 
original planned duration and so it is unlikely that scientific conclusions can be drawn. 
 
c. Document the opinion with rationale of all experts involved.  
 
d. Document the result of their assessment. This is achieved through a specific clinical evaluation 
assessment report which may be part of, or may be referenced, in the overall audit report, 
design / type examination report (as per A12.2.2 of this document) or the report on the 
assessment of representative samples’ documentation. 
 
e. Preserve confidentiality of the information and data received from the manufacturer, especially 
within the terms for contracting external experts. 


 
MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 
page 65 of 65 
 
f. 
Clearly identify how data from PMS conducted by manufacturers, vigilance and market 
surveillance information from competent authorities, PMCF data, and data from other relevant 
sources (e.g. clinical literature) is identified and reviewed by the notified body. This should 
clearly describe how, when and what criteria are used by the notified body to judge when a re-
assessment of the benefit/risk profile of a particular device is deemed necessary.
