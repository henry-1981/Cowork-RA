 ## Article 70

  ### Application for clinical investigations

   1. The sponsor of a clinical investigation shall submit an application to the Member State(s) in which the clinical investigation is to be conducted (referred to for the purposes of this Article as ‘Member State concerned’) accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex XV.

 The application shall be submitted by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 73, which shall generate a Union-wide unique single identification number for the clinical investigation, which shall be used for all relevant communication in relation to that clinical investigation. Within 10 days of it receiving the application, the Member State concerned shall notify the sponsor as to whether the clinical investigation falls within the scope of this Regulation and as to whether the application dossier is complete in accordance with Chapter II of Annex XV.

   2. Within one week of any change occurring in relation to the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex XV, the sponsor shall update the relevant data in the electronic system referred to in Article 73 and make that change to the documentation clearly identifiable. The Member State concerned shall be notified of the update by means of that electronic system.

   3. Where the Member State concerned finds that the clinical investigation applied for does not fall within the scope of this Regulation or that the application dossier is not complete, it shall inform the sponsor thereof and shall set a time limit of maximum 10 days for the sponsor to comment or to complete the application by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 73. The Member State concerned may extend this period by a maximum of 20 days where appropriate.

 Where the sponsor has not provided comments nor completed the application within the time limit referred to in the first subparagraph, the application shall be deemed to have lapsed. Where the sponsor considers the application does fall under the scope of this Regulation and/or is complete but the Member State concerned does not, the application shall be considered to have been rejected. The Member State concerned shall provide for an appeal procedure in respect of such refusal.

 The Member State concerned shall notify the sponsor within five days of receipt of the comments or of the requested additional information, whether the clinical investigation is considered as falling within the scope of this Regulation and the application is complete.

   4. The Member State concerned may also extend the period referred to in paragraph 1 and 3 each by a further five days.

   5. For the purposes of this Chapter, the date on which the sponsor is notified in accordance with paragraph 1 or 3 shall be the validation date of the application. Where the sponsor is not notified, the validation date shall be the last day of the periods referred to in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 respectively.

   6. During the period when the application is being assessed, the Member State may request additional information from the sponsor. The expiry of the period laid down in point (b) of paragraph 7 shall be suspended from the date of the first request until such time as the additional information has been received.

   7. The sponsor may start the clinical investigation in the following circumstances:

 (a) in the case of investigational class I devices or in the case of non-invasive class IIa and class IIb devices, unless otherwise stated by national law, immediately after the validation date of the application pursuant to paragraph 5, and provided that a negative opinion which is valid for the entire Member State, under national law, has not been issued by an ethics committee in the Member State concerned in respect of the clinical investigation;

 (b) in the case of investigational devices, other than those referred to in point (a), as soon as the Member State concerned has notified the sponsor of its authorisation, and provided that a negative opinion which is valid for the entire Member State, under national law, has not been issued by an ethics committee in the Member State concerned in respect of the clinical investigation. The Member State shall notify the sponsor of the authorisation within 45 days of the validation date referred to in paragraph 5. The Member State may extend this period by a further 20 days for the purpose of consulting with experts.

   8. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 115 amending, in the light of technical progress and global regulatory developments, the requirements laid down in Chapter II of Annex XV.

   9. In order to ensure the uniform application of the requirements laid down in Chapter II of Annex XV, the Commission may adopt implementing acts to the extent necessary to resolve issues of divergent interpretation and of practical application. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 114(3).
