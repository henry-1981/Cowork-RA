 ## Article 107

  ### Conflict of interests

   1. Members of the MDCG, its sub-groups, and members of expert panels and expert laboratories shall not have financial or other interests in the medical device industry which could affect their impartiality. They shall undertake to act in the public interest and in an independent manner. They shall declare any direct or indirect interests they may have in the medical device industry and update that declaration whenever a relevant change occurs. The declaration of interests shall be made publicly available on the Commission website. This Article shall not apply to the representatives of stakeholder organisations participating in the sub-groups of the MDCG.

   2. Experts and other third parties invited by the MDCG on a case-by-case basis shall declare any interests they may have in the issue in question.
