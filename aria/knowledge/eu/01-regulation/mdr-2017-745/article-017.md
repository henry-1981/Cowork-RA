 ## Article 17

  ### Single-use devices and their reprocessing

   1. Reprocessing and further use of single-use devices may only take place where permitted by national law and only in accordance with this Article.

   2. Any natural or legal person who reprocesses a single-use device to make it suitable for further use within the Union shall be considered to be the manufacturer of the reprocessed device and shall assume the obligations incumbent on manufacturers laid down in this Regulation, which include obligations relating to the traceability of the reprocessed device in accordance with Chapter III of this Regulation. The reprocessor of the device shall be considered to be a producer for the purpose of Article 3(1) of Directive 85/374/EEC.

   3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, as regards single-use devices that are reprocessed and used within a health institution, Member States may decide not to apply all of the rules relating to manufacturers' obligations laid down in this Regulation provided that they ensure that:

 (a) the safety and performance of the reprocessed device is equivalent to that of the original device and the requirements in points (a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of Article 5(5) are complied with;

 (b) the reprocessing is performed in accordance with CS detailing the requirements concerning:

 — risk management, including the analysis of the construction and material, related properties of the device (reverse engineering) and procedures to detect changes in the design of the original device as well as of its planned application after reprocessing,

 — the validation of procedures for the entire process, including cleaning steps,

 — the product release and performance testing,

 — the quality management system,

 — the reporting of incidents involving devices that have been reprocessed, and

 — the traceability of reprocessed devices.

 Member States shall encourage, and may require, health institutions to provide information to patients on the use of reprocessed devices within the health institution and, where appropriate, any other relevant information on the reprocessed devices that patients are treated with.

 Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of the national provisions introduced pursuant to this paragraph and the grounds for introducing them. The Commission shall keep the information publicly available.

   4. Member States may choose to apply the provisions referred to in paragraph 3 also as regards single-use devices that are reprocessed by an external reprocessor at the request of a health institution, provided that the reprocessed device in its entirety is returned to that health institution and the external reprocessor complies with the requirements referred to in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 3.

   5. The Commission shall adopt, in accordance with Article 9(1), the necessary CS referred to in point (b) of paragraph 3 by 26 May 2020. Those CS shall be consistent with the latest scientific evidence and shall address the application of the general requirements on safety and performance laid down in in this Regulation. In the event that those CS are not adopted by 26 May 2020, reprocessing shall be performed in accordance with any relevant harmonised standards and national provisions that cover the aspects outlined in point (b) of paragraph 3. Compliance with CS or, in the absence of CS, with any relevant harmonised standards and national provisions, shall be certified by a notified body.

   6. Only single-use devices that have been placed on the market in accordance with this Regulation, or prior to 26 May 2020 in accordance with Directive 93/42/EEC, may be reprocessed.

   7. Only reprocessing of single-use devices that is considered safe according to the latest scientific evidence may be carried out.

   8. The name and address of the legal or natural person referred to in paragraph 2 and the other relevant information referred to in Section 23 of Annex I shall be indicated on the label and, where applicable, in the instructions for use of the reprocessed device.

 The name and address of the manufacturer of the original single-use device shall no longer appear on the label, but shall be mentioned in the instructions for use of the reprocessed device.

   9. A Member State that permits reprocessing of single-use devices may maintain or introduce national provisions that are stricter than those laid down in this Regulation and which restrict or prohibit, within its territory, the following:

 (a) the reprocessing of single-use devices and the transfer of single-use devices to another Member State or to a third country with a view to their reprocessing;

 (b) the making available or further use of reprocessed single-use devices.

 Member States shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of those national provisions. The Commission shall make such information publicly available.

   10. The Commission shall by 27 May 2024 draw up a report on the operation of this Article and submit it to the European Parliament and to the Council. On the basis of that report, the Commission shall, if appropriate, make proposals for amendments to this Regulation.
