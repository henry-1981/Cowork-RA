 ## Article 74

  ### Coordinated assessment procedure for performance studies

   1. By means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69, the sponsor of a performance study to be conducted in more than one Member State may submit, for the purpose of Article 66, a single application that, upon receipt, is transmitted electronically to all Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted.

   2. The sponsor shall propose in the single application referred to in paragraph 1 that one of the Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted acts as coordinating Member State. The Member States in which the performance study is to be conducted shall, within six days of submission of the application, agree on one of them taking the role of the coordinating Member State. If they do not agree on a coordinating Member State, the coordinating Member State proposed by the sponsor shall assume that role.

   3. Under the direction of the coordinating Member State referred to in paragraph 2, the Member States concerned shall coordinate their assessment of the application, in particular of the documentation referred to in Chapter I of Annex XIV.

 However, the completeness of the documentation referred to in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2. of Part A of Annex XIII shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned in accordance with Article 66(1) to (5).

   4. With regard to documentation other than that referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, the coordinating Member State shall:

 (a) within six days of receipt of the single application, notify the sponsor that it is the coordinating Member State (‘notification date’);

 (b) for the purpose of the validation of the application, take into account any considerations submitted within seven days of the notification date by any Member State concerned;

 (c) within 10 days of the notification date, assess whether the performance study falls within the scope of this Regulation and whether the application is complete and shall notify the sponsor accordingly. Article 66(1) and (3) to (5) shall apply to the coordinating Member State in relation to that assessment;

 (d) establish the results of its assessment in a draft assessment report to be transmitted within 26 days of the validation date to the Member States concerned. By day 38 after the validation date, the other Member States concerned shall transmit their comments and proposals on the draft assessment report and the underlying application to the coordinating Member State which shall take due account of those comments and proposals in its finalisation of the final assessment report, to be transmitted within 45 days of the validation date to the sponsor and the other Member States concerned.

 The final assessment report shall be taken into account by all Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application in accordance with Article 66(7).

   5. As regards the assessment of the documentation referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, each Member State concerned may request, on a single occasion, additional information from the sponsor. The sponsor shall submit the requested additional information within the period set by the Member State concerned, which shall not exceed 12 days from the receipt of the request. The expiry of the last deadline pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 shall be suspended from the date of the request until such time as the additional information has been received.

   6. For class C and D devices, the coordinating Member State may also extend the periods referred to in paragraph 4 by a further 50 days, for the purpose of consulting with experts.

   7. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, further specify the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessments to be taken into account by Member States concerned when deciding on the sponsor's application. Such implementing acts may also set out the procedures and timescales for coordinated assessment in the case of substantial modifications pursuant to paragraph 12 of this Article and in the case of reporting of adverse events pursuant to Article 76(4) and in the case of performance studies involving companion diagnostics, where the medicinal products are under a concurrent coordinated assessment of a clinical trial under Regulation (EU) No 536/2014. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).

   8. Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the conduct of the performance study is acceptable or acceptable subject to compliance with specific conditions, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member State(s) concerned.

 Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, a Member State concerned may only disagree with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment on the following grounds:

 (a) when it considers that participation in the performance study would lead to a subject receiving treatment inferior to that received in normal clinical practice in that Member State concerned;

 (b) infringement of national law; or

 (c) considerations as regards subject safety and data reliability and robustness submitted under point (d) of paragraph 4.

 Where one of the Member States concerned disagrees with the conclusion on the basis of the second subparagraph of this paragraph, it shall communicate its disagreement, together with a detailed justification, through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 to the Commission, to all other Member States concerned, and to the sponsor.

   9. Where the conclusion of the coordinating Member State concerning the area of coordinated assessment is that the performance study is not acceptable, that conclusion shall be deemed to be the conclusion of all Member States concerned.

   10. A Member State concerned shall refuse to authorise a performance study if it disagrees with the conclusion of the coordinating Member State as regards any of the grounds referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8, or if it finds, on duly justified grounds, that the aspects addressed in Sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV are not complied with, or where an ethics committee has issued a negative opinion in relation to that performance study which is valid in accordance with national law for that entire Member State. That Member State shall provide for an appeal procedure in respect of such refusal.

   11. Each Member State concerned shall notify the sponsor through the electronic system referred to in Article 69 as to whether the performance study is authorised, whether it is authorised subject to conditions, or whether authorisation has been refused. Notification shall be done by way of one single decision within five days of the transmission, pursuant to point (d) of paragraph 4 of this Article, by the coordinating Member State of the final assessment report. Where an authorisation of a performance study is subject to conditions, those conditions may only be such that, by their nature, they cannot be fulfilled at the time of that authorisation.

   12. Any substantial modifications as referred to in Article 71 shall be notified to the Member States concerned by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69. Any assessment as to whether there are grounds for disagreement as referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 8 of this Article shall be carried out under the direction of the coordinating Member State, except for substantial modifications concerning sections 1.13, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of Chapter I of Annex XIV and point (c) of Section 2.3.2 of Part A of Annex XIII, which shall be assessed separately by each Member State concerned.

   13. The Commission shall provide administrative support to the coordinating Member State in the accomplishment of its tasks under this Chapter.

   14. The procedure set out in this Article shall, until 27 May 2029, be applied only by those of the Member States in which the performance studies are to be conducted which have agreed to apply it. After 27 May 2029, all Member States shall be required to apply that procedure.
