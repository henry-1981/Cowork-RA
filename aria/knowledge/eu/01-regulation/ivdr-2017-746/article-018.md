 ## Article 18

  ### CE marking of conformity

   1. Devices, other than devices for performance studies, considered to be in conformity with the requirements of this Regulation shall bear the CE marking of conformity, as presented in Annex V.

   2. The CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.

   3. The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly to the device or its sterile packaging. Where such affixing is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the device, the CE marking shall be affixed to the packaging. The CE marking shall also appear in any instructions for use and on any sales packaging.

   4. The CE marking shall be affixed before the device is placed on the market. It may be followed by a pictogram or any other mark indicating a special risk or use.

   5. Where applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the notified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 48. The identification number shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions that a device fulfils the requirements for CE marking.

   6. Where devices are subject to other Union legislation which also provides for the affixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the devices also fulfil the requirements of that other legislation.
