 ## Article 43

  ### Challenge to the competence of notified bodies

   1. The Commission, in conjunction with the MDCG, shall investigate all cases where concerns have been brought to its attention regarding the continued fulfilment by a notified body, or of one or more of its subsidiaries or subcontractors, of the requirements set out in Annex VII or the obligations to which they are subject. It shall ensure that the relevant authority responsible for notified bodies is informed and is given an opportunity to investigate those concerns.

   2. The notifying Member State shall provide the Commission, on request, with all information regarding the designation of the notified body concerned.

   3. The Commission, in conjunction with the MDCG, may initiate, as applicable, the assessment procedure described in Article 35(3) and (5) where there is reasonable concern about the ongoing compliance of a notified body or a subsidiary or subcontractor of the notified body with the requirements set out in Annex VII and where the investigation by the authority responsible for notified bodies is not deemed to have fully addressed the concerns or upon request of the authority responsible for notified bodies. The reporting and outcome of that assessment shall follow the principles of Article 35. Alternatively, depending on the severity of the issue, the Commission, in conjunction with the MDCG, may request that the authority responsible for notified bodies allow the participation of up to two experts from the list established pursuant to Article 36 in an on-site assessment as part of the planned monitoring and assessment activities in accordance with Article 40 and as outlined in the annual assessment plan described in Article 40(4) therein.

   4. Where the Commission ascertains that a notified body no longer meets the requirements for its designation, it shall inform the notifying Member State accordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including the suspension, restriction or withdrawal of the designation if necessary.

 Where the Member State fails to take the necessary corrective measures, the Commission may, by means of implementing acts, suspend, restrict or withdraw the designation. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3). It shall notify the Member State concerned of its decision and update NANDO and the electronic system referred to in Article 52.

   5. The Commission shall ensure that all confidential information obtained in the course of its investigations is treated accordingly.
