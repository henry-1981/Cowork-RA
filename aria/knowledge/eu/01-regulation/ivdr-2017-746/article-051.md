 ## Article 51

  ### Certificates of conformity

   1. The certificates issued by the notified bodies in accordance with Annexes IX, X and XI shall be in an official Union language determined by the Member State in which the notified body is established or otherwise in an official Union language acceptable to the notified body. The minimum content of the certificates shall be as set out in Annex XII.

   2. The certificates shall be valid for the period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years. On application by the manufacturer, the validity of the certificate may be extended for further periods, each not exceeding five years, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the applicable conformity assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall remain valid as long as the certificate which it supplements is valid.

   3. Notified bodies may impose restrictions to the intended purpose of a device to certain groups of patients or users or require manufacturers to undertake specific PMPF studies pursuant to Part B of Annex XIII.

   4. Where a notified body finds that the requirements of this Regulation are no longer met by the manufacturer, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or withdraw the certificate issued or impose any restrictions on it unless compliance with such requirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the manufacturer within an appropriate deadline set by the notified body. The notified body shall give the reasons for its decision.

   5. The notified body shall enter in the electronic system referred to in Article 52 any information regarding certificates issued, including amendments and supplements thereto, and regarding suspended, reinstated, withdrawn or refused certificates and restrictions imposed on certificates. Such information shall be accessible to the public.

   6. In the light of technical progress, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 108 amending the minimum content of the certificates set out in Annex XII.
