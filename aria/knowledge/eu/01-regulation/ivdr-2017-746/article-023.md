 ## Article 23

  ### Medical devices nomenclature

  To facilitate the functioning of the European database on medical devices (Eudamed) as referred to in Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, the Commission shall ensure that an internationally recognised medical devices nomenclature is available free of charge to manufacturers and other natural or legal persons required by this Regulation to use that nomenclature. The Commission shall also endeavour to ensure that that nomenclature is available to other stakeholders free of charge, where reasonably practicable.
