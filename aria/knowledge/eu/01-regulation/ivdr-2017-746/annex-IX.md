 ## 2.3. Audit

 The notified body shall audit the quality management system to determine whether it meets the requirements referred to in Section 2.2. Where the manufacturer uses a harmonised standard or CS related to a quality management system, the notified body shall assess conformity with those standards or CS. The notified body shall assume that a quality management system which satisfies the relevant harmonised standards or CS conforms to the requirements covered by those standards or CS, unless it duly substantiate not doing so.

 The audit team of the notified body shall include at least one member with past experience of assessments of the technology concerned in accordance with Sections 4.3. to 4.5. of Annex VII. In circumstances where such experience is not immediately obvious or applicable, the notified body shall provide a documented rationale for the composition of that team. The assessment procedure shall include an audit on the manufacturer's premises and, if appropriate, on the premises of the manufacturer's suppliers and/or subcontractors to verify the manufacturing and other relevant processes.

 Moreover, in the case of class C devices, the quality management system assessment shall be accompanied by the assessment of the technical documentation for devices selected on a representative basis in accordance with provisions in Sections 4.4 to 4.8. In choosing representative samples the notified body shall take into account the published guidance developed by the MDCG pursuant to Article 99 and in particular, the novelty of the technology, the potential impact on the patient and standard medical practice, similarities in design, technology, manufacturing and, where applicable, sterilisation methods, the intended purpose and the results of any previous relevant assessments that have been carried out in accordance with this Regulation. The notified body in question shall document its rationale for the samples taken.

 If the quality management system conforms to the relevant provisions of this Regulation, the notified body shall issue an EU quality management system certificate. The notified body shall notify the manufacturer of tits decision to issue the certificate. The decision shall contain the conclusions of the audit and a reasoned report.

 2.4. The manufacturer in question shall inform the notified body which approved the quality management system of any plan for substantial changes to the quality management system, or the device-range covered. The notified body shall assess the changes proposed, determine the need for additional audits and verify whether, after those changes, the quality management system still meets the requirements referred to in Section 2.2. It shall notify the manufacturer of its decision which shall contain the conclusions of the assessment, and where applicable, conclusions of additional audits. The approval of any substantial change to the quality management system or the device-range covered shall take the form of a supplement to the EU quality management system certificate.

 ## 3. Surveillance assessment applicable to class C and class D devices

 3.1. The aim of surveillance is to ensure that the manufacturer duly fulfils the obligations arising from the approved quality management system.

 3.2. The manufacturer shall give authorisation to the notified body to carry out all the necessary audits, including on-site audits, and supply it with all relevant information, in particular:

 — the documentation on its quality management system,

Those audits and assessments shall include audits on the premises of the manufacturer and, if appropriate, of the manufacturer's suppliers and/or subcontractors. At the time of such on-site audits, the notified body shall, where necessary, carry out or ask for tests in order to check that the quality management system is working properly. It shall provide the manufacturer with a surveillance audit report and, if a test has been carried out, with a test report.

 3.4. The notified body shall randomly perform at least once every five years unannounced audits on the site of the manufacturer and, where appropriate, the site of the manufacturer's suppliers and/or subcontractors, which may be combined with the periodic surveillance assessment referred to in Section 3.3 or be performed in addition to that surveillance assessment. The notified body shall establish a plan for such unannounced on-site audits but shall not disclose it to the manufacturer.

 Within the context of such unannounced on-site audits, the notified body shall test an adequate sample of the devices produced or an adequate sample from the manufacturing process to verify that the manufactured device is in conformity with the technical documentation. Prior to unannounced on-site audits, the notified body shall specify the relevant sampling criteria and testing procedure.

 Instead of, or in addition to, sampling referred to in the second paragraph, notified bodies shall take samples of devices from the market to verify that the manufactured device is in conformity with the technical documentation. Prior to the sampling, the notified body in question shall specify the relevant sampling criteria and testing procedure.

 The notified body shall provide the manufacturer in question with an on-site audit report which shall include, if applicable, the result of the sample test.

 3.5. In the case of class C devices, the surveillance assessment shall also include an assessment of the technical documentation as referred to in Sections 4.4 to 4.8 of for the device or devices concerned on the basis of further representative samples chosen in accordance with the rationale documented by the notified body in accordance with the third paragraph of Section 2.3.
