 ## Article 71

  ### Substantial modifications to performance studies

   1. If a sponsor intends to introduce modifications to a performance study that are likely to have a substantial impact on the safety, health or rights of the subjects or on the robustness or reliability of the data generated by the study, it shall notify, within one week, by means of the electronic system referred to in Article 69, the Member State(s) in which the performance study is being or is to be conducted of the reasons for and the nature of those modifications. The sponsor shall include an updated version of the relevant documentation referred to in Annex XIV as part of the notification. Changes to the relevant documentation shall be clearly identifiable.

   2. The Member State shall assess any substantial modification to the performance study in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 67.

   3. The sponsor may implement the modifications referred to in paragraph 1 at the earliest 38 days after the notification referred to in paragraph 1, unless:

 (a) the Member State in which the performance study is being or is to be conducted has notified the sponsor of its refusal based on the grounds referred to in Article 67(4) or on considerations of public health, of subject and user safety or health, or of public policy; or

 (b) an ethics committee in that Member State has issued a negative opinion in relation to the substantial modification to the performance study, which, in accordance with national law, is valid for that entire Member State.

   4. The Member State(s) concerned may extend the period referred to in paragraph 3 by a further seven days, for the purpose of consulting with experts.
