 ## Article 39

  ### Identification number and list of notified bodies

   1. The Commission shall assign an identification number to each notified body for which the notification becomes valid in accordance with Article 38(11). It shall assign a single identification number even when the body is notified under several Union acts. If they are successfully designated in accordance with this Regulation, bodies notified pursuant to Directive 98/79/EC shall retain the identification number assigned to them pursuant to that Directive.

   2. The Commission shall make the list of the bodies notified under this Regulation, including the identification numbers that have been assigned to them and the conformity assessment activities as defined in this Regulation and the types of devices for which they have been notified, accessible to the public in NANDO. It shall also make this list available on the electronic system referred to in Article 52. The Commission shall ensure that the list is kept up to date.
