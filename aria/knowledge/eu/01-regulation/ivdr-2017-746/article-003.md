 ## Article 3

  ### Regulatory status of products

   1. Upon a duly substantiated request of a Member State, the Commission shall, after consulting the Medical Device Coordination Group established under Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDCG), by means of implementing acts, determine whether or not a specific product, or category or group of products, falls within the definitions of ‘*in vitro* diagnostic medical device’ or ‘accessory for an *in vitro* diagnostic medical device’. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3) of this Regulation.

   2. The Commission may also, on its own initiative, after consulting the MDCG, decide, by means of implementing acts, on the issues referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. Those implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).

   3. The Commission shall ensure that Member States share expertise in the fields of *in vitro* diagnostic medical devices, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics, biocides, food and, if necessary, other products, in order to determine the appropriate regulatory status of a product, or category or group of products.

   4. When deliberating on the possible regulatory status as a device of products involving medicinal products, human tissues and cells, biocides or food products, the Commission shall ensure an appropriate level of consultation of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority, as relevant.
