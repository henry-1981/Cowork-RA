   2. In order to verify that the rights, safety and well-being of subjects are protected, that the reported data are reliable and robust, and that the conduct of the performance study is in compliance with the requirements of this Regulation, the sponsor shall ensure adequate monitoring of the conduct of a performance study. The extent and nature of the monitoring shall be determined by the sponsor on the basis of an assessment that takes into consideration all characteristics of the performance study including the following:

   4. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be implemented to protect information and personal data processed against unauthorised or unlawful access, disclosure, dissemination, alteration, or destruction or accidental loss, in particular where the processing involves transmission over a network.

   5. Member States shall inspect, at an appropriate level, performance study site(s) to check that performance studies are conducted in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation and with the approved investigation plan.
