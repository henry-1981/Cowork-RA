   2. For devices that are the subject of a conformity assessment as referred to in Article 48(3) and (4), the second subparagraph of Article 48(7), Article 48(8) and the second subparagraph of Article 48(9), the assignment of a Basic UDI-DI referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be done before the manufacturer applies to a notified body for that assessment.
