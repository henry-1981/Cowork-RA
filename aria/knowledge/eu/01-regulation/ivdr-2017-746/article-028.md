 ## Article 28

  ### Registration of manufacturers, authorised representatives and importers

   1. Before placing a device on the market, manufacturers, authorised representatives and importers shall, in order to register, submit to the electronic system referred to in Article 30 the information referred to in Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI, provided that they have not already registered in accordance with this Article. In cases where the conformity assessment procedure requires the involvement of a notified body pursuant to Article 48, the information referred to in Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI shall be provided to that electronic system before applying to the notified body.

   2. After having verified the data entered pursuant to paragraph 1, the competent authority shall obtain a single registration number (‘SRN’) from the electronic system referred to in Article 27 and issue it to the manufacturer, the authorised representative or the importer.

   3. The manufacturer shall use the SRN when applying to a notified body for conformity assessment and for accessing Eudamed in order to fulfil its obligations under Article 26.

   4. Within one week of any change occurring in relation to the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the economic operator shall update the data in the electronic system referred to in Article 27.

   5. Not later than one year after submission of the information in accordance with paragraph 1, and every second year thereafter, the economic operator shall confirm the accuracy of the data. In the event of a failure to do so within six months of those deadlines, any Member State may take appropriate corrective measures within its territory until that economic operator complies with that obligation.

   6. Without prejudice to the economic operator's responsibility for the data, the competent authority shall verify the confirmed data referred to in Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI.

   7. The data entered pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article in the electronic system referred to in Article 27 shall be accessible to the public.

   8. The competent authority may use the data to charge the manufacturer, the authorised representative or the importer a fee pursuant to Article 104.
