 ## Article 48

  ### Conformity assessment procedures

   1. Prior to placing a device on the market, manufacturers shall undertake an assessment of the conformity of that device, in accordance with the applicable conformity assessment procedures set out in Annexes IX to XI.

   2. Prior to putting into service a device that is not placed on the market, with the exception of in-house devices manufactured pursuant to Article 5(5), manufacturers shall undertake an assessment of the conformity of that device, in accordance with the applicable conformity assessment procedures set out in Annexes IX to XI.

   3. Manufacturers of class D devices, other than devices for performance study, shall be subject to a conformity assessment as specified in Chapters I, II except for Section 5, and in Chapter III of Annex IX.

 In addition to the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph, for devices for self-testing and near-patient testing, the manufacturer shall follow the procedure for technical documentation assessment set out in Section 5.1 of Annex IX.

 In addition to the procedures referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, for companion diagnostics, the notified body shall consult a competent authority designated by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (25) or the EMA, as applicable, in accordance with the procedure set out in Section 5.2 of Annex IX.

   4. Manufacturers of class D devices, other than devices for performance study, may, instead of the conformity assessment procedure applicable pursuant to paragraph 3, choose to apply a conformity assessment as specified in Annex X coupled with a conformity assessment as specified in Annex XI.

 For companion diagnostics, the notified body shall in particular consult a competent authority designated by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or the EMA, as applicable, in accordance with the procedure set out in point (k) of Section 3 of Annex X.

   5. In particular, and without prejudice to any of the obligations pursuant to the other procedures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4, for devices for which one or more EU reference laboratories have been designated in accordance with Article 100, the notified body performing the conformity assessment shall request one of the EU reference laboratories to verify by laboratory testing the performance claimed by the manufacturer and the compliance of the device with the applicable CS, or with other solutions chosen by the manufacturer to ensure a level of safety and performance that is at least equivalent, as specified in Section 4.9 of Annex IX and in point (j) of Section 3 of Annex X. Laboratory tests performed by an EU reference laboratory shall in particular focus on analytical and diagnostic sensitivity using the best available reference materials.

   6. In addition to the procedure applicable pursuant to paragraphs 3 and 4, where no CS are available for class D devices and where it is also the first certification for that type of device, the notified body shall consult the relevant experts referred to in Article 106 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on the performance evaluation report of the manufacturer. To that end, the notified body shall provide the performance evaluation report of the manufacturer to the expert panel within five days of receiving it from the manufacturer. The relevant experts shall, under the supervision of the Commission, provide their views, in accordance with Section 4.9 of Annex IX or point (j) of Section 3 of Annex X, as applicable, to the notified body within the deadline for delivery of the scientific opinion by the EU reference laboratory as specified therein.

   7. Manufacturers of class C devices, other than devices for performance study, shall be subject to a conformity assessment as specified in Chapters I and III of Annex IX, including an assessment of the technical documentation as specified in Sections 4.4 to 4.8 of that Annex of at least one representative device per generic device group.

 In addition to the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph, for devices for self-testing and near-patient testing, the manufacturer shall follow the procedure for technical documentation assessment set out in Section 5.1 of Annex IX.

 In addition to the procedures referred to in the first and second subparagraphs, for companion diagnostics the notified body shall for every device follow the procedure for technical documentation assessment laid down in Section 5.2 of Annex IX, and shall apply the procedure for technical documentation assessment laid down in Sections 4.1 to 4.8 of Annex IX and shall consult the competent authority designated by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or the EMA, as applicable, in accordance with the procedure set out in Section 5.2 of Annex IX.

   8. Manufacturers of class C devices, other than devices for performance study, may, instead of the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to paragraph 7, choose to apply a conformity assessment as specified in Annex X coupled with a conformity assessment as specified in Annex XI except its Section 5.

 For companion diagnostics the notified body shall in particular for every device consult a competent authority designated by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC or the EMA, as applicable, in accordance with the procedure set out in point (k) of Section 3 of Annex X.

   9. Manufacturers of class B devices, other than devices for performance study, shall be subject to a conformity assessment as specified in Chapters I and III of Annex IX, and including an assessment of the technical documentation as specified in Sections 4.4 to 4.8 of that Annex for at least one representative device per category of devices.

 In addition to the procedures referred to in the first subparagraph, for devices for self-testing and near-patient testing, the manufacturer shall follow the procedure for assessment of the technical documentation set out in Section 5.1 of Annex IX.

   10. Manufacturers of class A devices, other than devices for performance study, shall declare the conformity of their products by issuing the EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 17, after drawing up the technical documentation set out in Annexes II and III.

 However, if those devices are placed on the market in sterile condition, the manufacturer shall apply the procedures set out in Annex IX or in Annex XI. Involvement of the notified body shall be limited to the aspects relating to establishing, securing and maintaining sterile conditions.

   11. Devices for performance studies shall be subject to the requirements set out in Articles 57 to 77.

   12. The Member State in which the notified body is established may require that all or certain documents, including the technical documentation, audit, assessment and inspection reports, relating to the procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 to 10 be made available in an official Union language(s) determined by that Member State. In the absence of such requirement, those documents shall be available in any official Union language acceptable to the notified body.

   13. The Commission may, by means of implementing acts, specify the detailed arrangements and procedural aspects with a view to ensuring the harmonised application of the conformity assessment procedures by the notified bodies, for any of the following aspects:

 (a) the frequency and the sampling basis of the assessment of the technical documentation on a representative basis as set out in third paragraph of Section 2.3. and in Section 3.5 of Annex IX, in the case of class C devices;

 (b) the minimum frequency of unannounced on-site audits and sample tests to be conducted by notified bodies in accordance with Section 3.4 of Annex IX, taking into account the risk-class and the type of device;

 (c) the frequency of samples of the manufactured devices or batches of class D devices to be sent to an EU reference laboratory designated under Article 100 in accordance with Section 4.12 of Annex IX and Section 5.1 of Annex XI; or

 (d) the physical, laboratory or other tests to be carried out by notified bodies in the context of sample tests, assessment of technical documentation and type examination in accordance with Sections 3.4 and 4.3 of Annex IX and points (f) and (g) of Section 3. of Annex X.

 The implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 107(3).
