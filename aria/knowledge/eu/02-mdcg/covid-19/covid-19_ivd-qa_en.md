Types of test 
 
1. What is the difference between a medical device and  
an in vitro diagnostic medical device? 
 
A medical device is a device intended by its manufacturer for a medical purpose, such as treatment of 
disease, alleviation of a handicap or investigation of a physiological process1. A cardiac stent, an X-ray 
machine or a leg prosthesis are medical devices. They are regulated at EU level by two pieces of 
legislation: Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices (e.g. pacemakers) and 
Directive 93/42/EEC on other medical devices (e.g. the cardiac stents or X-ray machines). The 
Directives are to be replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 as of 21 May 2021. 
An in vitro diagnostic medical device is a subtype of medical device intended specifically for 
examination of specimens that come from the human body for a medical purpose, e.g. to give a 
diagnosis or to monitor treatment2. In contrast to the examples of medical devices in the previous 
paragraph, they are not intended for contact with the patient directly but rather for contact with 
specimens coming from the patient (such as blood or urine) or for analysing data coming from a 
specimen. In vitro diagnostic medical devices are governed by a specially dedicated EU law: Directive 
98/79/EC (and as of 26 May 2022, Regulation (EU) 2017/746, see question 6 and question 13). An in 
vitro diagnostic medical device must bear an indication that it is for in vitro use3 on its label, 
distinguishing it from a medical device.  
This document refers to placing COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests on the market under Directive 
98/79/EC, unless stated otherwise. 
 
2. What kinds of COVID-19 tests are there? 
 
There are broadly two types of COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests performed on specimens from the 
human body in terms of the scientific rationale: those detecting the SARS-CoV-2 virus (e.g. the RT-PCR4 
tests detecting the viral genetic material, or antigen tests detecting the viral protein) and those 
detecting the immune response of the human body to the infection (e.g. antibody tests).5

Tests can also be further classified by: 
- 
intended user (healthcare professional vs lay user, the latter are termed self-tests); 
- 
type of technology (automated, manual, or rapid tests which are non-automated and 
designed to give a fast result); 
- 
location of testing (sent off to a laboratory or performed near the patient, the latter also 
referred to as point-of-care tests). 
More information is available in the Communication from the Commission Guidelines on COVID-19 in 
vitro diagnostic tests and their performance6. 
The manufacturer may intend their test for a medical purpose (e.g. diagnosis of COVID-19). In this case 
they are termed in vitro diagnostic medical devices and they fall in the scope of Directive 98/79/EC9 
(see question 6) and must be CE-marked according to that Directive before being placed on the market. 
If the manufacturer intends their test for a non-medical purpose such as research, that Directive does 
not apply (see question 4).  
There are also tests that are done directly on patients rather than on specimens, such as computerised 
tomography (CT) scans. Such medical devices do not fall under the definition of in vitro diagnostics and 
they are covered by separate dedicated EU legislation (Directive 93/42/EEC). They are not covered in 
this document. 
 
3. What are in-house/lab-developed tests? 
 
In-house tests, or lab-developed tests, are devices manufactured and used within the same health 
institution, without being transferred to another legal entity7. They are not considered to be placed on 
the market and they are exempt from the requirements of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic 
medical devices. Nevertheless, they may be subject to national requirements8. 
These are distinct from devices for research use only, which are also outside the scope of Directive 
98/79/EC. 
 
4. What are research-use-only (RUO) tests in the context of COVID-19? 
 
In general terms research-use-only (RUO) products are outside the scope of Directive 98/79/EC on in 
vitro diagnostic medical devices because they are placed on the market without an intended medical 
purpose. RUO tests could be used e.g. for studying the distribution of antibodies in the population or 
to develop new drugs, but not for medical purposes such as diagnosing COVID-19 or making treatment 
decisions for a patient. The requirements of Directive 98/79/EC do not apply for such research uses.  
                                                          
6 OJ C 122I, 15.4.2020, p. 1–7 . 
7 See Article 1(5) of Directive 98/79/EC. 
8 For instance, national legislation may require that in-house tests fulfil the essential requirements.

The manufacturer’s information accompanying RUO products must explicitly state that they are for 
research use only, and they must not have instructions regarding diagnosis or other medical use, which 
are contradictory to the research-use-only purpose.   
 
5. Is there an EU database providing an overview of COVID-19 tests? 
 
At the moment, there is no exhaustive public EU database of CE-marked in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices on the market in the EU Member States. 
However, as part of EU efforts to provide guidance on the use of coronavirus tests, the Commission’s 
Joint Research Centre has created a database of COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic devices and test methods 
that gathers information on available tests in one place. 
The database contains publicly available information on devices, including elements of performance, 
and a collation of relevant scientific literature. It is regularly updated. 
It does not include manufacturer technical documentation, which is not publicly available. 
Although not an EU database, the page maintained by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics 
lists information on COVID-19 tests around the world.  
These databases do NOT represent a list of devices approved or authorised for use either by the 
European Commission or by Member State national authorities. There is no central approval or 
authorisation system for in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the EU (see also question 8). 
 
Legal framework  
for COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic medical devices 
 
6. What is the legal framework for COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests  
with a medical purpose in the EU? 
 
COVID-19 tests that are intended by the manufacturer for in vitro examination of specimens derived 
from the human body, with a medical intended purpose, are in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). 
The currently applicable legislation in the EU for such products is Directive 98/79/EC (see questions 3 
and 4 for some exceptions). The Directive specifies what intended purposes it covers9.   The 
requirements laid down in the Directive are of a general nature (see also question 7 and question 24). 
An introduction can be found in the European Commission services’ Guidance on medical devices, 
active implantable medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the COVID-19 context. 
                                                          
9 See Article 1 (2) of Directive 98/79/EC for a definition of in vitro diagnostic medical device and further 
specification of intended purposes covered.

The Directive will soon be replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. 
The Regulation will apply from 26 May 2022, but IVDs that comply with it may already be placed on 
the market on a voluntary basis. Please note that, as we are in the transition period, not all structures 
foreseen by the Regulation have been established yet and this may affect the possibility to place 
devices on the market under this framework (for example, as of January 2021, expert panels and EU 
reference laboratories are not yet in place). See question 13 for more information on the Regulation. 
This document refers to placing COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests on the market under Directive 
98/79/EC, unless stated otherwise. 
 
7. What are the procedures for placing COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic  
medical devices on the EU market? 
 
In summary, all kinds of COVID-19 IVDs described in question 2, provided they fulfil the definition in 
Article 1 (2) (b) of Directive 98/79/EC, must bear CE marking as proof of their compliance with the 
applicable requirements of Directive 98/79/EC to be placed on the EU market. It is the responsibility 
of the manufacturer to affix the CE marking on this type of product. 
Before affixing the CE marking, the manufacturer must first verify compliance of the device with the 
legal requirements, and prepare the technical documentation with evidence regarding the safety and 
performance of the device. This must cover a wide range of elements stipulated by Directive 
98/79/EC10, such as a general description of the product, the documentation of the quality system, 
detailed design information, the results of a risk analysis, adequate performance evaluation data, 
stability studies, labels, instructions for use etc.  
The manufacturer has to apply specific conformity assessment procedures to place the device on the 
market. The applicable procedures depend on the kind of device and are described in Article 9 of 
Directive 98/79/EC. 
For COVID-19 IVDs, the procedures depend on the intended user. They are different for tests for 
professional use, which are intended to be used by healthcare professionals, and for self-tests that are 
intended to be used by lay persons. 
 
For a COVID-19 device that is intended to be used by professionals, the manufacturer must 
draw up the EC declaration of conformity. They may then affix the CE marking to the device 
and place it on the market (these tests are frequently referred to as “self-declared” tests, 
although this term is not mentioned in the Directive). 
 
For COVID-19 devices that are intended to be used by lay persons (self-tests to be used at 
home), in addition to the above a third-party assessment body (a notified body) is involved. 
The notified body will ensure that the device design and the information provided for its use 
are suitable for non-professional users, and will issue the corresponding certificate (more 
information in question 16). 
                                                          
10 See Annex III (3) of Directive 98/79/EC.

A manufacturer located outside the EU must designate an authorised representative within the EU 
(see also question 17). 
Manufacturers, or their authorised representatives (see question 17), are obliged to notify the 
competent authorities of the Member State in which they have their registered place of business of  
the address of this place of business and of basic information on the device11. The competent 
authorities are not required to perform any verification of the device at this stage, and the notification 
does not constitute any “market approval” or similar (see also question 8). Notification is required 
under Directive 98/79/EC only for the Member State where manufacturers or authorised 
representatives have their registered place of business, i.e. Directive 98/79/EC does not impose 
notification of the device in every country where the device is sold. However, there may be additional 
national notification or registration requirements for market operators, such as registration of 
importers and distributors. 
In addition to these rules, some specific national requirements can also exist, such as language 
requirements for the information accompanying the device (for example, of the labelling and 
instructions for use). For further information please contact the relevant competent authority. The 
contact details of national competent authorities may be found on the European Commission’s 
webpage. 
More information on legitimate conformity documents can be found in the European Commission 
guidance document How to check if medical devices and PPE can be lawfully placed on the EU market 
in the COVID-19 context. 
 
8. Do national competent authorities, the European Commission or  
any EU agency approve or authorise COVID-19 tests? 
 
National competent authorities do not approve or authorise COVID-19 tests before they are placed on 
the market. There is also no central approval or authorisation for COVID-19 tests by European Union 
institutions, such as the European Commission, nor by any EU agency (for example neither the 
European Medicines Agency nor the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). 
The legally mandatory procedures the manufacturer must follow to place a test on the market are 
summarised in question 7, including the notification of tests to national competent authorities. For 
more information about the role of the competent authorities, see question 14. 
Under Directive 98/79/EC, manufacturers may place COVID-19 tests on the market without any explicit 
permission from authorities after they have declared the compliance of the product with the legislation 
and affixed the CE marking on the product themselves. For self-tests, the situation is different. A 
notified body must confirm that the device design and the information provided for its use is suitable 
for non-professional users and issue the corresponding certificate. This is an additional requirement 
before the manufacturer can draw up the EC declaration of conformity (see questions 7 and 16 for 
                                                          
11 See Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC.

more information). The EC declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer is always a 
prerequisite to place a device on the market, regardless whether it is a self-test or not. 
Therefore, statements that a manufacturer has “received”, “obtained” or “was granted” the CE 
marking, “EU/CE/CE-IVD approval/authorisation”, “permission for market access” or similar, are 
incorrect and should not be used for COVID-19 tests placed on the EU market under Directive 
98/79/EC. 
 
9. Is there an emergency market access procedure in the EU under  
the current legislation? 
 
Directive 98/79/EC foresees the possibility of granting a national derogation from conformity 
assessment procedure(s), if the use of individual devices is in the interest of protection of health12. 
Such a derogation can be issued by the competent authority of a Member State and is valid only in 
that Member State, i.e. it does not grant access to the EU market. The derogation would mean that 
the manufacturer can make the device available before completing all the conformity assessment 
procedures and CE-marking the device, e.g. before all the necessary safety testing took place. 
According to national requirements, such early market access is usually temporary until the 
manufacturer has fulfilled all conformity assessment requirements. After this, only the CE-marked 
version of the device can be marketed. 
Granting a derogation must be carefully considered by the national competent authority to ensure 
that the risks are outweighed by the benefit of having the device available for use and that this action 
is indeed in the interest of protection of health.  
An emergency use authorisation granted by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States of 
America is not valid in the EU.  
 
10. What legislation is applicable to swabs and lancets? 
 
Swabs for obtaining a sample of nasal secretions or lancets for obtaining a sample of blood are 
intended for direct contact with the human body. They are also invasive devices, i.e. they penetrate 
the body either through a body orifice or through the surface of the body. The applicable legislation 
has been explained in a guidance document endorsed by the competent authorities13. Such products 
are medical devices but not in vitro diagnostics, i.e. they fall in the scope of Directive 93/42/EEC and 
not Directive 98/79/EC (see also question 1). They must satisfy the requirements of Directive 
93/42/EEC and bear CE marking according to that Directive.

11. What legislation is applicable to combinations of swabs and  
lancets and COVID-19 tests? 
 
A test package could consist of e.g. a swab or a lancet, reagents and equipment to process the sample 
and obtain the result. Such a combination of several components that are made available together 
would constitute a kit, as mentioned in the definition of an IVD in Directive 98/79/EC14 and explained 
in a guidance document endorsed by the IVD competent authorities13. If the intended purpose of the 
kit falls under the definition of an IVD, the whole kit must be CE-marked according to Directive 
98/79/EC. However, the swab or the lancet, which is a medical device but not an in vitro diagnostic, 
must be CE-marked according to Directive 93/42/EEC (see also question 1 and 10) even if it is a 
component of the IVD kit.  
 
12. Where can I obtain further guidance on complying with Directive 
98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices? 
 
First of all it is essential to examine the text of the Directive 98/79/EC carefully to determine which 
legal requirements are applicable in your particular case.  
Secondly, a number of guidance documents endorsed by the EU competent authorities are available 
on the European Commission’s webpage. General guidance documents for the Directives are called 
MEDDEVs. They cover a variety of topics from borderline (determining whether a product is an IVD or 
not) to details of instructions for use. There are also several COVID-19-specific guidance documents 
issued by the Commission, notably:  
 
Guidance on medical devices, active implantable medical devices and in vitro diagnostic 
medical devices in the COVID-19 context   
 
How to check if medical devices and PPE can be lawfully placed on the EU market in the COVID-
19 context 
 
Guidance on COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests and their performance 
Please check the website regularly as further guidance may be published. 
There may also be additional national legal obligations, and guidelines at national level may also be 
available. You are strongly advised to research these and check the website of the relevant national 
competent authority. The details of the national competent authorities may be found on the European 
Commission’s webpage. 
In the case of devices that need to be assessed by a notified body, further information may be available 
on the website of the notified body.  
It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine exactly which steps must be taken to ensure 
that their device complies with the requirements of Directive 98/79/EC. While notified bodies,

10 
 
 
 
competent authorities and the European Commission may provide general information, they do not 
provide consultancy services to manufacturers to assist with compliance of their devices.  
13. Directive 98/79/EC is being replaced by Regulation (EU) 2017/746.  
What changes will it bring? 
 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 will come into application on 26 May 2022. It will significantly change the 
regulatory framework for IVDs in the EU. For example, it introduces a risk-based device classification 
system, replacing the simple list of high-risk devices under Directive 98/79/EC. COVID-19 IVDs will 
generally be classified in the highest risk class, class D15. The Regulation introduces assessment by 
third-party bodies independent from the manufacturer (the notified bodies) for the vast majority of 
IVDs, including COVID-19 devices. It lays down extensive and stringent requirements for device 
performance, for the studies that the manufacturer must perform and for the evidence he must furnish 
to show that the device is safe and performant. Novel devices will be further assessed by an 
independent panel of experts. Under the Regulation the Commission may designate EU reference 
laboratories to verify the performance of the devices. Importantly, the Regulation allows development 
of legally binding EU-wide rules on device performance (the common specifications).  
The Commission, Member States and stakeholders are currently engaged in intensive work to 
implement Regulation (EU) 2017/746. Please consult the European Commission’s medical device page 
for regular updates.  
 
Actors and their roles 
 
14. What is a national competent authority and what is their role  
for COVID-19 tests? 
 
A competent authority is a government body in a given country entrusted with the implementation 
and enforcement of the law in a particular sector, for example in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices. It may be a government department or an agency legally entrusted by the government to 
perform this function. The contact details of national competent authorities for medical devices may 
be found on the European Commission’s webpage. The European Commission facilitates cooperation 
and coordination among the competent authorities of the Member States. 
According to Directive 98/79/EC, Member State competent authorities do not assess files of individual 
devices before they are placed on the market. Manufacturers and authorised representatives (see 
question 17) do need to contact the national competent authorities to notify their devices and other 
basic information prior to placing them on the market.  
                                                          
15 The classification depends on the intended purpose as stated by the manufacturer, see Annex VIII of the 
Regulation.

The role of the competent authorities also includes designation and oversight of notified bodies 
involved in assessment of COVID-19 self-tests (see questions 7 and 16).  
The national competent authorities have the duty to engage in surveillance of devices already made 
available on the market16. As part of this, they may request the manufacturer to provide the full 
technical documentation or conduct testing of devices. The national authorities are empowered to 
take actions concerning non-compliant medical devices, which may include restriction, prohibition or 
withdrawal of products from the market. 
The authorities are also engaged in vigilance, i.e. the central recording and evaluation of serious 
incidents reported by manufacturers, medical practitioners etc. according to national rules. This could 
be e.g. a failure of a device which may lead to serious deterioration of a person’s health. The competent 
authorities may take appropriate measures in such cases to protect health and safety of patients, users 
or other persons. 
 
15. Who is a manufacturer of a COVID-19 test? 
 
According to Directive 98/79/EC, a manufacturer of an in vitro diagnostic medical device is the natural 
or legal person responsible for the design, manufacture, packaging and labelling of a device before it 
is placed on the market in their own name. This is regardless of whether these operations are carried 
out by that person himself or on his behalf by a third party. The manufacturer defines the intended 
purpose of the device, is responsible for following the legally prescribed conformity assessment 
procedures and for ensuring that the device is safe and indeed performs as intended. 
The Directive’s requirements for manufacturers also apply to persons who assemble, package, process, 
fully refurbish and/or label one or more ready-made products and/or assign them their intended 
purpose as devices to place them on the market in their own name. Please refer also to the European 
Commission services’ interpretative document on own brand labelling.  
 
16. What is a notified body and what do they do for COVID-19 tests? 
 
A notified body is a conformity assessment body, i.e. it is an organisation that carries out legally 
prescribed conformity assessment procedures for certain products (e.g. assessment of technical 
documentation, assessment of the performance evaluation report, assessment of quality management 
systems, etc.) as a service for manufacturers. They are public or private organisations, independent 
from manufacturers. Notified bodies are designated by the relevant national  authority to carry out 
such activities under a specific piece of legislation and are subject to constant surveillance by the 
designating authorities. Notified bodies are designated for the type of product to be certified. The 
                                                          
16 Such market surveillance activities are not in the remit of the European Commission or other EU institutions.

current list of notified bodies under Directive 98/79/EC, including the types of devices they can certify, 
can be consulted in the European Commission’s NANDO database here. 
The precise role of notified bodies for different types of products is described in the relevant 
legislation. For IVDs under Directive 98/79/EC, they are involved in the assessment of self-tests 
(intended for lay users) and certain high-risk devices listed in Annex II of Directive 98/79/EC17. For 
COVID-19 tests, notified bodies are not involved in conformity assessment of tests intended for 
professional use, as these are not listed in Annex II. However, they do have a role for COVID-19 self-
tests (i.e. those intended for lay users). For these tests, the manufacturer must submit an application 
to a notified body for the assessment of the design of the device, e.g. the suitability, for the lay user, 
of handling and information included on the label and instructions for use. Following a positive 
assessment, the notified body will then issue an EC design-examination certificate18. The assessment 
is usually by document review and not by physical testing of the device.  
Notified bodies are not responsible for affixing the CE marking on the device, as this is the duty of the 
manufacturer. Notified bodies only issue the certificate for the specific activity that they have carried 
out. For a COVID-19 self-test, the manufacturer will not be able to affix the CE marking until the notified 
body has issued the relevant EC design-examination certificate. More information on legitimate 
conformity documents can be found in the Commission services’ guidance document How to check if 
medical devices and PPE can be lawfully placed on the EU market in the COVID-19 context. 
Notified bodies are not to be confused with authorised representatives (see question 17) or competent 
authorities (see question 14). 
 
17. How can a non-EU manufacturer place a test on the EU market,  
and who is the authorised representative? 
 
Any manufacturer may place devices in the EU market if they are compliant with Directive 98/79/EC. 
Manufacturers with a registered place of business located outside the EU must fulfil the same 
requirements as those based in the EU. In addition, they are required to designate an authorised 
representative established in the EU, who will represent the manufacturer to authorities and bodies 
in the EU19. 
An authorised representative is not to be confused with a notified body (see question 16). Unlike a 
notified body, they do not assess the manufacturer’s documentation nor issue any certificates. 
One of the duties of the authorised representative is notifying the device to the relevant competent 
authority as described in question 7.  
 
                                                          
17 The notified bodies’ role for COVID-19 tests will be much broader under Regulation (EU) 2017/746, e.g. they 
will be responsible for certifying not only self-tests but also devices for professional use. 
18 See Annex III(6) of Directive 98/79/EC. 
19 See Article 1(2)(c) of Directive 98/79/EC for the formal definition.

18. Who are importers and distributors and what are their duties? 
 
Importers and distributors are economic operators involved in the supply chain of the device. 
Importers are natural or legal persons established in the EU that import devices from outside the EU 
and place them on the market. Distributors are natural or legal persons, other than the manufacturer 
or the importer, that make a device available on the market. Directive 98/79/EC does not lay down 
specific duties for importers and distributors20. However, there are usually national requirements 
applicable to them. Importers and distributors should therefore make themselves aware of the 
national requirements and if needed consult the competent authorities of the Member States where 
they intend to operate. The contact details of national competent authorities may be found on the 
European Commission’s webpage. 
19. What is the European Commission doing in the field of COVID-19 tests  
and their performance? 
 
Work related to COVID-19 tests is part of the European Commission’s comprehensive response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive information on this is available on the Commission’s coronavirus 
response page. Some examples are organisation of joint procurement of tests and lab equipment 
among Member States, facilitating exchange of information on testing strategies, matching supply and 
demand as part of the COVID-19 Clearing House and funding research projects on innovative tests.  
Concerning placement of COVID-19 in vitro diagnostic tests on the market, the European Commission 
chairs a forum of the EU competent authorities called the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG). 
It has a dedicated subgroup on in vitro diagnostic medical devices. This group oversees the 
implementation and application of EU legislation on in vitro diagnostics (Directive 98/79/EC and 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746) and issues corresponding guidance. The Commission may also adopt more 
specific legally binding measures to implement the above legislation, with the approval of the Member 
States. Please consult the European Commission’s medical device page regularly for updates. 
In addition to the above work with the competent authorities, on 16 April 2020, the Commission 
services have published a working document Current performance of COVID-19 test methods and 
devices and proposed performance criteria with an overview of test performance as of 6 April 2020 
and proposed performance criteria for different types of test, intended as temporary emergency 
guidance and input to the discussion on the topic by regulators and stakeholders. 
On 15 April 2020, the European Commission adopted a Communication titled Guidance on in vitro 
diagnostic tests and their performance. The Communication identifies a number of further actions 
needed in this area. The Commission is currently actively engaging in the follow-up of these actions 
by: 
 
facilitating regular exchanges of information between national competent authorities on 
regulatory issues; 
                                                          
20 This is in contrast to Regulation (EU) 2017/746, which does lay down requirements for importers and 
distributors.

can be found on the European Commission’s medical device page; 
 
working closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to make 
use of the agency’s epidemiological expertise; 
 
establishing and maintaining a centralised overview of devices and their performance; 
 
supporting the work of EUnetHTA, the European network of health technology assessment 
bodies; 
 
supporting research and innovation in the field of diagnostics, for example via the 
ERAvsCORONA action plan; 
 
developing tools such as reference materials; 
 
coordination of supply and demand via the specially created structure of the COVID-19 
Clearing House and via EU instruments such as joint procurement, rescEU and the Emergency 
Support Instrument. 
 
Regarding the use of tests, on 28 October 2020 the Commission adopted a Recommendation (EU) on 
COVID-19 testing strategies, including the use of rapid antigen tests. On 18 November, this was 
followed by the Commission Recommendation on the use of rapid antigen tests for the diagnosis of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 18 December 2020, the Commission adopted a Proposal for a Council 
Recommendation on a common framework for the use, validation and mutual recognition of COVID-
19 rapid antigen tests in the EU. The proposal was adopted by the Council on 21 January 2021 with 
text in EU languages available in the Official Journal. 
Please consult the Commission’s coronavirus response page and Commission’s medical device page 
regularly for updates. 
20. Do competent authorities have an overview of the devices  
that are placed on the market in their Member State? 
 
Manufacturers, or their authorised representatives (see question 17), are obliged by Directive 
98/79/EC to notify the competent authorities of the Member State in which they have their registered 
place of business of  the address of this place of business and of basic information on the device21. The 
competent authorities are not required to perform any verification of the device at this stage, and the 
notification does not constitute any “market approval” or similar (see also question 8). 
Please note that Directive 98/79/EC does not impose notification of the device in every country where 
the device is sold. However, there may be additional national notification or registration requirements 
for market operators, such as registration of importers and distributors. 
                                                          
21 See Article 10 of Directive 98/79/EC.

15 
 
 
 
Moreover, competent authorities engage in market surveillance and vigilance activities for devices 
present on the market (see question 14). 
21. How do I know who is the manufacturer, authorised representative  
and, if applicable, the notified body of a COVID-19 test? 
 
The complete name and address of the manufacturer are included on the label and in the instructions 
for use of the device. If applicable, the name and address of the authorised representative is included 
on the label, outer packaging or in the instructions for use of the device. 
If a device has been assessed by a notified body, which must be the case for COVID-19 self-tests 
intended for lay users, the CE marking will be accompanied by a four-digit number. This is the 
identification number of the notified body. You can find the details of the notified body in the European 
Commission’s NANDO database using the number.  
  
22. Who is responsible for ensuring that COVID-19 tests comply  
with legal requirements? 
 
The manufacturer has the responsibility to ensure that the device is safe, performs as intended and 
has up-to-date and complete technical documentation. The national competent authorities have the 
duty to engage in surveillance of devices already made available on the market22. As part of this, they 
may request the manufacturer to provide the full technical documentation or conduct testing of 
devices. The national authorities are empowered to take actions concerning non-compliant medical 
devices, which may include restriction, prohibition or withdrawal of products from the market. 
Besides the requirements for CE marking laid down by the Directive 98/79/EC, for clinical laboratory 
practice, many laboratories validate the devices they use against the manufacturer’s specifications 
and/or national requirements. There may be national legislation or restrictions for clinical laboratories 
and/or restrictions from public health authorities on what tests are used to provide COVID-19 testing 
for the public in that country.  
 
23. Has the sale of any COVID-19 testing kits been revoked in the EU? 
 
Actions against manufacturers are in the remit of national competent authorities. Several Member 
States have taken enforcement action to prohibit the making available of some devices, in particular 
certain rapid antibody tests, on their territory. Some devices were also refused registration (and 
therefore cannot be marketed) due to insufficient or incorrect documentation. 
For further information, please contact the relevant competent authority. The contact details of 
national competent authorities may be found on the European Commission’s webpage. 
                                                          
22 Such market surveillance activities are not in the remit of the European Commission or other EU institutions.

Performance of COVID-19 tests 
 
24. Does the EU legislation lay down any minimum levels of sensitivity  
and specificity of COVID-19 tests? 
 
Directive 98/79/EC obliges the manufacturers to evaluate the performance of their devices prior to 
placing them on the market and to report the performance parameters in the technical documentation 
and in the instructions for use. This includes analytical and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 
alongside a number of other parameters. The parameters must be adequate for the intended purpose 
of the device, as described by the manufacturer. 
Devices listed in Annex II of Directive 98/79/EC must also comply with common technical 
specifications23, which list some specific requirements on sensitivity and specificity for certain kinds of 
devices. These are legally binding. However, COVID-19 devices are NOT listed in Annex II, therefore 
there are currently no quantitative EU-level legally binding minimum requirements for sensitivity or 
specificity of these tests. However, the basic requirement that the performance of the device must be 
adequate for the intended purpose still applies – it is up to the manufacturer to demonstrate that this 
is the case.  
The EU Member States may have more specific national requirements and you are advised to contact 
the relevant national competent authorities for more information. The contact details of national 
competent authorities may be found on the European Commission’s webpage. 
 
25. Is there any specific guidance applicable to performance of CE-marked 
COVID-19 tests? 
 
There are legal requirements for performance of tests laid down in Directive 98/79/EC, in particular 
Article 3 and Annexes I and III. 
In addition, on 15 April 2020, the Commission adopted a Communication titled Guidance on COVID-19 
in vitro diagnostic tests and their performance. It includes considerations on device performance and 
validating that performance. It provides elements to be considered by Member States in defining 
national strategies, and by economic operators in placing devices on the market, with the objective of 
ensuring that safe and effective devices for COVID-19-related testing are available in the EU. In this

and other documents listed in question 18, the Commission recommends validation of the devices by 
the Member States and cooperation between Member States in efficient use of resources and 
establishment of a common framework for such validation activities. 
On 16 April, the Commission services published a working document Current performance of COVID-
19 test methods and devices and proposed performance criteria with an overview of test performance 
as of 6 April 2020 and proposed performance criteria for different types of test, intended as temporary 
emergency guidance and input to the discussion on the topic by regulators and stakeholders. 
Further guidance may be issued by the Commission or by the dedicated subgroup of the Medical 
Device Coordination Group (MDCG), the coordination forum of EU competent authorities chaired by 
the Commission. Please consult the Commission’s medical device page regularly for updates. 
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also issues epidemiological guidance 
on testing, such as the Options for the use of rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the 
UK. Please consult their webpage for more information. 
The Council Recommendation on a common framework for the use and validation of rapid antigen 
tests and the mutual recognition of COVID-19 test results in the EU, of 21 January 2021, recommends 
that the Member States should apply minimum performance requirements of ≥ 90% sensitivity and ≥ 
97% specificity for this type of test.   
As the follow-up to the Council Recommendation, on 18 February 2021, the EU Member States in the 
Health Security Committee agreed on a common list of COVID-19 rapid antigen tests, a selection of 
rapid antigen tests for which Member States will mutually recognise their results, and a common 
standardised set of data to be included in COVID-19 test result certificates. These three deliverables 
will be continuously reviewed and updated, and eventually available on the Commission’s COVID-19 
in vitro diagnostic devices and test methods database referred to in question 5. 
The Member State competent authorities may also issue guidance at national level. Please consult the 
relevant webpages or contact the relevant authorities. The contact details of national competent 
authorities are available on the European Commission’s webpage.
