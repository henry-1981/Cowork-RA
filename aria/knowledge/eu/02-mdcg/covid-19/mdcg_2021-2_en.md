Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and so is the market of in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices for COVID-19. In particular, many rapid tests1 for the detection of antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2 virus are becoming available. Determining what would be adequate performance 
for those tests is challenging. Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices2 
establishes that devices must be designed and manufactured3 in such a way that they are 
suitable for the intended purpose4 specified by the manufacturer, taking into account the 
generally acknowledged state of the art. The manufacturer should therefore justify why the 
device is suitable for the intended purpose claimed, in light of the state of the art. To facilitate 
the fulfilment of this legal requirement, the considerations presented in this guidance are 
intended to establish particular elements on the current state of the art for COVID-19 rapid 
antibody tests. It will also assist with understanding what the current state of the art is.    
For the purpose of this guidance, state of the art is the developed stage of current technical 
capability and/or accepted clinical practice with regard to products, processes and patient 
management, based on the relevant consolidated findings of science, technology and 
experience. 
Note: The state of the art embodies what is currently and generally accepted as good practice 
in technology and medicine. The state of the art does not necessarily imply the most 
technologically advanced solution. The state of the art described here is sometimes referred 
to as the “generally acknowledged state of the art”.5  
Therefore, state of the art does not refer to the best in class but rather to what is achievable 
by a majority of devices, and is therefore expected to be achieved by the devices on the 
market.6  
Naturally, the state of the art will improve over time. Therefore, the guidance presented here 
may be seen as the minimum expected from devices being placed on the market at the time 
of publication of this document. It may be revised or replaced by other documents as scientific 
knowledge and technology evolves.  
                                                          
1  Rapid tests are defined as qualitative or semi-quantitative IVDs, used singly or in a small series, which involve 
non-automated procedures and have been designed to give a fast result (Commission Decision 2002/364/EC 
on common specifications for in vitro diagnostic devices, OJ L 131, 16.5.2002, p. 17) 
2  OJ L 331, 7.12.1998, p.1.  
3  Note: this guidance is not exhaustive in its nature and should be read in conjunction with Directive 98/79/EC 
and other available documents and guidance. Aspects which are common to most IVDs and are not particularly 
specific to SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 rapid antibody tests have been left out of this document.  
4  It is important to note that additional requirements for self-testing exist and should be followed in addition to 
the indications provided here.

For reference see Commission Decision 2008/932/EC of 2.12.2008, C(2008)7378, OJ L 333/5 of 11.12.2008 on a 
certain HIV test of the manufacturer M.B.S. In the case in question, the combined data of various national institutes 
showed a picture according to which all HIV tests could be grouped into three tiers, grossly corresponding to three 
generations of tests. In that case, the HIV test in question was deemed not to correspond to the “state of the art” because 
it fell in the lowest performing tier.

Therefore, it is crucial that the manufacturer clearly specifies the device’s intended purpose, 
considering what levels of performance are needed and what aspects of the state of the art 
are relevant in light of that particular intended purpose. In addition, the manufacturer is 
expected to continuously take into account the state of the art as relevant new information 
becomes available and where necessary, update the device’s performance data, adjust the 
intended purpose, or, if this cannot be done, carefully reassess whether the device actually can 
be considered in conformity with the requirements of the Directive. 
 
Legal requirements of Directive 98/79/EC on device performance 
Directive 98/79/EC establishes that devices must achieve the relevant performance, in 
particular in terms of analytical sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity, analytical specificity, 
diagnostic specificity, accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, including control of known 
relevant interference, and limits of detection, stated by the manufacturer.7  
The intended purpose must be specified in the instructions for use and/or on the label, unless 
it is obvious to the user.8 For COVID-19 devices, it is always necessary to define the intended 
purpose. This should be complete and precise, including aspects such as : 
• 
the intended user,  
• 
the target population,  
• 
window between infection and antibody detection,  
• 
result interpretation (including limitations of interpretation),  
• 
assay design (target antigen(s), antibody types)9,  
• 
limitations of the assay,  
• 
whether the assay is intended, for example, to detect the antibody response in 
individual patients’ recovery, to assess if the patient has been previously infected, to 
assess response to vaccination,   
• 
the exclusion of antibody test use as first line test for diagnosis.  
The instructions for use must also describe the performance of the device with regard to the 
non-exhaustive parameters listed above.10 The technical documentation of the device must 
contain adequate performance evaluation data showing the performances claimed by the 
manufacturer. The data should originate from studies conducted in an environment targeted 
by the assay (e.g. clinical settings) or result from relevant references.11 The information on the 
establishment of performance should be complete to allow an assessment of its quality.  
For biological analytes such as virus specific antibodies there is no reference procedure of 
higher order. Therefore, the performance evaluation should be done in direct comparison to 
diagnostic device(s) measuring the same analyte which are estimated as reflecting the “state

(wild type or other variants).

of the art” at the time of the performance study (reference devices). Samples with discrepant 
test results obtained for the device under evaluation and reference (comparator) device should 
undergo further investigation (e.g. further assays, patient history) to clarify the probable “true” 
status, as far as possible.  
State of the art 
In the course of development of this guidance, 102 instructions for use of COVID-19 rapid 
antibody tests placed on the European market before September 2020 were examined in order 
to assess the state of the art from the perspective of real market performance. Performance 
criteria/considerations for devices used for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
published by different sources, including the WHO, were also reviewed. The outcome of this 
analysis was used as a basis for the following findings: 
1) Performance evaluation modalities 
The performance should be ideally evaluated for each claimed clinical specimen type unless 
equivalence between the relevant biological matrices has been demonstrated. 
• 
Interference studies: Standard interference studies should be performed and should 
take into account the typical potential sources of interference in the sample matrix in 
question. Please refer to pages 25-26 of the following document ‘Current performance 
of COVID-19 test methods and devices and proposed performance criteria - Working 
document of Commission services’ for more information.12  
• 
Cross reactivity studies: samples from patients with infection history of related 
viruses, e.g. SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, human common cold coronaviruses, or other 
respiratory infections (including influenza). Please refer to pages 25-26 of the following 
document ‘Current performance of COVID-19 test methods and devices and proposed 
performance criteria - Working document of Commission services’ for more 
information.12 
Note: Antibodies for other respiratory infection agents are considered as potentially pertinent 
cross reacting agents to be systematically tested in addition to other more usual cross 
reactants. As part of post market surveillance, it remains the responsibility of the manufacturer 
to continuously monitor the performance of their devices, including for new potentially cross-
reacting agents and update their relevant documentation, where necessary.  
• 
Diagnostic sensitivity evaluation: 
The positive sample panel should include at least 200 samples from individuals with a 
confirmed diagnosis of a SARS-CoV-2 infection with details on timing between sampling and 
potential onset of symptoms.  
Considering that diagnostic sensitivity depends highly on the time interval between the 
contact with the virus and sample taking, diagnostic sensitivity studies should use samples at

various stage and severity of disease and from putative infections. Samples could be 
longitudinal, drawn at different times from the same individuals. The positive sample panel 
should include early and later samples homogenously distributed in terms of the time interval 
between contact with the virus and sample taking.  
Depending on the intended purpose of the device, it may be difficult to get access to well-
defined panels reflecting the full diversity of potential antibody responses, representing e.g. 
different time points after infection, different follow-up courses of infection, asymptomatic / 
symptomatic infection, etc. Therefore, an option may be to use the device in parallel with an 
established device13 to investigate a representative set of samples, without preselection or 
exclusion of specimens, from a high incidence situation such as from a local or regional 
outbreak or from hospitals.   
• 
Diagnostic specificity evaluation:  
The negative panel should include at least 200 samples. 
The negative panel should consist of samples derived either from patients tested for 
antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 and confirmed as negative, or samples collected prior to 
November 2019. 
The negative samples should broadly represent the different factors present in the target 
population according to the intended purpose of the device.  Age, gender, demographics and 
additional factors such as previous disease history (e.g. non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract 
infections) or long-term medication of the patient should be considered.   
2) Diagnostic performance of the device 
Diagnostic sensitivities mentioned in the studied IFUs were heterogeneously determined, 
making it difficult to conclude on a minimum value reflecting the state of the art for this 
performance. It should nevertheless be noted that performance criteria/considerations 
published by different sources, including the WHO, for devices used for the detection of 
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 generally require at least 90% diagnostic sensitivity for each 
antibody type (IgM, IgG or total Ig).  
In the case of diagnostic performance established by comparison with a device used as 
reference, the diagnostic sensitivity should be at least equivalent to reference device(s), see 
Section “Legal requirements of Directive 98/79/EC on device performance”.  
Diagnostic specificity should be at least 98%. 
Confidence intervals should be provided for the estimates of both the diagnostic sensitivity 
and diagnostic specificity, 95 % confidence intervals are recommended.  
                                                          
13    Whereby an established device is understood as a device that meets the minimum performance requirements 
set in the present document.
