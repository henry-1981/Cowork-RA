Guidance on medical devices, active implantable
medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical
devices in the COVID-19 context
Question 1: What is a medical device, active implantable medical device and an
in vitro diagnostic medical device?
Medical devices are defined by Article 1 of the Medical devices directive
(93/42/EEC),
Active implantable medical devices are defined by Article 1 of the Directive on active
implantable medical devices (90/385/EEC),
In vitro diagnostic medical devices are defined by Article 1 of the Directive on in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (98/79/EC),

Question 2: What are the legal requirements for placing such medical devices
on the EU market and how should the compliance with them be verified and
documented?
In order to place a medical device of any of the three types on the market, the
manufacturer has to comply with the provisions of the applicable Directive mentioned
under Q1.
Based on the level of potential hazard inherent in the type of device concerned the
devices are classified in risk classes for which different types of conformity
assessment procedures are applied.
For low risk devices, the manufacturer ensures and declares conformity with the
applicable requirements. The Directives contain essential requirements that the
device must satisfy and certain requirements on the technical documentation to be
prepared by the manufacturer.
Medium and high risk devices (such as masks supplied in a sterile condition,
ventilators, or diagnostic self-tests) require an intervention of a notified body which
would in most cases need to assess both the manufacturer’s quality management
system
and the specific device technical documentation prior to issuing a
certification.
Notified bodies are listed in the NANDO (New Approach Notified and Designated
Organisations) Information System,

Question 3: How can standards be used under the legislation?
The Directives lay down essential requirements on safety and performance of the
devices they cover, but do not prescribe any specific mandatory technical solutions
for the manufacturing and design of the devices. Therefore, the manufacturer can
choose which technical solution to use to meet these essential requirements.
The Directives offer the possibility for manufacturers to rely on specific technical
solutions, which are detailed in harmonised European standards or parts thereof. The
references to these harmonised standards are published in the Official Journal of the
European Union. Where a manufacturer chooses to follow a harmonised standard,
the product is presumed to be in conformity with the applicable essential health,
safety and performance requirements. The harmonised standards under the Medical
devices directive most relevant for the public health crisis associated to the COVID19 outbreak are listed in annex 1.
Most European standards for medical devices have their origin in international ISO or
IEC standards. The annex 2 to this Q & A contains a table indicating the recognition
of international standards under the legal systems of the member jurisdictions of the
International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF).

Question 4: Where can standards be obtained?
Normally, manufacturers must purchase the standards they need from the national
members of the European standardisation organisations in the field (CEN and
CENELEC), i.e. the national standardisation bodies.
However, to ensure that European industry can quickly respond to the increased
demand of medical devices generated by the public health crisis associated to the
COVID-19 outbreak, the Commission has agreed with the European standardisation
organisations that several standards are made freely and fully available by the
national standardisation bodies.
Manufacturers can download these standards without cost from the online catalogues
of the national standardisation bodies.

Question 5: Due to the urgency caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, is there a
possibility to derogate from the normal conformity assessment procedures?
The directives prescribe that, on duly justified request, a Member State may, in the
Page 2 of 11

interest of protection of health, authorize the placing on the market within the territory
of the Member State concerned, of individual devices for which the conformity
assessment procedures haven´t been carried out yet. The public health crisis
associated to the COVID-19 outbreak is to be considered justified circumstance for
that purpose.
In addition, the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/403 on conformity
assessment and market surveillance of 13 March 2020 provides recommendations to
Member States with regard to personal protective equipment and medical devices for
protection (such as surgical masks, exploration gloves and some gowns). The
recommendation is accompanied by a guidance document on conformity assessment
procedures for protective equipment.
When assessing the need for a derogation, the national competent authority in a
Member State may consider factors such as:
1. the degree of criticality of the use of the device for the protection of health;
2. availability of suitable substitutes;
3. documentation of compliance with a harmonised standard or other specific
technical solutions ensuring fulfilment of the applicable essential requirements laid
down in the relevant Directive;
4. review of reports of tests performed by competent bodies;
5. indications from vigilance and/or market surveillance.
The derogation should be temporary and the period of validity limited to what is
strictly required for rendering the device compliant with the legislation or, if earlier,
when suitable substitutes can be expected or the critical needs will no longer be
present.
If Member States identify on the market devices for which the conformity assessment
procedures have not been carried out and no valid derogation decision has been
issued, they should take appropriate market surveillance measures in accordance
with the relevant directive. Recent experience indicates that there is, in addition, a
need to be attentive to falsified certificates and counterfeit devices.
Question 6: Is it necessary to register the devices?
In most cases there is an obligation for a manufacturer who makes devices available
on the market to inform the competent authorities of the Member State in which he
has his registered place of business, about the address of the registered place of
business and the description of the devices concerned. Manufacturers outside the
EU must have an authorised representative in the EU who then informs Member
State competent authorities of the above.

Question 7: How can I get in touch with the national competent authorities?
The national competent authorities are listed here:

https://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/medical-devices/contacts_en

Question 8: Off label use of a medical device
A medical device should be used as intended by the manufacturer and described in
the instructions for use. If a device is used in any other way, this is considered ‘offlabel’ use. Off-label use of a device could entail serious risks.
When it is deemed necessary to use an existing medical device for a purpose or in a
way that is different from that intended by the manufacturer, risks and benefits to the
patient must be carefully assessed. The assessment may typically include steps or
factors such as:






a documented risk assessment on the use of the device
consideration of ethical and legal implications
implementation of suitable precautions to minimise the risk
reviewing the risk assessment at suitable periods
obtaining approval from the national competent authorities when required.

Question 9: Will the new Regulations on medical devices and in vitro
diagnostic medical devices replace the three current Directives?
The new Regulations (MDR1 and IVDR2) will replace the current Directives
90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC on 26 May 2020 and 98/79/EC on 26 May 2022.
In light of the public health crisis associated to the COVID-19 outbreak and with
patient health and safety as a guiding principle, Commission adopted, on 3 April, a
proposal to postpone the current application date of 26 May 2020 of the Medical
1

Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices,
amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and
repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC

2

Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic
medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission Decision 2010/227/EU

Page 4 of 11

Devices Regulation (MDR) for one year is ongoing. The Commission intends to
submit the proposal to the co-legislators (the European Parliament and Council) in
early April 2020 with the aim to have the proposal adopted before the end of May.
