Introduction
This guidance document concerns performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) in the context of conformity assessment under either
Directive 98/79/EC or Regulation (EU) 2017/746. It covers devices for detection or
quantification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, antigens and also detection or quantification of
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These devices are collectively referred to as SARS-CoV2 IVDs. The guidance is addressed to all interested parties, including notably the
manufacturers, as well as notified bodies and competent authorities, authorised
representatives, other market operators, professional and patient associations.
The content of this guidance document is envisaged to form the basis for common
specifications to be adopted according to Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 in the
coming months. The content may be adapted to take account of changing circumstances
and increasing scientific and technical knowledge, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues
to evolve.
The terms “IVD”, “device”, “assay” and “test” are used interchangeably in this text.

General considerations
The general principles in this section should be taken into account for the performance
evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs.
The following terms are being used in this guidance document:
 diagnostic sensitivity means the ability of a device to identify the presence of a target
marker associated with SARS-CoV-2;
 true positive means a specimen known to be positive for the target marker and
correctly classified by the device;
 false negative means a specimen known to be positive for the target marker and
misclassified by the device;
 diagnostic specificity means the ability of a device to recognise the absence of a target
marker associated with SARS CoV-2;
 false positive means a specimen known to be negative for the target marker and
misclassified by the device;
 true negative means a specimen known to be negative for the target marker and
correctly classified by the device;
 the limit of detection (LOD) means the smallest amount of the target marker that can
be precisely detected, the LOD is part of analytical sensitivity of the device;
 analytical specificity means the ability of the method to determine solely the target
marker;

3 / 15

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2021-21 Rev.1

 nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAT) – methods of detection and/or
quantification of nucleic acids by either amplification of a target sequence, by
amplification of a signal or by hybridisation;
 rapid tests means qualitative or semi-quantitative in vitro diagnostic medical devices,
used singly or in a small series, which involve non-automated procedures and have
been designed to give a fast result;
 robustness of an analytical procedure means the capacity of an analytical procedure to
remain unaffected by small but deliberate variations in method parameters and
provides an indication of its reliability during normal usage;
 cross-reactivity (or cross-reaction) means the ability of non-target analytes or markers
to cause false-positive results in an assay because of similarity, e.g. the ability of nonspecific antibodies binding to a test antigen of an antibody assay, or the ability of nontarget nucleic acids to be reactive in a NAT assay;
 interference means the ability of unrelated substances to affect the results in an assay;
 whole system failure rate means the frequency of failures when the entire process is
performed as prescribed by the manufacturer;
 first line assay means a device used to detect a marker or analyte, and which may be
followed by a confirmatory assay. Devices intended solely to be used to monitor a
previously determined marker or analyte are not considered first line assays;
 confirmatory assay means a device used for the confirmation of a reactive result from
a first line assay;
 supplemental assay means a device that is used to provide further information for the
interpretation of the test result of another assay;
 virus typing assay means a device used for typing with already known positive
samples, not used for primary diagnosis of infection or for screening;
 95% positive cut-off value for NAT assays means the analyte concentration where
95% of test runs give positive results following serial dilutions of an international
reference material, where available, e.g. a World Health Organisation (WHO)
International Standard or reference material calibrated against the WHO International
Standard; this value describes the limit of detection (LOD) for NAT devices.
Overall considerations
Performance evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs should be carried out in direct comparison
with a state-of-the-art device. The device used for comparison should be one bearing CE
marking, if on the market at the time of the performance evaluation. For anti-SARS-CoV-2
tests, the new device should have an overall performance at least equivalent to that of the
state of the art device of the same type, e.g. considering claims based on target antigens
used and immunoglobulin classes detected.
Devices used for determination of status of samples used in performance evaluations of
SARS-CoV-2 IVDs should be state-of-the-art devices bearing CE marking.
Performance evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs should be performed on a population
equivalent to the European population.
If discrepant results are identified as part of a performance evaluation, these results should
be resolved as far as possible, by one or more of the following: evaluation of the
4 / 15

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2021-21 Rev.1

discrepant sample in further devices; use of an alternative method or marker; a review of
the clinical status and diagnosis of the patient; testing of follow-up samples.
As part of the required risk analysis the whole system failure rate leading to false-negative
results should be determined in repeat assays on low-positive specimens.
Sensitivity and specificity
Positive specimens used in the performance evaluation should be selected to reflect
different stages of the respective disease(s), different antibody patterns, different
genotypes, different subtypes, mutants, etc.
For SARS-CoV-2 IVDs intended by the manufacturer to be used with serum or plasma,
positive specimens should include 25 positive ‘same day’ fresh serum samples (≤ 1 day
after sampling).
Seroconversion panels should start with a negative bleed(s) and should reflect narrow
bleeding intervals as far as possible. Where this is not possible, manufacturers should
provide a justification in the performance evaluation report.
Negative specimens used in a performance evaluation should be defined so as to reflect
the target population for which the device is intended, such as blood donors, hospitalised
patients, pregnant women, etc.
Specificity should be calculated using the frequency of repeatedly reactive (i.e. false
positive) results in individuals negative for the target marker.
For SARS-CoV-2 IVDs intended by the manufacturer to be used with serum and plasma,
the performance evaluation should demonstrate serum to plasma equivalency. This should
be demonstrated for at least 25 positive donations for sensitivity and 25 negative
donations for specificity.
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IVDs intended by the manufacturer for testing body fluids other than
serum or plasma, e.g. urine, saliva, etc., should meet the same requirements for sensitivity
and specificity as serum or plasma devices. The performance evaluation should test
samples from the same individuals in both the devices to be approved and in a respective
serum or plasma device.
In the case of IVDs for SARS-CoV-2 detection from secretions of the respiratory tract, their
performance on all claimed specimen types should be compared to NAT tests on
nasopharyngeal swabs.
Interference and cross-reactivity
The manufacturer should select the potential interfering substances to be evaluated taking
account of the composition of the reagents and configuration of the device. The
manufacturer should include specimens such as, where applicable: those representing
related infections; those from multipara, i.e. women who have had more than one
pregnancy, or rheumatoid factor (RF) positive patients; those containing human antibodies
to components of the expression system, for example anti-E. coli, or anti-yeast.
Anticoagulants
For SARS-CoV-2 IVDs intended for use with plasma, the performance evaluation should
verify the performance of the device using all anticoagulants which the manufacturer
indicates for use with the device. This should be demonstrated for at least 50 plasma
specimens per anticoagulant (25 positive and 25 negative).
5 / 15

MDCG 2021-21 Rev.1

Batch testing
For SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody tests, the manufacturer’s batch testing criteria
should ensure that every batch consistently identifies the relevant antigens, epitopes, and
antibodies and is suitable for the claimed specimen types.
Self-tests
SARS-CoV-2 IVDs for self-testing should meet the same requirements for sensitivity and
specificity as respective devices for professional use. Relevant parts of the performance
evaluation should be carried out (or repeated) by appropriate lay persons to validate the
operation of the device and the instructions for use. The lay persons selected for the
performance evaluation should be representative of the intended users groups.

Specific considerations
The following tables set out specific considerations for various types of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs.
Table 1 refers to the following first-line assays (including rapid tests) for antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2): IgG-only, IgG combined with IgM and/or IgA, and total
antibody.

If the device is intended to be used for more than one specimen type, 100 samples shall be required for each specimen type. If this is not possible in exceptional
circumstances (e.g. if specimen collection is very invasive), the manufacturer shall provide a justification and evidence of matrix equivalence.
2
Sampling should be matched for antigen and NAT testing, e.g., two simultaneous samples from each individual or optimally NAT- and antigen testing from the same sample
(e.g. from the eluate of one swab); the buffer/transport medium should be compatible for both NAT and antigen testing; any volume change in the buffer/medium for sample
uptake different from that of the proprietary assay, and/or between antigen and NAT test should be clearly communicated.
3
Or time of infection, if known, taking into account the incubation time.

if applicable.
5
Depending on the design of the device and nature of the genetic variant. For the purpose of evaluation, at least 3 samples should be represented for each genetic variant.
6
Specimen collection and extraction items such as swabs, extraction buffers, etc., should be part of the evaluation. If proprietary sampling/sample preparation is not included
in the test kit, test performance should be investigated for an applicable range of sampling devices. If the sample is not tested immediately, e.g. after a certain transport time,
stability of the antigen should be investigated.
7
Other than rapid tests, i.e. formal laboratory-based assays e.g. enzyme immunoassay, automated tests, etc.
8
The sensitivity of ≥80%, ≥85% respectively, should be for all specimen types claimed. All claimed specimen types should be compared with paired NAT results from
nasopharyngeal specimens.
9
The relationship between antigen test performance and NAT should be demonstrated; sensitivity may be shown relating to different viral load ranges and to the threshold of
infectivity. The NAT and extraction method used should be described.

Unless there is an available international standard, analytical sensitivity may be tested by dilution series of in-house virus preparations, comparatively with other antigen
tests and NAT; if inactivated virus is used, the effect of inactivation and freeze/thawing on the antigen should be investigated.
