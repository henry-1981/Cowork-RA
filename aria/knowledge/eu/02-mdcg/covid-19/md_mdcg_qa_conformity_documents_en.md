How to verify that medical devices and personal protective 
equipment can be lawfully placed on the EU market and thus 
purchased and used – also in the COVID-19 context 
 
Introduction and scope of this document 
The purpose of this guidance document is to provide basic indications to allow those 
interested parties who are unfamiliar with the regulated sectors of medical devices and 
personal protective equipment to identify whether a product is lawfully placed on the 
EU market and can continue to be made available, thus purchased and used. 
Such clarification has proven especially necessary in the context of the COVID-19 
pandemic
1
. The related extraordinary circumstances have rapidly increased the need 
and demand for certain devices and equipment: this has resulted in the involvement of 
economic operators and other interested parties not previously in the supply and 
verification chain of these products. In addition, recent experience indicates the need to 
be attentive to misleading or falsified documents as well as to counterfeit products. 
 
Question 1: What is the applicable regulatory framework for medical devices and 
personal protective equipment in the EU?
2
 
Medical devices within the EU are currently regulated by the following Directives: 

 
Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of 

| Council Directive 90/385/EEC | of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of |
| --- | --- |
| the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices3 (hereafter |  |
| referred to as AIMDD) |  |


 
Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices
4
 
(hereafter referred to as MDD) 

 
Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 
1998 on 
in vitro
 diagnostic medical devices
5
 (hereafter referred to as IVDD) 
Medical devices can also already be placed on the EU market if they comply with the 
following new Regulations which entered into force in May 2017:

Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 
2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 
178/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 
90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC

 (hereafter referred to as MDR, fully applicable as from 
26 May 2021) 

 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 
2017 on 
in vitro
 diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and 
Commission Decision 2010/227/EU
7
 (hereafter referred to as IVDR, fully applicable 
as from 26 May 2022) 
The temporal scope and the conditions of applicability of the relevant legal 
requirements to devices, from the AIMDD, the MDD and the IVDD (hereafter referred 
to as Directives) to the MDR and the IVDR (hereafter referred to as new Regulations 
on medical devices), are governed by specific transitional provisions
8
. 
On the other hand, personal protective equipment within the EU is currently regulated 
by 
Regulation (EU) 2016/425 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 
March 2016 on personal protective equipment and repealing Council Directive 
89/686/EEC
9
 (hereafter referred to as PPER). 
 
Question 2: How can a product be lawfully placed on the EU market? 
In order to lawfully place on the EU market medical devices under the scope of the 
Directives or the new Regulations, as well as personal protective equipment under the 
scope of the PPER, these products must be CE-marked
10
 with the EC or EU 
declaration of conformity signed and issued by the manufacturer. 
In the EC or EU declaration of conformity, manufacturers must declare that their 
products comply with the applicable EU legislative act(s) and requirements. There are 
however no obligations in the EU legal framework to separately draw up declarations of 
compliance with national legislation, as well as with national, European or international 
standards. 
The Directives and the new Regulations on medical devices, and the PPER, in line with 
the main pieces of the EU legislation concerning the internal market for goods, lay 
down essential safety and performance requirements and health and safety 
requirements, respectively, but do not prescribe any specific mandatory technical 
solutions for the manufacturing and design of the products. Therefore, the 
manufacturer can choose which technical solution(s) to use to comply with these legal

 The CE marking must be affixed according to the specific provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 
765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30) 
as well as in the applicable EU legislation.

requirements. Manufacturers can use those offered in harmonised European standards 
or in other standards or technical specifications, or can come up with their own 
technical solution(s). 
The use of harmonised European standards is a voluntary means to comply with the 
legal requirements. These standards, developed by the relevant European 
standardisation organisations11, contain specific technical solutions that can be used to 
comply with the legal requirements. When the reference of a harmonised European 
standard is cited in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), the use of such 
standard confers on the product a presumption of conformity with the legal 
requirements it aims to cover (as listed in the relevant Annex Z). In practice, where a 
manufacturer chooses to follow a harmonised European standard to which the 
reference is cited in the OJEU, the product is presumed to be in conformity with the 
applicable legal requirements covered by such standard. On the contrary, where a 
manufacturer chooses not to follow a harmonised European standard, it must 
demonstrate that the alternative technical solution applied is adequate to ensure 
compliance of the product with the applicable legal requirements. 
The manufacturer must also prepare and maintain the relevant technical 
documentation for the product, in support to the compliance claimed in the EC or EU 
declaration of conformity. Such technical documentation has to be kept and made 
available to national competent authorities upon their request. 
For medical devices, manufacturers outside the EU must designate a single authorised 
representative in the EU. Information on the authorised representative must be 
available at least on the EC or EU declaration of conformity, on the certificate where 
applicable, and on the labelling of the device. 
For certain medical devices12 and personal protective equipment13, the manufacturer 
needs to involve a notified body in the prescribed conformity assessment procedure(s). 
Once the notified body assesses the compliance of the product with the relevant 
requirements of the applicable EU legislation, it will issue the appropriate certificate (as 
for example an EC or EU type-examination certificate, a design-examination certificate 
or a quality management system certificate). Such product must be CE-marked 
followed by the 4-digits identification number (NB xxxx) of the notified body. Conformity 
assessment procedures can include audits of manufacturers and/or critical 
suppliers/subcontractors, testing or review of technical documentation (such as test 
reports, manufacturer’s risk assessment and/or management process, drawings and 
clinical data) in support of compliance of the product with the applicable legal 
requirements.

Standardization (CENELEC) for the medical devices and personal protective equipment sectors.

patient ventilators, in vitro diagnostic devices listed in Annex II to the IVDD and diagnostic self-tests. 
13 Risk categories II and III such as respiratory protection face masks.

Question 3: Can other documents be valid to lawfully place a product on the EU 
market? 
Only documents which are explicitly referred to in the applicable EU legislation (namely 
the EC or EU declaration of conformity and, where needed, certificates issued 
according to the relevant conformity assessment procedures) may be drawn up and 
used for the purpose of lawfully placing a product on the EU market. Therefore, any 
other document is not valid for such a purpose. In practice there are several examples 
of documents which have no legal status according to the applicable EU legislation, for 
instance the so-called “certificate of compliance”, “attestation of compliance”, 
“certificate of conformity”, “certificate of notification”, “certificate of registration”, 
“documentation review” or similar, which do not comply with the requirements of an EC 
or EU declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer or a certificate issued by a 
notified body. 
Those “other documents” with no legal status according to the applicable EU legislation 
are issued by different kinds of entities, for instance non-notified conformity/certification 
bodies but also bodies notified under other EU legislative acts, or testing houses or 
laboratories, or even authorised representatives, etc. Even if such documents may 
include some elements of a declaration of conformity or a certificate, they are usually 
voluntary statements that manufacturers request from third parties but do not provide 
any legal basis to place products on the EU market. These statements may address 
different issues such as compliance with legislation or standards, appropriateness of 
the technical documentation and so on, but do not constitute “declarations of 
conformity” (because valid declarations of conformity can only be issued by 
manufacturers) nor “certificates” (because valid certificates can only be issued by 
notified bodies designated for the specific legislative act) within the meaning of the 
applicable EU legislation. 
These voluntary statements may be included in the technical documentation as 
supporting documents to provide evidence of compliance with certain applicable 
requirements. However, they can never replace the EC or EU declaration of conformity 
issued by the manufacturer, or the certificate(s) issued by notified bodies, as 
prescribed by the applicable EU legislation. 
 
Question 4: Which are the main characteristics of a valid declaration of 
conformity? 
A valid EC or EU declaration of conformity must be drafted and signed by the 
manufacturer, and include as a minimum14: 
                                                          
14 The model structure of the EC declaration of conformity is set out in Annex III to Decision No 
768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 
82). In addition, indications on the contents of the EU declaration of conformity can be found in “The 
‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU products rules” (see Question 9). 


 
5 
 the identification and description of the product; 
 the EU legislative act(s) to which conformity is claimed; 
 the name and address of the manufacturer, and/or of the authorised representative, 
where applicable; 
 a statement that the declaration is issued under the sole responsibility of the 
manufacturer; 
 the conformity assessment procedure(s) applied; 
 references to the relevant harmonised European standard(s) or common 
specification(s) used, where applicable; 
 the name and the 4-digits identification number (NB xxxx) of the notified body and 
reference to the certificate(s) issued, where applicable; 
 date of issue of the declaration, identification and signature of the manufacturer. 
The minimum contents of the EU declaration of conformity according to the new 
Regulations on medical devices are laid down in the respective Annexes IV. 
The minimum contents of the EU declaration of conformity according to the PPER are 
laid down in Annex IX. 
If a product falls under the scope of two or more EU legislative acts providing for the 
CE marking, a single EU declaration of conformity must be drafted and signed by the 
manufacturer, declaring conformity with the applicable two or more pieces of 
legislation. This is the case, for instance, of “double-purpose” medical protective 
equipment, such as some types of face masks or gloves, providing protection to both 
users and patients: they fall under the scope of both the MDD and the PPER, therefore 
their EU declaration of conformity will refer to both pieces of legislation. 
 
Question 5: Which are the main characteristics of a valid certificate? 
There are two types of certificates that can be issued by a notified body under the 
applicable EU legislation, in view of placing medical devices or personal protective 
equipment on the EU market: product certificates and quality management system 
certificates. The first certifies that the product complies with the relevant requirements 
(after the notified body has reviewed the relevant technical documentation and/or has 
performed the relevant tests). The latter certifies the quality management system of the 
manufacturer for a defined product range (either in its entirety or in aspects limited to 
production or product quality assurance). 
A valid certificate under the applicable EU legislation (as for example an EC or EU 
type-examination certificate, a design-examination certificate or a quality management 
system certificate) is issued by a notified body after the successful completion of the 
conformity assessment procedure applicable to the product. Notified bodies are 
designated by the relevant national authorities to perform specific conformity 
assessment procedure(s) and thus to issue the related certificate(s), for specific types 
of products or quality management systems under different EU legislative acts. Only 


 
6 
those notified bodies listed in the Commission’s NANDO information system 
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/ 
are 
entitled 
to 
issue 
valid 
certificates, within their scope and competences:

- 
List of notified bodies for the PPER: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-
databases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=directive.notifiedbody&dir_id=155501 
A conformity assessment body must be notified under each specific EU legislative act 
in order to be able to perform determined conformity assessment procedure(s) for 
specific types of products under the said legislative act, as indicated in the notification 
with its scope and the competences of the notified body. Thus, even if a body is 
notified under one or more EU legislative act(s) and has thus been granted a 4-digits 
identification number (NB xxxx) in NANDO, such notified body is not automatically 
allowed to perform conformity assessment procedures under other EU legislative act(s) 
or for different scope and competences. A separate notification is therefore necessary, 
even if the notified body will keep the same identification number under each EU 
legislative act. 
The NANDO information system can be consulted searching by “Country”, “Legislation” 
or “Body”. For each notified body and notifying/designating authority, information and 
contact details are included: this can be used to submit requests for specific 
information on the status and competences of notified bodies, as well as on their 
activities. In addition, several notified bodies listed in NANDO for medical devices and 
personal protective equipment have dedicated websites where the most relevant 
information on their certificates can be consulted. 
A manufacturer can choose any of the notified body listed in NANDO if notified for the 
specific EU legislative act(s), irrespective of where the notified body is located. 
Every certificate issued by a notified body prior to placing medical devices or personal 
protective equipment on the EU market must specify the conformity assessment 
procedure applied, and may include references to the test reports if applicable and 
other relevant technical documents, as well as to the harmonised European standards 
used if it is the case. The name and the 4-digits identification number (NB xxxx) of the 
notified body must be clearly indicated on the certificate. 


 
7 
Guidance on content of certificates issued by notified bodies for medical devices in 
accordance with the Directives can be found in the document NBOG BPG 2010-315, 
detailing information to be reported depending on the relevant conformity assessment 
procedure performed. 
The minimum contents of certificates according to the new Regulations on medical 
devices are laid down in their respective Annexes XII. 
The minimum contents of an EU type-examination certificate according to the PPER 
are laid down in its Annex V. 
 
Question 6: When is the intervention of a notified body required? 
For medical devices, the involvement of a notified body is required for the conformity 
assessment procedures applicable to class III, IIa and IIb devices, as in the case of 
respiratory patient ventilators, as well as for class I devices supplied in sterile condition 
or with measuring functions. For other class I devices, as in the case of medical face 
masks (often referred to as type I, II or IIR masks16), gloves and overalls when supplied 
in non-sterile condition, the intervention of a notified body is not required, and 
manufacturers are entitled to carry out the applicable conformity assessment 
procedure under their sole responsibility (“self-assessment”). 
For in vitro diagnostic medical devices, under the IVDD, notified body intervention is 
required for devices intended for self-testing, i.e. devices intended by the manufacturer 
to be used by lay persons in a home environment17. It is also required for devices listed 
in Annex II of the IVDD. Under the IVDR, notified bodies are involved in conformity 
assessment of class B, C and D devices, as well as class A sterile devices. 
For products under the scope of the PPER, a notified body is required for the 
conformity assessment procedures applicable to risk categories II and III equipment. In 
particular, respiratory protection face masks used in the COVID-19 context (often 
referred to as FFP2 or FFP3 masks18) are products falling in category III and as such a 
notified body must be systematically involved in the conformity assessment procedures 
prior to placing these products on the EU market. 
 
Question 7: Can a test report in accordance with a standard allow for the placing 
on the EU market of a product? 
A test report issued after carrying out testing on a product in accordance with a 
standard is not sufficient by itself for lawfully placing the product on the EU market. 
                                                          
15 http://www.doks.nbog.eu/Doks/NBOG_BPG_2010_3.pdf. 
16 As defined in the harmonised European standard EN 14683:2019+AC:2019. 
17 Article 1(2)(d) IVDD. 
18 As defined in the harmonised European standard EN 149:2001+A1:2009. 


 
8 
This is the case also for harmonised European standards providing presumption of 
conformity to certain requirements. Test reports, as well as documentation of the 
manufacturer’s risk assessment and/or management process, drawings, clinical data 
etc., are to be included in the technical documentation prepared by the manufacturer. 
Where applicable, these elements must be submitted to a notified body, which will 
review them and conduct additional tests if necessary. Notified bodies cannot issue 
any certificate based on test reports only: the relevant conformity assessment 
procedure(s) have to be performed. Once the relevant conformity assessment 
procedure has been successfully completed, in order to place products on the EU 
market according to the applicable legislation, such products must be CE-marked 
(followed by the 4-digits identification number (NB xxxx) of the notified body when 
applicable) with the EC or EU declaration of conformity signed and issued by the 
manufacturer. 
This is the case, for instance, of test reports for medical face masks in accordance with 
the harmonised European standard EN 14683:2019+AC:2019, or test reports for 
respiratory protection face masks in accordance with the harmonised European 
standard EN 149:2001+A1:2009 (in this case, documentation should be submitted by 
the manufacturer to the notified body which will perform the tests and the applicable 
conformity assessment procedures). Reports of tests performed against the relevant 
standards could be considered as one, but not the only, element based on which the 
manufacturer can issue the EC or EU declaration of conformity for products intended to 
be placed on the EU market. 
 
Question 8: Are derogations from the legal requirements possible (for instance, 
products not CE-marked, or without a declaration of conformity), in particular in 
the context of the COVID-19 pandemic? 
Under exceptional circumstances, the medical devices Directives and Regulations19 
empower national competent authorities, on a duly justified request, to authorise the 
placing on their national markets of medical devices for which the relevant conformity 
assessment procedures have not been carried out, but the use of which is in the 
interest of protection of health, or in the interest of public health or patient safety or 
health respectively (“national derogation”). 
On the contrary, the PPER does not envisage such possibility. 
Nevertheless, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Commission 
Recommendation (EU) 2020/403 of 13 March 2020 on conformity assessment and 
                                                          
19 Article 9(9) AIMDD, Article 11(13) MDD and Article 9(12) IVDD; Article 59 MDR and Article 54 IVDR. 
The referred Articles of the MDR and the IVDR establish also the possibility for the Commission, in 
exceptional cases relating to public health or patient safety or health, to extend for a limited period of 
time the validity of an authorisation granted by a Member State to the territory of the EU, and set the 
conditions under which the device may be placed on the market or put into service. 


 
9 
market surveillance procedures within the context of the COVID-19 threat20 allows for 
some degree of flexibility, to improve the availability of certain personal protective 
equipment21 and medical devices22, under strict conditions and bound to healthcare 
workers. In this sense, national competent authorities of the EU Member States may 
authorise the making available on their national markets of some products, for a limited 
period of time and while the necessary procedures are being carried out, even though 
the conformity assessment procedures, including the affixing of CE marking, have not 
been fully finalised. 
 
Question 9: Where can more detailed information on the applicable EU 
regulatory framework be found? 
All the relevant information on the EU legislative acts on medical devices and on 
personal protective equipment, with the related legal texts and requirements, guidance 
documents, working parties, lists of harmonised European standards and of notified 
bodies, contact points etc., can be found in the respective Commission’s sectorial
