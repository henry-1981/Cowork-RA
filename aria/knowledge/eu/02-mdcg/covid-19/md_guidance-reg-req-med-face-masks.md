INTRODUCTION 
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on 
March the 12th 2020. 
The COVID-19 virus is transmitted mainly via small airborne droplets emitted by 
infected people, especially when sneezing, coughing or talking. Therefore, a wide array 
of protective products designed to ensure protection against airborne particles or small 
droplets are used, such as: face masks, gloves, coveralls, etc. 
A medical face mask (also known as surgical or procedure mask) is a medical device 
covering the mouth, nose and chin ensuring a barrier that limits the transition of an 
infective agent between the hospital staff and the patient. They are used by healthcare 
workers to prevent large respiratory droplets and splashes from reaching the mouth and 
the nose of the wearer and help reduce and/or control at the source the spread of large 
respiratory droplets from the person wearing the face mask1. 
Medical face masks are recommended, as well, as a means of source control for persons 
who are symptomatic in order to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets produced by 
coughing or sneezing. The application of medical masks as source control has been 
shown to decrease the release of respiratory droplets carrying respiratory viruses1. 
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) have outlined recommendations on 
the preferential supply of medical face masks to healthcare professionals and 
symptomatic patients based on need and the emerging evidence1. 
Other products such as face covers (also known as ‘community’/‘artisanal’/‘textile’/ 
‘domestic’/‘non-medical’ face masks) include various forms of self-made or commercial 
masks or face covers made of cloth, other textiles or other materials such as paper. They 
are not intended for use in healthcare settings or by healthcare professionals. 
Manufacturers of medical face masks and face covers may include technological 
adaptation in the design of these products (with a transparent window), in order to allow 
lip reading for hearing impaired people (including healthcare professionals). 
Under the current COVID-19 context, the demand for different types of face masks has 
rapidly increased. Therefore, this document intends to outline the regulatory options for 
the placing of medical face masks on the EU market indicating their feasibility to allow 
short-term supply. 
In addition to the use of masks and face covers, other public health measures must be 
promoted, such us respiratory etiquette (i.e. covering of the mouth and nose with a tissue 
when coughing) to limit the spread of infection from an infected individual1.

LEGAL BACKGROUND 
Most of these masks are among the so-called ‘harmonised products’ for which there is 
specific EU product legislation in place. 
Medical face masks or surgical face masks are products falling within the scope of the 
EU legal framework on medical devices – Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD), to be replaced 
by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) as from 26 May 2021. 
Some products used in the COVID-19 context, such as filtering face-piece respirators 
(also called protective face masks or respirators), are considered as personal protective 
equipment (PPE) and hence fall under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2016/425 (PPER). 
A face covering is another type of mask, for which the EU regulatory framework has not 
established specific legal requirements. Therefore, the General Product Safety Directive 
(GPSD) 2001/95/EC would apply. In addition, some Member States, standardisation 
bodies or other entities may provide guidance on the specifications and use of these face 
covers. 
3. 
DEFINITION OF MEDICAL FACE MASKS AND INTENDED USE OF OTHER TYPES OF 
FACE MASKS 
Medical Face Mask: medical device covering the mouth and nose providing a barrier to 
minimize the direct transmission of infective agents between staff and patient. 
A medical face mask must fulfil the definition as a medical device and therefore have a 
medical purpose as intended by the manufacturer. 
This intended purpose is normally to limit the transmission of infective agents from staff 
to patients during surgical procedures and other medical settings with similar 
requirements. A medical face mask with an appropriate microbial barrier should also be 
effective in reducing the emission of infective agents from the nose and mouth of an 
asymptomatic carrier or a patient with clinical symptoms. 
Medical face masks should be distinguished from protective face masks or respirators 
(PPE), which are intended only to be worn by a person for protection against one or more 
risks to that person's health or safety, without a medical purpose, and do not fall under 
the definition of medical device. For further advice on the conformity assessment of 
these type of masks and other types of protective equipment, a questions and answers 
document 
has 
been 
published 
on 
the 
Commission 
web 
site: 
https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/40521 
Face covers do not meet the legal definitions of a PPE and neither they meet the legal 
definition of a medical device, as there is no intended medical or personal protection 
purpose made by the manufacturer. However, some Member States, standardisation 
bodies or other entities may provide guidance on the specifications and use of these face 
covers.

CLASSIFICATION 
4.1 Classification according to Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC and 
Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 
Medical Face Masks are classified according to Rule 1 for non-invasive devices, 
as devices that either do not touch the patient or contact intact skin only (see 
guidance2). There are two possible classifications: 
- 
Class I: non-sterile medical face masks. For them, the manufacturer is entitled 
to carry out a self-assessment conformity procedure, without the intervention 
of a notified body. 
- 
Class Is: sterile medical face masks. For them, the intervention of a notified 
body is required in the assessment of the sterility process and validation of 
documentation. 
4.2 Classification according to the harmonised European standard EN 
14683:2019+AC:2019 
Medical face masks are classified as Type I and Type II according to bacterial 
filtration efficiency, whereby Type II is further divided (Type II and IIR) 
according to whether or not the mask is splash resistant. The 'R' signifies splash 
resistance. 
Type I medical face masks should only be used for patients and other persons to 
reduce the risk of spread of infections particularly in epidemic or pandemic 
situations. Type I masks are not intended for use by healthcare professional in an 
operating room or in other medical settings with similar requirements3. 
5. 
USE OF HARMONISED EUROPEAN STANDARDS 
The use of harmonised European standards remains voluntary. Manufacturers are free to 
choose any other technical solution to demonstrate compliance with the mandatory legal 
requirements. 
The medical devices regulatory framework offers the possibility for manufacturers to rely 
on specific technical solutions, which are detailed in harmonised European standards or 
parts thereof. When the references of these harmonised European standards are published 
in the Official Journal of the European Union in support of the applicable EU legislation, 
the voluntary use of those standards confers presumption of conformity with the legal 
requirements the standard aims to cover. It means that, where a manufacturer chooses to 
adopt the technical solutions laid down in those standards, the product is presumed to be 
in conformity with the applicable essential safety and performance requirements. 
This is the case of the abovementioned harmonised European standard EN 
14683:2019+AC:2019 for medical face masks under the MDD.

REGULATORY OPTIONS FOR PLACING MEDICAL FACE MASKS ON THE EU 
MARKET AS MEDICAL DEVICES 
Medical face masks in the scope of the MDD and the MDR4 must comply with the 
applicable essential safety and performance requirements. Thus, these products must be 
CE-marked and accompanied by the EC or EU declaration of conformity issued by the 
manufacturer. The manufacturer must prepare the appropriate technical documentation 
and keep it available for market surveillance authorities on request. 
The CE marking should be affixed to the device where practicable and should be visible 
on the packaging. All labelling and information requirements should be met according to 
Annex I.13 of MDD and Annex I.23 of MDR. 
In the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, several industries have expressed their 
willingness to support and scale up the production of medical face masks. There are 
different regulatory options available for supporting production or placing in the market 
medical face masks. These options are presented below ordered in terms of feasibility to 
allow a swift supply under the current context. 
 
6.1. 
Supplying semi-finished or finished face masks to medical devices 
manufacturers currently placing the masks on the market 
When the actual manufacturer has already undergone a conformity assessment for 
the medical face mask, has issued the EC declaration of conformity and is lawfully 
placing face masks on the market under its own name, other producers (e.g. not 
currently working in the medical devices field) can support its production. Such 
producers can provide semi-finished or finished products, therefore becoming 
suppliers or subcontractors of the actual manufacturer. 
Given that the medical devices sector is highly regulated and complex, leveraging 
the knowledge and responsibilities of an already established manufacturer of face 
masks could be the least burdensome and fastest option to scale up the production of 
face masks. 
Manufacturers of medical devices producing face masks may provide the 
specifications of their face masks to another producer that becomes its 
subcontractor. This other producer will manufacture the face masks but the actual 
medical device manufacturer will keep its role of legal manufacturer according to 
the MDD or MDR. 
The actual manufacturer of the face masks, which should have implemented and 
maintained a quality management system, qualifies, approves and controls the 
subcontractor that might need to be audited by the actual manufacturer as part of the 
control of subcontractors and on the basis of its criticality.

6.2. 
Derogation procedure: placing on the market authorised by the 
competent authorities of a Member State in the interest of public health 
The EU legislation on medical devices allows for specific derogations from some 
requirements. In fact, according to Article 11(13) of the MDD and Article 59 of the 
MDR, the competent authorities of the Member States may authorise, on duly 
justified request, the placing on the market and putting into service within the 
territory of the Member State concerned, of specific devices for which the relevant 
conformity assessment procedures have not been carried out but the use of which is 
in the interest of public health or patient safety or health. 
By the amending Regulation of 23 April 20205, Article 59(1) of the MDR empowers 
Member States’ competent authorities to adopt national derogations under both the 
MDD and the MDR from the date of entry into force of that amendment (24 April 
2020). 
The relevant competent authority of the Member State in this case authorises the 
placing on the market within its territory. In practice, this implies that each 
competent authority would need to assess whether the devices produced by the 
manufacture provides an adequate level of safety and performance in respect to the 
applicable legal requirements or applicable standards. The assessment procedures 
can vary among Member States and in some cases will involve the support of third 
parties (e.g. testing laboratories). 
In the exceptional COVID-19 context, the assessment procedures will ensure a 
short-term supply while guaranteeing patient safety6. The Member State will 
evaluate the available technical documentation to find evidence that essential safety 
and performance requirements are guaranteed in the context of use. In particular, the 
role of healthcare teams and health facilities is essential to allow a rational use and a 
continuous assessment of these crisis solutions. 
Once this assessment is performed, the authority has to take a decision, whether or 
not the respective device produced by the manufacturer may enter the national 
territory of the Member State. As by 24 April 2020, competent authorities have to 
inform the Commission and their counterparts in the other Member States of any 
temporary agreement they have granted to specific devices. 
Furthermore, a specific Commission Recommendation7 allows for some degree of 
flexibility in placing certain medical devices on the EU market, under certain 
conditions, to improve availability of such products in view of the epidemiological 
context as well as the exponential growth in demand. Accordingly, Member States’ 
market surveillance authorities may authorise the making available on the EU 
market of some products, as national derogations, for a limited period of time and 
while the necessary procedures are being carried out, even though the conformity 
                                                 
5 Regulation (EU) 2020/561 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2020 amending 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices, as regards the dates of application of certain of its 
provisions (OJ L 130, 24.4.2020, p. 18). 
6 Some Member States have published guidance on their respective websites to support this assessment e.g. 
in case of implementation of innovative manufacturing processes such as 3D printing. 
7 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/403 of 13 March 2020 on conformity assessment and market 
surveillance procedures within the context of the COVID-19 threat (OJ L 79I, 16.3.2020, p. 1). 


 
7 
assessment procedures, including the affixing of CE marking, have not been fully 
finalised. 
Among the products explicitly addressed in the Recommendation, there are medical 
face masks covered by the MDD and MDR. 
The Commission issued guidance for the sound implementation of the referred 
derogations: Guidance on medical devices, active implantable medical devices and 
in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the COVID-19 context. 
Timing to obtain a derogation by a competent authority will greatly depend on the 
quality and adequacy of the evidence provided by the manufacturer. When technical 
documentation and evidence of safety and performance is adequate this can be a 
feasible option to ensure short-term supply. 
In addition, Article 59(3) of the MDR establishes the possibility for the 
Commission, in exceptional cases relating to public health or patient safety or 
health, to extend for a limited period of time the validity of an authorisation granted 
by a Member State to the territory of the EU and set the conditions under which the 
device may be placed on the market or put into service. This allows addressing 
potential EU-wide shortages of vitally important medical devices in an effective 
manner. 
 
6.3. 
Manufacture of the finished face masks by a producer currently not 
placing face masks on the market under its own name 
Producers of medical face masks who are no currently medical device 
manufacturers under MDD or MDR must ensure they assume all legal obligations 
before they place on the market products under their own name. This means that the 
manufacturer will need to fulfil all requirements of the MDD or the MDR (e.g. 
including the need to draw up the full technical documentation related to the face 
mask, and to establish and keep up to date a systematic procedure to review 
experience gained from devices in the post-production phase). 
The manufacturer who places the finished CE-marked face mask on the EU market 
under its own name must ensure that the device complies with the legal 
requirements (the essential requirements established in Annex I to the MDD or the 
general safety and performance requirements established in Annex I to the MDR) 
and provide relevant evidence (EC or EU declaration of conformity, technical 
documentation, etc.). Only if the face mask is supplied in sterile condition, a 
notified body must be involved in the assessment of the sterility process and 
validation of documentation. 
Therefore, the route for certification can vary. In particular: 
1. Class I non-sterile face masks: 
• EC declaration of conformity according to Annex VII of MDD, or 
• EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 19 after drawing up the 
technical documentation set out in Annexes II and III of the MDR. 
 
 


 
8 
2. Class I sterile face masks: 
• EC declaration of conformity according to Annex VII combined with an 
assessment by a notified body8 of the quality assurance of the production 
applicable to the sterility aspects according to Annex II, IV, V or VI of MDD, 
or 
• EU declaration of conformity referred to in Article 19, after drawing up the 
technical documentation set out in Annexes II and III, combined with an 
assessment by a notified body8 of the procedures set out in Chapters I and III 
of Annex IX, or in Part A of Annex XI of MDR. 
If the finished CE-marked face mask is produced outside the EU and imported into 
the single market, the legal manufacturer must designate a single authorised 
representative in the EU, who must assume responsibility for placing the device on 
the EU market, ensuring that European and national regulatory frameworks are 
complied with. 
Given that the medical devices sector is highly regulated and complex, the scenarios 
presented below will typically be the most burdensome and therefore only 
applicable to increase supply in the medium-long term. 
6.3.1. Medical devices manufacturers’ not currently producing face masks 
extending their product range 
This option is available for medical devices manufacturers currently placing in the 
marked other devices and wishing to add face masks to their product range. They 
could seek the support from (non-medical devices) producers to act as 
subcontractors. 
From the procedural point of view, a medical devices manufacturer may produce the 
finished face mask or may utilise a subcontractor (i.e. producer linked or not to the 
medical devices field). In the latter case, the manufacturer must retain the overall 
responsibility on the product and therefore qualify, approve and control the new 
subcontractor. 
6.3.2. Medical face masks manufactured entirely by a producer that is not currently 
the actual manufacturer under the MDD or the MDR 
Producers of medical face masks that do not currently qualify as actual 
manufacturers under the MDD or the MDR and decide to place face masks on the 
market under their own name must comply with all the legal requirements for 
manufactures under the MDD or the MDR. It is important to mention that some 
Member States could have specific requirements, for instance, to authorise the 
facility of the medical device manufacturer prior to start production.
