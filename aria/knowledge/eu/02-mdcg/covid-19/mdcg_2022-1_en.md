Notice to third country manufacturers
of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro diagnostic
medical devices

January 2022

This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group
(MDCG) established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is
composed of representatives of all Member States and it is chaired by a
representative of the European Commission.
The document is not a European Commission document and it cannot be regarded
as reflecting the official position of the European Commission. Any views expressed
in this document are not legally binding and only the Court of Justice of the European
Union can give binding interpretations of Union law.

Scope
This notice is addressed to manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic medical devices
(IVDs) with the intended purpose to detect and/or quantify markers of SARS-CoV-2
infection 1 who are based in countries outside the EU or the EEA and who place or
intend to place the abovementioned devices on the EU market. It is intended to
highlight a number of common issues that EU national competent authorities have
identified in the course of their market surveillance activities regarding compliance of
SARS-CoV-2 IVDs with the requirements of Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic
medical devices. These issues can also be relevant for SARS-CoV-2 devices which
are transitioning to Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (also see last paragraph).
Guidance documents relevant for SARS-CoV-2 IVDs are available on the European
Commission’s
medical
devices
webpage:

98/79/EC in the European Commission’s dedicated Q&A document:

Designation of an authorised representative
A manufacturer who does not have a registered place of business in an EU Member
State and who intends to place devices on the EU market under his own name must
designate an EU authorised representative in accordance with Article 10(3) of
Directive 98/79/EC. That authorised representative is responsible for the notification
required by Article 10(1) of Directive 98/79/EC. It should be noted that it is required to
designate only one authorised representative and to notify only the competent
authority where the authorised representative is established.

Involvement of a notified body for self-tests under Directive 98/79/EC
Under Directive 98/79/EC, SARS-CoV-2 IVDs intended to be used by professionals
do not need assessment by a notified body. In contrast, for SARS-CoV-2 self-tests,
i.e. those intended for lay users, the manufacturer must lodge an application with a
notified body (see procedures referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 9(1)
of Directive 98/79/EC). A list of notified bodies designated under Directive 98/79/EC
is available on the NANDO database: https://ec.europa.eu/growth/toolsdatabases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=directive.notifiedbody&dir_id=20

Translations of the instructions for use and the label
The instructions for use and the label are key documents accompanying the device to
inform the user about the correct use, safety and performance of the device. There
may be national requirements regarding the languages in which these documents are
supplied (see Article 4(4) of Directive 98/79/EC). Manufacturers must ensure good
quality of translations of the instructions for use and of the text elements of the label
into all languages required by the Member States where the device is made
available. Especially for self-tests, manufacturers must ensure that the instructions
for use and the text elements of the label include a good-quality translation into the
official language(s) of the Member State in which the device for self-testing reaches
its final user (section 8.1 of Annex I of Directive 98/79/EC).

Guidance on performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs
The Medical Device Coordination Group document MDCG 2021-21 provides
guidance on the performance evaluation of different types of SARS-CoV-2 IVDs,
including
SARS-CoV-2
self-tests:
https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/default/files/md_sector/docs/mdcg_2021-21_en.pdf
This document is relevant for devices being placed on the market under Directive
98/79/EC and under Regulation (EU) 2017/746.

Transition to Regulation (EU) 2017/746
Under Regulation (EU) 2017/746, all SARS-CoV-2 IVDs are subject to conformity
assessment involving a notified body. Manufacturers that wish to place devices on
the market in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/746, whether based in the
EU/EEA or in 3rd countries, that have not yet submitted an application for conformity
assessment to a notified body are strongly encouraged to liaise with designated
notified bodies as soon as possible. You may find the list of notified bodies
designated under Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on the NANDO database:
https://ec.europa.eu/growth/toolsdatabases/nando/index.cfm?fuseaction=directive.notifiedbody&dir_id=35. A good
quality of the documentation prepared by the manufacturer will facilitate the
assessment by the notified body. Please note also the obligations to designate an
authorised representative established in the EU in accordance with Article 11 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/746.
Provision of the instructions for use and label in the official Union language(s)
determined by the Member State in which the device is made available to the user or
patient is required by Article 10(10) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746.

See also Article 16(2), (3) and (4) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/746 and related
guidance MDCG 2021-26 on the role of importers, distributors or other persons that
engage in repackaging and relabeling activities, including translation of the
information supplied by the manufacturer.
In line with Article 110(3) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746, SARS-CoV-2 self-tests with
valid certificates issued in accordance with Directive 98/79/EC may continue to be
placed on the market after the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/746,
provided they continue to comply with the requirements of the Directive, that there
are no significant changes in the design or intended purpose, and that they comply
with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on post-market surveillance,
vigilance and registration of economic operators and of devices that replace the
corresponding requirements of the Directive. 2

2 On 14 October 2021, the European Commission made a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the
Council amending Regulation (EU) 2017/746 as regards transitional provisions for certain in vitro diagnostic medical devices
and deferred application of requirements for in-house devices (COM(2021)627 final). It contains a proposed provision that
would enable SARS-CoV-2 IVDs placed on the market with a declaration of conformity, regardless of whether or not they
also have a notified body certificate, to be subject to the transitional provisions in Art. 110(3).
