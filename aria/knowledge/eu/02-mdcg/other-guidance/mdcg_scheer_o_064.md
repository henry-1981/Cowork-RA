About the Scientific Committees (2022-2026)
Two independent non-food Scientific Committees provide the European Commission with
the scientific advice it needs when preparing policy and proposals relating to consumer
safety, public health and the environment. The Committees also draw the Commission's
attention to the new or emerging problems which may pose an actual or potential threat.
These committees are the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) and the
Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). The
Scientific Committees review and evaluate relevant scientific data and assess potential
risks. Each Committee has independent scientists from all over the world who are
committed to work in the public interest.
In addition, the Commission relies upon the work of other Union bodies, such as the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the
European Centre for Disease prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Chemicals
Agency (ECHA).
SCHEER
This Committee, on request of Commission services, provides Opinions on questions
concerning health, environmental and emerging risks. The Committee addresses questions
on:
- health and environmental risks related to pollutants in the environmental media and other
biological and physical factors in relation to air quality, water, waste and soils.
- complex or multidisciplinary issues requiring a comprehensive assessment of risks to
consumer safety or public health, for example antimicrobial resistance, nanotechnologies,
medical devices and physical hazards such as noise and electromagnetic fields.

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Main changes in the first UPDATE of the guidelines
The 2019 “SCHEER guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of phthalates in certain
medical devices covering phthalates which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to
reproduction (CMR) or have endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties” have been revised for
the first time after five years. The update was based on experiences with the guidelines
and a literature search over the last five years. Changes were included in the following
sections:
• Scope: referring to information on the use of the guidelines.
• Introduction: regarding chemical description of substances of the group of
phthalates as esters of phthalic acid, and recent regulatory developments.
• Methods: a section was included with the sources of evidence used and the use of
the Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach of the SCHEER, and in view of the literature
search performed.
• Framework: in the framework for the evaluation of alternatives in the non-phthalate
scenario, the terminology of “potential relevant” candidates for assessment as
alternatives for CMR/ED phthalates, has been changed into “most relevant”
candidates (starting in Step 5 of the framework). While a number of alternatives
might be available, the focus should be limited to the likely most relevant
alternatives based on a preliminary evaluation of the suitability of the available
alternatives. This is to avoid unnecessary extensive evaluation of many alternatives.
For the evaluation of alternatives, a minimum number to be evaluated is suggested
to be 3, while evaluation of less than 3 alternatives needs to be justified by
additional information.
• Framework: Step 1 Description and characterisation of the composition of the
medical device. Additional information with reference to (EN) ISO 10993-18 was
included.
• New information on regulation regarding ED hazard classification was included
(Category 1: known or presumed endocrine disruptors, and Category 2 suspected
endocrine disruptors, both for human health and for the environment).
• Annexes: the number of Annexes was extended with Annex 8 that describes the
exposure to currently used CMR/ED phthalate alternatives, Annex 9 that describes
the health hazards of currently used CMR/ED phthalate alternatives, and Annex 10
that describes progress in the development of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives for
use in blood bags.

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

ABSTRACT
The SCHEER was requested to provide an update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk
assessment (BRA) of the presence, in the medical devices specified in the regulation, of
phthalates, which have one or more of the following properties: carcinogenic, mutagenic,
toxic to reproduction (CMR) or endocrine-disrupting (ED), according to the criteria outlined
in the mandate. Only minor changes were included in this update regarding terminology
for selection of alternatives for the CMR/ED phthalates. The main text describing the
selection and evaluation procedure remains essentially the same as presented in the
guidelines as published in 2019. The update mainly concerns the progress made in the last
five years regarding the application, exposure and toxicology of alternatives for the
phthalate plasticisers in medical devices which is presented in additional Annexes.
Phthalates are widely used in industry as plasticisers of polymers, in a variety of
applications such as coated fabrics and roofing membranes, as well as in medical devices,
adhesives, paints, inks and enteric-coated tablets. Di-(2-(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is
the most widely used phthalate in medical devices. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and diethyl
phthalate (DEP) are not used as plasticisers but for other purposes e.g. as additives in
cosmetics, medical devices, and household products.
The interaction of phthalates with the polymers they are embedded is weak, so they may
be released from the plastic product into the environment and into the human body when
exposure occurs.
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 ("Medical Device Regulation", MDR), allows the use of CMR
1A/1B and/or ED substances in certain medical devices above a concentration of 0.1% w/w
when proper justification can be provided (Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4). For such a
justification, several steps need to be considered including the availability of alternative
substances, materials, designs, and medical treatments. In addition, the risk associated
with such alternatives should be weighed against the risk of the use of CMR 1A/1B and/or
ED identified phthalates covered under the MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.1.
However, the risk by itself is not the only parameter to consider: the impact of the possible
alternatives on the functionality, performance and the overall benefit-risk ratio of the
medical device shall also be evaluated.
These guidelines describe the methodology on how to perform a BRA for the justification
of the presence of CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED phthalates (CMR/ED phthalates) in medical
devices and/or parts or materials used therein at percentages above 0.1% by weight
(w/w).
They also describe the methodology for the evaluation of possible alternatives as
replacement of CMR/ED phthalates currently used in medical devices, including alternative
materials, designs or medical treatments.
They are intended to be used by the relevant stakeholders e.g., manufacturers, notified
bodies and regulatory bodies.
The approach of these guidelines may also be used for a BRA of other CMR/ED substances
present in medical devices.

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

For a number of plasticiser applications, alternative substances, including phthalates other
than DEHP, were reported for use in medical devices. However, it can be foreseen that
there may not be suitable alternatives for phthalate plasticisers available for all
applications. During the preparation of the update of these guidelines for BRA of the use
of CMR/ED phthalates in medical devices, the SCHEER noted that a number of BRA
methodologies were theoretically available. However, there is often a lack of adequate data
needed for the BRA of possible relevant alternatives to be used in medical devices.
Therefore, the SCHEER again encourages manufacturers to generate high-quality data on
such alternatives for CMR/ED phthalates in medical devices.
The current guidelines are an update of the guidelines on phthalates published in 2019,
according to the MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.3, stating that the guidelines need
to be updated at least every five years, depending on the latest scientific evidence.

A. UPDATE of the GUIDELINES on benefit-risk assessment for CMR and/or
endocrine-disrupting phthalates used in medical devices
Scope
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR), Annex I “General Safety and
Performance Requirements”, Chapter II “Requirements regarding design and
manufacture”, Section 10.4 deals with the presence of substances that may be released
from a medical device. Annex I Chapter II Section 10.4.1 states that substances that are
carcinogenic, mutagenic, or reprotoxic (CMR) of category 1A and 1B, or substances having
endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties for which there is scientific evidence of probable
serious effects on humans, shall only be present in devices, or parts thereof or those
materials used therein, above 0.1% weight by weight (w/w) when justified according to a
set of criteria listed under Section 10.4.2. The MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.3,
specifies a guideline for the use and evaluation of CMR/ED phthalates, whereas Annex I
Chapter II Section 10.4.4 indicates to draft, when appropriate, such a guideline for other
CMR/ED listed substances.
This is the first five-year update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the
presence of phthalates in certain medical devices covering phthalates which are
carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to reproduction (CMR) or have endocrine-disrupting (ED)
properties as presented in the MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.3.
A SCHEER call for information and experience with the 2019 published guidelines was
published in 2023 and was open from 28 April 2023 until 17 July 2023. The results of this
call indicated the usefulness of the guidelines, but also identified a need for more focus in
specific areas of the guidelines. In addition, the call for information also revealed that the
guidelines were also applied for other listed CMR/ED substances as indicated in Annex I
Chapter II Section 10.4.4. For the update of these guidelines, the scientific literature was
evaluated regarding new information on the toxicity of phthalates and their alternatives,
as well as on the use of these alternatives in medical devices.
For the phthalates and their alternatives, as indicated in MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section
10.4.2, dedicated Annexes regarding recent scientific developments were included in this
update of the guidelines. Considering the methodology for the Benefit Risk Assessment
(BRA) and the reduction of hazardous substances in medical devices according to the MDR
Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.1., the general principles of the evaluation of alternatives
for phthalates may also be applicable for other CMR/ED listed substances. Indeed, the call
for information also revealed that the guidelines were also applied for other listed CMR/ED
substances as indicated in Annex I Chapter II Section 10.4.4, notably cobalt (Co).
These guidelines1 describe the methodology on how to perform a BRA for the justification
of the presence of CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED phthalates in medical devices at percentages
above 0.1% by weight (w/w). They also describe the methodology for the evaluation of
possible alternatives as replacement of CMR/ED phthalates currently used in medical
devices, including alternative materials, designs or medical treatments. They are intended

It should be noted that, in accordance with Regulation (EC) 2017/745, Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.3. and
10.4.4., updates of these guidelines might be available in the future, pending new scientific evidence, but the
guidelines need to be updated at least every five years according to Annex I Chapter II Section 10.4.3.

to be used by the relevant stakeholders e.g. manufacturers, notified bodies and regulatory
bodies.
These guidelines apply to those medical devices and components thereof indicated in
Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.1. of the MDR. They do not provide information for the
BRA of the use of a medical device itself. However, the BRA as described can be integrated
within the risk management system for individual medical devices. For the BRA of medical
devices in general, stakeholders are referred to Section A7.2. of MEDDEV 2.7/1, revision
4. Additional information may be found elsewhere, for example in the following documents
FDA 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, (EN) ISO2 14971, and (EN) ISO/TR 24971. It should be
noted that the acceptability of any risk is evaluated in relation to the benefit of the use of
the medical device.
More specific information supporting the guidelines is presented in several Annexes. Annex
1 to these guidelines describes the mandate, Annex 2 describes the legal text as present
in Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4. of the MDR regarding the use of substances that could
be released from the medical device and pose a risk to patients, and Annex 3 describes
the definitions and abbreviations used in these guidelines. Annex 4 presents a description
of CMR and/or ED substances and the classification thereof according to Regulation (EC)
1272/2008 (“Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation,” CLP). Annex 5 describes
the regulatory context on CMR/ED phthalates including specific migration limits for a
number of phthalates authorised for use as additives in food contact materials (FCM).
Annex 6 presents information on the use of phthalates in medical devices. Annex 7 presents
additional information on various approaches for the risk benefit assessment.
Additional Annexes are included in this update of the guidelines. Annex 8 describes the
exposure to a number of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives. Annex 9 describes information on
the health hazards of a number of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives. Annex 10 describes
progress in the development of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives for use in blood bags.
When the word “patient” is used in these guidelines, it covers professional users and other
persons (e.g. donors in case of blood donation) exposed to the medical device, as well as
patients themselves.

the latest published version of the (EN) ISO standards/documents mentioned in these guidelines should be
used.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

1. Introduction
Placing medical devices on the market, making them available on the market and putting
them into service are all activities governed by Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) that
replaces Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. Medical devices are defined in the MDR as
presented in the text box below:
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply
(1) ‘medical device’ means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant,
reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone
or in combination, for human beings for one or more of the following specific medical
purposes:
— diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of
disease,
— diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or
disability,
— investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological or
pathological process or state,
— providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens derived from
the human body, including organ, blood and tissue donations, and which does not
achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic
means, in or on the human body, but which may be assisted in its function by such
means.
The following products shall also be deemed to be medical devices:
— devices for the control or support of conception;
— products specifically intended for the cleaning, disinfection or sterilisation of devices
as referred to in Article 1(4) and of those referred to in the first paragraph of this point.
As a general requirement, the medical device shall perform according to its intended
purpose and be safe for patients, or where applicable, other persons (e.g. donors) on which
the device is used. The conformity of medical devices shall be evaluated against the
requirements of the MDR. They shall be presumed to be in conformity with this Regulation
if they are in conformity with EU-harmonised standards or the relevant parts of those
standards, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the
European Union. Although not mandatory, these standards provide a route to comply with
the MDR. In addition, the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) document MDCG
2021-5 “Guidance on standardisation for medical devices”, provides information on
different aspects related to standards in the medical devices sector in support of the
requirements laid down in the MDR. It describes the general framework for harmonised
European standards and the relationship between harmonised European standards and EU
legislation.
For medical devices, the horizontal standards (EN) ISO 14971 and (EN) ISO 10993-1 are
especially relevant. (EN) ISO 14971 describes the application of a risk management

10

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

process for medical devices, whereas (EN) ISO 10993-1 deals with the biological evaluation
and testing of medical devices within a risk management process. According to (EN) ISO
10993-1, evaluation of the biological safety of a medical device should be a strategy
planned on a case-by-case basis to identify the hazards and estimate the risks of known
hazards. In Annex A of (EN) ISO 10993-1, a series of endpoints is indicated from which a
selection can be made for the biological evaluation of a medical device. The selection is
based on the nature of the device's contact with the body (device category: surface device,
external communicating device, or implant device; type of contact: skin, mucosal
membrane, compromised surface, blood, tissues, organs; duration of the contact: limited
≤24 h, prolonged >24 h to 30 days, permanent >30 days). A systematic literature review
is conducted as part of the biological evaluation of a medical device, in order to avoid
unnecessary testing ((EN) ISO 10993-1). For this literature review all available information
needs to be considered including peer reviewed publications and regulatory studies. This
systematic literature review should also be performed for a CMR/ED phthalate or relevant
potential alternatives identified for a given phthalate in a medical device. The FDA
published a guidance to provide further clarification and update information on the use of
ISO 10993-1 (FDA 2023).
In addition to (EN) ISO 10993-1, a series of (EN) ISO 10993 standards have been published
describing various assays and approaches for the evaluation of the endpoints identified in
(EN) ISO 10993-1 for the biological evaluation of medical devices. Assays described in the
various standards address cytotoxicity, sensitisation, irritation, systemic toxicity,
implantation, haemocompatibility, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity endpoints.
Additionally, immunotoxicity and organ-specific toxicities need to be considered, if
appropriate. In addition, reproductive and developmental toxicity should be addressed for
novel materials, materials containing substances with known reproductive or
developmental toxicity, medical devices used in relevant target populations (e.g. pregnant
women), and/or medical devices where there is the potential for local presence of device
materials in the reproductive organs ((EN) ISO 10993-1). For the risk assessment, (EN)
ISO 10993-17 describes the process and requirements for the toxicological risk assessment
of medical device constituents, whereas (EN) ISO 10993-18 and (EN) ISO 1099318:2020/Amd.1:2022 describe methods for chemical characterisation of materials used in
medical devices. In addition to the horizontal standards, vertical i.e. device specific
standards and standards for clinical investigation are available and can be applied (e.g.
(EN) ISO 14155).
Furthermore, the EC also provides guidance documents in MEDDEV (e.g. MEDDEV 2.7/1
rev.4 “Clinical evaluation: A guide for manufacturers and notified bodies under directives
93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC”), and MDCG documents, aligned with the MDR (MDCG 20205 “Guidance on clinical evaluation – Equivalence”, and MDCG 2020-6 “Guidance on
sufficient clinical evidence for legacy devices”).
The MDR states that substances that are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic to
reproduction (CMR) of category 1A or 1B, or substances identified at EU level as having
endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties for which there is scientific evidence of probable
serious effects on humans (CMR/ED substances, in this text), shall only be present in
devices or parts thereof or those materials used therein above 0.1% weight by weight
(w/w) when justified (MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.1). Annex 4 of this document
provides further information on the classification of CMR and on identification of ED
substances. The justification for the use of CMR/ED substances in a medical device above
0.1% w/w shall be based on an analysis of potential patient exposure, availability of

11

_______________________________________________________________________________________

possible alternatives, an argumentation why possible alternatives are appropriate or
inappropriate, and on the most recent revision of these guidelines (MDR Annex I, Chapter
II Section 10.4.3).
Phthalates are a group of substances widely used in medical devices as plasticisers. They
are a family of chemicals with different chemical structures: phthalates are esters of the
phthalic acid, i.e. benzene dicarboxylic acid. The position of the carboxylic groups on the
benzene ring differentiates ortho-phthalates (esters of 1,2-benzendicarboxylic acid) from
meta- and para-phthalates (esters of 1,3- and 1,4-benzendicarboxylic acid, respectively).
Many ortho-phthalates have a long history of use as primary plasticisers for polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) and with that function, they may comprise a substantial part of the medical
device. A typical concentration of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP; CAS 117-81-7) in
plasticised polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can be around 30%-40%, based on weight (ECB 2008,
SCENIHR 2015, European Pharmacopeia, 11th ed. 2022). Reproductive toxicity and the
endocrine disrupting activity of a number of phthalates have been acknowledged and
resulted in regulatory measures (e.g., Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP)
Regulation (Regulation (EC) 1272/2008); use restrictions e.g., under Regulation (EC)
1907/2006 (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals,
REACH)), and Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR)).
In the context of these guidelines, the term “phthalate” refers to ortho-phthalates, if not
otherwise stated.
Phthalates currently classified as reproductive toxicants category 1B under the
Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation (Regulation (EC) 1272/2008) and
identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) under Article 57(c) of Regulation (EC)
1907/2006 (REACH) are listed in Annex 5 of this document. This list may continuously be
updated, so it is recommended to consult the Annex VI of the CLP Regulation when using
a CMR/ED phthalate as constituent in a medical device.
In addition, the Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1210 and Commission
Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/636 identified some phthalates as substances of very
high concern (SVHC) according to Article 57(f) of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH),
due to their endocrine disrupting properties with probable serious effects to humans,
namely Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), Dibutyl
phthalate (DBP), Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and Dicyclohexylphthalate (DCHP).
The SCENIHR adopted an Opinion on the safety of medical devices containing DEHPplasticised PVC in 2008, and a revision of that Opinion in 2015 (SCENIHR 2015). The main
source for DEHP exposure of the general population was determined to be food after
migration from food contact materials (FCM). In addition, the use of medical devices can
increase the exposure considerably in the course of specific medical treatments, for
example during massive blood transfusions, haemodialysis, and in neonatal intensive care
units (NICU) for prematurely born neonates (SCENIHR 2015). Although quite a number of
alternative substances were available for DEHP, serious data gaps were observed for some
of them regarding hazard identification and exposure estimation (Bui et al., 2016, SCENIHR
2015). The Danish EPA assessed different alternatives and concluded that, to various
degrees, some substances can be considered to be relevant alternatives to DEHP in terms
of human health hazards, especially regarding the endpoints reproductive and
developmental toxicity (Nielsen et al. 2014). However, the data set was limited for a
number of possible alternatives. Some alternatives showed a low migration rate and some

12

_______________________________________________________________________________________

of them are already used as substitutes in medical devices for traditional DEHPapplications. For example, four additional plasticisers for PVC ((n-butyryl-tri-n-hexyl
citrate) (BTHC), (di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT), (1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic
acid, diisononylester) (DINCH), and (trioctyltrimellitate, tris(2-ethylhexyl)trimellitate)
(TOTM)) used in medical devices have been included in the updated chapters of the
European Pharmacopoeia (EDQM 2019). More recently the 11 th edition of the European
Pharmacopoeia (2022) was published (see EDQM at European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)
11th Edition - European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (edqm.eu)
Phthalates classified as CMR of category 1A or 1B according to the procedure described in
Annex 4 are listed in Annex VI of the CLP Regulation (classification, labelling and packaging
of substances and mixtures) (Regulation (EC) 1272/2008). According to article 57(f) of
Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH) or the Regulation (EC) 528/2012 (Biocides),
phthalates can be identified as having ED-properties when there is scientific evidence of
probable serious effects to human health. Recently, the Commission Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2023/707 amended Regulation (EC) 1272/2008 (CLP), introducing two hazard
categories for endocrine disruptors for human health with Category 1 considering known
or presumed endocrine disruptors for human health, and Category 2 considering suspected
endocrine disruptors for human health.
These guidelines provide a framework of how to perform a BRA for the presence of such
CMR and/or ED phthalates in medical devices or parts or materials used therein at
percentages above 0.1% weight by weight (% w/w), and shall be used by all relevant
stakeholders, e.g., manufacturers, notified bodies and regulatory bodies for the
justification of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates. According to the guidelines, the
evaluation should be performed by a multidisciplinary team, including amongst others e.g.,
a material scientist, medical device specialist, toxicologist and clinician.
A justification for the use of a CMR/ED phthalate can also be based on an already available
justification relating to a medical device for which equivalence with the device in question
can be demonstrated according to the MDR Annex XIV Section 3. The MDR (MDR Annex
XIV, Part A, point 3) requires that biological characteristics also be taken into consideration
for the demonstration of equivalence (MDCG 2020-5). The existing justification can be
used as a reference, and the data used for this justification should be available.
The approach described in these guidelines can also be used for the BRA of other CMR/ED
substances present in medical devices.
Other descriptions for BRA may be “benefit-risk analysis” or “benefit-risk determination”
as defined in the MDR. As Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.3 of the MDR indicates a benefitrisk assessment, this terminology is used in these guidelines.

2. Methods

In drafting an Opinion, the SCHEER relies on the SCHEER Memorandum on Weight of
Evidence and Uncertainties (SCHEER, 2018). However, the Weight of Evidence (WoE)
approach could not be applied for the drafting of these BRA guidelines as they do not
provide a risk assessment and are mainly based on regulatory documents or documents
published by international institutions.
The scientific data referring to plasticisers, plastics, medical device, and toxicity, were
collected from the available scientific literature (through searches in relevant databases,
i.e., MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Find-eR), websites and from documents of other
Scientific Committees and International Organisations (e.g., IARC (WHO), EPA (US), EFSA,
SCCS, etc), as well as Government and Agency publications. As a number of substances
are already known as possible alternative plasticisers for phthalates, the literature search
included a dedicated search for these substances (see below). The terms used in the
literature searches are presented in Table 1.

3. Framework for Benefit-Risk Assessment
The MDR allows the use of CMR 1A/1B and/or ED substances in medical devices above a
concentration of 0.1% w/w when a proper justification can be provided (MDR Annex I,
Chapter II Section 10.4). For such a justification, several steps need to be considered
including the availability of alternative substances, materials, designs, and medical
treatments. In addition, the risks associated with such alternatives shall be weighed
against the risks of the use of CMR 1A/1B and/or ED identified phthalates covered under
MDR Annex I, Chapter II Section 10.4.1. However, risk is not the only parameter to be
considered. The impact of the possible alternatives on the functionality, performance and
the overall benefit-risk ratio of the medical device should also be evaluated.
The justification for the presence of CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED phthalates for which there is
scientific evidence of probable serious effects on humans should be based on a number of
considerations as described below and in Figure 1.
In order to perform the BRA as indicated above, it is important to describe the terminology
to compare the risks of the presence of the phthalates to be evaluated (see text box below).
Annex 3 provides a selection of definitions as present in the MDR and/or the OECD
Substitution and Alternatives Assessment Toolbox.
Alternatives assessment and substitution of harmful chemicals - OECD
For the purpose of these guidelines the following definition for "alternatives" is used:
“alternatives are defined as substances, materials, designs and medical treatments that
can be used to replace the use of CMR and/or ED substances in medical devices”
The alternative therefore is not limited to a possible substitute substance or material but
could also be another device design (e.g. coating/production process/ techniques/lower
concentration of substances) or medical treatment (e.g. procedure, device) or a
combination of technical and substance alternatives that can substitute or eliminate the
use of the CMR/ED phthalate (modified from the REACH Guidance on the preparation of an
application for authorisation).

17

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

The functionality and performance of the alternative should be comparable to the extent
that there would be no clinically relevant difference foreseen in the performance of the
device or in the outcome of the alternative medical procedure. Considerations of
functionality and performance shall be based on proper scientific justification. In order to
justify the use of a CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED phthalate, the manufacturer shall clearly
demonstrate that the identified alternative(s) are not appropriate for maintaining the
functionality, performance and benefit-risk ratios of the medical device.
A number of aspects need to be considered for the justification of the presence of a
phthalate classified as CMR category 1A or 1B and/or identified as ED with a content >
0.1% w/w in a medical device, or parts thereof or those materials used therein, as intended
to be used.
In summary, these aspects can be considered by a stepwise approach given below and
presented in Figure 1. Further details and examples on the steps used in the guidelines are
given in the following sections.
Assessment of the CMR/ED phthalate (CMR/ED phthalate scenario)
Step 1:
Description and characterisation of the composition of the medical device (or parts
or materials thereof). Identification of the presence and concentration of CMR/ED
phthalate(s) in weight by weight percentage (% w/w).
Step 2:
Description of the use and function of the CMR/ED phthalate used in the medical
device.
2a. Description of functionality/performance provided by the presence of the
CMR/ED phthalate.
2b. Description of the benefit in terms of material properties and/or clinical outcome
of the presence of CMR/ED phthalate in the medical device.
Step 3:
Assessment of the risks of the CMR/ED phthalate.
3a. Determination of the patient exposure based on realistic worst-case3 use
scenarios in the intended use.
3b. Identification of biocompatibility, general toxicological and specific CMR/ED
hazard characterisation associated with the phthalate.
3c. Determination of the toxicological risk based on tolerable/acceptable exposure
for the patient, based on pre-clinical and clinical information (if available).
3d. Determination of the risks for various intended use scenarios and patient
groups.
It should be noted that the information obtained in steps 1 to 3 needs to be provided for
the risk assessment (and BRA) of the CMR/ED constituents of any medical device. For a
medical device already on the market, this information should already be available. For the

Realistic worst case is the situation where the exposure is estimated using a range of factors (i.e. duration,
amount, exposure controls), where applicable, the ones that would be expected to lead to maximum amount of
exposure (e.g. exposure might be assessed under realistic simulated-use scenarios by (EN) ISO 10993-12 and
(EN) ISO 10993-18 or a non-volatile residue test (USP <661>)). The realistic worst case does not include
deliberate misuse. (EU Biocides Regulation 528/2012).

risk assessment, all available information needs to be used including peer reviewed
publications and regulatory studies. The SCHEER recommends using a WoE approach for
performing the risk assessment.

Assessment of possible alternative(s) (non CMR/ED phthalate scenario)
Step 4:
Inventory of possible alternative(s).
4a. Substances.
4b. Materials.
4c. Designs and/or medical treatments4.
Step 5:
Identification of the most relevant candidates for assessment as alternatives to
CMR/ED phthalates and justification for the selection and exclusion of possible
alternatives. This also includes assessment of the availability of the most relevant
alternative(s).
Step 6:
Description of the most relevant alternative(s) identified.
6a. Description of functionality and performance of the most relevant
alternative(s).
6b. Description of the benefit in terms of material properties and/or clinical outcome
of the use of the most relevant alternative(s).
Step 7:
Assessment of the risks of the most relevant alternative(s) identified
7a. Determination of patient exposure of the alternative(s) based on a realistic
worst-case use scenario of intended use.
7b. Determination, where available, of biocompatibility, toxicological and CMR/ED
hazard characterisation associated with the alternative(s).
7c. Determination of toxicological risk to the patient, based on tolerable/acceptable
exposure of the alternative(s) (if available).
7d. Determination of risk of the alternative(s) for various use scenarios and patient
groups.
For the risk assessment all available information needs to be used including peer reviewed
publications and regulatory studies. The SCHEER recommends using a WoE approach for
performing the risk assessment.
Assessment of most relevant alternative(s) versus CMR/ED phthalate
Step 8:
Comparison of functionality and performance of CMR/ED phthalate as used in the
medical device with functionality and performance of the most relevant
alternative(s) identified

It should be noted that for alternative designs and/or medical treatments, appropriate endpoints for risks and
benefits shall be selected.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Step 9:
Comparison of hazard characterisation and exposure in the realistic worst-case
scenario of original CMR/ED phthalate as used in the medical device with those
identified for the most relevant alternative(s) identified.
Step 10:
Comparison of benefit and risk of CMR/ED phthalate used in the medical device with
the most relevant alternatives identified.
The same approach as used for assessing risks to patients shall be used for the justification
of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in medical devices to evaluate the risk for
professional users and for other persons (e.g. donors) exposed to CMR/ED phthalates
released from medical devices. When alternative designs or medical treatments were
identified as potential alternatives in Step 5, adequately adopted endpoints for risks and
benefits shall be chosen.
It should be noted that scientific information and/or technical developments may become
available after the initial assessment regarding the use of alternatives for CMR/ED
phthalates. Therefore, a revision of the BRA of the presence of the CMR and/or ED
phthalate may be necessary. Revisions of the above indicated BRA shall occur as indicated
in the relevant sections of MDR for the general risk assessment of the medical device.
Figure 1 illustrates the BRA and is based on Eliason and Morose (2011), EMA (2014), FDA
(2016) and a critical selection from the OECD Substitution and Alternatives Assessment
Toolbox (http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org). It presents the stepwise approach described
above, including a general description of factors to consider when performing a BRA. Figure
1 presents a use scenario in which the CMR/ED phthalate is used in a medical device versus
a non-use scenario in which a relevant alternative is evaluated.

4. Assessment of the presence of phthalates in a medical device 5
When evaluating the risk for the use of a medical device, it is necessary to identify the
components and substances present in the medical device, in order to estimate any
possible patient and user exposure. Therefore, it is necessary to provide most of the
information as indicated for the use of CMR/ED phthalates, in order to prove compliance
with the general safety and performance requirements (see MDR) for the phthalatecontaining medical device.
When more than one CMR/ED phthalate is used simultaneously in the medical device, a
justification shall be provided for each of the phthalates and their combination. Some risk
assessment data regarding the combination of phthalates are available, as EFSA has
recently proposed a Group Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for some of them, having a similar
Mode of Action (MoA) in vivo (EFSA 2019, see Annex 5). Information on assessment of
combined exposures to phthalates can be found, for example, in the report by the National
Research Council (US) Committee on the Health Risk of Phthalates (2008) and the ECHA
restriction of articles containing BBP, DEHP, DBP and DiBP for indoor environments and
direct exposure (ECHA, 2014) (https://echa.europa.eu/registry-of-restriction-intentions//dislist/details/0b0236e180d73895), and EFSA guidance on cumulative exposure (EFSA,
2019, 2021). In addition, the US EPA has drafted a framework for cumulative risk
assessment, which was made publicly available for comments in 2023 (see EPA website)

Step 1: Description and characterisation of the composition of the medical device.
Provide a description of the medical device and its composition including identification and
the concentration of each CMR/ED phthalate in the device, and the type of
chemical/physical binding of the phthalate in the formulation/device, when there is an
impact on leakage.
Use available chemical information for identifying target phthalates (e.g. CAS Nº; EINECS
Nº; IUPAC name). The chemical characterisation process can use various qualitative and
quantitative techniques (e.g. see Annex F of (EN) ISO 10993-18). These techniques can
provide detailed information regarding a material’s characterisation, its purity, the
chemical composition, and the presence of impurities and degradation products.
The chemical characterisation includes the determination of extractables (chemicals that
can be extracted from a medical device using laboratory extraction conditions) and
leachables (chemicals that are released from a medical device during its clinical use, under
normal clinical conditions).
The chemical composition of a medical device can be evaluated by using, for example, (EN)
ISO 10993-18. This standard covers the chemical characterisation of the medical device
and the determination of leachables, and it provides information on the quality
requirements of the analytical methods.

The analysis presented in Section 4 (Steps 1-3) describes the current use scenario of the CMR/ED phthalate,
i.e., the scenario that would continue in the future if no additional action (other than, e.g., a planned regulatory
action entering into force) is taken to limit, substitute or eliminate the presence of the CMR/ED phthalate in the
medical device. The current scenario can also be referred to as baseline, business as usual or continued use
scenario.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Step 2: Use and function of CMR/ED phthalates in the medical device.
Characterise the function and use of the CMR/ED phthalates in the medical device and the
properties it imparts to the device.
Provide a description of the intended use, indications(s), functionality and performance of
the medical device containing the CMR/ED phthalate and how the use of the phthalate is
critical for its functionality and performance (MDCG 2019-9 rev.1 “Summary of safety and
clinical performance”). For PVC, for example, consider the performance, maintenance,
flexibility, and durability of the medical device, and for CMR/ED, consider phthalate
viscosity and PVC compatibility. Provide a description of the patients targeted (e.g., with
respect to sex, age, probable vulnerable groups6).
Provide a description of use types of the medical device for which it is intended (e.g., single
versus repeated exposure).
Other factors that can be relevant include the critical properties (e.g., flexibility), the
conditions of use, critical quality criteria, process/treatment and performance constraints
(e.g., sterilisation, device/drug interactions), regulatory or clinical or other requirements
that the CMR/ED phthalates and the phthalate-containing device need to deliver.
Key criteria for the function, performance and overall use should be outlined and applied
as the basis for an identification and screening of possible alternatives and a more detailed
assessment of the most relevant alternatives.
Justification for the selection of these criteria should be provided. It should be noted that
CMR/ED phthalates may have different functions depending on the medical device in which
they are used (e.g., DEHP for flexibility in tubing and red blood cells (RBCs) quality for
storage in blood bags).
Benefits of the device with CMR/ED phthalates should also be considered, e.g. some
medical treatments require the use of a medical device with a high degree of flexibility for
the patient’s comfort and safety.
Present an inventory of the benefits of the CMR/ED phthalates in the medical device for
the patients (separately for vulnerable groups). More detailed information on the benefit
assessment is presented in Section 8.
Step 3: Assessment of the risks of the CMR/ED phthalate.
Perform a risk assessment of the CMR/ED phthalate present in the medical device by using
all the available information, including peer reviewed publications and regulatory studies.
The SCHEER recommends the application of WoE methodology. The risk assessment should
contain:
1) a description of the potential phthalate exposure of various patient groups for which the
medical device is intended (e.g. single vs repeated exposure). This should separately
include vulnerable groups. (EN) ISO 10993-1 provides information on use type in terms of
exposure potential (e.g. limited (≤24h), prolonged (>24h to 30d) and permanent (>30d))
that slightly differs from the duration of use as defined in the MDR (Annex VIII, 1, transient
<60 minutes, short term 60 minutes to 30 days, long term >30 days);
2) a description of the hazard characterisation.
Vulnerable Groups (in these guidelines): vulnerable groups of the population such as children and individuals
with increased susceptibility due to pre-existing disease, medication, compromised immunity, pregnancy or
breastfeeding, women and men in reproductive age. These vulnerable groups also include infants, elderly people
or people with poor health conditions.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Exposure estimation
Estimate the release of the CMR/ED phthalate from the medical device, when used in
various clinical modalities. This information should preferably be based on data from direct
measurement or, when not available, on an estimation based on worst-case scenario or
from high quality scientific literature. For a medical device as a whole, a leachable study is
not practical due to challenges with reproducing actual clinical conditions. Therefore,
simulated-use extraction studies using representative materials are often performed
instead (as specified in (EN) ISO 10993-12 and (EN) ISO 10993-18). For data generation,
analytical evaluations should include material contact conditions for the evaluation of
leaching of substances from medical devices. These should consider, for example,
temperature, contact duration and frequency, polarity of contact liquids, flow rates, contact
surface, and volume of contact liquids ((EN) ISO 10993-1, (EN) ISO 10993-12, (EN) ISO
10993-18, USP 661). The contact conditions should be set to represent realistic worst-case
conditions, taking into account the intended use of the medical device.
Estimate exposure to the phthalate(s) considering data on the release of the substance
from the device in the conditions of use.
Consider repeated use scenarios (e.g. dialysis, apheresis donation, chronic treatment) and
different population groups.
If a medical device contains several types of CMR/ED phthalates, the potential impact of
this combined exposure must also be considered.
More details on the use of phthalates in medical devices are presented in Annex 6. Risk
management measures in place and their effectiveness should be described and taken into
account in the assessment ((EN) ISO 14971, (EN) ISO 10993-1). In addition, data from
biomonitoring programmes may become available that could also provide information on
exposure levels of phthalates in the general population and more specifically during medical
treatment.
Information on human exposure to phthalates in general and currently used alternatives
in medical devices is presented in Annex 8.
Hazard characterisation
Describe hazards associated with the CMR/ED phthalate by considering all relevant
toxicological endpoints for acute as well as for repeated dose toxicity. (EN) ISO 10993-1
provides information on hazard endpoints to be considered depending on the exposure and
use category of a medical device, whereas a tolerable intake (systemic toxicity) or tolerable
contact level (local toxicity) can be determined according to (EN) ISO 10993-17. Possible
hazardous effects of combined exposure should also be assessed. This information can be
based on data from direct measurement or from any source of scientific literature analysed
on the base of the WoE principles.
Identify an adequate Point of Departure (PoD) for risk assessment, meaning it should be
representative of the route and duration of exposure associated to the actual use of the
specific medical device under evaluation. In case of a threshold Mode of Action, such a PoD
could be the most sensitive no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) or lowest-observedadverse-effect-levels (LOAEL), or a dose that causes a predefined response (Benchmark
Dose – BMD or BMDL, the lower limit of the BMD confidence interval) obtained by
benchmark dose modelling. In case of non-threshold effects (e.g. in the case of genotoxic

24

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

carcinogens), such a dose descriptor could be a T25 7 value or the benchmark dose
associated with a 10% response (BMD10) (EFSA, 2022). Hazards should be evaluated by
a relevant exposure route for the intended use of the assessed medical device.
Where a reference derived no effect level (DNEL) and/or a reference derived minimum
effect level (DMEL) or a Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) or any other reference value have
already been derived in the context of other EU legislations, the analysis could refer to
these derived figures without referring to detailed assessment how these data have been
derived (e.g. under Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 (REACH), Regulation (EC) 1935/2004
(Food Contact Materials), and Commission Regulation (EU) 10/2011 (Plastic materials
intended to come into contact with food)). However, as some of these data may have been
derived in the past, relevant up-to-date scientific evidence (based upon a systematic
literature review) and up-to-date risk assessment methodology for all relevant toxicological
endpoints needs to be considered. If such already available reference values are not used
in the assessment, a justification should be presented (e.g. new information/studies).
Some of these other legislations for CMR/ED substances are presented in Annex 4. In
addition, information on the hazard characterisation of DEHP is detailed in the SCENIHR
Opinion on DEHP (2015).
The ED property of the phthalate, which is inherent part of the hazard characterisation,
can be described according to the published EFSA/ECHA guidance document 8. The current

ED properties include impacts on fertility, birth defects (e.g., cryptorchidism, hypospadias),
developmental effects (e.g. effects on thyroid), and other effects associated with the
CMR/ED phthalates.
The Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 of 19 December 2022 identifies,

endocrine disruptors (Category 1) and suspected endocrine disruptors (Category 2), both

published in 2017, there is no reference to this ED categorisation. This ED categorisation
is also not yet included in the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) endorsed
documents or other EU Guidance documents on medical devices.
Risk characterisation
Evaluate the risk by comparing exposure levels that are considered safe (i.e. health-based
reference values) with the expected exposure (worst-case scenario) to obtain a Risk
Characterisation Ratio (RCR). Alternatively, for obtaining a MoS, compare the expected
exposure (worst-case scenario) with the relevant PoD. PoDs for this comparison could be
the most relevant and lowest no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) or lowestAnimal dose-descriptor; chronic dose rate that will give 25% of the animal's tumours at a specific tissue site
after correction for spontaneous incidence (Dybing et al., 1997)

observed-adverse-effect-levels (LOAEL), or a dose that causes a predefined response
(Benchmark dose – BMD or BMDL, the lower limit of the BMD confidence interval) for
threshold substances. For non-threshold substances (e.g. carcinogen acting with a
genotoxic mechanism), a T25 value or the benchmark dose associated with a 10%
response (BMD10) could be used.
Data (i.e. exposure level and PoD) on the relevant exposure route of the medical device
application (e.g. intravenously) should be used (see also (EN) ISO 10993-1 Table A.1). A
route-to-route extrapolation is only possible when the kinetic behaviour of the phthalates
is known by using appropriate modelling. It has to be noted that patients are sometimes
exposed to medical devices only for a limited period of time. According to (EN) ISO 1099317 for medical devices a toxicological risk can be estimated based on tolerable intake
(systemic toxicity) or tolerable contact level (local toxicity), using an estimated worst-case
exposure for each constituent.
By dividing the PoD by appropriate uncertainty factors (also known as safety or assessment
factors) reference values can be derived, such as “Derived No-Effect Level” (DNEL),
“Derived Minimum Effect Level” (DMEL) or intakes over lifetime without presenting an
appreciable risk to health (ADI or TDI/TWI) 9. Specifically for ED effects, additional
assessment factors have been suggested as proposed recently (Hass et al., 2019).
The risks can be described by calculating the Margin of Exposure (MoE) or the Margin of
Safety (MoS), which is the ratio between the lowest relevant PoD and the expected
exposure (worst-case scenario). This ratio should be compared with an adequate MoS,
which quantitatively corresponds to the uncertainty factors used to derive the reference
values.
Alternatively, it is also possible to compare the reference values (e.g. the TDI) with the
expected exposure (worst-case scenario): when the ratio, known as RCR, is <1 there is no
concern, whereas values >1 represent a potential concern (and a refinement of the
evaluation could be performed, for example not using the worst case scenarios).
If neither of these procedures is followed, a scientifically-based justification should be
provided (e.g. new information/studies).
This evaluation must be performed for every group (patients/donors) for which the device
is intended to be used.
Determine and describe any situations in which the risk could be acceptable for the use of
the CMR/ED phthalate in the medical device. The benefit-risk assessment for the use of
the CMR/ED phthalate can be performed using for example MEDDEV 2.7/1rev4 and (EN)
ISO 14971 (see also Section 8). The MDR considers a risk acceptable when it is outweighed
by the benefit of using the device in patients (MDR Chapter I and Chapter VI Article 61 and
62, Annex I Chapter I Sections 1 and 9).
In addition to potential CMR/ED effects, discuss any other potential hazards associated
with the composition of the device (e.g. by using the EN ISO 10993 series of standards).
Evaluate if such effects are associated with the use of the CMR/ED phthalates in the device.
The assessment of the risk should be accompanied by an estimation of the impact of
uncertainties in the described outcomes (see Section 10).

ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake and TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) are defined as the dose to which an individual
can be daily exposed lifetime, without experiencing significant adverse effects. The TWI (Tolerable Weekly Intake)
is generally used for persistent bioaccumulating chemicals instead of TDI.

medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

It is to be noted that most of this information as described for Step 1 to Step 3 should
already be embedded in the BRA of the marketed medical device, and for high-risk devices,
in the Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) as part of the dossier of the
currently used medical device (see MDCG 2019-9 rev.1 “Summary of safety and clinical
performance”). In this SSCP, a description of the device shall be presented, including, for
example, key functional elements and any materials or substances in contact with the
patient’s tissues.

5. Assessment of possible alternative substances, materials, designs or medical
treatments10
In general, a similar risk assessment as presented in Step 3 above has to be performed
for the alternative (substances, materials, designs or medical treatment). An inventory
should be prepared in order to be able to evaluate possible alternatives. An alternative
could be another substance/material or device design modification, or it could be a clinical
procedure (e.g., a process, technique, treatment or modification) or a combination of
technical and substance alternatives.
Step 4: Inventory of possible alternatives
Prepare a list of possible alternatives (such as substances, materials, designs or medical
treatments)11.
A description of the alternative scenario (CMR/ED phthalate "non-use scenario”) needs to
be presented including identification of alternative substances, materials, designs or
medical treatment, e.g. by including consideration of all available information, such as
alternative medical devices available on the market, information about independent
research, published peer-reviewed studies, systematic literature reviews, risk assessment
reports or scientific opinions from relevant scientific committees and the results of in-house
research and development. The identification of possible alternatives should be properly
documented.
Step 5: Identification of the candidates for assessment as most relevant alternatives for
phthalates
The MDR indicates that an analysis of all possible alternatives shall be performed. However,
when many alternatives are available it would not be feasible to do an extensive evaluation
of all alternatives. It is therefore recommended to select a number of most relevant
alternatives based on screening against key criteria for function, performance, toxicity, and
overall use in the medical device in question (see below). In addition, analysis of availability
and technical feasibility might affect choices for alternatives as well. Preferably a number
of alternatives should be evaluated, and justification should be provided when fewer than
three alternatives are evaluated.
A preliminary analysis of possible alternative substances, materials or designs or medical
treatments should be performed. This preliminary analysis should include a description of
their possible use as alternative substance, material, designs or medical treatments.
The analysis presented in Section 5 constitutes the non-use scenario or the scenario that would transpire if the
CMR/ED phthalates would no longer be used in the medical device.
11
Information source for alternatives might be the European Pharmacopoeia.

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Justification on how and why alternatives are rejected for further assessment by defining
inclusion and exclusion criteria should be provided.
Information/data on functionality (e.g., level of flexibility in tubes) as well as performance
and/or chemical safety assessment (e.g., hazard profile) may be used for rejection of the
less likely alternatives (see below) and no further risk assessment for the alternative is
required. The rejection of the less likely alternatives requires justification and
documentation. The compliance to chemical requirements, according to the MDR, should
be demonstrated after a positive outcome of the assessment of the functionality and
performance.
In addition to the comparison in terms of functionality, technical performance and risks to
patients and users, which are critical elements for the benefit-risk assessment, Annex I
Section 10.4.2 of the MDR states that the justification for the presence of CMR/ED
substances should also be based on an analysis of the availability of possible alternatives.
Availability has several aspects, including, for example, the availability of necessary
quantity (volumes) of the alternative on the market within a required timeframe and the
ability to gain access to alternatives that may be proprietary (e.g. via licensing).
If potential alternatives can be identified, a shortlist of the most relevant alternatives can
be established for further detailed assessment with regard to technical feasibility, health
benefits, comparison of risks, existing legal requirements, availability, and technical
performance. In the event that no alternative is identified, information should be presented
on the actions undertaken to identify alternatives.
A compilation of resources and elements in support of chemical substitution and an
assessment of alternatives can be found on the OECD webpage:
http://www.oecdsaatoolbox.org/
Step 6: Description of identified most relevant alternative(s) and conclusion on their
technical feasibility
CMR/ED phthalates are present in medical devices for a specific purpose depending on the
intended use of the medical device. For example, phthalates offer the possibility for finetuning the flexibility (e.g., providing optimal flexibility of tubes without kinking) of a PVCbased medical device. In addition, DEHP has a stabilising effect on red blood cells in blood
bags, reducing haemolysis during storage and improving transfusion efficacy (Klei et al.,
2022). Technical feasibility of an alternative is based on the alternative fulfilling the
function of the CMR/ED phthalate. Therefore, it is essential to assess the functional
properties in relation to the intended use of the medical device. Besides functionality,
performance under intended use conditions should also be considered.
Argumentation shall be provided for justifying why possible substances and/or material
substitutes, if available, or design or medical treatment changes, if feasible, are
inappropriate in relation to maintaining the functionality and/or performance of the medical
device. For example, it might be the case that replacement is possible for one specific
functional use, whereas for another functionality the use of the CMR/ED phthalate remains
necessary. Other aspects related to the performance of the alternatives also need to be
considered, like material processing conditions (Crespo et al., 2007), material quality after
sterilisation (Burgos and Jiménez 2009), and possible interaction with drugs in therapeutic
infusion systems (Treleano et al., 2009, Salloum et al., 2015, Tortolano et al., 2018).

28

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

The benefit(s) should also be considered. An inventory of the benefit(s) of the most
relevant alternative substances, materials, designs or medical treatments for patient
populations (separately for vulnerable patient groups) should be presented (see Section
8).
The evaluation of the most relevant alternatives identified can be done in a tiered way to
avoid full assessments for each candidate alternative. For example, based on the outcome
of the functionality evaluation, the choice of the most relevant candidates might be
reconsidered, and some might be discarded before performing the risk assessment (see
Step 7).
The ECHA guidance on the preparation of an application for authorisation and ECHA formats
for Analysis of Alternatives provide more detailed information on how to conduct an initial
screening of possible alternatives and how to assess the technical feasibility of potential
alternatives. Submitted applications for authorisations contain a number of examples
(https://echa.europa.eu/applications-for-authorisation-previous-consultations)
of
technical feasibility assessments for uses of substances of very high concern.
Step 7: Assessment of the risk of the most relevant alternatives
The risk assessment of alternatives is comparative in nature. Its aim is to assist in
determining whether the transition to the alternatives would lead to lower/higher benefit
and/or risk to human health for patients when compared to the current use of the CMR/ED
phthalates in the medical device. The methodology of the assessment in this step is similar
to that in Step 3, as performed for the phthalate to be evaluated with reference to the
alternative. For the risk assessment, all available information needs to be used including
peer-reviewed publications and regulatory studies. The SCHEER recommends using a WoE
approach for performing the risk assessment.
If a number of most relevant alternatives were identified under Steps 1-6, a risk
assessment of these most relevant alternative substance/material or designs or medical
treatments should be performed. The risk assessment should contain a description of the
substance/material (alternative design or medical procedure) exposure of various person
groups (e.g., including patients, donors, professional users) for which the medical device
is intended to be used (considering single or repeated use). The assessment for vulnerable
groups should be included as a separate section. For each subgroup, a different level of
risk may be accepted based on the potential benefit of the medical device for that particular
group. Risk management measures ((EN) ISO 14971, (EN) ISO 10993-1) and their
effectiveness to reduce exposure should be described and taken into account in the
assessment.
Exposure estimation
Estimate the possible release of the most relevant alternative substance(s) when used in
various treatment modalities. The rate of leaching should be considered when estimating
the potential exposure to the alternative substance. Multiple use scenarios (including
various types of possible contact) should be considered for estimating exposure of the
alternative substance also considering repeated use scenarios (e.g. frequent use of
dialyzer) and different population groups. This information should preferably be based on
data from direct measurement or on an estimation based on worst-case scenario. The

29

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

leaching tests should be performed using similar conditions as for the original medical
device ((EN) ISO 10993-12, (EN) ISO 10993-18). Scientific argumentation should be
provided in case of deviation from these conditions. Some information on the exposure to
possible alternative substances for DEHP is presented in Annex 8.

Hazard identification
Identify hazards based on literature, supplier documentation and other information (such
as risk assessments performed by regulatory bodies). Describe hazards associated with
the most relevant alternative substance/material by considering all relevant toxicological
endpoints for acute as well as for repeated dose toxicity including human data.
Identify an adequate point of departure (PoD) for risk assessment, meaning that it should
be representative of the route and duration of exposure for the specific medical device
under evaluation. In case of a threshold Mode of Action, such a PoD could be the most
sensitive no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) or lowest-observed-adverse-effectlevels (LOAEL), or a dose that causes a predefined response (Benchmark dose – BMD or
BMDL, the lower limit of the BMD confidence interval) obtained by benchmark dose
modelling. When there are non-threshold effects (e.g. in the case of genotoxic
carcinogens), such a dose descriptor could be a T25 value or the benchmark dose
associated with a 10% response (BMD10) (EFSA, 2022). Hazards should be evaluated by
a relevant exposure route for the intended use of the assessed medical device.
For the hazard identification, special attention should be on the determination of any
potential CMR and/or ED property of the alternative substance used. For further
information, consider the ECHA Guidance on the application of the CLP criteria
(https://echa.europa.eu/documents/10162/23036412/clp_en.pdf/58b5dc6d-ac2a-49109702-e9e1f5051cc5)
or see Annex VI of the CLP Regulation. ED properties of the alternative substance/material
can be described according to the recently published EFSA/ECHA guidance document
(ECHA 2018)12.
These effects may include impacts on fertility, birth defects (e.g., cryptorchidism,
hypospadias), developmental effects, and other potential toxic effects associated with
phthalates with ED properties and reprotoxic effects category 1A/B. It needs also to be
considered that the potential alternative (substances, materials, designs or medical
treatments) could also have other hazards than those of the CMR/ED activity. These other
hazards and their possible associated risks should be discussed for example by using the
EN ISO 14971 and the EN ISO 10993 series. See also (EN) ISO 10993-1 Table A.1. Some
information on the health hazards of possible alternative substances for DEHP are
presented in Annex 9.

ECHA and EFSA are working on updating the Guidance on the application of CLP criteria for newly added hazard
classes, e.g., ED for human health. For more information see: New hazard classes 2023 - ECHA (europa.eu)

medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Risk characterisation
Evaluate the risk by comparing exposure levels that are considered safe (i.e. health-based
reference values), with the expected exposure (realistic worst-case use scenario) to obtain
a Risk Characterisation Ratio (RCR). For obtaining a MoS, compare the expected exposure
(worst-case scenario) with the relevant PoD in relation to route and duration of exposure.
PoD could be the most relevant and lowest NOAEL, LOAEL, BMDL for threshold substances,
or T25 or BMD10 for non-threshold substances. Data on the relevant exposure route of the
medical device application (e.g. intravenously) should be used (see also (EN) ISO 109931 Table A.1).
It has to be noted that patients may be exposed to medical devices only for a limited period
of time. (EN) ISO 10993-17 provides information for estimating a toxicological risk based
on tolerable intake or tolerable contact level, using a worst-case estimated exposure for
each of the constituents. For medical devices, a tolerable contact level (e.g. for irritation)
or tolerable intake (e.g. for systemic toxicity) can be determined by (EN) ISO 10993-17.
By dividing the point of departure for risk assessment by appropriate assessment or
uncertainty factors, reference values can be derived, such as DNELs, ADI, TDI or TWI for
threshold substances, or DMELs for non-threshold substances. Specifically for ED effects,
additional assessment factors have been suggested as proposed recently (Hass et al.,
2019). Where a reference DNEL and/or a reference DMEL have already been derived in the
context of other EU legislations, the assessment could refer to these derived figures without
referring to a detailed assessment of how these data have been derived (e.g. under REACH
legislation, Food Contact Material legislation).
The risks can be described by calculation of the Margin of Exposure (MoE) or the Margin of
Safety (MoS) for the substances present in a medical device, which is the ratio between
the lowest relevant PoD and the expected exposure (e.g. realistic worst-case use scenario)
and comparison with an adequate MoS, which quantitatively corresponds to the uncertainty
factors used to derive the reference values.
Alternatively, it is also possible to compare the reference values (e.g. the TDI) with the
expected exposure (worst-case scenario): when the ratio, known as RCR, is <1 there is no
concern, whereas values >1 represent a potential concern (and a refinement of the
evaluation could be performed, for example not using the worst case scenarios).
If neither of these procedures is followed, a scientifically-based justification should be
provided (e.g. new information/studies).
Perform this evaluation for every patient and other groups for which the device is intended
to be used.
Determine and describe acceptability of the risk for the use of the most relevant
alternatives. Risks may be acceptable when they are outweighed by the benefits for the
patient.
Consider any known adverse events associated with the operation of the device using the
phthalate, and whether the potential alternatives might affect these adverse events. These
considerations can be based upon a systematic literature review (see MEDDEV 2.7/1rev4).
This exercise has to be performed for each of the most relevant alternative substances
identified and/or materials.

31

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

There are a large number of phthalates, and some, not yet classified/identified as CMR/ED,
may be potentially relevant alternatives for the CMR/ED phthalate used in medical devices.
However, these phthalates may have CMR or ED hazardous properties and some are
already classified/designated for these properties (see above). Such phthalates might be
identified as alternatives when their CMR/ED risk is reduced compared to the phthalate
intended to be used. In addition, different non-ortho-phthalate substances have also been
proposed as alternative plasticisers. The SCENIHR published an updated DEHP Opinion,
including some information on potential alternative plasticisers for DEHP (SCENIHR, 2015).
Although many alternatives were potentially available, it was also observed that for many
of them, the information on potential risks and the necessary risk assessment was rather
limited, precluding their use as alternatives. Some information on the exposure and health
hazards of possible alternative substances for DEHP are presented in Annex 8 and Annex
9, respectively.
In the event that the risk assessment of a most relevant alternative cannot be performed
when PoD or reference values for the alternative are lacking, documentation should be
presented on the actions undertaken to obtain information to characterise the risk,
including the outcome (for example, QSAR /read-across could be performed).
Note shall be taken that alternative designs or medical treatments might lead to the
adaptation of endpoints for the benefit-risk assessment when compared to the toxicological
endpoints of CMR/ED phthalates.
The assessment of the risk should be accompanied by an estimation of the uncertainties
in the described outcomes, which might be quantitative (e.g., confidence interval, standard
deviation) or qualitative (see Section 10).
Conclude the analysis of the most relevant alternative(s) with a summary describing the
possible scenario(s) (see Figure 1).

6. Assessment of most relevant alternative substances, materials, designs or
medical treatments
Based on the information obtained above, a decision can be made on the appropriateness
of the most relevant alternatives (substance, material, design or medical treatment.
Several factors need to be included in the evaluation, such as weighing of technical
feasibility, benefits and risks and, if possible, quantification of benefits and risks. These
steps entail a comparison of the CMR/ED phthalate “use-scenario” (summarised in Step 3)
with the “Non-use scenario” (summarised in Step 4) as shown in Figure 1.
Step 8: Comparison of functionality and performance of CMR/ED phthalate as used in the
medical device with functionality and performance of identified most relevant
alternative(s).
Compare the functionality and performance of CMR/ED phthalate in the medical device and
the potential relevant alternative substance/material (or designs or medical treatments by
choosing adequate endpoints). Perform Step 8 for each candidate identified as the most
relevant alternative in Section 5.

32

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

If several potential alternatives have a similar functionality and hazard profile, exposure
conditions and possibilities for Risk Management Measures (RMM) resulting in risk
reduction should be considered (see below). Risk management is described in (EN) ISO
14971.
In this comparison, additional issues, not directly related to the functionality and
performance of the alternative itself, like availabilities and technical possibilities,
sterilisation effects and interactions with infusion liquids, are also important for the
application of the alternative and the comparison with the CMR/ED phthalates, and thus
should be considered.
Step 9: Comparison of risk(s) of CMR/ED phthalate as used in the medical device with
risk(s) of identified most relevant alternatives.
Compare the risk of both CMR/ED phthalate and alternative substance/material (or designs
or medical treatments by choosing adequate endpoints).
Perform Step 9 for each potential alternative.
If several potential alternatives have a similar functionality and hazard profile, exposure
conditions and possibilities for Risk Management Measures (RMM) resulting in risk
reduction should be considered. Risk management is described in (EN) ISO 14971.
There may be difficulties in comparing the risks of a substance e.g. a phthalate, and the
risks of a technical alternative such as medical design or medical treatment. For example,
there may be risks associated with alternative technologies, but these may not be of the
same nature of the risk presented by the use of phthalates. However, the potential
alternative must represent a reduction in the overall risks to human health (Step 10).
Therefore, a comparison of risks must be conducted, and the applicant will need to consider
how these different risks might be compared in terms of risks to human health. Note that
an alternative medical design or medical treatment may also result in exposure to other
risks previously not present in the treatment modality. Possible additional risks of these
alternatives will also need to be considered in the overall assessment. The comparison with
technological alternatives such as a medical design or medical treatment can normally not
be fully quantitative (i.e. with directly comparable numeric values), as the hazards and
associated risks will not be expressed in similar terms, but will in most cases be qualitative
or semi-quantitative. Nevertheless, a clear and transparent description can provide a good
basis to conclude whether overall risks are reduced or not (Step 10).
Step 10: Comparison of benefit and risk of CMR/ED phthalate used in the medical device
with identified most relevant alternatives.
A summary/overview of a benefit/risk comparison between using CMR/ED phthalate in the
medical device and the most relevant alternatives should be provided, including
uncertainties about the estimates or reliability of the data, assumptions, etc. for the
parameters presented. The summary should contain various aspects of functionality,
performance, risk and benefit of the use of the original CMR/ED phthalate used in the
medical device and the potentially relevant alternative(s). In Section 7 below, the
justification of the use of a CMR/ED phthalate is described based on the summary
presented in Table 6 comparing an alternative with the CMR/ED phthalate.
Perform Step 10 for all of the most relevant alternatives identified.

33

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Each of the assessments performed in steps 1 to 10 will have some degree of uncertainty.
Some of them can be described by the use of standard deviation or confidence interval.
For other uncertainties, a description may be necessary to explain the extent of the
uncertainty and its impact on the final outcome.
Benefit and risks should be described and weighted against each other in the use of the
potential alternative substance/material in the medical device (or designs or medical
treatments by choosing adequate endpoints) similar to the procedure for the CMR/ED
phthalate (see Step 2).
7. Justification for the use of CMR/ED phthalate
Based on the comparison of functionality, performance, availability, risk and benefit, an
argument could be made as to why a possible substance and/or material alternative, if
available, or changes in designs or medical treatment, if feasible, are inappropriate in
relation to maintaining the functionality, performance and the benefit-risk ratio or profile
(quantitative/semi-quantitative or qualitative) of the medical device containing a CMR/ED
phthalate.
Explain the importance of any difference in terms of benefits and risks between the CMR/ED
phthalate to be used in the medical device and the most relevant alternatives using value
judgements and explain how the use of the CMR/ED phthalate can be justified over the
alternatives by describing the acceptability of trade-offs in the achievement of some criteria
against others. Any advantage in benefits needs to be weighed against possible
disadvantages in terms of functionality and risks. Both differences in benefits and risks
need to be considered jointly.
In building the argumentation for the use of a CMR/ED phthalate, note can be taken of the
Memorandum on Weight of Evidence and Uncertainties of the SCHEER (SCHEER 2018).
This Memorandum describes a methodology that classifies the strength of evidence in the
human health risk assessment based on integration of different lines of evidence into
strong, moderate, weak, uncertain and inconclusive (no suitable evidence available). Any
WoE evaluation needs to show the overall confidence in the assessment. By the term
“confidence in the assessment” it is meant any measure of uncertainty related to the effect
size of the association, e.g., its related statistical uncertainty indicated by the confidence
intervals of the effect estimates, as well as the internal consistency of the results. Methods
for assessing confidence in the assessment may also include resampling procedures (e.g.
bootstrap), Bayesian inference, probability bounds analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations.
The argumentation should specifically take into account the intended use of such devices.
This should include consideration and discussion of possible high-risk groups such as
children or pregnant or breastfeeding women, and other patient groups considered
particularly vulnerable to such substances and/or materials. In addition, where applicable
and available, any future update of these guidelines shall be considered. A table with the
most relevant information and values should be used to present an overview of the
performed assessment comparing the CMR/ED phthalate with potential alternative(s). A
non-exhaustive example of such a table is presented below. Table 6 should be extended
depending on the number of criteria evaluated and the number of potential alternatives
identified.

better intended functionality as well as performance and shows a reduced risk, use of a
CMR/ED phthalate is not acceptable. The risk assessment should also indicate whether
there would be a reduced hazard concerning CMR and/or ED properties, and/or reduced
exposure overall resulting in reduced risk. In this evaluation, a full toxicological profile of
the most relevant alternatives shall be taken into account, including other toxicities (e.g.,
target specific toxicity for any other organ or system).
A balanced weighing of the benefit versus the risk has to be performed. For example, it is
possible to use a combination of a CMR/ED phthalate and PVC/material with intrinsic
toxicological hazards, thus accepting a risk from a toxicological perspective, if the clinical
benefit is very high. In contrast, a minor loss in medical functionality might be acceptable
if there is a large reduction or even absence of risk. Each comparison of a potential
alternative for the use of a phthalate should be based on the combination of functionality,
risks and benefits for patients.
In this final evaluation, the assessment of uncertainties associated with the alternatives
(e.g., on the nature of the risks; assumptions made) should also be considered (see Table
7 below in Section 10). Therefore, where possible, quantitative results should be collected
and compared (e.g., NOAEL, estimated exposure in mg/kg) and their uncertainties should
be reported. A qualitative description of the uncertainties may also be useful (see Table 7
below in Section 10). Their impact on the conclusions should also be discussed.
Although not the main subject of these guidelines, it should be noted that availability and
accessibility on the market might be a limitation for the introduction of an alternative
substance/material. Some chemicals proposed as alternatives are widely available,
however, this may not be the case for other alternatives. The unavailability of a potential
alternative for a medical device might lead to the conclusion that replacement is not
feasible and that the continued use of a phthalate with CMR and/or ED property is
acceptable in order to keep the device available for patients. In addition to considering the
technical feasibility in terms of functionality and risk reduction (risk assessment of the
phthalate versus the alternative), the availability and accessibility on the market needs to
be taken into consideration.
The BRA of the CMR/ED phthalate should be updated when new scientific information
becomes available on alternatives for the use of phthalates, when new guidelines are
released, or as the "overall" benefit-risk determination of the medical device is updated. A
plan to perform an update of the relevant part of the technical file of the device needs to
be submitted during the certification process (post-market surveillance plan referred to in
Article 84, the requirements are set out in Section 1.1 of Annex III MDR) and this should
also cover updates needed on the justification for the presence of CMR/ED phthalates.

8. Benefit assessment
Both benefits and risks should be specified considering their nature, likelihood of
occurrence, extent and duration, as well as frequency. However, these guidelines do not
provide information for the benefit-risk assessment of the use of a medical device itself

but are limited to the methodology on how to perform a BRA for the justification of the
presence of CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED phthalates in a medical device above 0.1% (w/w). A
detailed evaluation of the overall benefit-risk assessment of a medical device is presented
in other documents (e.g., MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4, MDCG 2020-5, and MDCG 2020-6, (EN)
ISO 14971, FDA 2017, 2019), and it is currently based on a Multiple Criteria Decision
Analysis (MCDA) approach (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1495-4), which is
defined as a systematic and theory-based approach to perform a comparative analysis of
various competing options, based on their functioning on multiple and complicated criteria.
MCDA involves a clear definition of the studied problem, the selection of the appropriate
evaluation criteria, the assessment of the performance of each alternative on each
criterion, the determination of the criteria’s weights and uncertainty and, finally, the
aggregation of performance scores in an overall value. Information on BRA approaches is
presented in Annex 7.
The benefits of the CMR/ED phthalate used in a medical device need to be compared to
the benefits of the most relevant alternatives, with the focus of the analysis being on the
net or incremental benefits of use of the CMR/ED phthalate in comparison to the
alternatives. These benefits may include material or clinical benefits. Uncertainties about
the estimates or reliability of the data, assumptions, etc. for the parameters need to be
presented.
8.1

Material benefit

A medical device does not achieve its principal intended action by pharmacological,
immunological or metabolic means, in or on the human body, but may be assisted in its
function by such means. For the use of phthalates in medical devices, additional
functionalities need to be considered. One of the functionalities is the fine-tuning of the
flexibility of PVC when used as plasticisers, e.g., in intubation devices. For blood bag set
materials other requirements are, for example, resistance to heat and chemicals, especially
during sterilisation, and permeability of gases to assure that pH and oxygen levels remain
stable. In addition, DEHP has an additional property namely the stabilising effect on red
blood cells (RBCs) (Klei et al., 2022). A number of alternatives were evaluated as
alternative for DEHP during RBC storage and some of these are already in use (see Annex
10). Platelets are extremely sensitive to changes in the pH of the medium in which they
are suspended, so sufficient gas permeability to O 2 and CO2 has to be assured in the
containers devoted to their storage (Simmchen et al., 2012). For this reason, DEHP,
although still present in connecting tubes and ports of blood bag sets, has been almost
fully replaced with BTHC, DINCH, and/or Trioctyltrimellitate (TOTM or Tri(2-ethyl
hexyl)trimellitate (TEHTM)) in platelet storage bags (Simmchen et al., 2012; Prowse et al.,
2014). A better gas exchange has been found in bags plasticised with these chemicals.
Also, other materials, like polyolefins, are used for platelet storage bags (Prowse et al.,
2014).
It should be noted that the benefit of CMR/ED phthalates in terms of material functionality
and performance may differ from device to device. An alternative may be available for one
application, but not for another, due to added or specific demands on the functionality of
the CMR/ED phthalate.

8.2

Clinical benefits

Clinical benefit of medical devices is defined in the MDR as follows:
•

“Clinical benefit” means the positive impact of a device on the health of an
individual, expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical
outcome(s), including outcome(s) related to diagnosis, or a positive impact on
patient management or public health (MDR, Article 2 Definitions: (53))

This “clinical benefit” has to be substantiated by the manufacturers in the “clinical
evaluation” of the medical device, which includes a number of considerations. These
comprise a discussion and overall conclusions covering safety and performance results,
assessment of risks and clinical benefits, discussion of clinical relevance in accordance with
clinical state of the art, any specific precautions for specific patient populations,
implications for the investigational device and limitations of the investigation.
A ”clinical benefit” could include any meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant outcome as
presented below. The SCHEER identified the following examples that may be relevant for
the use of phthalates (list not exclusive):
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Improved survival rates
Improved quality of life
Reduced length of hospital stay
Improved placement times (among others in tubes and catheters)
Improved product quality/clinical performance (among others in tubes and
catheters) in terms of, for example:
o leakage rates
o breakage rates
o knotting rates
o blockage rates
o bending performance rates
o release rates of toxic substances
o release rates of (nano-)particles
Improved displacement rates
Improved possibilities for sterilisation procedure
Reduction of diameters in relation to performance
Possibility to produce a “multi-functional” device (e.g., inclusion of additional
sensors), and therefore reduction of over-all stress and impact on the patient
Improved observability (safety) in terms of translucence, printability, radiopaque
lines included, identifiability, traceability, etc. (among others in tubes and
catheters)
Fewer adverse events, e.g., reduced mucosal or endothelial irritation or injury rates
(among others in tubes and catheters)
Fewer serious adverse events and serious incidents

The benefit of the use of the CMR/ED phthalate should always be judged with respect to
the “intended use” of the medical device and the exposed patient-group to the medical
device and weighed in its clinical impact (i.e., “clinically relevant difference”). These
aspects should be judged by clinical experts.

38

medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Quantitative information on the benefits should be provided where possible or at a
minimum qualitative description of their magnitude. Information on the probability of the
benefit to occur and/or the duration of the benefit should also be included.

9. Methodologies for Benefit –Risk Assessment
In general, a Benefit - Risk Assessment (BRA) aims to evaluate the desired effects of
therapeutic means, medicines or devices, against their undesired effects, i.e. risks for
human health. An appropriate BRA can contribute to a more objective analysis and provide
a more objective and transparent decision-making process for conformity verification
bodies and authorities. Weighing the benefits and risks can be a complex task. It may
involve the evaluation of a large amount of data that should be as accurate as possible,
without methodological weaknesses and biases. There is always some uncertainty around
the actual benefits and risks, because they can only be determined by looking at the
information that is available at a given point in time which may contain various sources of
uncertainty.
For the BRA of medical devices in general, guidance is available in Section A7.2. of MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4, and in MDCG 2020-5 and MDCG 2020-6 guidance documents. (EN) ISO 14971
and the accompanying ISO/TR 24971 provide information on the risk benefit analysis to
be performed within a risk management process. Additional information may be found
elsewhere, for example in the documents of the FDA 2017 and FDA 2019. It should be
noted that the acceptability of any risk is weighted against the benefit of the use of the
medical device.
Several methodologies for BRA have been proposed (Guo et al., 2010; Mt-Isa et al., 2014),
mainly, so far, those are used for pharmaceutical products. However, it should be
underlined that for medical devices, it may prove difficult to make the quantitative
determination of a benefit-risk ratio and express it numerically. In such cases, a qualitative
approach of weighing the benefit based on expert judgement might be used. One
methodology, namely the multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA), can be generally applied
to various areas of BRA. The Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach
(https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1495-4) is defined as a systematic and theorybased approach to perform a comparative analysis of various competing options, based on
their functioning on multiple and complicated criteria (Belton and Stewart, 2002).
Therefore, this methodology might also be suitable for performing the BRA of medical
devices (see Annex 7). The MCDA methodology originates from a decision-making process
that evaluates multiple conflicting criteria. These criteria can include the benefits and risks
of the use of a medical device on human health.
The final BRA of both the used CMR/ED phthalate and most relevant alternatives should
contain all aspects as indicated in the framework above. A quantitative or semi-quantitative
description of the risks (e.g., MoS, RCR) and of the benefits of a medical device containing
a CMR/ED phthalate or alternative should be the basis for a BRA. However, although
quantitative approaches for a BRA are preferable, presenting a qualitative description of
the value judgements about the balance of benefits and risks might also be an acceptable
approach when justified (see Step 10).

10. Uncertainty analysis
Uncertainty analysis aims to identify and, when possible, to quantify uncertainties in
measurements involved in medical and technical data modelling. Medical uncertainty has
been considered an inherent feature of medicine, especially in clinical practice. Especially
when considering the clinical prognosis and life expectancy of patients, the uncertainty
related to the expressed prognosis remains difficult to estimate (Smith et al., 2013). Based
on a scoping review, a framework for decision making in medicine was suggested, taking
into consideration various aspects of uncertainty (Helou et al., 2020). Understanding and
measuring medical uncertainty has been regarded to be a core competency for good and
quality health and plays an important role in medical decision making. It is widely accepted
that, despite the methodological and technological improvements that were achieved in
the past decades, there is never absolute certainty regarding the safety, effectiveness, or
performance of a medical treatment or use of a device. Therefore, the degree of certainty
and thus, uncertainty of the benefits and risks of a medical device is a factor that should
always be considered when making a BRA.
There are various sources of uncertainty in bio-medical studies; a major source of
uncertainty is the biological difference among individuals. Another source of uncertainty is
the intra- and inter- variability of the laboratories, with respect to equipment, reagents,
and methods used. It is also accepted that diagnostic tools, which evaluate benefit and
risk, share several limitations, giving false negative and false positive results in a variety
of cases. Observer variation occurs quite often and should always be taken into account.
Other factors that may influence the degree of uncertainty include: the type of clinical
information available (e.g., clinical investigation data, observational studies, evidence
derived from registries or use experience), the representativeness of the information (e.g.,
sample size, relevance of the sample to the referent population exposed to the device),
and the statistical inferences derived from the information. For medical devices, the
determination of an uncertainty factor for the analytical evaluation of constituents is
described in ISO 10993-18 as amended in ISO 10993-18:2020/Amd.1:2022(E).
Another source of uncertainty could be the data set of the pre-clinical studies used for risk
assessment.
A number of techniques for uncertainty analysis are described in the Guidance for SocioEconomic Analysis on authorisation from ECHA (ECHA 2011). The aim is to determine
whether uncertainties in the estimation of impacts could affect the overall conclusions.
More accurately, the techniques shown can be used to either reduce the variability of
estimates, or to help test whether uncertainties affect the conclusions drawn. The only way
to actually reduce uncertainty is through better data, better understanding and knowledge
of the uncertainties and through further analysis. However, in most cases residual
uncertainties will remain.
EFSA published a guidance on uncertainty analysis (EFSA 2018a) and a description of the
principles and methods behind the guidance for uncertainty analysis (EFSA 2018b). The
EFSA Guidance recognises that the form and extent of uncertainty analysis, and how the
conclusions should be reported, vary widely depending on the nature and context of each
analysis and the degree of uncertainty that is present. Therefore, it is important to identify
appropriate options for each BRA. The EFSA documents provide a flexible framework for
uncertainty analysis within which different methods may be selected, according to the

40

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

needs of each BRA. It seems likely that similar flexibility is needed for medical devices too,
in view of the broad range of medical devices used.
EFSA describes a number of main elements of uncertainty that need to be considered in
the uncertainty analysis:
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Identifying uncertainties affecting the assessment. This is necessary in every
assessment and should be done in a structured way to minimise the chance of
overlooking relevant uncertainties. In assessments that follow standardised
procedures, it is only necessary to identify nonstandard uncertainties.
Prioritising uncertainties within the assessment plays an important role in planning
the uncertainty analysis, enabling the assessor to focus detailed analysis on the
most important uncertainties and address others collectively when evaluating
overall uncertainty. Often prioritisation will be done by expert judgement during the
planning process, but in more complex assessments it may be done explicitly using
influence analysis or sensitivity analysis.
Dividing the uncertainty analysis into parts. In some assessments, it may be
sufficient to characterise overall uncertainty for the whole assessment directly, by
expert judgement. In other cases, it may be preferable to evaluate uncertainty for
some or all parts of the assessment separately and then combine them, either by
calculation or expert judgement.
Ensuring the questions or quantities of interest are well-defined. Each question or
quantity of interest must be well-defined so that the true answer or value could be
determined, at least in principle. This is necessary to make the question or quantity
a proper subject for scientific assessment, and to make it possible to express
uncertainty about the true answer or value clearly and unambiguously. Some
assessments follow standardised procedures, within which the questions and/or
quantities of interest should be predefined. In other assessments, the assessors will
need to identify and define the questions and/or quantities of interest case by case.
Characterising uncertainty for parts of the uncertainty analysis. This is needed for
assessments where assessors choose to divide the uncertainty analysis into parts
but only for some of the parts, with the other parts being considered when
characterising overall uncertainty.
Combining uncertainty from different parts of the uncertainty analysis. This is
needed for assessments where the assessors quantify uncertainty separately for
two or more parts of the uncertainty analysis.
Characterising overall uncertainty. Expressing quantitatively the overall impact of
as many as possible of the identified uncertainties and describing qualitatively any
that remain unquantified. This is necessary in all assessments except those
standardised assessments where only standard uncertainties are identified (e.g.
inter-and intra-species uncertainty factors).
Prioritising uncertainties for future investigation. This is implicit or explicit in any
assessment where recommendations are made for future data collection or research
and may be informed by influence or sensitivity analysis.
Reporting uncertainty analysis. Required for all assessments, but extremely briefly
in standardised assessments where only standard uncertainties are identified.

A number of methods that can be used in the uncertainty analysis include:
•
•

Sensitivity analysis
Scenario analysis

41

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

•
•

Expert judgement
Monte Carlo Simulations

Some of these techniques can be used in combination (e.g., scenario analysis together
with expert judgement to establish ranges for key variables) but also together with less
commonly used techniques such as risk-risk analysis, Delphi techniques and portfolio
analysis, which can be used to help reduce the variability of estimates but are not discussed
in these guidelines.
After performing the uncertainty analysis, the observed overall confidence associated with
a BRA can be expressed as a probability score. This score gives the risk assessor an
indication of what the uncertainty is in the BRA.
In situations where sufficient data are available, a quantitative categorisation of probability
levels is preferred. If this is not possible, the manufacturer should give a qualitative
description. A good qualitative description is preferable to an inaccurate quantitative
description ((EN) ISO 14971).
EFSA (EFSA, 2018b) and SCHEER (2018) use a rather detailed probability scale of 9 and 7
probability levels, respectively. EFSA stresses that this scale may be used as an aid to
support the development of judgements and that other ranges or qualitative descriptions
can be used as well. EFSA (2018b) also argues that presenting the numerical probabilities
alongside verbal expressions of probability, e.g., ‘Likely (> 66% probability)’, increases
the consistency of interpretation.
A detailed scale does not seem to be applicable for the uncertainties that can be obtained
during a BRA evaluation of medical devices. For medical devices, a probability scale as
indicated in Table 7 may be used showing a 5-level scale recommended by ISO for semiquantitative assessments (ISO TR 24971, Tables 3 and 4). Table 7 further shows the verbal
terms and subjective probability ranges that are based on a simplification of the
EFSA/SCHEER scales (EFSA 2018a, 2018b; SCHEER 2018).

11. Conclusions
These guidelines are intended to be used for a BRA of the presence of phthalates in certain
medical devices covering phthalates which are carcinogenic, mutagenic, toxic to
reproduction (CMR) or have endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties. The guidelines can be
used for the justification of the use of CMR/ED phthalates in a medical device according to
the MDR (EU 2017/745). They also provide a framework on how to assess and compare
possible alternative substances, materials, designs or medical treatments to the use of
CMR/ED phthalates in medical devices. Major aspects include the functionality of CMR/ED
phthalates, the performance of the medical device using the CMR/ED phthalate or the
identified most relevant alternatives for the CMR/ED phthalate, as well as the risk
assessment of the CMR/ED phthalate or the most relevant alternatives. In the end, the
benefit(s) shall be weighed against the possible risks of the use of the CMR/ED phthalate
and of the most relevant alternatives, i.e., substance, materials, designs or medical
treatments. This overall analysis will determine whether or not it is justified to use a
CMR/ED phthalate in a medical device.
In view of the concern about the CMR/ED properties of phthalates, further research to
replace these phthalates in medical devices is highly encouraged by the SCHEER. In this
update of these guidelines, progress regarding the replacement of CMR/ED phthalates is
presented in some of the annexes, notably Annexes 8, 9, and 10.
During the preparation of these guidelines for BRA of the use of CMR/ED phthalates in
medical devices, the SCHEER noticed that a number of BRA methodologies are theoretically
available. However, there is a considerable lack of data for the BRA for potentially relevant
alternatives to be used in medical devices. Therefore, the SCHEER encourages
manufacturers to generate high-quality data for such alternatives to CMR/ED phthalates in
medical devices.
As the BRA of the presence of phthalates may have an impact on the conclusions of the
"overall" benefit-risk determination of the medical device, a periodic update of the BRA of
the medical device may be needed. The BRA of the presence of the CMR/ED phthalate
should be updated when new scientific information becomes available on phthalates and/or
alternatives for the use of phthalates, when new guidelines are released, or as the "overall"
benefit-risk determination of the medical device is updated. A plan to perform an update
of the general BRA for the medical device should be included in the dossier before
marketing the device, and this should also include a plan regarding the necessary updates
on the evaluation of alternatives for CMR/ED phthalates.

C. ANNEXES
Annex 1: SCHEER mandate on benefit-risk assessment on the use of CMR/ED phthalates
1. Background
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) (13) establishes a legal obligation on
the Commission(14) to provide the relevant scientific committee with a mandate to prepare
guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of phthalates, which belong to
either of the groups of substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction
of category 1A or 1B, in accordance with Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) 1272/2008,
or that have endocrine-disrupting properties.
The benefit-risk assessment has to take into account the intended purpose and context of
the use of the device, as well as any available alternative substances and alternative
materials, designs or medical treatments.
The obligation to have the guidance available was set on 26 May 2020 and the document
was adopted by the SCHEER at plenary meeting on 18 June 2019.
The MDR sets also a legal obligation for the update of the guidance, on the basis of the
latest scientific evidence. Such update can be made when appropriate and, at least, every
five years.
2. Terms of reference
The SCHEER is requested to update the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the
presence of phthalates in certain medical devices that was adopted by that committee at
the plenary meeting on 18 June 2019.
The update has to take into consideration and be based on the latest scientific evidence.
The devices covered, or those parts thereof of those materials used therein, are those
which:
•
•
•

are invasive and come into direct contact with the human body;
(re)administer medicines, body liquids or other substances, including gases,
to/from the body, or;
transport or store such medicines, body fluids or substances, including gases, to be
(re)administered to the body.

The guidelines shall continue to include guidance on how, for an individual device, to:
•
•
•

analyse and estimate potential patient or user exposure to the substance,
analyse possible alternative substances, materials, designs, or medical treatments,
justify why possible substance and/or material substitutes, if available, or design
changes, if feasible, are inappropriate in relation to maintaining the functionality,
performance and the benefit-risk ratios of the product, including taking into account
if the intended use of such devices includes treatment of children or treatment of

Annex 2: CMR and/or ED substances under the Medical Device Regulation (Regulation
(EU) 2017/745)
The requirement for justification of the presence of CMR 1A or 1B and/or ED hazardous
substances is described in Annex I 10.4.2 as presented in the text box below.
10.4. Substances
10.4.1. Design and manufacture of devices
Devices shall be designed and manufactured in such a way as to reduce as far as possible the
risks posed by substances or particles, including wear debris, degradation products and
processing residues that may be released from the device.
Devices, or those parts thereof or those materials used therein that:
— are invasive and come into direct contact with the human body,
— (re)administer medicines, body liquids or other substances, including gases, to/from the body,
or
— transport or store such medicines, body fluids or substances, including gases, to be
(re)administered to the body,
shall only contain the following substances in a concentration that is above 0,1 % weight by
weight (w/w) where justified pursuant to Section 10.4.2:
(a) substances which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (‘CMR’), of category
1A or 1B, in accordance with Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council (1), or
(b) substances having endocrine-disrupting properties for which there is scientific evidence of
probable serious effects to human health and which are identified either in accordance with the
procedure set out in Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and
of the Council (2) or, once a delegated act has been adopted by the Commission pursuant to the
first subparagraph of Article 5(3) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament
and the Council (3), in accordance with the criteria that are relevant to human health amongst
the criteria established therein.
10.4.2. Justification regarding the presence of CMR and/or endocrine-disrupting substances
The justification for the presence of such substances shall be based upon:
(a) an analysis and estimation of potential patient or user exposure to the substance;
(b) an analysis of possible alternative substances, materials or designs, including, where
available, information about independent research, peer-reviewed studies, scientific opinions
from relevant scientific committees and an analysis of the availability of such alternatives;
(c) argumentation as to why possible substance and/ or material substitutes, if available, or
design changes, if feasible, are inappropriate in relation to maintaining the functionality,
performance and the benefit-risk ratios of the product; including taking into account if the
intended use of such devices includes treatment of children or treatment of pregnant or
breastfeeding women or treatment of other patient groups considered particularly vulnerable to
such substances and/or materials; and
(d) where applicable and available, the latest relevant scientific committee guidelines in
accordance with Sections 10.4.3 and 10.4.4.

Regulation (EU) 2017/745 Annex XIV Clinical evaluation and post-market clinical
follow-up. Part A “Clinical evaluation” Section 3 describes the characteristics that
shall be considered for demonstration of equivalence.
A clinical evaluation may be based on clinical data relating to a device for which equivalence
to the device in question can be demonstrated (see also MDCG 2020-5 and MDCG 20237). The following technical, biological and clinical characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence:
Biological characteristics: the device uses the same materials or substances in contact
with the same human tissues or body fluids for a similar kind and duration of contact and
similar release characteristics of substances, including degradation products and
leachables.
Leachables may include degradation products or other substances from the materials or
substances that the device is made of, but also other constituents for example residuals
from the manufacturing process or sterilisation, any contaminations etc.
Clinical characteristics: the device is used for the same clinical condition or purpose,
including similar severity and stage of disease, at the same site in the body, in a similar
population, including as regards age, anatomy and physiology; has the same kind of user;
has similar relevant critical performance in view of the expected clinical effect for a specific
intended purpose.
The characteristics shall be similar to the extent that there would be no clinically significant
difference in the safety and clinical performance of the device. Considerations of
equivalence shall be based on proper scientific justification. It shall be clearly demonstrated
that manufacturers have sufficient levels of access to the data relating to devices with
which they are claiming equivalence in order to justify their claims of equivalence.”
Technical characteristics: the device is of similar design; is used under similar conditions
of use; has similar specifications and properties including physicochemical properties such

55

as intensity of energy, tensile strength, viscosity, surface characteristics, wavelength and
software algorithms; uses similar deployment methods, where relevant; has similar
principles of operation and critical performance requirements.

Some definitions on assessment of alternatives
Note: The term "chemical" is used synonymously with "substance"
Alternatives assessment: A process for identifying and comparing potential chemical
and non-chemical alternatives that can be used as substitutes to replace chemicals or
technologies of high concern [1]
Chemical substitution: The process of replacing a chemical of concern with a safer
chemical, material or product, or technology/process that eliminates the need to use that
chemical
Cost/benefits and availability: The negative (cost) and positive (benefit) implications,
direct and indirect, resulting from some action. This includes both financial and nonfinancial information. Availability refers to the production of an alternative and its market
accessibility [2]
Functional use approach: This approach starts with identifying the function that is
desired. The concept is applied in two ways: ﬁrst and foremost, to characterise the purpose
a chemical or mixture serves, or the properties it imparts in a product or process (functional
use), and second, to evaluate the function of the product and how its use may inﬂuence
the assessment of alternatives [2-4]
Material substitution: The process of replacing a material containing a chemical of
concern with a safer chemical, material, product or technology/process that eliminates the
need to use that chemical
Mixture: A composition of at least two chemicals in which they do not react [5], or any
combination of two or more chemicals that may contribute to effects regardless of source
and spatial or temporal proximity [6]
Process modification: Changes in manufacturing processes to eliminate, reduce or
substitute chemicals of concern. Such changes may include synthesis pathways, waste
reduction, and manufacturing procedures where chemicals are used.
Product performance: The ability of a product to meet identified performance
requirements. The boundaries of performance characteristics are defined by the user [2]
Product substitution: The process of replacing a product containing a chemical of
concern with a chemical, material or product or technology/process that eliminates,
reduces or substitutes the need to use that chemical.
Technical feasibility: The determination as to whether the performance or functional
requirements of a chemical, material or product could be fulfilled or replaced by eliminating
or using an alternative chemical, material, product, process or technology, while
considering any need for process adaptations and changes [2]

Annex 4: CMR and/or ED substances
CMR substances are substances identified and classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic
for reproduction of different categories based on the intrinsic toxic properties of a
substance for which categories 1A and 1B apply to these guidelines. In Europe,
classification for these endpoints is harmonised through harmonised classification and
labelling
(CLH).
Details
can
be
found
at
https://echa.europa.eu/regulations/clp/understanding-clp. For a specific substance to be
classified as CMR 1A, 1B or 2 an ECHA RAC Opinion is developed based on the CLH dossier.
If the Commission agrees on the proposed hazard classification, it submits a draft decision
concerning the inclusion of that substance in Part 3 of Annex VI of Regulation (EC)
1272/2008 (CLP Regulation, (R classification, labelling and packaging of substances and
mixtures).
•
•
•

Category 1A means that the substance is a known human carcinogen, mutagen or
reproductive toxicant based on human evidence.
Category 1B means that the substance is a presumed human carcinogen, mutagen
or reproductive toxicant based on animal studies.
Category 2 means that a substance is considered as suspected carcinogen, mutagen
or reproductive toxicant based on limited evidence from animal studies or humans
(not part of these guidelines).

Documents on the classification and labelling are publicly available, and information on the
C&L Inventory to search for notified and registered substances is given here:
https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/cl-inventory-database
For endocrine disruptor activity, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 was
recently published including an amendment on the classification of ED substances. It is
indicated that the level of evidence as regards endocrine disrupting properties may be of
different scientific strength. It is therefore considered appropriate to create two categories
of endocrine disruptors based on the available level of evidence. According to the
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 of 19 December 2022 amending
Regulation (EC) 1272/2008, based on the level of evidence, there are two categories of
endocrine disruptors: known or presumed endocrine disruptors (Category 1) and suspected
endocrine disruptors (Category 2), both for human health and for the environment. The
criteria to meet these two hazard categories are described in Annex I, Table 3.11.1. of
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/707 (see Table below).

Table 3.11.1.
Hazard categories for endocrine disruptors for
human health
Categories

Criteria

CATEGORY 1

Known or presumed endocrine disruptors for human
health
The classification in Category 1 shall be largely based on
evidence from at least one of the following:

a) human data;
b) animal data;
c) non-animal data providing an equivalent predictive

capacity as data in points a or b.
Such data shall provide evidence that the substance meets
all the following criteria:
(a) endocrine activity;
(b) an adverse effect in an intact organism or its
offspring or future generations;
(c) a biologically plausible link between the endocrine
activity and the adverse effect.
However, where there is information that raises serious
doubt about the relevance of the adverse effects to
humans, classification in Category 2 may be more
appropriate.
CATEGORY 2

Suspected endocrine disruptors for human health
A substance shall be classified in Category 2 where all the
following criteria are fulfilled:

(a) there is evidence of:
i. an endocrine activity; and
ii. an adverse effect in an intact organism or its
offspring or future generations;

(b) the evidence referred to in point (a) is not

sufficiently convincing to classify the substance in
Category 1;
(c) there is evidence of a biologically plausible link
between the endocrine activity and the adverse
effect.

Guidance for the identification of endocrine disruptors (ED) in the context of Regulations
(EU) 528/2012 and (EC) 1107/2009 has been published on 7 June 2018 by ECHA and EFSA
(doi: 10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5311; EFSA Journal 2018;16(6):5311) and can be accessed
via:https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5311
EDs identified with the procedure set out in Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006
concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals
(REACH), will finally be placed on the REACH candidate list of substances of very high
concern for potential inclusion in REACH Annex XIV. This information can be found in the
respective decision document accessible via: https://echa.europa.eu/candidate-list-table.
For substances having endocrine-disrupting properties as indicated above, there is
currently no information concerning whether it is foreseen to publish them in central lists
or annexed to a Regulation.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Annex 5: Regulatory context on CMR and/or ED phthalates
A number of phthalates are identified as substances of very high concern (SVHC) due to
their reprotoxic and endocrine disrupting properties and are included in the REACH
Candidate List (see https://echa.europa.eu/de/candidate-list-table). Several are also
included on the REACH Authorisation List (REACH Annex XIV) to ensure that the risks of
these SVHC are properly controlled and they are progressively replaced by suitable
alternative substances or technologies. When risks cannot be adequately controlled, the
use of those substances may only be authorised where the socio-economic benefit exceeds
the risk of continued use and there are no suitable alternatives. The Authorisation List
(available at https://echa.europa.eu/de/authorisation-list) contains substances which
cannot be used within the European Union without an authorisation. However, imported
articles do not come under the authorisation requirement. Of all phthalates on the
Authorisation list, to date, applications for authorisation have been submitted for DEHP
and DBP only. For the purpose of evaluating applications for authorisation, the ECHA
Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) has developed reference DNELs regarding
reprotoxicity for several substances, including DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIPP. (See Evaluating
Applications Table/Reference DNELs on ECHA’s website:
https://echa.europa.eu/applying-for-authorisation/evaluating-applications
Risks to human health arising from the use of an Annex XIV substance in medical devices
regulated by Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC or 98/79/EC were exempted from
authorisation requirements under Title VII of the REACH Regulation 16 if the substance is
listed on Annex XIV based on hazards to human health only. Regulation (EU) 2017/745
(MDR) repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC (active implantable medical devices) and
93/42/EEC (medical devices) contains specific provisions on reducing the risk of substances
released from the device. More specifically, for substances present above 0.1% weight by
weight that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction (CMR), or which have
endocrine-disrupting (ED) properties, justification for their use in certain medical device
must be presented. The MDR contained the requirement for the Commission to mandate
the relevant scientific committee to draft a guideline for the benefit-risk assessment of
phthalates with CMR/ED properties that was published by the SCHEER in 2019.
REACH Annex XVII (entry 51) restricts the placing on the market of articles containing
DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIBP in concentration greater than 0.1% weight by weight of the
plasticised material, individually or in combination in a range of articles. These articles
include toys17 and childcare articles, as well as other primarily consumer and professional
use articles which lead to dermal or inhalation exposure. Medical devices (or parts thereof)
within the scope of Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC or 98/79/EC are exempted from the
scope of the restriction. For risk assessment conclusions, including derivation of a DNEL

See generic_exemptions_authorisation_en.pdf (europa.eu). The exemption for uses in medical devices within
the scope of Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC and 98/79/EC EC will expire on 27 May 2025 (COMMISSION
REGULATION (EU) 2021/2045 of 23 November 2021). More recently the exemption for medical devices was
prolonged to 2030: Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/2482 of 13 November 2023 amending Regulation (EC) No
1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the substance bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate
(DEHP) in medical devices (europa.eu)
17
The Toy Safety Directive (2009/48/EC) stipulates that chemicals that are susceptible to cause cancer, change
genetic information, harm fertility or harm an unborn child (CMR substances) are no longer allowed in accessible
parts of toys beyond the concentration limits set in the CLP Regulation ((EC) No 1272/2008).

for DIBP, see Compiled RAC & SEAC Opinion and background document on ECHA’s website:
Substance Information - ECHA (europa.eu)
REACH Annex XVII (entry 52) restricts the placing on the market and the use of DINP,
DIDP, or DNOP as a substance or in mixture, in concentrations greater than 0.1% weight
by weight of the plasticised material in toys and childcare articles which can be mouthed
by children. Information on the restrictions of use for these phthalates can be found on
ECHA’s website: Search for chemicals - ECHA (europa.eu)
Regarding the exemption of medical devices from the REACH restriction requirements
several changes have been published recently. Regulation (EU) 2021/2045 (amending
Annex XIV of REACH (Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006) authorisation list Annex XIV REACH)
extended the scope of use of several phthalates in the EU, including that of DEHP. Since
this modification of entry n°4 of the REACH authorisation list to include DEHP's endocrine
disrupting (ED) properties, use of DEHP in medical devices (previously exempt from the
REACH authorisation) will be subject to an authorisation requirement.
Originally, for medical devices, the use of DEHP was to be subject to authorisation
requirements after May 2025, but the new Regulation (EU) 2023/2482, issued in November
2023, postpones this deadline. This amendment aligns with the extended transitional
periods for medical device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) reflecting the need for a
gradual shift to DEHP-free medical devices.
Under the new Regulation (EU) 2023/2482, users of DEHP in medical devices will no longer
be able to use DEHP from July 2030, unless they apply for authorisation before January
2029. After 2030, this authorisation will add an authorisation process to the current
requirements in the MDR that includes for the use of DEHP above 0.1% in a medical device
a justification and comparison with potential alternatives for which the revised guidelines
can be used.
In addition to the REACH legislation, there is also product-specific legislation which
regulates certain phthalates, i.e. the Cosmetic Products’ Regulation (EC/1223/2009) and
the Regulation on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (Food
Contact Materials (FCM), Regulation (EC) 1935/2004, as general framework regulation and
Regulation (EU) 10/2011 specific for plastic materials and articles destined to be in contact
with foodstuffs. The latter also includes provisions for the use of phthalates in plastic food
contact materials and articles with respect to migration limits.
In 2019, EFSA published an update of the risk assessment of di-butylphthalate (DBP),
butyl-benzyl-phthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), di-isononylphthalate
(DINP) and diisodecylphthalate (DIDP) for use in food contact materials.18 As a follow-up
to this work, the European Commission requested EFSA to carry out a re-evaluation of the
risks to public health related to the presence of plasticisers (such as phthalates, structurally
similar substances, and substances used to replace phthalates) in food contact materials
(FCMs).
The EFSA re-evaluation has been divided into two parts, with part 1 relating to preparatory
work, and part 2 encompassing the actual risk assessment(s). Part 1 has been completed
and the following related outputs have been published:

Although not authorised for use in plastic FCM, some considerations on DIBP were also included in the Opinion
as the Panel noted a similar potency with regards to reproductive toxic effects and intake estimates compared to
DBP.

Discussions on the scope of part 2 of the EFSA re-evaluation are ongoing.
Plastic FCM show similarity regarding migration (and thus potential internal exposure) of
phthalates as present in plastics used for medical device manufacturing. In Annex I of
Regulation (EU) 10/2011 (recently amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/1442) all substances
are listed, which are authorised for the use as starting material or additive for plastic layers
in plastic materials and articles. Each substance must not exceed its specific migration limit
(SML).
The following phthalates and other plasticisers 19 are authorised for use as additives in FCM:

DBP (FCM No 157): SML = 0.12 mg/kg food
only to be used as:
(a) plasticiser in repeated use materials and articles in contact with non-fatty foods;
(b) technical support agent in polyolefins in concentrations up to 0.05% (w/w) in the final
product

BBP (FCM No 159): SML = 6 mg/kg food
Only to be used as:
(a) plasticiser in repeated use materials and articles;
(b) plasticiser in single-use materials and articles in contact with non-fatty foods, except
for infant formula and follow-on formula;
(c) technical support agent in concentrations up to 0.1% (w/w) in the final product.

DEHP (FCM No 283): SML = 0.6 mg/kg food
Only to be used as:
(a) plasticiser in repeated use materials and articles in contact with non-fatty foods;
(b) technical support agent in concentrations up to 0.1% (w/w) in the final product.

DINP (FCM No 728): SML(T) = 1.8 mg/kg food (group-SML with DIDP, expressed as sum
of the two substances)
only to be used as

(a) plasticiser in repeated use materials and articles
(b) plasticiser in single-use materials and articles in contact with non-fatty foods except

(c) technical support agent in concentrations up to 0.1% (w/w) in the final product
Not to be used in combination with FCM substances 157, 159, 283, or 1085.

DIDP (FCM No 729): SML(T) = 1.8 mg/kg food (group-SML with DINP, expressed as sum
of the two substances)
Only to be used as
(a) plasticiser in repeated use materials and articles
(b) plasticiser in single-use materials and articles in contact with non-fatty foods except
for infant formulae and follow-on formulae (as defined by Directive 2006/141/EC) or
processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children (as defined
by Directive 2006/125/EC)
(c) technical support agent in concentrations up to 0.1% in the final product

Furthermore, for certain plasticisers listed in Regulation (EU) 10/2011, including a number
of phthalates, a group restriction (Group restriction number 32) applies, namely that the
sum of these substances must not exceed an SML of 60 mg/kg foodstuff.
An additional group restriction (Group restriction number 36) applies for DBP, BBP, DEHP
and DIBP, i.e. 0.6 mg/kg food expressed as the sum of DBP, DIBP20, BBP and DEHP
expressed as DEHP equivalents using the following equation: DBP*5 + DIBP*4 + BBP*0,1
+ DEHP*1.
DEHP, BBP, DBP and DIBP have not been permissible in homogenous materials above the
concentration of 0.1% w/w since July 2019 in accordance with the Restriction of Hazardous
Substances Directive in electrical and electronic equipment RoHS2 (2011/65/EC). For
medical devices and in vitro diagnostic products, this restriction came into effect in July
2021.
ECHA has published an assessment of regulatory needs dealing with ortho phthalates for
future considerations on regulatory risk management action at EU level (ECHA, 2021). It
should be noted that a limited number of the ortho-phthalates as indicated in ECHA 2021
are currently used for the manufacturing of the medical devices.

Diisobutyl phthalate, FCM No 1085, with synonyms 1,2-bis(2-methylpropyl) benzene-1,2-dicarboxylate or
‘DIBP’ and CAS number 84-69-5 is not listed as an authorised substance. However, it may co-occur with other
phthalates as a consequence of its use as an aid to polymerisation and is included in group restrictions with the
assignment FCM No 1085.’

Annex 6: Use of phthalates in medical devices
Besides being used as plasticiser in a multitude of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based consumer
products, phthalates are also abundantly used in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) medical devices
such as blood bag sets, bags storing liquids for intravenous administration, nutrition
pockets, tubing, catheters, respiratory masks or disposable gloves (Luis et al., 2021;
Šimunović et al., 2022). More than 40% of all plastic-based disposable medical devices are
made from PVC. Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), which has been for many years the
most commonly used phthalate ester plasticiser in medical devices. A survey among the
Danish Medical Device Industry found that 95% of the products contained DEHP (Huntley
2014).
Safety concerns have been expressed for several high-risk patient groups, such as
neonates, infants, pregnant and breast-feeding women exposed to DEHP. The SCENIHR in
its Opinion of 2015 indicated that “a lack of evidence of causation between DEHP-PVC and
any disease or adverse effect does not mean that there are no risks”. This lack of evidence
applies to all phthalates classified as CMR and/or identified as ED. The requirement of
patient subgroup analysis for the target patient groups as defined in the “Intended Use” of
a medical device is included in Regulation (EU) 2017/745.
For the use of DEHP, high-risk groups were identified including patients undergoing
haemodialysis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and prematurely born
infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), (SCENIHR 2015). Especially in NICU, DEHP
is abundantly present, in addition to a number of other plasticisers in the medical devices
used for neonatal intensive care (Malarvannan et al., 2019; Bernard et al., 2023; Cleys et
al., 2023; Paneel et al., 2023, Wang and Kannan, 2023). That preterm neonates are at
risk was confirmed by Al-Saleh (Al-Saleh et al., 2023), reporting high NICU exposures
above reference doses for anti-androgenicity by several phthalate isomers (di-n-butyl
phthalate (DnBP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), and DEHP.
In a laboratory study on migration profiles of phthalates (extracted in ethanol/water 1:1
mixture) from single-use medical devices present in intensive care units, including NICU,
in 99% of the medical devices DEHP was demonstrated including those labelled DEHP-free
(Wang and Kannan, 2023). Exposure doses to DEHP from medical devices was estimated
in the range of 0.005−730 μg/kg bw/day, with the highest exposure doses from cannulas
for newborns.
The actual exposure of such patient groups relative to the toxicity, including CMR/ED
property, needs to be determined. However, even if the remaining risk is high, the benefit
of the treatment should be considered as well. It might be useful to evaluate the patient
subgroups separately:
•
•
•
•
•

Paediatric Population (see subgroups)
Peripubertal individuals
Pregnant women
Breast-feeding women
Any other patient group considered particularly vulnerable or exposed to high levels
of phthalates.

70

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

For purposes of these guidelines, the following ranges of paediatric subpopulations are
proposed to be used as a guide for manufacturers in medical devices as described by EMEA
in 2001 and confirmed by EMA in 2017 (EMA/CPMP/ICH/2711/1999).

Definition of Paediatric Population Subgroups (EMA)
Paediatric Subgroup
Preterm newborn infants
Newborn infants

Approximate Age Range

Infants/toddler
Children

28 days to 23 months
2 to 11 years

Adolescents

12 to 16-18 years (dependent on region)

0 to 27 days

In view of ED activity, additional (paediatric) subpopulations may need to be considered
including:
•
•
•
•
•

extremely low birth weight (ELBW) newborns, weighing less than 1.0 kg (WHOICD-11)
very low birth weight (VLBW) describes newborns less than 1.5 kg (WHO-ICD-11)
low birth weight (LBW) describes newborns less than 2.5 kg (WHO-ICD-11)
prepubertal age group typically ranges from 9 to 12 years.
peripubertal males or females

It should be realised that the benefit of medical devices including the use of phthalates
must also be considered: The survival of prematurely born infants often depends on the
availability of the same medical devices that result in a relatively high phthalate content
exposure due to treatment. Whenever possible, material with low release potential should
be used (SCENIHR 2015).
Besides the direct patient benefits of the treatment with a medical device containing
phthalates, other functionalities may also need to be considered. For example, DEHP is
incorporated into RBCs, stabilising their membrane and reducing storage hemolysis. This
results in a prolonged shelf life and thus patient availability of RBCs stored in DEHP
containing blood bags (SCENIHR 2015). In addition, RBCs have increased post-transfusion
survival rates when stored in DEHP-containing blood bags. A maximum limit of extractable
DEHP of 15 mg/100 mL for flexible PVC containing DEHP is indicated in EN ISO 3826-1 on
containers for the collection of human blood and blood components.
The plasticiser industry has been investing in and developing alternatives to DEHP in
medical devices. Today, other plasticisers such as Di-isononyl cyclohexanoate (DINCH, CAS
166412-78-8), Tri-2-ethylhexyl trimellitate (TEHTM (TOTM), CAS 3319-31-1), butyryl trin-hexyl citrate (BTHC, CAS 102818-95-1) and Dioctyl Terephthalate (DOTP (DEHT,
DEHTP), CAS 6422-86-2) are being proposed in medical applications such as medical
tubing and blood bag sets. (Home - European plasticisers) For any BRA on the use of
phthalates and the development of alternatives in medical devices, careful consideration

71

should be used for the appropriate patient subgroup analysis regarding medical device use
and the resulting potential exposure.

Annex 7: Approaches for Benefit-Risk Assessment
Several approaches and frameworks for Benefit-Risk Assessment (BRA) have been
proposed, especially in the context of medicinal products. Many approaches were identified
and classified as descriptive (qualitative or semi-qualitative) or quantitative frameworks
(relying on quantitative methods of trading risks and benefits following mathematical
principles), metrics (measures for benefits and risks that are usually endpoint specific),
estimation techniques (i.e. simulation techniques and meta-analysis), and utility survey
techniques (to elicit stakeholders’ preferences) (Guo et al., 2010, Mt-Isa et al., 2014). A
detailed review of approaches used for BRA was published by Mt-Isa et al. (Mt-Isa et al.,
2014).
Concerning quantitative frameworks, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
Project Report (EMA/227124/2011), there is no agreement on any approach to be used in
regulatory submissions on the benefits and risks of medicines. However, the EMA has
encouraged the use of quantitative frameworks in regulatory submissions of applications
for marketing authorisation of medicinal products. Although there is little experience with
quantitative frameworks in the area of medical devices, some of the BRA approaches used
for pharmaceuticals or veterinary medicinal products may also be relevant for medical
devices and particularly regarding the use of CMR/ED phthalates.
Step-by-step
Description and relation to framework for Benefit-Risk Assessment described in Section A of the
guidelines
Problem

Describe the medical device, its intended use, and the therapeutic context;
frame the decision problem in terms of potential alternatives to CMR/ED
phthalate. See Step 1: Description and characterisation of the composition of
the medical device; and Step 2: Use and function of the phthalates in the
medical device.

Objectives

Identify the full set of criteria to evaluate different alternatives. See Step 2: Use
and function of the phthalates in the medical device; and Step 3: Assessment
of the risks of the CMR/ED phthalate. See 7 Benefit assessment.

Alternatives

Identify alternatives that are being evaluated in comparison with each other.
See Step 4: Inventory of possible alternatives; and Step 5: Identification of the
candidates for assessment as most relevant alternatives for phthalates.

Consequences

Describe how the alternatives perform for each of the criteria, i.e. the
magnitudes of all effects in terms of the different benefits and risks. See Step
2: Use and function of the phthalates in the medical device; Step 3: Assessment
of the risks of the CMR/ED phthalate; Step 6: Description of identified potential
alternative(s); Step 7: Assessment of the risk of identified most relevant
alternatives. For a summary see Table 6. Example for a comparison of CMR/ED
phthalate with most relevant alternative(s).

Trade-offs

Assess the balance between benefits and risks using criteria and weights to
judge the value associated with the benefits and risks of every alternative.
MCDA techniques commonly achieve this through numerical analysis. A number
of different weighing methods can be used. Conduct sensitivity analyses to
explore uncertainties using different scenarios and assess how different weights
affect the overall ordering of the alternatives.
See also Step 8: Comparison of functionality and performance of CMR/ED
phthalate as used in the medical device with functionality and performance of
identified most relevant alternatives; Step 9: Comparison of risk(s) of original

73

_______________________________________________________________________________________

CMR/ED phthalate as used in the medical device with risk(s) of identified most
relevant alternatives; and Step 10: Comparison of benefit and risk of CMR/ED
phthalate used in the medical device with identified most relevant alternatives.
Uncertainty

Report the uncertainty associated with the benefits and risks. Consider how the
balance between benefits and risks is affected by uncertainty. A quantitative
model will explore in sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses (or by explicitly
incorporating probability distributions in the model) the effects on the overall
benefit-risk balance of all sources of uncertainty. See Section 10 covering
uncertainty analysis.

Risk tolerance

Describe any considerations that could or should affect the decision maker’s
attitude toward risks (e.g. special population, unmet medical need).

Linked-decisions

Discuss how the value judgements and data are consistent with similar decisions
on medical devices.

Approaches based on multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) have attracted much attention
during the past years, particularly in the field of medical decisions. For an introduction to
MCDA, see Dodgson et al., (2009), and for more detailed information, see Gongora-Salazar
et al., (2023) and Khan et al., (2022). In brief, MCDA is based on decision theory and
belongs to the general class of multi-criteria analysis models that accommodate decision
making with multiple objectives. The main purpose of MCDA is to bring together evaluations
of options on different criteria into one overall evaluation. The starting point for MCDA
approaches includes identification of the alternatives and the criteria against which the
alternatives are appraised. MCDA includes weighing, which ensures that the units of value
on all the criteria are comparable so that benefits and risks can be compared by using a
common unit of value. In this way, the added value of benefits can be compared to the loss
of value from the risks. A number of different weighing methods can be used, ranging from
precise elicitation of weights to weights based on qualitative judgements or including
uncertainty. A generic framework for conducting an MCDA can be based on the steps of the
PROACT-URL framework (Hammond et al., 2015), as presented below. A detailed
description of the different implementations of MCDA techniques is beyond the scope of
these guidelines. The chosen techniques and analyses should be presented and justified on
the basis of internal consistency, logical soundness and transparency, among other
considerations.
In 2016 the US FDA developed a Guidance Document to provide clarity regarding the
benefit and risk factors in prioritising resources for compliance and enforcement efforts to
maximize medical device quality and patient safety (FDA, 2016). This guidance describes
a framework for medical device decision-making in the product availability, compliance,
and enforcement field. A common understanding of how FDA considers benefit and risk
may better align industries and FDA on actions that maximize benefit to patients, improve
medical device quality, and reduce risk to patients. In January 2017, a guidance document
was published by the FDA explaining the principal factors that the FDA considers when
assessing benefits and risks of investigational device exemption (IDE) applications, or
amendments and supplements for human clinical investigations of medical devices to
determine safety and effectiveness (FDA, 2017). In addition, in 2019, the US FDA published
a guidance document that explains the main factors that should be considered when making
benefit-risk determinations in the premarket review of certain medical devices (FDA, 2019).
In December 2023, the EMA released for public consultation guidelines on the evaluation
of the benefit-risk balance of veterinary medicinal products (EMA/CVMP/248499/2007 Rev.

1, 2023). This guideline aims to replace the “Recommendation on the evaluation of the
benefit-risk balance of veterinary medicinal products”. The guideline provides
methodological details on the conduct of the BRA, provides guidance on when and how to
perform a BRA, and can be the basis for the elaboration of all assessment documents that
include a section on the evaluation of the benefit-risk balance. The principles of the
methodology provided in this guideline regarding the BRA factually describe the observed
effects and uncertainties in terms of important benefits and risks, as well as of their impact.
It is suggested that the identified benefits and risks should be evaluated separately, the
direct benefit(s) of the product must be clearly established for each target species and each
indication, and each risk should be assessed considering all the elements present in the
different parts of the dossier, which should be accompanied, if appropriate, by proposals
for risk mitigation measures. The goal is to objectively bring to light and critically discuss
the benefits and risks described. This guideline suggests a structured approach for the BRA
to ensure that the reasoning leads to a clear conclusion, comprising the following elements:
(a) the conclusion of the BRA should include an introduction summarising the main
characteristics of the product and outlining the legal basis of the marketing authorisation
application which forms the framework of the assessment; (b) the direct benefits of the
product should be clearly described for each target species and each indication. Any
additional benefits should be identified separately; (c) the BRA should consider potential
dose-effect relationships if relevant. A balance between the benefit(s) and the risks for the
target can often be done directly; (d) the risk assessments should be performed for all
relevant risks and information about each risk should be stated; and (e) for each risk, risk
mitigation options should be considered, and the potential residual risk discussed. An
overall conclusion should be drawn on the BRA, recognising that zero risk does not exist
and considering potential risk mitigation measures. The evaluation of the overall BRA
should clearly describe why it is considered as favourable (positive) or unfavourable
(negative), explaining the reasoning which led to the conclusion. After the analysis of
benefits and risks, a clear discussion and conclusion should be written, following the
benefit-risk evaluation principles mentioned above.
Consistency in the use of data requirements and risk assessment methodologies applied
within the regulatory frameworks is of crucial importance when performing a BRA. The
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) commissioned RPA Europe and FoBiG (Forschungsund Beratunsinstitut Gefarhstoffe GmbH) to carry out the study “Mapping of data
requirements and assessment methodologies linked to the regulatory frameworks and
remits of the relevant EU Agencies (ECHA, EFSA and EMA) and EC Scientific Committees
(Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety, SCCS, and Scientific Committee on Health,
Environmental and Emerging Risks, SCHEER)” (Oltmanns et al., 2023). The objective was
to collect and analyse data requirements and risk assessment methodologies applied within
regulatory frameworks, i.e., EFSA, ECHA, EMA, as well as the EC Scientific Committees,
SCCS and SCHEER. These data requirements and risk assessment methodologies can also
be used for a formal BRA framework. Based on a comparative analysis methodology, the
database of data requirements and risk assessment methodologies across different
regulatory frameworks was created by extracting information on various data requirements
(e.g. substance identity, physico-chemical and environmental fate properties as well as
ecotoxicity and toxicity and target organism safety) and risk assessment methodologies for
the environment, human health, and target organisms. The study identified inconsistencies
within regulatory areas, e.g. between legal acts and guidance documents. Differences were
also found between regulatory frameworks with respect to terminology, the quality
standards for experimental studies, and other issues. Based on the identified differences

75

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

and the potential for harmonisation across the regulatory frameworks, several
recommendations were outlined in the study that involve addressing specific as well as
more principal and structural differences that could also be considered for a formal BRA
analysis.
Although not specifically addressing medical devices, the guideline documents mentioned
above from the FDA, ECHA, EFSA and EMA provide information that can be considered and
can be useful when performing a BRA for the use of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives.
Drug and medical device life science companies (n=20) were interviewed for their use of
BRA methodology. They were reported to use both qualitative and semi-quantitative benefit
risk assessment approaches, which was limited to a small number of assets primarily for
internal decision making or regulatory submissions (Smith et al., 2021).

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Annex 8: Exposure identified for currently used alternatives
8.1 Leaching and extractable properties
In the (EN) ISO 10993 series for the biological and clinical evaluation of medical devices
(MDs), both determination of the chemical composition of the device and the possibility for
migration/leakage of potentially harmful substances from the device are key issues in the
safety evaluation of MDs. Potential human exposure to plasticisers leaching from MDs is
basically dependent on the structure of the plasticiser, the plastic of which the MD is made
of, and the fluid in contact with the MD. The factors that influence the degree of leaching,
in addition to the concentration in the MD, are lipophilicity/hydrophobicity of the plasticiser
(e.g., octanol/water partition coefficient), physicochemical affinity for the plastic of the MD,
vapour pressure, molecular weight, and steric hindrance. The overall exposure is
determined by the actual conditions of use of the MD (e.g., temperature, duration of
storage or infusion, contact duration and area, type and flow of the fluid, mechanical stress
in peristaltic pumps).
When medical devices need to be flexible (e.g., tubings, bags, circuits), they are generally
made of PVC with the addition of varying amounts of plasticisers that can add up to 50%
w/w (Bernard et al., 2023). The plastic formulation may be composed of either a unique
plasticiser or, more commonly, by a mixture of different plasticisers, altogether contributing
to the desired performance. In a study on 97 samples of indwelling medical devices in
pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), Malarvannan et al. (2019) showed that DEHP was the
most used plasticiser (60/97 samples), while non ortho-phthalate alternatives were bis(2ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA, 32/97), bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT, 24/ 97), tris(2ethylhexyl) trimellitate (TOTM, 20/97), and tributyl-O-acetyl citrate (ATBC, 10/ 97). Other
plasticisers detected, although less frequently, were di-isononyl-cyclohexane-1,2dicarboxylate (DINCH, 2/97), di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP, 4/97), di(2-propylheptyl)
phthalate (DPHP, 4/97) and di-isodecyl phthalate (DiDP, 2/97). It was observed that in
most cases a mixture of plasticisers was used (TOTM in combination with DEHP and DEHT).
Similarly to phthalates, alternative plasticisers may be potentially released from the MD
and their behavior with respect to leaching needs to be characterised. When alternatives
are used as a replacement for DEHP in medical devices, the use conditions of the MD with
these alternatives are the same as the original DEHP-containing device. Indeed, in terms
of quantitative exposure (mg/kg bw), differences may occur depending on the actual
amount of a plasticiser or a mixture of plasticisers present in the medical devices and the
leaching properties of these alternatives in the actual intended use of the medical device.
Faessler et al. (2017) measured the leakage of DEHP and alternative plasticisers in lipid
emulsion from seven perfusion lines, containing a range of plasticisers from 22 to 44% (i.e.
DEHP, DEHT, TOTM and DINCH). DEHP was the plasticiser with the greatest leaching, while
lower release was measured for DINCH (8 times smaller), DEHT (18 times) and TOTM
(more than 100 times smaller than DEHP). In an in vitro model system, both DEHP and
TOTM were found to be leaking from PVC infusion lines (Fernandez-Canal et al., 2018).
Regarding fluid transport, lipidic fluids showed higher levels of leached plasticisers than
non-lipidic ones due to the hydrophobic character of the plasticisers (Panneel et al., 2023).
The detected plasticisers, in addition to DEHP, were ATBC, TOTM, DEHT and DEHA. The
higher molecular weight and/or higher steric hindrance of the alternatives in comparison
with DEHP was related to their lower release from the tested MD.

_______________________________________________________________________________________

Labile blood products (LBPs) were evaluated using a PVC blood bag plasticised with DEHP,
DINCH or DEHT and leaching was evaluated after storage (Thelliez et al., 2023). At the end
of the 49-day storage period, the DEHP equivalent concentration in RBC concentrates was
statistically higher when compared to DINCH and DEHT.
8.2 Analytical methods
Various analytical methods for detecting and measuring phthalates and alternative
plasticisers are available, as already reviewed by Bernard et al. back in 2014 (Bernard et
al., 2014). The differences in the applicable methods depend on the matrix to be analysed
(i.e. the plastic device itself or the fluid in contact with it), the chemical structure of the
plasticiser, the concentration to be analysed, and/or the presence of a mixture of
plasticisers. For direct analysis of a plastic medical device, the sample preparation is carried
out with a solvent dissolution step of the plastic (e.g. Tetrahydrofuran for PVC) or with a
liquid/solid extraction of the plasticisers (e.g., Soxhlet or Accelerated Solvent Extraction).
The supercritical CO2 extraction technique is also used. For analysis of the fluid in which
the plasticisers are potentially leached, the sample preparation is done by means of liquidliquid extraction (LLE), solid-phase extraction (SPE), solid-phase microextraction (SPME),
liquid-phase microextraction (LPME).
There is a certain similarity in the release or leakage of material components between
medical biomaterials, food packaging/food contact materials and other consumer products.
For these types of applications, similar methodologies might be used to determine
plasticiser presence and/or release. Chromatographic techniques are the most suitable for
separation, identification and detection of the constituents of the device: gaschromatography with different detectors such as flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and
mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), coupled
with a diode array detector (UV- DAD) or with Mass Spectrometry detectors (e.g., tandem
mass spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry). Suitable tests should be chosen
depending on the device ((EN) ISO 10993-18; Thelliez et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023; Weng
et al., 2023). A method using 1H NMR was reported by Genay (Genay et al., 2017). The
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has adopted GC–MS for the analysis of
seven phthalates (BBP, DBP, DEHP, DIBP, DIDP, DINP, and DnOP) in polymers with the
range as low as 100–2000 mg/kg (corresponding to 0.01 to 0.2 % w/w) as a standard test
method (IEC 2017).
Desorption Corona Beam Ionization (DCBI) MS/MS was reported as a quick method for
screening face masks for the presence of phthalates originating from the packaging
material (Min et al., 2021). Phthalate di-esters dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di(2ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP), di-iso-butyl phthalate (DIBP), and butyl benzyl phthalate
(BBP) were also found in face masks used during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in
inhalation exposure (Vimalkumar et al., 2022; Kisielinski et al., 2024; Shende et al., 2024)
and potential dermal absorption (Shende et al., 2024). Screening of gloves prepared from
different materials (vinyl, nitrile, neoprene, and latex) showed a variation in plasticiser
content depending on the glove material used, with relative high amounts in vinyl gloves
of the three main plasticisers DEHP, DEHT and DINP (Poitou et al., 2021). Currently, a
number of alternative non-ortho phthalate plasticisers are used in flexible PVC food contact
materials as reviewed by Harmon and Otter (2022).
For biological samples (e.g., tissue, blood or urine), similar methods as those described
above can be applied. It should be noted that to estimate the exposure to the plasticisers,

79

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

it is important to determine not only the parent compound, but also its metabolites. A
HPLC-MS/MS method was developed for simultaneous determination in urine of 22
metabolites of DEHP and alternative plasticisers present in medical devices used in a NICU
(Pinguet et al., 2019). Simultaneous determination of DEHP and DINCH and their
metabolites was also reported using a tandem LC-MS/MS method (Descat et al., 2020).
Been et al. (2019) developed a method using solid phase extraction (SPE) and liquidchromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to evaluate multiple
exposure biomarkers for alternative plasticisers determining metabolites of amongst others
DINCH, DEHTP, and DEHA, in urine and blood samples (Been et al., 2019).
8.3 Human exposure to DEHP and alternative plasticisers
The general population is exposed to DEHP through a variety of routes, with food being the
primary source of exposure. Matrices for biomonitoring human exposure to phthalates or
their alternatives can be urine, blood serum, fingernails and hair (Alves et al., 2017; Been
et al., 2019; Yin et al., 2019; Bernard et al., 2021, 2023). Several biomonitoring studies,
measuring primary and secondary excreted DEHP metabolites, that were analysed in detail
in the SCENIHR Opinion in 2015, indicate widespread exposure to DEHP (SCENIHR, 2015).
Since all DEHP metabolites have been demonstrated to have a short half-life, it is essential
to measure the time between exposure and urine sampling in order to characterise DEHP
exposure and to be able to discriminate between short- and long-term exposure, which can
be estimated by using the ratio between primary and secondary metabolites. The median
background exposure for the general population reported in the 2015 Opinion was 2-5
µg/kg bw/day, whereas the 95th percentile is estimated to be between 6 and 17 µg/kg
bw/day. Children may have a somewhat higher body burden of DEHP than adults, with a
median exposure of around 4 to 8 µg/kg/day. A decreasing trend was noted over time,
although medical procedures using PVC medical devices can lead to DEHP exposures much
higher than the background levels, and even similar or above NOAEL concentrations
(SCENIHR 2015).
After the SCENIHR Opinion on DEHP (SCENIHR 2015) and the SCHEER publication on the
guidelines for a BRA of phthalates (SCHEER 2019) considerable progress has been made
on the replacement of DEHP by other phthalates and/or alternative substances in various
applications. The use of these alternatives in a variety of products, including medical
devices, is shown in the reports indicating human exposure to these alternatives. Even for
the replacements though, multiple plasticisers could be detected in medical devices used
at a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) (Malarvannan et al., 2019). See Table 8.1 for
some (non-exhaustive) examples of the demonstrated presence of phthalates in these
medical products and human exposure to phthalates through these replacements. It should
be noted that there is also a widespread exposure to the classical phthalates (DEHP, DEP,
DBP) and alternative plasticisers (DINCH, DINP, DIDA, DEHA) from other sources as well,
including food and potable water, personal care products, toys and other children’s
products (Kim et al., 2020; Praveena et al., 2021, Wu et al., 2021; Struzina et al., 2022;
Stuchlík Fišerová et al., 2022). In a recent review by Kisielinski et al. (2024) also face
masks used during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic were observed to induce
exposure to a number of substances including DEHP (Kisielinski et al., 2024). In addition,
it was noted that in some medical devices the amount of DEHP reported was higher than
the 0.1% content as indicated in the MDR (EU 2017/745).

Update of the guidelines on the benefit-risk assessment of the presence of CMR/ED phthalates in certain
medical devices – final version
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Annex 9: Health hazards of CMR/ED phthalate alternatives
After the publication of the guidelines for the benefit risk assessment (BRA) for the
justification on the use of CMR/ED phthalates in medical devices (SCHEER 2019), some
progress has been made in the development and use of alternatives for phthalate
plasticisers. With increasing use, more studies have emerged describing the actual
exposure risks presented by these alternatives (see Annex 8) and investigating the
potential hazards associated with these CMR/ED phthalate alternatives. However,
compared to DEHP, information on toxicology is less exhaustive for the alternative
plasticisers.
It is of note that aggregate exposure from other sources of alternative plasticisers different
from medical devices should be taken into account for the general risk assessment,
because they are used in many other consumer products. In addition, since several
different plasticisers are used not as a single plasticiser but in plasticiser mixtures, possible
combined exposure and risk should also be evaluated, as it was suggested for male
developmental toxicity risk assessment caused by exposure to phthalate mixtures
(Kortenkamp and Koch, 2020).
This Annex is not intended to provide any systematic review nor any exhaustive hazard
characterisation for the potential phthalates alternatives, which is out of the scope of these
guidelines (see Annex 1). Rather, it provides a brief compilation of toxicological information
for a number of alternatives that can be used as plasticisers to replace the CMR/ED
phthalates. Although the actual replacement of the CMR/ED phthalates depends also on
the functionality and performance of the proposed alternatives, alternatives demonstrating
a lower net risk due to a reduction of exposure (e.g. due to lower leaching properties from
the plastic) and/or having a lower toxicity may serve as suitable replacements.
The main hazard characteristics of a number of the currently known alternatives are
summarised in Table 9.1. The hazard characteristics are presented by showing the critical
endpoint on the basis of which the NOAEL and or the BMDL has been derived for oral
repeated dose toxicity, which sometimes differs from the reproductive properties
characterising the action of DEHP. None of them has been reported to be genotoxic,
therefore any carcinogenic effect is generally assumed to be associated with a nongenotoxic mechanism for which a threshold can be determined.
Some alternatives can cause reproductive toxicity, in analogy with DEHP, but so far, higher
doses were reported to be needed to cause reproductive toxicity for the alternatives,
indicating a lower potential of inducing such an outcome. However, in many instances,
critical effects driving NOAEL derivations were other than reproductive effects. The doses
for these critical effects (other than reproductive toxicity) may also be lower than the doses
noted for reproductive effects identified for CMR/ED phthalates.
A recent evaluation of the toxicity of various alternatives confirmed the critical NOAELS as
reported by the Danish EPA and the SCENIHR (2015) and identified DINCH and TOTM as
having a more favourable migration and/or toxicity profile compared to DEHP (Den BraverSewradj et al., 2020). In a review on six phthalates, DEHP, DINP, DBP, DIBP, BBP, and
DEP, it was concluded based on robust evidence that DEHP and DBP phthalate exposure
affects male reproductive outcomes, while there was moderate evidence for the same
outcome from DINP and BBP exposure, and slight evidence for similar effects from DIBP
and DEP exposure (Radke et al., 2018). In rats a comparison between DBP and DINP

indicated that the latter does not cause the adverse reproductive effects known to occur
with DBP, a well-established ED (van den Driesche et al., 2020).
Based on a plausible common mode of action (i.e. reduction in fetal testosterone)
underlying the reproductive effects of DEHP, DBP and BBP, the EFSA CEP Panel (EFSA CEP
Panel, 2019) considered it appropriate to establish a group-TDI for these phthalates, taking
DEHP as index compound as a basis for introducing relative potency factors. The CEP Panel
noted that DINP also affected fetal testosterone levels at doses around three-fold higher
than liver effects and therefore considered it prudent to include it within the group-TDI,
which was established to be 50 µg/kg bw per day, expressed as DEHP equivalents.
The combined exposure to different plasticisers with the same mode of action is therefore
important also considering that different plasticisers may be used in mixtures.

It is evident from Table 9.1 that besides the relevant endocrine disrupting activity, the
overall toxicity of the alternatives needs to be considered.
Recently some publications showed possible effects in vivo for a number of CMR/ED
phthalate alternatives e.g.:
For ATBC
•

changes in fat metabolism and disruption of antral follicle function following ATBC
oral exposure (Zhang et al., 2023; Rasmussen et al., 2017)

For DINP
•
•
•
•
•

induction of apoptosis, autophagy and oxidative stress of the ovary tissue caused
by DINP (Chen et al., 2022);
long term alteration of estrous cycle, reduction in pregnancy, decreased fertility
(Chiang and Flaws 2019; Chiang et al., 2020)
effects on colon morphology and physiology in adult female mice (Chiu et al., 2020);
alteration of inflammatory cytokines in the kidney (Gu et al., 2021);
alteration of lipid metabolism (Yang et al., 2021).

In vitro findings have also been reported, including the cytotoxic effects of DEHP and
several alternatives and/or their metabolites, suggesting that metabolites can also display
some biological activity in fibroblasts (Eljezi et al., 2017, 2019), in kidney cells
(Vasconcelos et al., 2019) or adipocytes (Zhang et al., 2019). More recently other models
were reported, including the use of fetal testis samples (Tardif et al., 2023) or zebrafish
(Tsai et al., 2023) to further study the reproductive effects of DEHP and some alternatives.
Regarding the possibility for screening of ED activity, many in vitro studies have been
published recently. They were carried out using many different cell lines and models, some
of which have been adopted as OECD test guidelines suitable for the identification of
specific hazards, such as steroidogenesis testing, binding to estrogen receptors or
thyroxine-binding globulin (Boccard et al., 2019; Sheikh and Beg, 2022; Langsch et al.,
2018; Engel et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2019; Moche et al., 2021; Rajkumar et al., 2022).
Outcomes related to ED-mediated activity varied, depending on the chemical, dose and
cell lines used: this implies that in vitro data should always be interpreted with caution.
Indeed, the in vitro test is only one of the first steps within the OECD framework for the
testing and assessment of ED activity (OECD 2018) and does not take into consideration
the kinetic behaviour of the chemical or the interplay of different organs and system
characterising the endocrine system.
This is relevant in view of the definition “An ED is an exogenous substance or mixture that
alters function(s) of the endocrine system and consequently causes adverse effects in an
intact organism, or its progeny, or (sub)populations.” (WHO/IPCS, 2002) and considering
that endocrine disruption should not be seen as an adverse effect per se, but rather as a
mode or mechanism of action potentially leading to other outcomes, for example
carcinogenic, reproductive, or developmental effects, routinely considered in reaching
regulatory decisions. In addition, many cell lines are not representative of the in vivo
situation (e.g., many immortalised cells have lost the ability of biologically transforming
exogenous chemicals). This can lead to discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo
responses.

Therefore, although relevant for the understanding of the mode of action, these in vitro
studies cannot be used at present to derive or change the reference values reported for
the risk assessment procedure.

Annex 10: Recent progress in the use of alternative plasticisers to DEHP for red blood cell
storage
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plasticised with di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been the
material of choice for blood bag sets used for the collection, processing and storage of red
blood cell concentrates since the mid-20th century. DEHP is important for material
flexibility; facilitating centrifugation, sealing, transport and general handling of blood bag
sets without risk of breakage and product loss (Walter 1984). In addition, leached DEHP
incorporates in the red blood cell membrane and has a stabilising effect, which helps to
maintain cell integrity, reducing hemolysis and thus permitting longer storage duration of
red blood cell concentrates (Horowitz et al., 1985; Rock et al., 1984). As per European
legislation (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex V), hemolysis of red cell must be below 0.8% at
the end of shelf life (usually between 5-7 weeks, depending on the Member State). In the
EDQM guide (2023) it is indicated that at least 90% of the hemolysis tests should meet
the required values. In addition, specific requirements for blood bag sets are also presented
in ISO 3826-1:2019 and ISO 3826-1:2023 Amendment 1. Furthermore, some Member
States may have additional quality requirements.
At least five independent Phase I studies compared red blood cell storage in DEHP-PVC
bags with the plasticiser alternatives diisononyl-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH),
di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHT), n-Butyryl-tri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC), DINCH and di
(2-ethylhexyl) 4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylate (DOTH, CAS 2915-49-3) or DOTH and 4cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid dinonyl ester (DL9TH, CAS 1609185-22-9).
For red blood cells stored in DINCH bags in the storage solution SAGM, end of storage
hemolysis was increased in DINCH when compared to DEHP but remained below the
European limit of 0.8%. (Lagerberg et al., 2015). This study also showed that two second
generation storage solutions (phosphate–adenine–glucose–guanosine–saline–mannitol
(PAGGSM) and AS-3) or an experimental storage solution (phosphate–adenine–glucose–
guanosine–gluconate–mannitol PAGGGM) reduced hemolysis associated with the usage of
DINCH-PVC bags to a level similar to DEHP bags/SAGM solution.
The plasticisers alternatives DINCH+DOTH or DL9TH+DOTH associated with the mannitoladenine-phosphate storage solution (MAP) showed a tendency to increased hemolysis that
did not reach statistical significance when compared to DEHP-PVC bags/MAP solution at 42
days of storage (Morishita et al. 2017).
For red blood cells stored in DEHT bags in the storage solution SAGM, although end of
storage hemolysis was slightly higher in DEHT when compared to DEHP, it remained below
the European limit of 0.8%. (Larsson et al., 2021). Similarly, for red blood cells stored in
DEHT-PVC in the storage medium AS-1, increased hemolysis rates at the end of storage
were observed when compared to DEHP-PVC but also remained below the European limit
of 0.8% (Graminske et al., 2018). Interestingly, both studies showed that the PAGGSM
storage solution reduced hemolysis associated with the usage of DEHT-PVC bags, when
compared to AS-1 and SAGM. Lastly, a recent Phase I study by Vermeulen et al. showed
that BTHC bags/PAGGSM solution had hemolysis levels comparable to DEHP bags/SAGM
solution (Vermeulen et al., 2022).
In the same report, a Phase III hemovigilance surveillance was performed to track adverse
event frequency in patients transfused with red blood cells stored in BTHC bags/PAGGSM
solution (652 patients) or in standard of care DEHP/SAGM solution (1633 patients).
Transfusion of red blood cell concentrates stored in BTHC/PAGGSM solution did not result
in an increased rate of transfusion reactions (Vermeulen et al., 2022).
One Phase I study compared DEHP/DEHT and SAGM/PAGGSM solution combinations for
storage of irradiated red blood cells, a blood product used to transfuse

immunocompromised patients (Larsson et al., 2022). The hemolysis level was slightly
increased at the end of storage in DEHT bags conditions but remained below the European
limit of 0.8%. As for standard red blood cell storage, the PAGGSM solution reduced
hemolysis associated with the usage of DEHT bags.
In all of these studies, the plasticiser alternatives for DEHP did not show a negative impact
on the end of storage ATP level, suggesting that red cell metabolism is not negatively
impacted by DEHP removal (Lagerberg et al., 2015; Morishita et al., 2017; Larsson et al.,
2021; Graminske et al., 2018; Vermeulen et al., 2022).
These studies show that it may be possible to replace DEHP by an alternative plasticiser
that does not affect the storage capacity of the red blood cells in these blood bags.
However, a careful benefit risk assessment extending beyond hemolysis needs to be
performed before replacing DEHP by any alternative in blood bag sets. These guidelines
are intended to provide information how to perform such BRA.
It should be noted that the sunset date for the continued use of DEHP in medical devices
has recently been extended to 1 July 2030 (Commission Regulation (EU) 2023/2482) as
described in Annex 5 of these guidelines. After this date authorisation according to REACH
(Regulation (EC) 1907/2006) is required, in addition to justification for the use of CMR/ED
phthalates according to the MDR (Regulation (EU) 2017/745).
