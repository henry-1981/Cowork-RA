Guidance MEDDEVs
The MEDDEVs promote a common approach to be followed by manufacturers and notified
bodies that are involved in conformity assessment procedures.
•

•
•
•

The MEDDEVs are drafted by authorities charged with safeguarding public health in
conjunction with all stakeholders (industry associations, health professionals
associations, notified bodies and European standardisation organisations). This is in
accordance with the relevant annexes of the directives
MEDDEVs are carefully drafted through a consultation process with all interested
parties and are subject to a regular updating process
These documents have particular reference codes and are endorsed at the medical
devices expert group (MDEG) plenary meetings
The guidelines are not legally binding. However, due to the participation of the
aforementioned interested parties and the experts from competent authorities, it is
expected that the guidelines be followed, ensuring the uniform application of
relevant directive provisions.

Disclaimer: Please note that the amendments introduced by Directive 2007/47/EC or
previous amending directives have not yet been incorporated into all MEDDEVs.
