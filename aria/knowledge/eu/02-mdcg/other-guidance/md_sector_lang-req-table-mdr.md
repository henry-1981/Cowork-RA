MDR - Language requirements for manufacturers - Rev. 3 (August 2025)
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) contains different legal provisions that allow Member States to determine language requirements for manufacturers at
national level for information accompanying the device. The following table gives an overview of the national provisions, in the case that Member States have made use of the
possibility to determine language requirements for manufacturers. Member States are not obliged to determine a specific language. Having regard to the costs related to
providing information in various languages, Member States are encouraged to consider whether information to be provided by the manufacturer could be accepted in another
language than their national language (e.g. in English) if the safe use of the device is not compromised, especially regarding devices for professional use.
The below information is provided based on the information available to the Commission services following a consultation of the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) in
October 2023. It is updated when Member State authorities inform about changes. The Commission services do not take responsibility for the correctness of the information in
the table. In any case, the provisions of the MDR and the provisions of the Member States implementing the MDR in respect of language requirements take precedence over
the information in this table.
