Introduction

The Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) considers the post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) as a continuous process that
updates the clinical evaluation and that shall be addressed in the manufacturer’s post-market surveillance plan. The MDR reinforces the
PMCF process by the manufacturer, devoting part B of Annex XIV to it and providing a set of requirements for developing a PMCF plan
and its evaluation report, necessary to its implementation.
The manufacturer shall analyse the findings coming from the activities foreseen in the PMCF plan and document the results in this PMCF
evaluation report that shall be part of the clinical evaluation report and the technical documentation.
The conclusions of the PMCF evaluation report shall be taken into account to update eventually the clinical evaluation, the risk
management documentation, the post market surveillance plan and the SSCP, if applicable.
The purpose of the present templates is to guide manufacturers in complying with the requirements of the MDR with respect to the
compilation of the PMCF evaluation report. This would assist manufacturers in a harmonised and complete presentation of post market
clinical data and facilitate the activity of notified bodies and competent authorities in finding the information in an organized format.

Section C. Activities undertaken related to PMCF: results
In this section the manufacturer shall report all the activities described in section C of the PMCF plan which have been performed, all the collected
clinical data obtained from those completed activities, as well as any justification of deviations from the plan.
The discussion shall include the analysis of the findings, whether positive or negative and also the potential impact on the different documents (clinical
evaluation report, risk management file, SSCP, etc…) initially reviewed during the conformity assessment.
It is expected for each activity performed, a description in different subsections, related to the type of activities (device registry, PMCF studies, real
world evidence, surveys about the use of device, etc…), and for each subsection, a description about the quality of data collected.5

Section D. Evaluation of clinical data relating to equivalent or similar devices
In this section the manufacturer shall report all the clinical data collected relating to an equivalent device or selected similar device(s), provide an
analysis and conclusions, and whether changes of the state of the art, or newly identified hazards would have an impact on the devices benefit-risk
determination, the clinical evaluation and/or the PMCF plan.

In this section, the manufacturer shall discuss the aggregate results coming from each PMCF activity planned and performed, described in section C,
but also results coming from equivalent and/or similar device, described in section D, which are considered to impact the technical documentation and
at least the following documents shall be considered:
1. Clinical evaluation report - CER (date and version)
☐ No relevant information from the clinical evaluation report have been considered.

If applicable, it is expected from manufacturer to describe why some information that might have an impact on the CER have not been considered.
Relevant information analyzed and monitored:
Analysis of the outcome is to be reported in the updated clinical evaluation report.
2. Risk management file (date and version)
☐ No relevant information from the risk management file have been considered

If applicable, it is expected from manufacturer to describe why some information that might have an impact on the risk management file have not been
considered.

Relevant information analyzed and monitored:

Section G. Conclusions

In this section, it is expected that the manufacturer shall provide an overall conclusion of the findings and relate them to the aims of the PMCF
plan. The conclusions shall be taken into account in the following clinical evaluation and in the risk management. Finally, this conclusion shall
highlight if any need for preventive and/or corrective measures has been identified. The conclusion may also give input to the next PMCF plan.
