Introduction 
 
This document is intended for sponsors of clinical investigations of devices conducted within 
the scope of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). This document may be supplemented in 
due course with further questions and answers.  
Throughout this document the term ꞌdeviceꞌ is used with the same meaning as in the MDR, 
i.e., for the purpose of the MDR, medical devices, accessories for medical devices and 
products listed in Annex XVI of the MDR and to which the MDR applies, shall hereinafter be 
referred to as ꞌdevicesꞌ1. 
Further, the term “clinical investigation” is used throughout with same meaning as in the MDR 
Article 2(45), i.e. “any systematic investigation involving one or more human subjects, 
undertaken to assess the safety or performance of a device”. 
While clinical investigation is clearly defined in the MDR, it is sometimes also necessary to 
mention that there are studies that do not fulfil this definition, to draw the line between when 
the provisions in the MDR chapter VI and annex XV apply, and when they don’t. For this 
purpose, the broader term “clinical study” is used, and covers, for the purpose of this guidance, 
studies done within medical research involving humans and includes clinical trials of 
medicines, clinical investigations of devices, and clinical performance studies of in vitro 
diagnostic devices, as well as other studies in a clinical setting where products such as drugs 
or devices are not necessarily involved at all.2 3  
Further, the sponsor4 needs to be aware that MDR does not specify details about ethics review 
of clinical investigations. It is thus necessary to check national requirements in relation to 
submission to the Ethics Committee and if applicable, make sure that Ethics Committees and 
Competent Authorities have access to the same versions of updated documents.  
 
 
 
1 Article 1(4) of the MDR. 
2 Note that in the EU regulation 536/2014 the term Clinical Study has a much narrower definition and 
is limited to studies involving medicinal products. 
3 This is also in contrast with the Note 1 to entry 3.8 in ISO 14155:2020 which states that ‘For the 
purpose of this document, ”clinical trial” or “clinical study” are synonymous with “clinical investigation”. 
4 Defined in Article 2(49) of the MDR as any individual, company, institution or organisation which 
takes responsibility for the initiation, for the management and setting up of the financing of the clinical 
investigation.

General questions 
 
1. 
What are the general differences and improvements related to clinical investigations 
under the new Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) as compared to the Directives 
93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC? 
 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) will progressively replace both Directives (93/42/EEC and 
90/385/EEC) and their transpositions in national law.  
The first difference is regarding the type of the law. A Directive is a legislative act that sets out 
a goal that all EU countries must achieve. However, it is up to the individual countries how to 
reach these goals by the implementation of national laws. A Regulation, as opposed to a 
Directive, is a binding legislative act that must be applied in its entirety across the EU on the 
date of application. It means that the rules are applied in an identical manner throughout the 
EU. Member States, in authorising and supervising the conduct of a clinical investigation, will 
be required to base their assessments and decisions on the same rules. 
The MDR contains greater detail than the Directive, which is a result of implementing aspects 
related to good clinical practice, many of which have previously been present in the form of 
guidance and standard documents. 
Further harmonisation at European level will provide greater certainty, which will support an 
environment that provides greater predictability and is more favourable for conducting clinical 
investigations, with the highest standards of patient safety, for all EU Member States. It will not 
only harmonise decisions, but also foster work sharing and collaboration between Member 
States and enhance the transparency regarding these studies. 
For certain clinical investigations,5 the sponsor still needs to check and follow any specific 
national provisions which may apply. 
 
2. 
 Is there legislation other than the MDR that needs to be considered when conducting 
clinical investigations of devices? 
 
The MDR allows, and for some aspects requires, Member States to have national legislation 
in place, when it comes to e.g. procedures for review and authorisation by ethics committees, 
responsibility for medical care provided to subjects, investigator qualifications, legally 
designated representative for subjects, damage compensation systems, designation of 
competent authority as well as additional requirements for clinical investigations falling under 
Article 82 of the MDR. For support on applicable national legislation, consult the websites of 
national competent authorities and ethics committees.  
Further, in addition to the MDR there is other European Union legislation that may be 
applicable, depending on whether other products than devices are being studied in the same 
clinical study6, such as the EU Regulation 536/2014 (CTR) (additional information is available 
 
5 Article 82(2) of the MDR, Article 70(7)(a) of the MDR. 
6 Please refer to the Introduction of this document for clarification on how the term ꞌclinical studyꞌ is 
used in this guideline.

under questions 14 and 15 below) and EU Regulation 2017/746 (IVDR) (refer also to Annex 
III: Does my combination product study require an MDR clinical investigation submission?).  
Complying with the MDR does not remove the obligation of sponsors to comply with other 
relevant legislation, issued by the European Union7 or Member States, which is not specifically 
mentioned above. 
 
3. 
What is a clinical investigation? 
 
A clinical investigation is defined by the MDR as any systematic investigation involving one or 
more human subjects, undertaken to assess the safety or performance of a device8.  
 
4. 
Are all clinical studies that involve use of devices considered clinical investigations 
as defined by the MDR ?? 
 
No, there are situations when devices are used in clinical research but where the scope is not 
to make a systematic investigation involving one or more human subjects, to assess the safety 
or performance of the device(s) used. For example, a clinical trial of a medicinal product may 
involve determining blood pressure or oxygen saturation. This will require the use of devices 
but since the safety or performance of the devices used for blood pressure/oxygen saturation 
are not being assessed, such studies would not be considered clinical investigations and 
devices used in these studies are not investigational devices as defined by the MDR9.  
Note that in these situations, the devices in question will have to be placed on the market or 
put into service in a manner which is compliant with the MDR10. Other national and EU 
legislation11 regarding aspects such as clinical research, ethical review and personal data 
protection may also be applicable.  
Refer also to question 19 below.  
 
5. 
Are all clinical investigations of devices covered by the MDR requirements? 
 
The MDR includes requirements for those clinical investigations that are intended to gather 
clinical evidence for the purpose of demonstrating conformity of devices, and also basic 
requirements regarding other types of clinical investigations.  
Clinical investigations that are carried out as part of the clinical evaluation for conformity 
assessment purposes are regulated in Article 62(1) of the MDR and need to be designed, 
authorised, conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions in Articles 62-
 
7 such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on the protection 
of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such 
data. 
8 Article 2(45) of the MDR. 
9 Note that if an endpoint or objective in such a study is related to the assessment of the safety or 
performance of the device, the study would meet the definition of clinical investigation in Article 2(45) 
of the MDR.  
10 As specified in Article 5 of the MDR. 
11 Refer to question 2 regarding other applicable legislations. 


Medical Devices

81 of the MDR. There may be one or more purposes of such clinical investigations, e.g. to 
establish and/or verify performance, clinical benefits, clinical safety or any undesirable side-
effects.  
Article 74 of the MDR lists particular requirements for some clinical investigations of CE-
marked devices, see also question 11 below.  
Other clinical investigations, i.e. those performed for purposes for which neither Article 62(1) 
nor Article 74(1) applies, fall under Article 82 of the MDR, which lists minimum requirements 
that apply to all such clinical investigations and allows Member States to define additional 
national requirements. For such clinical investigation, you have to check and follow the 
applicable national provisions in each Member State where the clinical investigation will be 
conducted. 
 
6. 
What is the difference between the performance, clinical performance and clinical 
benefit? 
 
In accordance with the MDR, the performance12 of a device is its ability to achieve its intended 
purpose as stated by the manufacturer13. By extension, the clinical performance14 of a device 
is the ability of the device to achieve its intended purpose, thereby leading to a clinical benefit15 
when used as intended. Clinical benefit means the positive impact of a device on the health of 
an individual, expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical 
outcome(s), including outcome(s) related to diagnosis, or a positive impact on patient 
management or public health. 
 
 
 
12 Defined in Article 2(22) of the MDR. 
13 For some medical devices, performance may relate to the user of the device. 
14 Defined in Article 2(52) of the MDR. 
15 Defined in Article 2(53) of the MDR.

7. 
Which regulatory pathway shall a sponsor follow in order to conduct a clinical 
investigation to collect clinical data that will be used to support the conformity 
assessment procedure of the investigated device? 
 
Article 62(1) of the MDR provides that the clinical investigations carried out, as part of the 
clinical evaluation for conformity assessment purposes, shall be designed, authorised, 
conducted, recorded and reported in accordance with the provisions of Articles 62 to 80 of the 
MDR. There may be one or more purposes of clinical investigations; e.g. to establish and/or 
verify performance, clinical benefits, clinical safety and any undesirable side-effects. Such 
clinical investigations are conducted with devices not yet bearing the CE marking or CE marked 
devices which are being investigated outside their intended purpose. 
For clinical investigations that fall under Article 70(7) point (a) of the MDR (i.e. devices in class 
I, non-invasive class IIa or class IIb devices), it may be necessary to check national provisions. 
For clinical investigations of other than these devices, the authorisation procedure is defined 
in Article 70(7) point (b) of the MDR. An overview of the different pathways outlined in the 
MDR, including national requirements possible under Article 82 of the MDR, is described in 
Annex I of this document. 
 
8. 
Which clinical investigations would be considered pilot stage? 
 
A pilot stage clinical investigation is typically an early-stage clinical investigation, which 
includes the following types:  
• 
First in human clinical investigation 
• 
Early feasibility clinical investigation (may also be called proof-of-concept investigation) 
• 
Traditional feasibility clinical investigation 
In general, pilot stage clinical investigations are designed to enrol a limited number of subjects 
to assess a device early in its development phase with respect to the initial clinical safety and/or 
performance (e.g. device functionality)16. The results of this kind of clinical investigation may 
guide further device design modifications or provide further information for the design of a 
subsequent clinical investigation. The outcomes of an early-stage clinical investigation can 
often support further development and iterative changes to the device. The data generated in 
pilot stage clinical investigations are in general insufficient to CE mark the device but should 
be considered in the clinical evaluation.  
More information on the different development stages and related types of clinical investigation 
design for investigational medical devices may be found in the standard ISO14155:2020 and 
its Annex I17. 
 
 
 
16 For certain investigations, in particular early studies of new/high risk devices it might be necessary 
from a safety point of view to limit the rate of enrolment (e.g.; the study design could include an 
evaluation of the first patient before next patient is treated, a phased approach, use of a run-in 
component).

9. 
Which regulatory pathway should a sponsor follow to conduct a clinical investigation 
in the pilot stage (i.e. first in human, early feasibility) in accordance with the 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR)? 
 
In general, as pilot stage clinical investigations are conducted to gather preliminary safety 
and/or performance data, the use of Article 62 of the MDR should be foreseen. In cases of 
doubt, it is recommended to apply under Article 62 of the MDR. Annex I of this document may 
guide you in the different possible pathways to apply for a clinical investigation. 
 
10. 
Is it possible to combine several clinical development stages (e.g. pilot/pivotal) in the 
same clinical investigation?  
 
In some situations, a sponsor may consider it appropriate to include two different study 
designs in the same CIP (exploratory and confirmatory) to investigate a device for the same 
intended use and clinical indication as it progresses through clinical developmental stages 
(e.g. pilot and pivotal stage). This approach should be used restrictively, as the results from 
the first stage may provide important input to what is the most suitable study design for the 
subsequent development stage, but there are situations where the approach could be 
justified.  
Note that applications regarding clinical investigations with a phased approach may be 
subject to conditional approval, where the condition could be that a substantial modification 
notification to the CAs (including data on outcomes of the first stage) is required before the 
second stage is initiated. 
 
11. 
A clinical investigation is planned to further investigate a CE marked device – how 
does a sponsor determine the regulatory pathway for this clinical investigation? 
 
To determine the regulatory pathway for studies with CE marked devices it is necessary to 
understand what the intended purpose of the device is and to check whether the planned use 
in the clinical investigation is within its intended purpose. 
The regulatory pathways available for studies with CE marked devices are outlined in Annex I 
of this document. Question 12 provides further guidance on how to assess the planned use in 
the clinical investigation with respect to its intended purpose.  
Once it has been determined if the investigational medical device will be used within its 
intended purpose, please refer to the following to determine the appropriate regulatory 
pathway: 
a) When the CE marked device is further assessed, for safety or performance within the 
intended purpose, this may be done as part of the manufacturer’s post market clinical 
follow-up activities as a post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) investigation.  
Where the PMCF investigation would involve submitting subjects to procedures 
additional to those performed under the normal conditions of use of the device and 
those additional procedures are invasive or burdensome, the sponsor shall notify the 
Member State(s) concerned at least 30 days prior to its commencement, in accordance 
with Article 74(1) of the MDR. If the sponsor is uncertain whether such additional

13 
 
procedures are considered invasive or burdensome, they are encouraged to request 
the opinion of the relevant authority in the Member State(s) prior to commencement of 
the investigation. See question 13 for further information.  
 
b) There are PMCF investigations other than those that need to be notified according to 
Article 74(1) of the MDR, that do not involve submitting subjects to procedures 
additional to those performed under the normal conditions of use of the device or where 
those additional procedures are not considered invasive or burdensome. There are 
also post market clinical investigations that are not part of the manufacturer’s PMCF 
activities, such as clinical investigations initiated by other stakeholders and conducted 
independently from the manufacturer.  
 
If safety and/or performance of a CE marked device is being further investigated, the 
device will be used within its intended purpose, and if Article 74(1) of the MDR is not 
applicable, Article 82 of the MDR applies, taking into account national legislation. It is 
also necessary to check and follow national provisions in the Member State where the 
clinical investigation will be conducted. Registration in a publicly available database of 
clinical investigations falling under Article 82 of the MDR is encouraged.   
 
c) When the CE marked device is assessed outside its intended purpose, Article 74(2) of 
the MDR provides that the requirements for pre-market clinical investigation apply, 
(Articles 62 to 81 of the MDR). If the clinical investigation is not performed as part of 
the clinical evaluation for conformity assessment purposes, Article 82 of the MDR 
applies, taking into account national legislation.  
 
For the situation when the device itself is not assessed for safety and/or performance, please 
refer to question 4.  
Article 74(1) is only applicable to devices that are appropriately CE-marked at the time of the 
clinical investigation and the device must be used within the intended purpose as defined by 
the manufacturer. Note that modifications of the device may render the CE mark invalid.   
 
12. 
How can a sponsor assess if the planned use of a device in the clinical investigation 
is covered by the intended purpose?  
 
In order to assess if the use of a device in a clinical investigation is within its intended purpose, 
as defined by the manufacturer, first determine the device’s intended purpose, which could be 
identified by reviewing the instructions for use, and if available, the following documents: 
• 
The EU declaration of conformity; 
• 
The labelling18 supplied by the manufacturer; 
• 
Where applicable, the EU conformity certificate19 for the device; 
• 
The clinical evaluation plan; 
• 
The clinical evaluation report; 
 
18 Article 2(12) of the MDR defines “intended purpose” as “the use for which a device is intended 
according to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the label, in the instructions for use or in 
promotional or sales materials or statements and as specified by the manufacturer in the clinical 
evaluation”. 
19 EU technical documentation assessment certificates, EU type-examination certificates or EU product 
verification certificates as appropriate. 


Medical Devices 
Medical Device Coordination Group Document                                      MDCG 2021-6 Rev. 1      
14 
 
• 
Where applicable, the Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP). 
The next step is to determine how the device will be used in the clinical investigation:  
• 
Review the clinical investigation plan to determine the details of the planned use of the 
device. 
Details 
to 
review 
include 
the 
target 
population, 
the 
indications/contraindications, anatomical location where the device will used, the 
duration of use, the planned procedures, and the planned users.  
• 
Check if the intended user in the clinical investigation will use the device as stated in 
the instructions for use. 
From these documents, compare the intended purpose with how the device will be used in the 
clinical investigation and assess if these are aligned. An investigational device can only be 
considered to be used within its intended purpose if the planned use of the device during a 
clinical investigation is aligned with the device’s intended purpose. 
 
13. 
What is considered burdensome or invasive? 
 
Where the investigation would involve submitting subjects to procedures additional to those 
performed under the normal conditions of use of the device and those additional procedures 
are invasive or burdensome, the sponsor shall notify the Member States concerned at least 30 
days prior to its commencement, in accordance with Article 74(1) of the MDR.  
Additional procedures which are burdensome can include a wide variety of different 
interventions, this may include procedures which may cause pain, discomfort, fear, potential 
risks or complications/side-effects, disturbances of lives and personal activities, or otherwise 
unpleasant experiences. It is mostly determined from the perspective of the person bearing 
the burden.  
Additional procedures which are invasive include (but are not limited to) penetration inside the 
body through the surface of the body, including through mucous membranes of body orifices, 
or penetration of a body cavity via a body orifice. 
The understanding of what is considered to be invasive or burdensome is expected to develop 
over time. Sponsors are encouraged to document their assessment whether the additional 
procedures imposed by the clinical investigation plan are considered as burdensome and/or 
invasive, and where appropriate, contact the relevant authority in the Member State(s) to 
discuss cases where the sponsor is uncertain. 
 
14. 
Are clinical studies of combinations of medical devices and medicinal products 
subject to the MDR requirements for clinical investigations?  
 
Devices incorporating medicinal substances 
Per Article 1(8) of the MDR, a device that, as an integral part, incorporates a substance which, 
if used separately, would be considered to be a medicinal product20 and that has an action 
 
20 As defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, including a medicinal product derived from 
human blood or human plasma as defined in point 10 of that directive 


Medical Devices 
Medical Device Coordination Group Document                                      MDCG 2021-6 Rev. 1      
15 
 
ancillary to that of the device shall be assessed and authorised in accordance with the MDR. 
Clinical studies of such devices that fulfil the definition of clinical investigation in Article 2(45) 
of the MDR are subject to the MDR requirements for clinical investigations.  
However, if the action of the medicinal substance is principal and not ancillary to that of the 
device, the integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC21 or Regulation (EC) 
No 726/200422 as applicable. In that case, the relevant general safety and performance 
requirements set out in Annex I of the MDR shall apply as far as the safety and performance 
of the device part are concerned. Clinical studies of such integral products may be considered 
clinical trials regulated by the Regulation (EU) 536/2014 on clinical trials for medicinal products 
for human use (CTR)23. 
Devices intended to administer medicinal products 
Per Article 1(9) of the MDR, any device which is intended to administer a medicinal product24 
shall be governed by the MDR. Clinical studies of such devices that fulfil the definition of clinical 
investigation in Article 2(45) of the MDR are subject to the MDR requirements for clinical 
investigations.  
However, if the device intended to administer the medicinal product and the medicinal product 
are combined in such a way that they form a single integral product which is intended 
exclusively for use in the given combination, and which is not reusable, that single integral 
product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC21 or Regulation (EC) No 726/200422 as 
applicable. In that case, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in 
Annex I of the MDR shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part are 
concerned. Clinical studies of such integral products may be considered clinical trials regulated 
by the Regulation (EU) 536/2014 on clinical trials for medicinal products for human use 
(CTR)23. 
The flowchart in Annex III helps determine when the MDR requirements on clinical 
investigations are applicable for clinical studies of medical device and medicinal product 
combinations.  
 
15. 
Which regulatory pathway shall a sponsor follow in order to conduct a clinical study 
(investigation) to collect clinical data both for a medicinal product and a device that 
will be used to administer the medicinal product, but it is not a single integral 
product?  
 
The medicinal product and the medical device studied in a situation where they are not a single 
integral product at the time of administration, are governed by two different legal frameworks. 
 
21Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the 
Community code relating to medicinal products for human use 
22Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 
laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for 
human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency 
23 Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on 
clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, and repealing Directive 2001/20/EC 
24As defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC 


Medical Devices 
Medical Device Coordination Group Document                                      MDCG 2021-6 Rev. 1      
16 
 
This applies even if they are co-developed and/or intended to be used in a specific 
combination.  
Thus, a clinical study6 which is collecting data for both a device and a medicinal product will 
have to comply with the regulatory requirements in relation to clinical investigations of medical 
devices (in the MDR) as well as the regulatory requirements for clinical trials of medicinal 
products, which are governed by the Regulation (EU) 536/2014 on clinical trials for medicinal 
products for human use (CTR).  
If data on the device are being collected for conformity assessment purposes, Article 62 of the 
MDR applies. 
 
16. 
Is there a common EU procedure for combined studies with devices and medicinal 
products?  
 
No, clinical investigations of devices are regulated by the MDR, while clinical trials of medicinal 
products are regulated by the Regulation (EU) 536/2014 on clinical trials for medicinal products 
for human use (CTR). There is no dedicated procedure for combined studies foreseen in the 
regulations and therefore, currently, no harmonized procedure is in place. Therefore, the 
clinical study6 has to be designed so that it fulfils both regulations. In administrative terms, 
combination studies have to be submitted as a notification or application for a device clinical 
investigation under the MDR and as a medicinal product clinical trial under the CTR. However, 
the study documentation required for submissions (if applicable) may be partially overlapping. 
Please note that each application must be sufficient in itself and cannot refer to documentation 
found in in other applications, as they are handled in separate systems. Sponsors of these 
clinical studies are encouraged to consult national guidance available via National Competent 
Authorities websites. 
The clinical study6 has to have the adequate design to fulfil the purpose of both legislations as 
intended. In administrative terms, the two regulatory pathways must be followed. 
Therefore, in relation to the device, Articles 62 or 82 of the MDR should be foreseen. 
 
17. 
According to the MDR, are usability tests considered clinical investigations? 
 
In the European standard EN 62366-125: 
• 
Usability is defined as the characteristic of the user interface that establishes 
effectiveness, efficiency, ease of user learning and user satisfaction in the intended 
use environment (section 3.16) 
o Note 1 to entry: All aspects of usability, including effectiveness, efficiency and 
user satisfaction, can either increase or decrease safety of a medical device. 
• 
Usability test is defined as a method for exploring or evaluating a user interface with 
intended users within a specified intended use environment (section 3.19) 
 
25 EN 62366-1 Medical devices - Part 1: Application of usability engineering to medical devices (IEC 
62366-1:2015) 


Medical Devices 
Medical Device Coordination Group Document                                      MDCG 2021-6 Rev. 1      
17 
 
• 
User interface is defined as the means by which the user and the medical device 
interact (section 3.26) 
o Note 1 to entry: Accompanying documentation is considered part of the medical 
device and its user interface.  
o Note 2 to entry: User interface includes all the elements of the medical device 
with which the user interacts including the physical aspects of the medical 
device as well as visual, auditory, tactile displays and is not limited to a software 
interface.  
o Note 3 to entry: For the purposes of this standard, a system of medical devices 
can be treated as a single user interface. 
• 
User is defined as person using, i.e. operating or handling, the medical device (section 
3.24) 
o Note 1 This includes, but is not limited to, cleaners, maintainers and installers. 
o Note 2 Patients or other laypersons can be users. 
• 
Use environment is actual conditions and setting in which users interact with the 
medical device (section 3.20) 
o Note 1 to entry: The conditions of use or attributes of the use environment can 
include hygienic requirements, frequency of use, location, lighting, noise, 
temperature, mobility, and degree of internationalization. 
Usability is created by characteristics of the user interface that facilitate use, i.e., to make it 
easier for the user to perceive information presented by the user interface, to understand and 
to make decisions based on that information, and to interact with the medical device to achieve 
specified goals in the intended use environments. Many of these factors can influence safety 
and performance26 to various extents. 
Manufacturers should document the usability of a medical device, and various types of usability 
test may be conducted for this purpose. Depending on the overall test design, usability testing 
may or may not fall under the definition of clinical investigation in Article 2(45) of the MDR 
(refer also to question 3).  
Factors to be considered when determining whether a usability test is also a clinical 
investigation should include the scope and purpose of testing, as well as how the human 
subjects are exposed to the device. Note that prototypes or parts of a future device may have 
a medical purpose which is evaluated in the usability test and they would thus be considered 
as investigational devices, whereby the test could be a clinical investigation, in particular when 
the usability test involves exposing users to risk related to the device or where poor usability 
may lead to patient or user safety risks. 
During device development it is recommended to design and conduct usability tests with limited 
human exposure to device related risks, in order to be able to adequately reduce the risks prior 
to the exposure to the device which is necessary for investigating device performance and/or 
safety in a subsequent clinical investigation.  
 
26 The words ”and performance” have been added vs the text in standard EN 62366-1 


Medical Devices 
Medical Device Coordination Group Document                                      MDCG 2021-6 Rev. 1      
18 
 
Manufacturers should document (as part of the technical documentation) their justification of 
why a particular usability test falls outside the definition of a clinical investigation if human 
subjects are involved.  
Typically, a usability test that fulfils the definition of clinical investigation falls under Article 62(1) 
of the MDR, but there may be situations where Article 82 of the MDR could be relevant. 
 
18. 
May a retrospective clinical study fall under the definition of a clinical investigation? 
 
A clinical investigation is defined in the MDR as “any systematic investigation involving one or 
more human subjects, undertaken to assess the safety or performance of a device”. In 
retrospective studies the involvement of human subjects and their exposure to the device 
precedes the study itself as data have already been generated. This implies that retrospective 
analysis of such data has no impact on patient management and the study does not introduce 
any additional risks for patients. The study may involve analysing ‘personal data’ which 
according to GDPR27 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural 
person (‘data subject’) but the study per se does not mean involving (exposing) human subjects 
to a device.  
If performance and/or safety of the device are analysed in the study retrospectively, separately 
from the decision to use the device, the study should not be considered as a clinical 
investigation according to the MDR, however there may be national provisions which need to 
be taken into consideration. 
Data from such studies may form part of the clinical evaluation in appropriate circumstances.  
 
19. 
When the objective of a clinical study is not specifically to evaluate a device, but the 
device is necessary for the purpose of the study (e.g. study of a physiological 
process, or a medical method or a surgical technique or rehabilitation technique) 
what  regulatory aspects related to the device must the sponsor take into account? 
 
Any device which is used for medical purposes as per Article 2(1) in research involving human 
subjects needs to comply with the requirements of the MDR that are applicable to it. 
This means that the device must be: 
• 
CE-marked according to MDD or AIMDD (have been acquired with a valid CE-marking), 
or 
• 
CE-marked according to the MDR, or 
• 
an “in house” device that fulfils the requirements of Article 5.5 in the MDR, or 
• 
custom made device compliant with Article 52(8) of the MDR or  
 
27 Article 4(1) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 
2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the 
free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) 


Medical Devices

19 
 
• 
an investigational device per Article 2(46) of the MDR used in a clinical investigation 
following the requirements outlined in either Article 62, 74 or 82 of the MDR.28  
For devices lacking CE-marking, the only option available may be to design the study as a 
clinical investigation of the device and seek the necessary approvals. Although the main 
research purpose might not be to study the performance and/or safety of the device, these 
could be made secondary objectives. National legislation may provide further options.  
Use of CE-marked devices outside their intended purpose in a clinical research setting should 
be carefully considered from a risk perspective, and may not always be appropriate, depending 
on the degree of deviation from the intended purpose stated by the manufacturer.  
 
20. 
Who is responsible for determining the correct regulatory pathway for a clinical 
investigation? 
 
It is the sponsor’s responsibility to determine the correct regulatory pathway for their clinical 
investigation. Guidance is provided in this document, but the MDR and national legislation 
contain the legally binding requirements.  
Note that the MDR introduces a requirement for manufacturers to have access to a Person 
Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (Article 15 of the MDR).  
Sponsors are encouraged to document their assessments and choices of regulatory pathways.  
If the sponsor is uncertain about which route to apply for a particular clinical investigation, the 
National Competent Authority may be consulted. 
 
21. 
What are the safety reporting requirements for clinical investigations? 
 
For clinical investigations conducted according to article 62.1 and 74.1 the requirements for 
safety reporting will depend on whether you are using the investigated device within its 
intended purpose: 
• 
If the investigated device is not CE marked, or is CE marked but will be used outside 
its intended purpose, the provisions on safety reporting laid down in Article 80 of the 
MDR shall apply. 
• 
If the investigated device is CE marked and will be used within its intended purpose, 
the provisions on vigilance laid down in Article 80(5-6) and Articles 87 to 90 of the MDR 
and the acts adopted pursuant to Article 91 of the MDR shall apply for PMCF 
investigations. 
Please refer to MDCG 2020-10/1 ‘Safety reporting in clinical investigations of medical devices 
under the Regulation (EU) 2017/745’ for further guidance29. 
 
28 Note that Member States may impose additional national requirements for clinical investigations 
falling under Article 82.

20 
 
Further, national CA websites should be consulted for national guidance on safety reporting, 
in particular for clinical investigations under article 82.  
 
 
22. 
Does a manufacturer of devices without a medical purpose included in Annex XVI of 
the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) have to conduct clinical investigations? 
 
To ensure the same level of protection of consumers for some products which could be similar 
to medical devices but without a medical purpose, devices described in Annex XVI to the MDR 
have to comply with the applicable general safety and performance requirements. Clinical 
evaluations of those products shall be based on relevant data concerning safety, including 
data from post-market surveillance, PMCF, and, where applicable, specific clinical 
investigations. Clinical investigations shall be performed for those products unless reliance on 
existing clinical data from an analogous medical device is duly justified30. Please refer to 
MDCG 2020-5 Clinical Evaluation – Equivalence, section 4 (f) for further guidance31. 
 
23. 
What procedure applies for clinical investigations of custom-made devices or in-
house manufactured devices? 
 
Custom-made devices are defined in Article 2(3) of the MDR.  
In-house manufacturing, modifying and use of devices within health institutions is provided for 
in Article 5(5) of the MDR.  
The relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I of the MDR apply 
to both of these device types. As such, clinical investigations may be undertaken with respect 
to these device types, and they may fall under Article 62 or 82. See Annex I of this document 
for further information. 
 
24. 
Are coordinated assessment procedures in accordance with Article 78 of the 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) available? 
 
For the time being, no coordinated procedure is available. When EUDAMED will be available 
and provide the functionality for applications under Article 78 of the MDR, some Member States 
will contribute to a voluntary test to start a co-ordinated assessment of multi-national studies.

26. 
What documents do I have to submit for a clinical investigation that follows article 
74(1) of the MDR? 
 
Article 74(1) of the MDR points out that the same documentation has to be provided with a 
notification as for an application, see chapter II in Annex XV of the MDR.  
The guidance document MDCG 2021-08 on clinical investigation application/notification 
documents35 provides templates for clinical investigation application/notification created to 
support clinical investigation procedures with respect to the MDR. In addition, it is necessary 
to visit the website of the relevant competent authority in the country where the clinical 
investigation is to be conducted, to check national requirements regarding the notification 
content. 
 
27. 
What documents do I have to submit for a clinical investigation that follows article 82 
of the MDR? 
 
Article 82 states minimum requirements for those clinical investigations that are not performed 
pursuant to any of the purposes listed in Article 62(1). These clinical investigations shall comply 
with the provisions of Article 62 (2) and (3), points (b), (c), (d), (f), (h), and (l) of Article 62(4) 
and Article 62(6).  
It is not possible to provide general guidance on submission requirements for these studies, 
as the submission requirements for studies according to Article 82 of the MDR are subject to 
national provisions. Thus, it is necessary to check the website of the relevant competent 
authority and/or the relevant ethics committee in the country where the clinical investigation is 
to be conducted, to obtain information on national requirements.

28. 
What is the expected content of the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)? 
 
The purpose of the IB is to provide the investigators with sufficient data on safety and 
performance of the investigational device, from pre-clinical testing or clinical investigations to 
justify human exposure to the investigational device.  
Section 2 in chapter II of Annex XV of the MDR lists the required content of the IB.  In addition, 
it is recommended that the annex B of ISO 14155:202033 is adhered to.  
For further guidance, consult MDCG document “Detailed guidance on content of the

Investigation Plan for clinical investigations of medical devices”. 
 
Modifications to clinical investigations 
 
30. 
How is a substantial modification defined? 
 
A substantial modification of a clinical investigation is a change to the clinical investigation which 
is likely to have a substantial impact on the safety or health or rights of the subject, or on the 
robustness or reliability of clinical data generated by the investigation. Modifications of the clinical 
investigation plan (CIP), investigators brochure (IB), the subject information sheet and other 
clinical investigation documentation may or may not be considered as substantial modifications.  
Sponsors should also take into consideration the fact that some modifications may seriously 
impact the design or scientific outcome of the clinical investigation and may require the 
initiation of a new clinical investigation.  
The procedure to notify a substantial modification is further described in Article 75 of the MDR. 
A non-exhaustive list of modifications that may be interpreted as substantial can be found in 
Annex II of this document.

It is the sponsor’s responsibility to determine if the modification is substantial or not. However, 
if the sponsor is uncertain about the impact for a particular modification of a clinical 
investigation, the National Competent Authority may be consulted prior notification. 
 
31. 
When can a sponsor submit a substantial modification notification? 
 
A notification of substantial modification may be submitted in accordance with Article 75 of the 
MDR36 as soon as a clinical investigation is allowed to commence in accordance with the MDR.  
Moreover, it is not recommended to submit a substantial modification while assessment of an 
already submitted substantial modification is still ongoing. It is also important to consider 
whether national procedures may apply regarding modifications to clinical investigations.37  
 
32. 
Is a change to the investigational device to be considered as a substantial 
modification to the clinical investigation or does it lead to the submission of a new 
clinical investigation application? 
 
In general, a change to the investigational device is a substantial modification of the clinical 
investigation. As an example, a change to the device which alters the risk profile or adds new 
risks is likely to have a substantial impact on the safety or health or rights of the subject and, 
thus, is a substantial modification. 
Some modifications to the investigational device are so extensive in nature that a new clinical 
investigation should be applied for. Modifications to the device which alter the suitability of the 
clinical investigation design to provide evidence for the safety, performance or clinical benefit 
of the device, may result in refusal of the modification and the submission of a new clinical 
investigation application may be required.  
In order for the data resulting from a clinical investigation to be relevant for a certain device, in 
a situation where several versions of the device have been used during the clinical 
investigation, the aspect of equivalence may need to be considered.  
MDCG 2020-5 provides guidance on equivalence in relation to clinical evaluation. This 
guidance may support sponsors in determining whether a modification of a device could be 
done within the same clinical investigation, or if a new clinical investigation application should 
be submitted. Member States will assess on a case-by-case basis if a change to the 
investigational device alters the suitability of the clinical investigation design to provide 
evidence for the safety, performance or clinical benefit of the device. If the modified 
investigational device is not equivalent to that one object of the initial application, according to 
MDCG 2020-5, a new clinical investigation may be required.

33. 
According to Article 75 of the MDR, if a sponsor intends to introduce modifications to 
a clinical investigation which are substantial, the sponsor has to notify the Member 
State within ‘one week’. From which point in time does this ‘one week’ start? 
 
The ‘one week’ period starts from the date when the relevant documents (such as clinical 
investigation plan, investigator brochure, subject information sheet and informed consent form) 
are issued in an updated version.  
It is acknowledged that changes to e.g. a CIP may require subsequent changes to other 
documents such as patient information, and that these changes may be done on a different 
date. Such changes can be collected and submitted together when the last affected document 
is issued but note that the implementation of the changes to the clinical investigation can not 
be done until the deadline in Article 75 of the MDR has expired or an authorisation letter is 
issued by the Competent Authority and/or Ethics Committee if this is required according to 
national provisions. 
 
34. 
Can the sponsor start to implement the substantial modification after 38 days of the 
notification date to the Member State?  
 
Yes, if the sponsor has not heard from the Member State after 38 days the substantial 
modification may be implemented, provided that an Ethics Committee in that Member State 
has not issued a negative opinion in relation to the substantial modification. This 38-day period, 
which starts when all the relevant documentation with clearly identifiable changes have been 
submitted in their entirety, may be extended by a further 7 days in order to consult with experts. 
Member States will notify the sponsor if such a consultation is taking place. The substantial 
modification can be implemented sooner if the Member State has authorised the substantial 
modification.  
If the Member State has sent a request for information, there may be, depending on national 
provisions, a clock-stop, as long as the Member State has not received the additional 
information. 
Further, the sponsor needs to ensure that updated documents in relation to a substantial 
modification are submitted to both the Competent Authority and the Ethics committee where 
required. Note that there may be national provisions in place regarding e.g. the notification 
and review of substantial modifications to Ethics committees.   
 
35. 
What notification requirements apply to non-substantial modifications?  
 
Article 75 of the MDR does not describe how sponsors or authorities shall deal with non-
substantial modifications. Once EUDAMED is available, sponsors are expected to keep the 
information in the database up to date in accordance with Article 70(2) of the MDR. However, 
in the absence of EUDAMED Member States have not yet harmonised their approach, and it 
is thus necessary to check the national requirements.  
Note that there may be national provisions in place regarding e.g. the notification and review 
of non-substantial modifications to Ethics committees.

Timeline considerations for clinical investigations 
 
36. 
Which date is considered as the start of the clinical investigation?  
 
Reporting of the clinical investigation start date is not explicitly required by the MDR, but in 
some Member States it is required by national legislation to report this to the relevant Authority.  
Further, the start date of a clinical investigation should be indicated in EUDAMED (once 
available) to disseminate relevant information to the public and for Competent Authority 
inspection planning purposes. The start date of a clinical investigation should be described in 
the clinical investigation plan. In general it is considered to be, the first act of recruitment in the 
clinical investigation in a Member State. The first act of recruitment should be specified by the 
sponsor and could be, for example, the date of initiation of the clinical investigation in the first 
site or the date when the first investigation-specific advertisement is published. In any case the 
clinical investigation cannot start earlier than the authorisation date (or commencement date 
notified for PMCF clinical investigations) or not later than the date recruitment starts. 
 
37. 
Which date is considered as the end date of a clinical investigation? 
 
As stated in Article 77(2) of the MDR, the end of a clinical investigation shall be deemed to 
coincide with the last visit of the last subject unless another point in time for such end is set 
out in the clinical investigation plan (for example site closure occurring after the last visit of the 
last subject).  
 
38. 
Does the sponsor have to notify the end of the clinical investigation when it is 
concluded in one or more Member States, or when the overall clinical investigation is 
completed globally?  
 
According to Article 77(3) of the MDR the sponsor shall notify each Member State in which a 
clinical investigation was being conducted of the end of that clinical investigation in that 
Member State. That notification shall be made within 15 days of the end of the clinical 
investigation in relation to that Member State. 
If a clinical investigation is conducted in more than one Member State the sponsor shall also 
notify all Member States in which that clinical investigation was conducted when the clinical 
investigation is completed in all Member States. That notification shall be made within 15 days 
of the end of the clinical investigation in the last Member State. 
If the clinical investigation is still ongoing in one or more third countries when the end of the 
clinical investigation in the EU is reported, this will impact the sponsor’s ability to provide a 
clinical investigation report of the overall study (i.e. fulfil the reporting requirements of Article 
77(5) of the MDR). Therefore, the sponsor should inform the concerned Member States of the 
expected end of study globally if this does not coincide with the end of study in the EU. 
Sponsors are encouraged to notify the Member States concerned to confirm the actual end of 
study globally, once reached.

27 
 
39. 
When does the sponsor have to notify an early termination of a clinical investigation?  
 
In case a clinical investigation is temporarily halted or terminated early, the sponsor has to 
inform the Member State concerned within 15 days, or within 24 hours if based on safety 
grounds. This reporting timeline should be counted from the sponsor’s decision to 
halt/terminate the clinical investigation.  
In case of restart after temporarily halted study, a notification will be made to the CA. In case 
of temporarily halt on safety grounds, this notification should be submitted as a substantial 
modification. 
Note that if inclusion of new subjects is halted in a country before the expected number of 
subjects in that Member State was reached, and this is due to the achieved recruitment of 
the total number of subjects globally, this is not considered as early termination. 
 
40. 
When does the sponsor have to submit the clinical investigation report with the 
results?  
 
Irrespective of the outcome of the clinical investigation, within one year of the global end of the 
clinical investigation the sponsor shall submit to all the Member States in which a clinical 
investigation was conducted a clinical investigation report as referred to in Section 2.8 of 
Chapter I and Section 7 of Chapter III of Annex XV to the MDR.  
Following a decision of an early termination or temporary halt, a clinical investigation report is 
required to be submitted within 3 months to all Member States in which the clinical investigation 
was conducted. Sponsors are expected to submit a risk analysis concerning any safety 
grounds related to the temporary halt.  
In the event that the clinical investigation is restarted within three months of the temporary halt, 
the sponsor does not have to submit a clinical investigation report until the clinical investigation 
has been completed. The final clinical investigation report should include detail with respect to 
the temporary halt.  
 
41. 
For how long must study documentation be retained? 
 
It is stated in section 3 chapter III (covering sponsor’s obligations) in Annex XV of the MDR 
that the documentation mentioned in annex XV shall be kept for a period of at least 10 years 
after the clinical investigation with the device in question has ended, or, in the event that the 
device is subsequently placed on the market, at least 10 years after the last device has been 
placed on the market. In the case of implantable devices, the period shall be at least 15 
years. 
Note that the phrase ‘placed on the market’ refers to each single individual device, i.e. the 
reference is to the last individual device transferred from the manufacturer to another party.38 
This means that in practice documentation has to be stored for an extended period of time.  
 
38 This is eluded from the Blue Guide

Clinical investigation reports 
 
42. 
What shall be the content of the clinical investigation report? 
 
The minimum requirements for content of the clinical investigation report (which will be made 
public according to Article 77 of the MDR) are defined in Chapter III point 7 of Annex XV to the 
MDR. The standard ISO 14155:2020, Annex D also has information which is relevant regarding 
the content of a clinical investigation report.  
It is important to note that the summary of serious adverse events, adverse device effects and 
device deficiencies should only present aggregated information related to these events. 
Descriptions of single events or line listings with direct or indirect personal data may jeopardise 
subject privacy and should be avoided in a report which will be made public.  
To put the information that is required (minimum content) in a relevant context and enhance 
the understanding of the clinical investigation report, sponsors are encouraged to also include 
the following information in the report:   
Clinical investigation background  
Presentation of the context and reasons for conducting the clinical investigation. 
Outcome measures 
Description of the selected outcome measures and their relevance for the assessment of safety 
and performance of the investigational device. 
Clinical investigation conduct  
• 
Include information on the dates defining the periods of recruitment and follow-up of subjects 
in order to describe the time period during which the clinical investigation was conducted. 
• 
Interventions: Precise details of the interventions intended for each group and how and 
when they were actually administered should be included in the report. State the 
precise dose (if relevant), treatment duration, control interventions and additional 
treatment for each of the groups. 
Clinical investigation subjects  
Baseline data (baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of each group) should be 
included. Also describe the flow of subjects through each stage (diagram, if appropriate). 
For each group the numbers of subjects randomly assigned, receiving intended treatment, 
completing the clinical investigation, and analysed for the primary outcome should be stated. 
Indicate the number of subjects in each group which have been included in each analysis and 
whether the analysis was by "intention-to-treat" or “per protocol”. 
Deviations and amendments 
Deviations from the initial clinical investigation plan and a description of any CIP amendments 
should be described and justified.

43. 
Is there a template for the mandatory summary of the clinical investigation report 
referred to in article 77(5) of the MDR? 
 
Yes, refer to the Commission Guidance on the content and structure of the summary of the 
clinical investigation report (2023/C 163/06)39. 
 
Arrangements for the transitional period 
 
44. 
When will EUDAMED allow applications for clinical investigation? 
 
The use of EUDAMED for Clinical Investigation and Performance Studies becomes 
mandatory at the end of the 6 months transitional period after the publication of a notice in 
the Official Journal of the European Union that EUDAMED has achieved full functionality 
following the outcome of an independent audit. It will not be possible to submit applications 
via EUDAMED before it is mandatory to use. 
Link to the EUDAMED: https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed  
 
45. 
Until the clinical investigation module in EUDAMED is ready, how can the sponsor 
comply with the MDR? 
 
Clinical investigation sponsors will not have the opportunity to register as actors in EUDAMED 
as of the date of application of the MDR, nor to submit applications or notifications via 
EUDAMED. 
To submit an application: 
All requested information to apply for or notify a clinical investigation should be submitted to 
the national competent authorities unless otherwise specified in the MS concerned. Check with 
the relevant National Competent Authority which system will be used for submission. 
 
The Commission has a listing of the contact details for National Competent Authorities, which 
is available at:

To fulfil the safety reporting requirements of the MDR Article 80: 
Please see MDCG 2020-10/1 ‘Safety reporting in clinical investigations of medical devices 
under the Regulation (EU) 2017/745’ for guidance.

46. 
What will happen to those clinical investigations that started prior to the date of 
application of Regulation (EU) 2017/745? 
 
Clinical investigation that are currently being conducted with respect to Directive 93/42/EC and 
Directive 90/385/EC by the date of application of the MDR, can continue to be conducted. 
Nevertheless, serious adverse events (SAEs) and device deficiencies occurring after the date 
of application of the MDR, shall be notified to the MS according to the rules defined in Article 
80 of the MDR. 
  
To facilitate the transition and give time for sponsors to update Clinical Investigation Plans and 
procedures in clinical investigations a sponsor may continue to report all SAEs to National 
Competent Authorities until Eudamed reporting is mandatory. This applies only to studies 
which have started to be conducted in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 90/385/EEC or 
Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC prior to 26 May 2021. Please refer to MDCG 2020-10/1 
‘Safety reporting in clinical investigations of medical devices under the Regulation (EU) 
2017/745’ for further guidance. 
 
47. 
How should Article 120(11) of the MDR be interpreted – when is a clinical investigation 
to be considered started to be conducted in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 
90/385/EEC or Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC? 
 
As national interpretations and implementation of the directives in national legislation may 
differ between Member States, please check with the national competent authority in the 
Member State where the clinical investigation is to be conducted as to what they consider as 
started/starting date. 
 
Legal representative 
 
48. 
What is the role and responsibility of the sponsor’s legal representative? 
 
In article 62(2) of the MDR it is stated that: Where the sponsor of a clinical investigation is not 
established in the Union, that sponsor shall ensure that a natural or legal person is established 
in the Union as its legal representative
40
. Such legal representative shall be responsible for 
ensuring compliance with the sponsor's obligations
 pursuant to this regulation, and shall be 
the addressee for all communications with the sponsor provided for in this Regulation. Any 
communication with that legal representative shall be deemed to be a communication with the 
sponsor. 
 

| 40 Article 62(2) of the MDR allows | Member States to choose not to apply the requirement for sponsors |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| to have a legal representative in clinical investigations to be conducted solely on their territory, or on |  |  |
| their territory and the territory of a third country, provided that they ensure that the sponsor establishes |  |  |
| at least a contact person on their territory in respect of that clinical investigation who shall be the |  |  |
| addressee for all communications with the sponsor. |  |  |

31 
 
Per the Regulation, the legal representative is responsible for ensuring compliance with the 
sponsor’s obligations pursuant to the MDR. It is not foreseen that this responsibility can be 
delegated back to the sponsor, nor to a CRO.  
It is recommended that the sponsor issues a study specific power of attorney to the designated 
legal representative.  
In order to enable the legal representative to ensure compliance with the sponsor’s obligations 
under the MDR it is recommended that a contract between the parties obliges  
- the sponsor to provide the legal representative with all required information and  
- the legal representative to immediately notify the sponsor in case (s)he becomes aware 
of any noncompliance with the Regulation. 
If tasks are delegated by a legal representative to another legal or natural person, the 
responsibility to ensure compliance with the MDR still resides with the legal representative.  
Any delegation of tasks related to sponsor’s obligations must be done in compliance with 
chapter III of annex XV to the MDR. If the contract(s) between the sponsor and other entities 
are related to the compliance of the sponsor’s duties according to the MDR, it is also the 
responsibility of the legal representative to ensure that these duties are well covered by the 
other entities. 
It is acknowledged that responsibilities and tasks contracted to the legal representative may 
expand beyond the legal requirements of the MDR, which is a business decision between the 
parties. In situations where the legal representative also functions as a CRO, it is 
recommended that the agreement between the sponsor and the CRO clearly defines what 
responsibilities are assigned in terms of the legal representative capacity and what tasks are 
assigned to the CRO capacity.  
 
49. 
How should a legal representative check the sponsor’s compliance with the MDR?  
 
The legal representative is responsible for ensuring compliance with the sponsor’s obligations 
pursuant to the MDR. The MDR does not specify how a legal representative fulfils the legal 
obligations. 
The legal representative may perform audits of the sponsor and its subcontractor(s), or check 
compliance by other means, according to prior agreement.  
The legal representative would need permanent and integral availability and access to the 
technical documentation of the investigated device and clinical investigation documentation, in 
order to be able to ensure that this information has been drawn up and complies with the MDR.  
For the legal representative it would be necessary to be aware of specific aspects of the clinical 
investigation, i.e. not only to check the availability of procedures on a general level., in order 
to be able to ensure that the clinical investigation is compliant with the MDR in practice.  
It is necessary that the legal representative verifies, in parallel and/or in addition to the sponsor, 
all relevant documentation and keeps records of the verification activities performed. This 
verification is included in the legal representative’s responsibility for ensuring compliance with 
the sponsor's obligations pursuant to the MDR.

32 
 
However, this does not mean that the legal representative replaces the sponsor with regard to 
its obligations expressed in Chapter III, Annex XV, nor does it mean a participation in the 
evaluation/review of the data of each document. 
 
50. 
Would it be sufficient that the legal representative is able to provide documents from 
the sponsor upon request by authorities?  
 
It is expected that the legal representative has permanent and unlimited access to the complete 
and up-to-date investigation master file including, but not limited to, contracts and financial 
arrangements related to the clinical investigation, evidence that the investigational sites and 
other participating entities and persons are appropriately qualified, relevant communication 
which can support the demonstration of compliance of sponsor’s duties according to the MDR, 
monitoring reports and SAE reports. It should be specified in the contractual agreement 
between the sponsor and the legal representative how this is achieved.  
Note that it is clearly stated in section 3, chapter III, Annex XV of the MDR that the 
documentation should be kept at the disposal of the competent authorities, even if the sponsor 
goes bankrupt or ceases its activity prior to the end of the specified retention period.  
Further, sponsors and legal representatives should also consider the fact that securing storage 
on EEA and Türkiye territory may be critical in the event that something happens to the 
sponsor’s documentation.
