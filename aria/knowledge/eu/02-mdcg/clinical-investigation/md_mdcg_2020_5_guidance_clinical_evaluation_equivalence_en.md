1. Introduction
This guidance document is not legally binding. It has been put together following
contribution from national competent authorities, industry and relevant stakeholders
and it should therefore be recognised as best practice.
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices 1, hereafter referred to as the MDR
(medical device regulation), provides a possibility to use clinical data related to an
equivalent device in the clinical evaluation required for a device under conformity
assessment2.
Whilst carrying out a clinical investigation is the most direct way to generate clinical
data concerning the safety and performance of medical devices for the purpose of CE
marking, clinical data can also be sourced from3
 clinical investigation(s) or other studies reported in scientific literature, of a
device for which equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated,
 reports published in peer reviewed scientific literature on other clinical
experience of either the device in question or a device for which equivalence to
the device in question can be demonstrated
Equivalence shall be demonstrated according to the MDR requirements 4.
The European Commission has published a guide on clinical evaluation under the
directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC; MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 5. This MEDDEV guide
should be used also during the process of demonstrating equivalence under the MDR.
However, it has been recognised that some of the requirements set out in MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4 are not fully aligned with the MDR and that further guidance to address the
differences would be of benefit to industry and other stakeholders. Only the text of the
MDR is legally binding. In cases of divergence between the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, this
MDCG guidance and the MDR, the MDR shall take precedence.
This MDCG guidance does not introduce any new requirements.
The demonstration of equivalence does not remove the requirement to always conduct
a clinical evaluation in accordance with the MDR. It is the demonstration of
equivalence6 that allows the manufacturer to let clinical data from an equivalent device
enter the clinical evaluation process of the device in question for the purpose of
confirmation of conformity with relevant general safety and performance

equivalent device8 to include in the process of clinical evaluation.
2. Scope
This MDCG guidance covers the demonstration of equivalence, based on data
pertaining to an already existing device on the market9, for the purpose of CE-marking
under the MDR.
One of the purposes of this document is to highlight the differences between the MDR
and the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.4 specifically with regards to equivalence. It is also
intended to provide additional guidance and support a harmonised approach to the
demonstration of equivalence across the EU.
In addition, non-exhaustive guidance and references have been provided with respect
to device considerations for medical devices incorporating an ancillary medicinal
product.
This MDCG guidance also covers products without an intended medical purpose listed
in Annex XVI of the MDR.
3. Equivalence
The MDR requires10 that technical, biological and clinical characteristics are
considered when demonstrating equivalence to another device. Whilst these general
characteristics are described in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 Appendix 1 and are aligned
with the MDR requirement, there are differences in the criteria that are set out for each
of the three characteristics. Differences in criteria between the MDR and the MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev. 4 are highlighted below and are accompanied by some explanatory text.
3.1

Technical characteristics

MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3)
The device is of similar design;
is used under similar conditions of use;
has similar specifications and properties including
physicochemical properties such as intensity of
energy, tensile strength, viscosity, surface
characteristics, wavelength and software
algorithms;
uses similar deployment methods, where relevant;
has similar principles of operation and critical
performance requirements.

MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev 4, Appendix A1
- be of similar design, and
- used under the same conditions of use, and
- have similar specifications and properties (e.g.
physicochemical properties such as type and intensity
of energy, tensile strength, viscosity, surface
characteristics, wavelength,
surface texture, porosity, particle size, nanotechnology,
specific mass, atomic inclusions such as
nitrocarburising, oxidability), and
- use similar deployment methods (if relevant), and
- have similar principles of operation and critical
performance requirements

section 4 (d) and (e) in this document for further guidance.

MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3).

Page 5 of 20

(a) The MDR requires that technical characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence including that the device in
question and the device presumed to be equivalent are “used under similar
conditions of use”. MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, however, specifies use under the
same conditions with regard to technical characteristics 11. The conditions of use
shall be similar to the extent that there would be no clinically significant
difference in the safety and clinical performance between the device in question
and the device presumed to be equivalent. For further guidance on the
assessment of ‘similar’, see also section 4 of this document.
(b) Different examples are given for specifications and properties of the device
when considering technical characteristics across the two definitions. These are
examples only and are to be considered as such. They must not be interpreted
as an exhaustive list of specifications and properties of technical characteristics
when considering equivalence to another device. Note however that the MDR
specifically points out that software algorithms shall be similar in the device
presumed to be equivalent. This includes software algorithms in software driving
or influencing the use of a device, and in software intended to be used alone 12.
It is the functional principle of the software algorithm, as well as the clinical
performance(s) and intended purpose(s) of the software algorithm, that shall be
considered when demonstrating the equivalence of a software algorithm. It is
not reasonable to demand that equivalence is demonstrated for the software
code, provided it has been developed in line with international standards for
safe design and validation13 of medical device software.
Software solely intended for the configuration of a device (e.g. presentation on
a graphical user interface etc), and not related to any medical purpose14 (e.g.
diagnosis, treatment etc), does not need to be similar when considering
equivalence as long as it can be justified to not negatively affect the usability,
safety or clinical performance.
3.2

Biological characteristics

MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3)
The device uses the same materials or substances in
contact with the same human tissues or body fluids
for a similar kind and duration of contact and
similar release characteristics of substances,
including degradation products and leachables

MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1
Use the same materials or substances in contact with
the same human tissues or body fluids.
Exceptions can be foreseen for devices in contact
with intact skin and minor components of devices; in
these cases risk analysis results may allow the use of
similar materials taking into account the role and
nature of the similar material.

11

“Conditions of use” with regard to technical characteristics may e.g. be environmental factors such as
magnetic fields, temperature, moisture, conditions during transport of device in use etc.
See section 3.3 in this document regarding use for the same clinical condition or purpose.

(a) Manufacturers must consider the additional text in the MDR and adequately
specify all applicable characteristics. The exceptions, outlined in the MEDDEV
2.7/1 rev 4, to not use the same materials are NOT acceptable under the MDR.
The MDR requires that biological characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, i.e. the device uses the
same materials or substances in contact with the same human tissues or body
fluids for a similar kind and duration of contact, and with similar release
characteristics of substances, including degradation products and leachables,
as the presumed equivalent device. The distinction between “same materials or
substances” and “similar release characteristics of substances” is made to
account for the fact that processing, design and the use environment may
introduce small changes even when the raw materials are the same.
Processing can make materials more susceptible to degradation by changing
properties of the material and/or by inducing different stresses. For example,
small changes in pH or oxidative stress can increase or decrease release
characteristics. For this reason, it is the final device that shall be assessed.
(b) The principles outlined in ISO 10993 series of standards for the biological
evaluation of medical devices can be adopted, in particular the ISO 10993-1 for
a risk-based approach to biological evaluation15 and also for material
characterization.
In addition, the ISO 10993-18 which covers chemical characterization of
materials can be adopted to specify the identity of materials and to estimate the
type and quantity of leachables from the final device. Annex C of this standard
addresses biological equivalence. The ISO 10993-17 includes principles on the
toxicological risk assessment of leachables. Leachables may include
degradation products or other substances from the materials or substances that
the device is made of, but also other constituents for example residuals from
the manufacturing process or sterilisation, any contaminations etc. Therefore,
for the consideration of equivalence, it is the properties and characteristics of
the final device that shall be taken into account.
For degradable materials, ISO 10993, Parts 13, 14 and 15 address the
identification and quantification of degradation products. Note, that there may
be further parts in the ISO 10993 series of standards that are relevant for the
device in question.
(c) The MDR has additional requirements16 for devices that are composed of
substances or of combinations of substances that are intended to be
introduced into the human body, and that are absorbed by or locally dispersed
15

ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, and collateral standards in the 10993 series.

in the human body. For the consideration of equivalence, the substances shall
be the same.
Those devices are not medicinal products, but for the conformity assessment
they shall comply with the relevant requirements laid down in Annex I to
Directive 2001/83/EC17 for the evaluation of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion, local tolerance, toxicity, interaction with other devices,
medicinal products or other substances and potential for adverse reactions. This
means that for the demonstration of equivalence under the MDR, those aspects
shall also be taken into consideration.
Note that the requirement 18 that the notified body shall seek a scientific opinion
from a competent authority for medicinal products or the EMA, for the device or
its products of metabolism, that are systemically absorbed by the human body
in order to achieve their intended purpose, on the compliance with the relevant
requirements laid down in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, always applies for
the device under evaluation even if equivalence has been demonstrated under
the MDR.
(d) The demonstration of equivalence may also concern medical devices with an
ancillary medicinal substance, for example drug-eluting stents or heparinbonded central venous catheters.
The MDR requires19 that biological characteristics shall be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, including that the device in
question and the device presumed to be equivalent, use “the same materials or
substances in contact with the same human tissues or body fluids”. This applies
also to the medicinal substance and any related excipients/coatings.
Excipients/coatings may potentially have a significant effect for example on the
release characteristics of the medicinal substance intended only for a local
effect from a stent, and thereby a significant effect on the clinical performance.
In all cases, concerning the device under evaluation, the notified body shall20
 verify the usefulness of the substance as part of the device, taking
account of the intended purpose of the device, and
 seek a scientific opinion from a competent authority for medicinal
products or the EMA to ensure that the quality, safety and benefit/risk of
using the ancillary medicinal product, including whether the
manufacturing process have been adequately assessed.

Note that medical devices with an ancillary medicinal substance are class III
devices21. In cases where a manufacturer intends to claim equivalence to a
device not manufactured by him, the MDR requires that the two manufacturers
have a contract in place that explicitly allows the manufacturer of the second
device full access to the technical documentation on an ongoing basis22 .
Manufacturers cannot claim equivalence of a device with an ancillary medicinal
substance to a device without an ancillary medicinal substance and vice versa.
For example, the manufacturer of a heparin coated catheter shall not claim
equivalence to a drug-free catheter even if both catheters are otherwise
identical23 . See also section 4 of this document.
Similarly, manufacturers shall not claim equivalence of the ancillary medicinal
substance to a ‘standalone’ medicinal substance.
3.3

Clinical characteristics
MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3)

MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1

The device is used for the same clinical condition or
purpose, including similar severity and stage of
disease, at the same site in the body, in a similar
population, including as regards age, anatomy and
physiology;
has the same kind of user;
has similar relevant critical performance in view of the
expected clinical effect for a specific intended
purpose.

- used for the same clinical condition (including when
applicable similar severity and stage of disease, same
medical indication), and
- used for the same intended purpose, and
- used at the same site in the body, and
- used in a similar population (this may relate to age,
gender, anatomy, physiology, possibly other aspects),
and
- not foreseen to deliver significantly different
performances (in the relevant critical performances such
as the expected clinical effect, the specific intended
purpose, the duration of use, etc.)

(a) The MDR additionally requires that, for manufacturers to compare clinical
characteristics, the device shall have the same kind of user. The MDR clearly
points out that a user means any healthcare professional or lay person who
uses a device24, and that a lay person means an individual who does not have
formal education in a relevant field of healthcare or medical discipline25.
Manufacturers must therefore take into consideration whether the intended
user’s competence or knowledge can have any implication for the safety, clinical
performance and outcome when considering equivalence between the device
in question and the presumed equivalent device. For example, a device
intended for professional use and a device intended for home use, but for the
same clinical condition or purpose, may have a different safety and performance
profile due to the environment in which they are intended to be used.

(b) The MDR does not explicitly state that the medical device needs to be used for
the same medical indication, gender and duration of use as the equivalent
device. However, it is understood that in general, this is covered by the MDR
requirement that both devices should be used for the same clinical condition
or purpose including similar severity and stage of disease and also have similar
relevant critical performance which is also outlined in the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4.
This is supported by the definitions in the MDR of the ‘intended purpose’ 26, and
the ability of the device to achieve its intended purpose by the ‘clinical
performance’27 including measurable ‘clinical benefit’28.
4. Demonstration of equivalence
MDR, Annex XIV Part A (3)
The characteristics listed in the first paragraph shall be
similar to the extent that there would be no clinically
significant difference in the safety and clinical
performance of the device. Considerations of
equivalence shall be based on proper scientific
justification.

MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, Appendix A1
For assuming equivalence,
- all three characteristics (clinical, technical, biological)
need to be fulfilled;
- similar means that no clinically significant difference
in the performance and safety of the device would be
triggered by the differences between the device under
evaluation and the device presumed to be equivalent.

There are a number of prerequisites that shall be fulfilled for the demonstration of
equivalence:
(a) The overall considerations of equivalence shall conclude whether the listed
technical, biological and clinical characteristics in the MDR29 are similar to the
extent that there would be no clinically significant difference in the safety and
clinical performance of the device. Note that some of the listed characteristics
in the MDR shall be the same, not only similar. The corresponding wording from
MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 is presented for information above. Consideration must
be given to the characteristics mentioned above and a gap analysis should be
conducted by the manufacturer to evaluate any clinically significant
difference(s).
Modifications30 of a device may be implemented for a variety of reasons. If the
differences have been introduced to address specific safety and/or performance
issues it shall be duly justified, that there would be no clinically significant
difference in the safety and clinical performance other than the intended
improvements related to the specific issue that triggered the modification /
difference. For all modifications and concomitant claims of equivalence, there
must be no additional risks or potential of negatively altered performance related
to the introduced modifications.

See a template example of an Equivalence table in the Annex I of this document.
A manufacturer of a medical device shall not claim equivalence to a product
without an intended medical purpose listed in the MDR Annex XVI.
(b) Manufacturers may identify more than one equivalent device to the device under
evaluation, but each device shall be equivalent to the device under evaluation
in all the listed technical, biological and clinical characteristics 31. Equivalence to
each device shall be fully investigated, described and demonstrated in the
clinical evaluation report.
This means that manufacturers shall not use different parts of different devices
to claim equivalence to the device under evaluation. The MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4
is in line with this approach.
In exceptional cases, a deviation from this principle may be considered. There
may be device systems comprised of several more or less “stand alone”
devices, where it may be justified to consider equivalence of a device in the
system to a presumed equivalent device in a device system already on the
market (by the same manufacturer) provided that all technical, biological and
clinical characteristics are same/similar32, and that the devices in the system do
not affect the safety and performance of each other. This should be duly
investigated and documented both on the level of potential interference between
the devices in the system, as well as on the overall safety and clinical
performance of the device system.
(c) Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MDR requires 33 that the manufacturer
shall specify and justify the level of clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate
conformity with the relevant general safety and performance requirements. That
level of clinical evidence shall be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the
device and its intended purpose34. In addition, considerations of equivalence
shall be based on proper scientific justification 35.
This implies that technical, biological and clinical characteristics shall be duly
investigated and documented. The manufacturer is expected to fully identify and
disclose any differences between the two devices.
Pre-clinical data for the consideration of equivalence should allow a scientifically
sound evaluation of technical and biological characteristics. Examples of data
sources:

device
(specifications,
test-results,
chemical/physical/biological
analyses,
data
from
pre-clinical
investigations etc)
 data published in the scientific literature, e.g. animal or other pre-clinical
data
The assessment of whether any differences in characteristics would result in
clinically significant difference in safety and clinical performance shall also be
duly substantiated and based on proper scientific justification. This assessment
may be supported by e.g. clinical data from the scientific literature, common
specifications (CS)36, harmonised standards or other established technical
specifications.
Furthermore, for the assessment of safety, a risk-based approach37 is expected,
both for the identification of characteristics that may affect safety as well as for
the final assessment of equivalence regarding safety.
It is important for the consideration of equivalence that pre-clinical data and any
clinical data relate to the actual device under evaluation, and to a defined
generation/version of the actual device considered for equivalence, bearing in
mind that there may be significant differences between different generations of
the other device.
If a manufacturer is not able to demonstrate sufficient levels of access to the
data38 relating to the presumed equivalent device and needed for the
consideration of equivalence, equivalence claims cannot be made for the
purpose of conformity assessment.
(d) The MDR notes specific requirements in addition to the demonstration of
equivalence in order not to perform a clinical investigation which must be taken
into account.
A manufacturer of implantable devices and class III devices shall perform
clinical investigations except if the device has been designed by modifications
of a device already marketed by the same manufacturer and equivalence can
be demonstrated according to the MDR39. In this context, a marketed device is
considered to be a device already placed on the market and CE marked with
respect to either the MDR or the directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC. The CE
marking should still be valid, should be based on an updated clinical evaluation,
and the benefit/risk ratio for this device should be favourable.

For a manufacturer of implantable devices and class III devices claiming
equivalence to an already marketed device not manufactured by him, in
addition to the requirements in MDR Article 61(4), the manufacturer must have
a contract in place that allows full access to the technical documentation on an
ongoing basis40. Furthermore, the MDR also requires that the original clinical
evaluation of the equivalent device has been performed in compliance with the
requirements of the MDR. This implies that the presumed equivalent device is
certified under the MDR. As such, it will not be possible to claim equivalence to
a device certified with respect to the Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC.
(e) For devices other than implantable devices and class III devices and where
the manufacturer wants to claim equivalence, MDR Article 61 (3) is applicable.
This requirement does not specify whether the device is presumed to be
marketed within the EU. Therefore, it will be possible to claim equivalence to a
device certified with respect to the Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC or the
MDR.
However, exceptions can be considered, and equivalence claimed to a device
that is not CE-marked, provided all relevant MDR requirements regarding
equivalence and clinical evaluation can be met. This includes
 that the manufacturer shall have sufficient levels of access to the data
relating to devices with which they are claiming equivalence41 . In the
circumstance that the presumed equivalent device is from another
manufacturer, there is no MDR requirement of a contract between the
manufacturers for regulating the access to the technical documentation.
 that clinical investigations were conducted in accordance with
international guidelines42
 that the clinical data meet the requirements of the MDR, and a
justification is provided whether the clinical data are transferrable to the
European population.
The regulatory status of the presumed equivalent device should be disclosed.
See MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 Appendix A1 for further guidance.
(f) In case of products without an intended medical purpose listed in MDR
Annex XVI clinical investigations shall be performed for those products unless
reliance on existing clinical data from an analogous medical device is duly
justified43. An analogous device, in this context, is understood as a medical
device which is similar in terms of functioning and risks profile and has a medical
purpose44. To duly justify reliance on existing clinical data from an analogous

medical device, the principles of demonstration of equivalence45 should be
applied with the acceptance that the device under evaluation will only have an
aesthetic or another non-medical purpose whereas the analogous device has a
medical purpose. The general requirement to demonstrate a clinical benefit46
shall be understood as a requirement to demonstrate the performance of the
device.
In addition, since the common specifications (CS) for the products without an
intended medical purpose may have requirements related to the clinical
evaluation regarding safety47 these requirements must be taken into
consideration when demonstrating equivalence and concluding whether there
would be no clinically significant difference in the safety48.
There shall be no significant difference in the safety and performance between
the product and the presumed analogous medical device.
5. Use of data from similar devices
The term ‘similar devices’ may be understood as devices belonging to the same
generic device group. The MDR defines this49 as a set of devices having the same or
similar intended purposes or a commonality of technology allowing them to be
classified in a generic manner not reflecting specific characteristics.
In cases where equivalence cannot be demonstrated under the MDR, the data from
similar devices may be useful for a variety of other purposes, for example:
1. Ensuring that the risk management system is comprehensive by identifying
relevant hazards and clinical risks.
2. Understanding the state of the art, the natural course of disease and
alternative available treatment options.
3. Helping to define the scope of the clinical evaluation, by identifying any design
features in similar devices that pose special performance or safety concerns.
4. Provide input for clinical investigation design or post-market clinical follow-up
design, and the post-market surveillance system.
5. Identification of relevant and specified clinical outcome parameters for the
intended clinical benefits, based on the published clinical data pertaining to the
similar device(s).
6. To define minimum requirements for a quantified clinical benefit that is
considered clinically relevant, and/or to identify acceptable occurrence rates of
risks and adverse events.

6. Clinical data identification
A clinical evaluation of the device under assessment shall be made according to the
MDR50. All the clinical data, both favourable and unfavourable shall be identified. This
applies to clinical data from both the device in question and the device for which
equivalence can be demonstrated. If the data meet the definition of clinical data as
defined in the MDR51, the data shall then progress to data appraisal and analysis in
order to evaluate whether the clinical data are providing sufficient clinical evidence for
the purpose of confirmation of conformity with the relevant general safety and
performance requirements (GSPR)52.
For identifying, appraising and analysing available clinical data from the scientific
literature to establish clinical evidence53, manufacturers will find facilitative guidance in
sections 8-10 of MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4.
In the event that the data do not meet the MDR definition of clinical data these are not
clinical data and cannot be subject to data appraisal, analysis and evaluation for the
purpose of providing clinical evidence for the confirmation of conformity with the
relevant GSPR.

Annex I – Equivalence table
A table, such as the table below, may be used to clearly demonstrate equivalence and
to identify the supporting data on a device by device basis. The items in the first column
of the table are examples only and are to be considered as such. They must not be
interpreted as an exhaustive list of specifications, properties, parameters and/or
aspects for demonstrating equivalence to another device.
The manufacturer should identify differences and place emphasis on the differences
between the two devices rather than the similarities. Considerations shall include the
potential additive effect of multiple small differences. For further considerations of
equivalence, see sections 3 and 4 in this document.
Scientific justifications shall be provided for the different characteristics when claiming
no clinically significant difference in the safety and clinical performance of the device.
Where more than one device is assessed for equivalence, the table should be
completed separately for each presumed equivalent device. The documentation of the
demonstration of equivalence shall be included in the clinical evaluation report.
