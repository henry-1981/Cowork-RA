Introduction
The sponsor of a clinical investigation is required to submit an application/notification 1 to the Member State(s) in
which a clinical investigation is to be conducted, accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter II of Annex
XV of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). 2 The application/notification is required to be submitted by means of the
electronic system referred to in Article 73 of the MDR.
In the absence of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), a series of clinical investigation
application/notification documents have been created to support clinical investigation procedures with respect to
MDR.
These documents include:
•
•

•
•

Clinical investigation – application/notification form under the MDR
Addendum to the clinical investigation application/notification form for:
o Additional investigational device(s) (section 3)
o Additional comparator device(s) (section 4)
o Additional investigation site(s) (section 5)
Clinical investigation supporting documents - Appendix of documents to attach
Checklist of general safety and performance requirements, Standards, common specifications and scientific
advice

Insofar as possible, the clinical investigation application/notification form includes same data fields to the EUDAMED
system in development.
For further guidance with respect to the application of certain MDR provisions during the absence of EUDAMED please
see MDCG 2021-1 Rev.1. 3 In the absence of EUDAMED, the Union-wide unique single identification number for a
clinical investigation, which shall be used for all relevant communication in relation to that clinical investigation will
be the CIV-ID which is currently used for Eudamed2, the electronic system which supports the medical device
Directives. 4
Use of templates
These documents are intended to be facilitative and their use by the Competent Authorities and sponsors is
encouraged, however it is important to check with the individual Member State in which the clinical investigation is
planned to be conducted as to any specific national requirements. It is planned that these templates will be withdrawn
once the EUDAMED module for clinical investigations is fully functional. Further operational guidance with respect to
the use of the guidance may be provided in due course.

1 Clinical investigation application (MDR Art. 62(1)), PMCF investigation notification (MDR Art. 74(1)), other clinical investigation

application/notification, i.e. a national application (MDR Art. 82(1)).
