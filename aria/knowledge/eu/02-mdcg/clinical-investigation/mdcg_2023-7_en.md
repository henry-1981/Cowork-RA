2. Introduction
For ease of reference, the text of Article 61 paragraphs (4)-(6) is included below:
Article 61
Clinical evaluation
4.

In the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical investigations shall be
performed, except if:
—
the device has been designed by modifications of a device already marketed by
the same manufacturer,
—
the modified device has been demonstrated by the manufacturer to be
equivalent to the marketed device, in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV
and this demonstration has been endorsed by the notified body, and
—
the clinical evaluation of the marketed device is sufficient to demonstrate
conformity of the modified device with the relevant safety and performance
requirements.
In this case, the notified body shall check that the PMCF plan is appropriate and
includes post market studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the device.
In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases referred to in
paragraph 6.

5.

A manufacturer of a device demonstrated to be equivalent to an already marketed
device not manufactured by him, may also rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform
a clinical investigation provided that the following conditions are fulfilled in addition to
what is required in that paragraph:
—
the two manufacturers have a contract in place that explicitly allows the
manufacturer of the second device full access to the technical documentation on
an ongoing basis, and
—
the original clinical evaluation has been performed in compliance with the
requirements of this Regulation, and the manufacturer of the second device
provides clear evidence thereof to the notified body.

6.

The requirement to perform clinical investigations pursuant to paragraph 4 shall not
apply to implantable devices and class III devices:
(a) which have been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in accordance
with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC and for which the clinical
evaluation:
— is based on sufficient clinical data, and
3(12)

(b)

— is in compliance with the relevant product-specific CS for the clinical
evaluation of that kind of device, where such a CS is available; or
that are sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws,
wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors for which the clinical evaluation
is based on sufficient clinical data and is in compliance with the relevant productspecific CS, where such a CS is available.

Article 61(4) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) requires clinical
investigations to be performed for implantable and class III devices, except in four
specific cases as outlined in:
CASE 1) indents 1-3 of Article 61(4);
CASE 2) Article 61(6)(a);
CASE 3) Article 61(6)(b);
CASE 4) Article 61(5).
These four cases which are exempted from the requirement to perform clinical
investigations are independent of each other; i.e. the criteria outlined in one paragraph
do not apply to the other paragraphs unless directly referenced.
One important consequence of this independence of cases is that the requirement for
a contract, pursuant to Article 61(5), does not apply to the cases outlined in indents 13 of Article 61(4), Article 61(6)(a) and Article 61(6)(b). For these cases, it is only
necessary to demonstrate equivalence in accordance with the criteria listed in Annex
XIV Section 3 MDR to be able to use the associated clinical data in the clinical
evaluation.
In addition to outlining the technical, biological and clinical characteristics to be taken
into consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, Annex XIV Section 3
mandates that “It shall be clearly demonstrated that manufacturers have sufficient
levels of access to the data relating to devices with which they are claiming
equivalence in order to justify their claims of equivalence”. The requirement to have
sufficient levels of access to the data required to establish equivalence does not in
itself require a contract between the two manufacturers (see Section 5 of this guidance
for further detail).
3. Scope
This guidance is intended to clarify the exemptions from the requirement to perform
clinical investigations, and associated conditions related to the demonstration of
equivalence, for implantable and class III medical devices to be placed on the
European market. It also provides examples and considerations relevant to the
demonstration of “sufficient levels of access to the data” per Annex XIV Section 3.
4. When are clinical investigations not mandatory according to Article 61(4)-(6) of
the MDR?
Article 61(4) states that clinical investigations shall be performed for implantable and
class III devices. Indents 1-3 of Article 61(4) outline the first case which can be
4(12)

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-7

exempted from this requirement. Articles 61(5) and 61(6) outline additional exemption
cases, as illustrated in Appendix I. Appendix I shows the parallel nature, and thus
independence, of these cases. The conditions that apply to each case are summarised
in Table 1 in this section.
N.B.: Devices which are neither class III nor implantable are outside the scope of this
document. The need for a clinical investigation(s) for such devices is determined by
the objectives of the clinical evaluation and the sufficiency of existing clinical evidence
to meet those objectives. Please refer to MDCG 2020-5 and MDCG 2020-6 for further
guidance.
The beginning of the first sentence of Article 61(4) provides the general obligation,
namely “in the case of implantable devices and class III devices, clinical investigations
shall be performed”. The remainder of Article 61(4), as well as Article 61(5) and 61(6)
describe circumstances under which these devices are exempted from the requirement
to conduct clinical investigations; they do not describe conditions for demonstrating
equivalence, nor do they describe when data from EDs may be used in a clinical
evaluation.
As summarised in the Introduction to this guidance, the cases in which implantable and
class III devices are exempted from mandatory clinical investigations are independent
of each other, except where a dependence is explicitly indicated1, 2. In other words, the
criteria outlined in one paragraph do not apply to the other paragraphs unless directly
referenced. Specifically, the requirement for a contract as described in Article 61(5) does
not apply to the exemption cases outlined in Articles 61(4) and 61(6).
A manufacturer may use clinical data generated from another manufacturer’s ED in the
clinical evaluation of the DUE, without a contract, in any of the cases 1 to 33. The only
requirement in this respect is that the equivalence criteria described in Annex XIV
Section 3 are met.
Use of ED data may enable a manufacturer to demonstrate that their clinical evaluation
is based on “sufficient clinical data”. However the manufacturer is only exempted from
the requirement to perform clinical investigations if the conditions outlined in the relevant
exemption case are met, as summarised in Table 1 below.
1 Article 61(4) states “In addition, clinical investigations need not be performed in the cases referred to in paragraph

6”. The words “in addition” indicates additional exemption cases which do not rely on the exemption criteria of Article
61(4) being met. i.e., CASE 2 and CASE 3, as described in Article 61(6)(a) and Article 61(6)(b), do not need to satisfy
the additional requirements listed in Article 61(4).
Article 61(5) states “a manufacturer […] may also rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform a clinical investigation
provided that the following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in that paragraph”. This indicates that
the exemption case outlined in Article 61(5) is dependent on criteria described in Article 61(4) being met. In legal
terms, the phrasing “may also rely upon” indicates a dependence on the referenced paragraph; Article 61(5) has a
dependency on Article 61(4), but Articles 61(4) and 61(6) are not dependent on Article 61(5).
2 It can be inferred from this independence of paragraphs that the devices described in CASE 1 and CASE 4 are
neither legacy devices as outlined in CASE 2 nor “sutures, staples, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws,
wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors” as outlined in CASE 3. i.e., the DUE described in Article 61(5) and
indents 1-3 of Article 61(4) are new devices which have not previously been marketed under either the Directives or
the MDR.
3 N.B., in CASE 4, a contract with at least one manufacturer will be required along with the other conditions described
in Table 1. However, data from other manufacturers’ devices (with which equivalence is demonstrated) can be used
without a contract to supplement the data in the clinical evaluation, for those indications covered by the contract. See
also footnote 11.

Table 1: Criteria for exemption from the Article 61(4) requirement for clinical
investigations for implantable and class III devices
CASE 1:
• DUE has been designed by modifications of a device already

marketed by the same manufacturer.
Article 61(4)
• Equivalence is demonstrated between the DUE and the
manufacturer’s ED in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV;
demonstration of equivalence has been endorsed by the notified
body. For further guidance on the demonstration of equivalence,
please refer to MDCG 2020-5.
• The clinical evaluation of the marketed device is sufficient to
demonstrate conformity of the modified device with the relevant
safety and performance requirements4, 5.
• PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market studies to
demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE6.

• DUE has been lawfully placed on the market or put into service in
Article
accordance with Directive 90/385/EEC or Directive 93/42/EEC.
61(6)(a)
• The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data7.
• The clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant productspecific CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device,
where such a CS is available.
CASE 3:
• DUE is one of the listed types of devices: “sutures, staples,
Article
dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges,

plates, wires, pins, clips or connectors”.
• The clinical evaluation is based on sufficient clinical data7.
• The clinical evaluation is in compliance with the relevant productspecific CS for the clinical evaluation of that kind of device,
where such a CS is available.
CASE 4:
• Equivalence is demonstrated between the DUE and the other
Article 61(5)8
manufacturer’s ED in accordance with Section 3 of Annex XIV;

The MDR does not prohibit the use of data from another manufacturer’s ED in the clinical evaluation of the
manufacturer’s already marketed device. This does not imply that a manufacturer will rely on equivalence in
perpetuity: the additional requirement for PMCF studies to demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE
ensures that clinical data on the DUE itself will be collected post market; this data will be included in future revisions
of the clinical evaluation report per Article 61(11). There may however be circumstances in which it is appropriate to
continue to include data from EDs in the clinical evaluation, even when clinical data has been generated on the DUE.
5 The clinical evaluation for the manufacturer’s ED does not supersede the clinical evaluation for the DUE; the DUE
clinical evaluation and its documentation are still required, in accordance with Article 61(1).
6 See also MDCG 2020-8: Post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) Evaluation Report Template - A guide for
manufacturers and notified bodies (April 2020)
7 “Clinical data” includes data from any of the sources listed in the Article 2(48) definition. This includes data from “a
device for which equivalence to the device in question can be demonstrated”. The definition does not include a
requirement for a contract between the manufacturers.
Additional note: MedDev 2.12/2 indicated that PMCF studies should be undertaken for devices when the clinical
evaluation was based on equivalence. In some cases, execution of such studies may have been a condition of
certification under the Directives. The acceptance of clinical evidence from EDs as part of the clinical evidence
package to support MDR certification does not invalidate any such conditions of certification.
8 Article 61(5) states: “A manufacturer of a device demonstrated to be equivalent to an already marketed device not
manufactured by him, may also rely on paragraph 4 in order not to perform a clinical investigation provided that the
following conditions are fulfilled in addition to what is required in that paragraph”; i.e., the exemption requirements of
Article 61(4) must also be met in addition to the exemption requirements laid out in Article 61(5). This does not include
the requirement for the device to be a design modification of the manufacturer’s own already marketed device.

demonstration of equivalence has been endorsed by the notified
body (via Article 61(4)).
The clinical data from the clinical evaluation of the ED is
sufficient to support the intended purposes of the DUE (via
Article 61(4))9.
The two manufacturers have a contract in place that explicitly
allows the manufacturer of the ED full access to the technical
documentation on an ongoing basis.
The clinical evaluation of the other manufacturer’s ED has been
performed in compliance with the requirements of the MDR10, 11.
PMCF plan is appropriate and includes post market studies to
demonstrate the safety and performance of the DUE6 (via Article
61(4)).

In the case where a clinical investigation(s) is determined to be mandatory12 in order to
obtain the needed clinical data to support the clinical evidence for a claimed indication
for use, the MDR does not specify the number or extent of the clinical investigation(s)
required. However, as a minimum, mandatory clinical investigation(s) should be
understood to mean a pivotal clinical investigation(s) generating pivotal data.
5. Demonstration of “sufficient levels of access to the data” required to justify
claims of equivalence
In addition to outlining the technical, biological and clinical characteristics to be taken
into consideration for the demonstration of equivalence, Annex XIV Section 3 MDR
requires manufacturers to have “[…] sufficient levels of access to the data relating to
devices with which they are claiming equivalence in order to justify their claims of
equivalence”. As clarified above, demonstration of “sufficient levels of access” does not
require a contract in all circumstances. A contract is only required for the exemption case
described in Article 61(5). It should also be noted that Annex XIV Section 3 refers
specifically to the data required to justify claims of equivalence: i.e., the requirement is
for sufficient access to establish the clinical, technical and biological characteristics
against which equivalence is evaluated, not access to the complete technical
documentation.
A contract as described in Article 61(5) is presumed to provide full access to the data
needed for the demonstration of equivalence. However, in the cases where a contract is
not required, other means of access to data can prove to be adequate to support
demonstrations of equivalence. This includes CASEs 1, 2, and 3; it also includes a
specific subset of CASE 4, in which equivalence is fully demonstrated with more than
one device from more than one manufacturer, and there is a contract in place with at
9 The MDR does not prohibit the use of equivalence, demonstrated in compliance with the MDR, in the clinical

evaluation of ED.
10 The clinical evaluation for the other manufacturer’s ED does not supersede the clinical evaluation for the DUE; the
DUE clinical evaluation and its documentation are still required, in accordance with Article 61(1).
11 The MDR does not prohibit the use of clinical data from more than one manufacturer’s ED in the clinical evaluation
of the DUE. In this case, only one contract with one manufacturer is required for the exemption from the requirement
for clinical investigations to apply for the specific indications for use covered by the existing contract.

least one of the manufacturers, see footnotes 3 and 11. The manufacturer of the DUE
must document their justification within the CER as to why the level of access they have
obtained is sufficient, and this has to be accepted by the notified body13.
Table 2 in Appendix II provides some examples of means of access to the data relevant
for the demonstration of equivalence and suggests a hierarchy in relation to the level of
access to this data. It also indicates potential limitations of these methods and means
by which these limitations might be addressed. Table 2 is for illustrative purposes only,
and is not intended to be exhaustive or prescriptive.
N.B.: A higher level of access is indicated where limitations are considered unacceptable
and cannot be adequately addressed. In this context, an unacceptable limitation is one
which compromises the completeness or accuracy of the demonstration of equivalence
such that it cannot be presumed that the DUE has similar safety and performance
characteristics to the device with which equivalence is claimed.
It should also be noted that a higher level of access to data does not directly correlate
to a stronger demonstration of equivalence. For example, in example 1a of Table 2, the
manufacturer of the DUE has complete access to the data required to demonstrate
equivalence, but the devices could still have differences in one or more of the clinical,
technical or biological equivalence criteria described in Annex XIV Section 3 of the MDR.
By contrast, in the case described in example 1d of Table 2, it may be presumed that
the DUE is identical to its claimed equivalent.
If a manufacturer is not able to demonstrate sufficient levels of access to the data needed
for the demonstration of equivalence, equivalence claims cannot be made for the
purpose of conformity assessment13.
