Introduction
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (1) requires that the
manufacturer shall draw up a summary of safety and clinical performance (SSCP)
for implantable devices and for class III devices, other than custom-made or
investigational devices. The SSCP shall be validated by a notified body (NB) and
made available to the public via the European database on medical devices
(Eudamed)1.
The SSCP is intended to provide public access to an updated summary of clinical
data2 and other information about the safety and clinical performance of the medical
device. The SSCP will be an important source of information for intended users –
both healthcare professionals and if relevant for patients. It is one of several means
intended to fulfil the objectives of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) to enhance
transparency and provide adequate access to information3.
The SSCP is not intended to:
 give general advice on the diagnosis or treatment of particular medical
conditions, nor
 replace the instructions for use (IFU) as the main document that will be
provided to ensure the safe use of a particular device, nor
 replace the mandatory information on implant cards4 or in any other
mandatory documents.
The main purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the presentation,
content and validation of the SSCP. The word “shall” is used when there is a
corresponding “shall” in the MDR, otherwise “should” or “recommended” etc. is used
indicating the interpretation of the MDR.

General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP
The information in the SSCP should be sourced entirely from the technical
documentation (TD) of the device15. Examples of such documents are design
verification/validation reports, the risk management report/file, the clinical evaluation
report, and post-market surveillance (PMS) and post-market clinical follow-up
(PMCF) plans and reports. The IFU includes information extracted from the same
sources as the SSCP, but may itself be used as a source for the SSCP if
appropriate.
The manufacturer will assign to the SSCP an identifier (reference number) that
within the manufacturer’s management system is unique to that SSCP and will
remain the same for the entire lifetime of the SSCP. In combination with the
manufacturer’s SRN this will allow for the unique identification of the SSCP in
EUDAMED and in EU.
The SSCP shall be kept updated in Eudamed16. When the PMCF evaluation report17
and the periodic safety update report (PSUR)18 are updated at least annually19, the
SSCP shall be reviewed and updated20 if needed to ensure that any clinical and/or
safety information in the SSCP remains correct and complete. When updating the
SSCP, all sections of the document shall be updated if needed so that they are in
alignment with the most current version of the relevant parts of the TD of the device.
This guide outlines the minimum content of the SSCP. The manufacturer may add
further information from the TD of the device to enhance the comprehension of the
mandatory information providing:

it does not affect the readability of the SSCP and
it excludes any element of a promotional nature.

The SSCP shall be objective and adequately summarise both favourable and
unfavourable data21.
For further guidance on the contents of the SSCP, please refer to sections 1-8 of this
document and to the template in the Appendix. The format and structure of this
template is recommended. It addresses all of the SSCP content requirements of the
MDR22, but the order has been revised to enhance its presentation.
The IFU shall contain all that is needed to directly find the SSCP in Eudamed. The
following applies to the IFU23.
 It shall state that the SSCP is available in the European database on medical
devices (Eudamed), where it is linked to the Basic UDI-DI.
 It should provide the URL to the Eudamed public website:
https://ec.europa.eu/tools/eudamed
 It should state the value of the Basic UDI-DI. Alternatively, another metadata
can be stated provided it can be used to unambiguously search and find the
intended SSCP in Eudamed.
Translations to other EU languages
No single language will be understood by all intended users and patients in the EU –
see the European Survey on Language Competences initiated by the European
Commission (4). In order to meet the requirement in the MDR that the SSCP shall
be written in a way that is clear to the intended user and, if relevant, to the patient 24,
the SSCP should be translated into the languages accepted in the Member States
where the device is envisaged to be sold. This is by analogy with the requirement for
an IFU25. Note that Member States may have different language requirements for an
IFU depending on whether the information is intended for health care professionals
or for patients. The SSCP part intended for patients should be provided in all the
languages required for IFUs intended for patients in the Member States concerned.
If the selection of European languages for the SSCP does not include English, then
an English translation of the document should also be provided. English is the most
common language used in medical scientific publications and is understood by many
healthcare professionals in the EU. Always providing an English-language version of
the SSCP further enhances access to information26 about devices available on the
EU market.
There should be one SSCP document for each language. Each SSCP document
should state in which language the SSCP was validated by the NB. The
manufacturer should ensure, through their quality management system, that the

translations are correct.
Relevant SSCP information for patients
The MDR indicates that patients are also intended recipients of the information in the
SSCP, “if relevant”27. Devices for which information will be especially relevant for
patients include:
 implantable devices for which patients will be given implant cards28, and
 class III devices that are intended to be used directly by patients.
For these devices, a part of the SSCP specifically intended for patients should be
provided.
Note: Devices listed in MDR Annex XVI, and eligible for a SSCP, should always be
considered as relevant for patient information.
For devices other than the two groups listed above, including any devices listed in
Annex XVI and eligible for a SSCP, the manufacturer may consider whether it is
relevant to provide specific information intended for patients. This can be based on
the manufacturer’s analysis of the device in question.
Readability
The SSCP should always have one part for intended users/healthcare professionals,
and when it is relevant (see above) a second part for patients. Both should be clear
and provide information at an appropriate depth to reflect the healthcare
professionals’ and the patients’ different levels of knowledge29.
For further guidance, see references (5) and (6) in this guide. It should not be
assumed that the patient has any formal education in a medical discipline or any
prior knowledge of medical terminology or clinical research. It is recommended that
the readability of the part of the SSCP intended for patients is assessed for example
by a test given to lay persons. The manufacturer may use a method it finds
adequate for the readability test to confirm that the SSCP is written in a way that is
clear to the patient30.
Medical terminology, relevant for the medical device and the clinical context, should
be used consistently throughout the part of the SSCP that is intended for healthcare
professionals.
Stylistic recommendations
The SSCP should be presented in an organised and unambiguous manner.
Usually, abbreviations and acronyms should not be used; if they are, then in the text,
the abbreviation or acronym should follow the full phrase it is intended to replace. It
may then be used thereafter throughout the document.

Medical terms should be explained in simple language in the parts intended for
patients. Consistency should be assured by giving the lay term with a description
first, and then the medical term immediately afterwards (in brackets). On a case-bycase basis the lay or medical term (but preferably the lay term) may then be used
throughout the part intended for patients.
It is recommended to keep the information for patients/lay persons and for intended
users/healthcare professionals in two separate parts of the SSCP, separated by a
“page break”. This enhances their readability and facilitates printing of each part
separately. See the template in the Appendix of this document.
The SSCP should be written in a font type and size which allow easy reading. Since
the SSCP is intended for the public, it needs to be in a format that everyone can
read (and that is not editable) without the need for a license. Therefore the SSCP file
uploaded in Eudamed should be in PDF format. When downloaded, the PDF file
should be printable and searchable with the search function in the program used to
view the file, for example the Adobe Reader.
Validation and uploading of the SSCP
Validation of the initial SSCP by the NB
When the NB has assessed that all the required elements31 are included in the draft
SSCP, accurately presented and in alignment with the most current version of
relevant documents in the TD, the SSCP has been validated by the NB.
In the circumstance that the conformity assessment is performed according to Annex
X and XI in the MDR and there are two NBs involved, it is the NB which assesses
the TD according to Annex X that shall validate the SSCP.
The validation of the SSCP by the NB covers only one of the language(s) accepted
by the NB and agreed with the manufacturer. The manufacturer should state in the
revision history in each SSCP document in which language the SSCP was validated
by the NB.
The timing of the SSCP validation may depend on the class of device and the
conformity assessment routes:
 For class III devices and class IIb implantable devices, except sutures and
staples etc.32, the validation is performed when a draft SSCP as a part of the
application documents is submitted to the NB involved in the conformity
assessment33, prior to issuing the certificate.
 For class IIa implantable and some IIb implantable devices such as sutures
and staples etc34, a draft SSCP as a part of the application documents shall
be submitted to the NB involved in the conformity assessment. The draft
SSCP shall be validated by the NB35.

MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1

In the circumstance if more than one device is covered by the relevant
certificate, at least one draft SSCP shall be validated against relevant
documents in the TD during the initial conformity assessment, prior to issuing
the certificate.
Draft SSCPs that are not validated at the initial conformity assessment, shall
be validated against relevant documents in the TD at least once during the
period of validity of the certificate.
Validation of updates of the SSCP between certification activities
The manufacturer has an obligation to keep the SSCP updated; for further details
see the section “General requirements and recommendations for the SSCP” in this
guide. Furthermore the manufacturer shall prepare a periodic safety update report
(PSUR) that includes data gathered as a result of the post-market surveillance plan,
description of any preventive and corrective actions taken, conclusions of the
benefit-risk determination, and the main findings of the PMCF36.
If the PSUR contains information rendering any information in the SSCP incorrect or
incomplete, the SSCP shall be updated37 to be in line with the information in the
most recent PSUR.
The manufacturer shall submit a PSUR to the NB at least annually, or for class IIa
implantable devices38 at least every two years39.
If the SSCP has been updated with new/changed information, except for strictly
editorial modifications, the manufacturer should submit the updated SSCP to the NB
when submitting the required PSUR.
 If the SSCP has been previously validated, the NB should validate the updated
SSCP against the submitted and evaluated PSUR. Both the NB and the
manufacturer should make an effort to keep the validation time short in order to
meet the MDR requirement of an update of the SSCP at least annually if
indicated40.
 If the SSCP has not previously been validated41, the NB may defer the
validation until a validation against the relevant documents in the TD is planned
during the period of validity of the certificate.
In addition, as part of its surveillance activities, the NB shall verify that the
manufacturer has appropriately updated the SSCP. The NB should take into
consideration its assessment of the PMS plan and PSUR, the PMCF plan and its
evaluation report, and/or other relevant information.

Validation of SSCP at certificate renewal
With each certificate renewal application, the manufacturer should:
 For class III devices and class IIb implantable devices, other than sutures and
staples etc.42, submit a draft SSCP which has been updated within the previous
12 months, regardless of whether there are new data or conclusions.
 For class IIa implantable and IIb implantable devices, such as sutures and
staples etc.43, confirm that the SSCP in Eudamed is in alignment with the
current version of the TD, or provide an updated SSCP where required.
At certificate renewal, the same principles should apply for the validation of the
SSCP documents as at the initial certification.
Uploading of the SSCP in Eudamed
The SSCP shall be uploaded in Eudamed by the NB44, which is the only actor that
can manage the SSCPs in Eudamed. Timelines for uploading of the SSCP
documents in Eudamed:
 The NB shall upload the SSCP validated in conjunction with an initial
conformity assessment at the same time that it uploads the issued certificate.
 For class IIa implantable and IIb implantable devices, such as sutures and
staples etc.45, the NB shall upload the SSCPs of all the devices covered by
the issued certificate at the same time that it uploads the issued certificate,
even if some of the SSCPs have not been validated yet, and are to be
validated during the period of validity of the certificate.
The manufacturer should state in a revision history in the SSCP document
whether that revision was validated by the NB. It is important and should be
transparent to the public46 whether the SSCP document has been validated
yet by the NB. See the example of a revision history in section 9 and in the
template in the Appendix of this guide.
 The NB shall upload a SSCP whenever it has been validated against relevant
documents in the TD, and thus replacing the SSCP uploaded at the initial
certification with the currently validated revision.
 The manufacturer is responsible for the translations of the SSCP into other
languages47, once the “master” SSCP has been uploaded by the NB.
If the “master” SSCP is in a language other than English, then an English
translation should be provided by the manufacturer within 90 days of the
upload of the “master” SSCP. The NB should upload the English translation
within 15 days of receiving this from the manufacturer.
 The manufacturer decides when it translates the initial “master” SSCP into
other languages in the Member States depending on when/if they plan to
place the product on that market.
The NB does not validate the translated SSCP documents. It should upload
them in Eudamed within 15 days of receiving them.

The manufacturer shall verify that the SSCP, and any translations needed for any
single Member State, have been uploaded in Eudamed before placing a device on
that market48.

When receiving an updated SSCP document in conjunction with the PSUR,
the NB should upload the updated SSCP document within 15 days after it is
validated, or within 15 days after deeming the validation to be deferred49 until
a validation against the relevant documents in the TD is planned during the
period of validity of the certificate.
At certificate renewal, the NB shall upload any updated SSCPs of all the
devices covered by the reissued certificate at the same time that it uploads
the reissued certificate. The NB should ensure the revision history indicates
whether or not these have been validated by the NB.
The manufacturer should provide updated translations to the NB within 90
days of the upload of the updated “master” SSCP. The NB should upload
these translations within 15 days of receiving them from the manufacturer.

Guidance for each of the required sections of the SSCP document

1.

The identification of the device and the manufacturer, including the Basic
UDI-DI and, if already issued, the SRN

2.2. The indications shall be described. This includes the stages and/or severities
of the pathologies, the specific medical conditions, and the specific
anatomical locations or confirmation that no anatomical locations are
contraindicated, as applicable. The target population(s) shall be specified, for
example if the device is intended for adults and/or children and/or
infants/neonates.
2.3. Any contraindications or restrictions for use or limitations of the device shall
be included.
The information can be sourced from the IFU, or from the clinical evaluation
report.

3.

A description of the device, including a reference to previous generation(s)
or variants if such exist, and a description of the differences, as well as,
where relevant, a description of any accessories, other devices and
products, which are intended to be used in combination with the device
3.1. A description of the device shall be presented, including its operating
principles and mode(s) of action. Design characteristics should be included,
for example key functional elements and any materials or substances in
contact with the patient’s tissues. Include information on whether the device
is for single use, and its method of sterilisation. For absorbable implants the
stability retention profile, including time to loss of stability and the absorption
time, should be provided.
A picture or drawing can be added accompanied by text.
Information about the constituents should be provided, as required for the
IFU53, if the device incorporates
 a medicinal substance (including a human blood or plasma derivative), or
 tissue(s) or cells of human or animal origin, or their derivatives, or
 substances or combinations of substances that are absorbed by or locally
dispersed in the human body, or
 materials incorporated into the device that contain or consist of CMR
(carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction) substances or
endocrine-disrupting substances, or
 materials that could result in sensitisation or an allergic reaction by the
patient or user.
In Eudamed, the SSCP is associated to one or multiple Basic UDI-DI(s). All
UDI-DIs/devices associated to this Basic UDI-DI will be seen as having the

same SSCP (a UDI-DI/device must always be associated with one and only
one Basic UDI-DI).
If the device is a system of several components/devices, each device in the
system should have a Basic UDI-DI but also one Basic UDI-DI for the
system. It is the Basic UDI-DI for the system that is intended to be provided in
section 1.4 in the template, and that will be associated with the SSCP in
Eudamed. The device system, and any Basic UDI-DIs of included devices,
should be described in section 3.1.
The device description in the SSCP shall therefore include all the
device(s)/device system associated with the same Basic UDI-DI. The
description of the device(s)/device system should be comprehensive and can
be presented in different ways to include, if such exist, any configurations /
combinations / different sizes / specification of any soft-ware versions that
can be related to safety and/or performance and their release dates / etc.
The description should also include any model number or similar designation
used to identify the device(s)/device system.
3.2. A reference to previous generation(s) or variants shall be provided, if such
exist. This applies both to changes/variants of the device itself (same Basic
UDI-DI) and to previous generation(s) or variants associated with other Basic
UDI-DIs, if available. A description of the differences shall be provided,
highlighting the reasons for the change; for example changes to the intended
clinical benefits, changes to reduce identified clinical risks, or changes for
manufacturing reasons etc.
3.3. If there are any accessories54 that are not themselves devices, but are
intended by the manufacturer to be used in combination with the device, they
shall be described or listed. The list of accessories should include all those
that are essential for the safe and correct use of the device.
3.4. If there are any other devices and products intended to be used in
combination with the device, they shall be described or listed. However,
generic surgical equipment and/or other generic devices do not need to be
listed.
In the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients, section 3 may be limited to
the device(s) in question (Basic UDI-DI) including relevant and necessary
accessories from a patient’s perspective; see suggested headings for section 3 in
the template in the Appendix.

4.1. Residual risks and undesirable effects

54

MDR, Article 2 (2)

13(24)

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-9 Rev.1

This section of the SSCP guide and template includes residual risks55, other
than those contraindications, limitations, warnings and precautions that are
included in sections 2.3 and 4.2.
Description of residual risks and undesirable effects
Risk is defined in the MDR56 as the combination of the probability of
occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. Harm is defined in the
standard ISO 14971:201257 as physical injury or damage to the health of
people, or damage to property or the environment. Thus the term ‘risk’
includes both clinical and non-clinical harms.
The term ‘residual risk’ is defined in the standard ISO 14971:2012 58 as “risk
remaining after risk control measures have been taken”.
There is a requirement in the MDR that the IFU shall contain information on
any residual risks and any undesirable side-effects59, i.e. no sort of residual
risk or undesirable side-effect related to the device is excluded from
disclosure. The SSCP should contain information on at least the same
residual risks and undesirable side-effects as included in the IFU.
For the purpose of the SSCP, an undesirable effect60 can be understood as
any undesirable side-effect related to the device and that is experienced by
the patient and/or can be diagnosed and/or measured in the patient.
For the clarity of the SSCP, undesirable side-effects can be annotated also in
other terms as appropriate, to present any undesirable side-effects related to
the device in question. There may be device-specific terminology for
describing side-effects and risks in device-specific ISO standards or scientific
literature that is important to use to allow comparison of clinical data.
For example, some events indicated in the MDR by the terms ‘adverse
events’61, ‘undesirable side-effects’ or ‘incidents’62, may all be annotated as
‘adverse events’ in the scientific literature.
Any further discussion on risks can be included in the SSCP if needed for
clarity or comprehension.
Quantitative data
The definition of risk63 includes the probability of occurrence of harm.
Therefore the information in the SSCP on risks shall also include
quantifications. This information can be sourced from the clinical evaluation

report where an updated examination of qualitative and quantitative aspects
of clinical safety is available, with clear reference to the determination of
residual risks and side-effects64.
It should also be clarified in the SSCP whether quantitative data on sideeffects or residual risks relate to clinical data that were obtained proactively,
for example from a structured prospective follow-up study of the device itself,
or if the expected frequencies65 come from a systematic review of the
scientific literature. It should be disclosed in the SSCP if data from
spontaneously reported incidents or serious incidents66 are used as one of
the sources for estimating quantitative data on side-effects or residual risks,
in which case significant under-reporting needs to be considered.
A relation to time should also be included when presenting the quantitative
data, for example during five or ten years of use from implantation, or
adverse events per 100 patient-years for implantable devices with constant
hazards, etc. The quantitative data and the relation to time should always be
presented together.
To use tabulated lists for the presentation of side-effects and residual risks
with quantitative data and a relation to time, may enhance the readability.
In the part of the SSCP that is intended for patients, residual risks and sideeffects should be explained and quantified in a way that patients and lay
persons can understand. A statement should be included about how potential
risks have been controlled or managed, and also a statement on what to do if
the patient believes that he/she is experiencing side-effects related to the
device or its use. See the example in the template in the Appendix.
4.2. All warnings and precautions pertaining to the device should be presented.
However warnings and precautions solely related to for example
installation/preparation of a device or relating to special procedural steps can
be discussed on a general level in the SSCP if a link (URL) to the IFU on the
manufacturer’s website is provided.
Always include any warnings, precautions or measures to be taken by the
patient or a healthcare professional with regard to reciprocal interference with
reasonably foreseeable external influences, medical examinations or
environmental conditions.
If any particular clinical follow-up is necessary and mentioned in the IFU, that
information should also be included in the SSCP.
4.3. Other relevant aspects of safety should be described. If the device has been
subject to any field safety corrective action (FSCA including FSN), the date of

The summary of clinical evaluation as referred to in Annex XIV, and relevant
information on post-market clinical follow-up
This part of section 5 relates to content intended for the user/healthcare
professional.
This section is intended to summarise, in a comprehensive manner, the clinical
evaluation results and the clinical data67 forming the clinical evidence68 for the
confirmation of conformity with relevant general safety and performance
requirements69, the evaluation of undesirable side-effects and the acceptability of
the benefit-risk ratio70.
It shall be an objective and balanced summary of the clinical evaluation71 results
of all the available clinical data related to the device in question, whether
favourable, unfavourable, and/or inconclusive.
See suggested headings for this section in the Appendix of this document.
5.1. The SSCP should include a statement if conformity of the device was
assessed and endorsed by the NB on the basis of equivalence. If
equivalence was used, then the device(s) for which equivalence has been
demonstrated should be identified by name and Basic UDI-DI if available,
together with the name(s) of its/their manufacturer(s).
The SSCP should also include a statement whether the equivalent device’s
SSCP is available in Eudamed. If not available in Eudamed, the SSCP should
include a summary of the clinical data pertaining to the equivalent device,
written in accordance with the recommendations of this section 5, with a clear
note that it relates to the equivalent device. It should be evident from the
summary what the clinical evidence for the equivalent device was based on:
whether it was clinical investigations of that device itself, or if any other data
were used and then the sources of that data. Also include a summary of how
long-term safety and performance of the equivalent device has been
confirmed.
5.2. All clinical investigations of the device in question, conducted before the CEmarking, should be summarised. It is recommended to keep the format clear
by grouping the information for each study. The summary of each
investigation should include the following non-exclusive list:
