1. Introduction
When a sponsor of a clinical investigation shall submit an application according to article 70(1) of
the MDR, the application shall be accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter II of
Annex XV of the MDR. The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) is part of the required documentation and
is one of the means by which the sponsor is to fulfil the requirement in section 2.7 of Chapter I of
Annex XV of the MDR which states that the investigator shall have access to technical and clinical
data regarding the device that is being investigated. This includes the intended purpose(s),
design, the basic fundamental scientific principles behind the design and the level of objective
evidence already in place, to assure its safety and functionality during the investigation. For the
purpose of this guidance document, medical devices, accessories for medical devices, and
products listed in Annex XVI shall hereinafter be referred to as ‘devices’. 5
Section 2 of Chapter II of Annex XV of the MDR describes the required content of the IB. Please
note that by submitting complete applications and documents that contain all the required content,
this helps competent authorities in assessing the application, which facilitates the review process.
Prior to submission of the IB, sponsor is recommended to complete the checklist in Appendix A
of this guidance, to ensure the IB meets the minimum requirements for validation of the application
per article 70 of the MDR. The checklist, if used, should be included together with the IB in the
submission.
When preparing the IB, sponsors are encouraged to review the full details of the regulation as
well as the normative Annex B of the international standard ISO14155:2020 Clinical investigation
of medical devices for human subjects - Good clinical practice.
This guidance document is intended to support sponsors in developing their IB by describing in
greater detail what type of information is expected in the respective IB sections, in order to preempt questions from the competent authorities during the assessment of the clinical investigation
application. The guidance is based on the requirements of both the MDR and ISO14155:2020 as
well as experience from the competent authorities.
Note that any updates to the IB or other relevant information that is newly available shall be
brought to the attention of the investigators in a timely manner 6. Further, when the IB is updated,
the sponsor needs to notify the member states concerned within one week 7. Changes made to
the IB shall be clearly identifiable.
Note that the scope of this guidance is IBs written for clinical investigations as defined by the
MDR, and it is not intended to be applied for performance study IBs under the IVDR.

2. Content of the Investigator’s Brochure
The IB shall contain the clinical and non-clinical information on the investigational device that is
relevant for the investigation and available at the time of application. The information shall be
presented in a concise, simple, objective, balanced, and non-promotional form that enables a
potential investigator and the investigation site team, to understand it and make his/her own

unbiased benefit-risk analysis of the appropriateness of exposing study participants to the
investigational device. Further the IB should contain sufficient information to allow safe and
correct use of the device.
Note that it is preferred for all necessary information to be included in the IB. However, if it is
decided to move part of the information to annexes, then a clear reference should be made in the
IB and the annexes enclosed with the application. The reference in the IB should clearly state the
title of the referenced document and the section in which the information is given. A summary of
the referenced document should still be provided in the IB, as the IB should be possible to read
as a stand-alone document.

Administrative details

The IB shall be clearly identified. The first page(s) should contain a proper identification of the IB
with the name of the investigational device, a document reference number, version and date of
the IB, if appropriate a confidentiality statement, a summary of the revision history and table of
contents.
The name and address of the sponsor of the clinical investigation should be given, and of the
manufacturer of the investigational device, if different from the sponsor.
The page number and total number of pages of the document should be indicated on each page
of the IB.

2.1.

Investigational device information

According to section 2.1, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include identification
and description of the device, including information on the intended purpose, the risk classification
and applicable classification rule of the regulation, design and manufacturing of the device and
reference to previous and similar generations of the device.
This investigational device information should include the following elements, if applicable:

2.1.1.

Identification of the device

2.1.2.

Intended purpose

If several names are used for the same device, this should be explained, and care taken to use
consistent terminology throughout the study documentation, to avoid confusion.

State the intended purpose 8 with a clear specification of the indications, contra-indications, the
patient target group or groups, and the intended users, as appropriate 9.
If there is a known difference between the intended purpose in the clinical investigation (due to
development stage, study design or other reasons) and the planned intended purpose when the
device will be placed on the market, this difference should be clearly stated.

8 Article 2(12) of the MDR.

9 Aligned with section 23(4)b in Annex I of the MDR.

Medical Device

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-5

If the device has already been CE-marked and placed on the market, it should be explained
whether the intended purpose of device in the clinical investigation is different from the intended
purpose for which the device has been CE marked, or if it is to be further assessed within the
scope of its intended purpose. This should be clearly specified.

2.1.3.

Intended clinical performance 10

Describe in clinical terms the performance that the device is intended to achieve. I.e. describe
how (the mechanisms through which) the device is able to achieve its intended purpose as
claimed by the manufacturer, thereby leading to a clinical benefit for patients, when used as
intended by the manufacturer.
The ‘clinical benefit’ means the positive impact of a device on the health of an individual,
expressed in terms of a meaningful, measurable, patient-relevant clinical outcome(s), including
outcome(s) related to diagnosis, or a positive impact on patient management or public health 11.
Describe the intended clinical benefits to patients with relevant and specified clinical outcome
parameters. The clinical benefit could be resulting from any direct or indirect medical effects which
stem from the technical or functional characteristics of the device, including diagnostic
characteristics.
For products without an intended medical purpose that are covered by Annex XVI of the MDR,
the requirement to demonstrate a clinical benefit shall be understood as a requirement to
demonstrate the performance of the device 12.

2.1.4.

Qualification and classification

Provide a rationale for why the device qualifies i.e. has regulatory status as a medical device, an
accessory for a medical device or a product listed in Annex XVI. Compare the intended purpose
to the applicable definition in article 2(1), 2(2) or annex XVI of the MDR, and state the applicable
risk class according to Annex VIII of the MDR.
For borderline products (i.e. where there could be uncertainty whether the product is a device or
a medicinal product), it is of particular importance to include the scientific rationale for the
qualification as device, and to align with the MDCG 2022-5 guidance 13.
Further, if the study is a study combining device and medicinal product, clear information on the
regulatory status of both device and drug components should be provided.

the design and intended use of the investigational device, if available.

2.1.6.
2.1.6.1.

General description of the device:
Design

The IB shall contain a description of the critical and fundamental design (e. g. the technical or
scientific principles applied) of the relevant components/parts of the device, so that the device,
when used according to the instructions, will be able to achieve the intended purpose. The
description should be as clear and fundamental as reasonably possibly, not assuming that all
intended readers are already experts in the field. Describe the operation of the device and its
mode of action, along with supporting scientific literature if available.

2.1.6.1.1.

Description of the key functional elements

Include a general description of the key functional elements, e.g. its parts/components (including
software if appropriate), its formulation 17, its composition, its functionality and, where relevant, its
qualitative and quantitative composition. Where appropriate, this should include labelled pictorial
representations (e.g. diagrams, photographs, and drawings), clearly indicating key
parts/components, including sufficient explanation to understand the drawings and diagrams.
Often, animations or recordings are made to clarify the mechanism of action and specific features
of a device; if this is the case, a copy or link to these can be provided in or together with the IB as
a supporting way to explain the design and working principles of complex devices; nevertheless,
these are considered complementary and do not fully replace a written description of the
mechanism of action in the IB.

2.1.6.1.2.

Overview of materials used

A clear overview of materials used in the device should be provided, preferably in a tabular format.
In addition, detailed information for all materials coming into contact with the human body (i.e., in
contact with tissues or body fluids of a patient, health care professional, or other user, even if

biocompatibility and biological safety. Refer to section 2.3.2.3.2 below for further guidance.
If relevant, details of any medicinal substances, non-viable human or animal tissues or their
derivates, or other biologically active substances must also be included. See also section 2.6
below.

2.1.6.1.3.

Technical specifications

Technical specifications, such as features, dimensions and performance attributes, of the device
and any variants/configurations and accessories that would typically appear in the device
specification made available to the user, for example in brochures, catalogues and similar
publications should be provided. This concerns the variants/configurations and accessories to be
used in the clinical investigation.

2.1.7.

Summary of relevant manufacturing processes

The IB should contain information on how the manufacturing process has been designed to
ensure sufficient device quality and robustness, considering e. g. known or foreseeable variability
inherent to biological materials and other critical components or raw materials which may cause
challenges that might jeopardize device performance unless they are sufficiently controlled.
Provide a summary of relevant manufacturing processes and the corresponding quality controls
(including verifications and validations as well as final testing) applied to demonstrate that the
investigational devices are manufactured and verified under a controlled process according to the
applicable regulations. This can be done by means of a manufacturing flowchart.

2.1.8.

Reference to previous and similar generations of the device

2.1.9.

Overview of identified equivalent or, if any, similar devices available

An overview of the previous and similar versions of the device (e.g., in table format) is
recommended, if applicable. This overview should specifically focus on the devices used clinically
and in confirmatory pre-clinical testing, i.e. the late stages of development. Preferably, this table
contains for each iteration the version number, a photograph/drawing and a brief overview and
rationale of changes with regards to the previous iteration.

As background for the evaluation of clinical data (refer to section 2.4 in chapter II Annex XV of
the MDR as well as section 2.4 in this guidance document) and for the assessment of anticipated
benefits per article 62(4e) of the MDR, the sponsor should provide an overview of identified
equivalent if any, or relevant similar devices available in the Union or international markets. A
brief description of similar devices including the key features and their intended purpose(s)
focusing on the novelty of the current device when compared to other is sufficient.

11

2.2.

MDCG 2024-5

Labels and instructions for use

According to section 2.2, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include manufacturer’s
instructions for installation, maintenance, maintaining of hygienic standards and use of the
investigational device, including any necessary storage and handling requirements, as well as, to
the extent that such information is available, information to be placed on the label, and instructions
for use to be provided with the device. In addition, information relating to any relevant training
required is to be included.
Sponsor needs to check national legislation, which may require labelling and instructions for use
to be in national language.

2.2.1.

Instructions for use

For devices which do not bear CE marking, “Instructions for Use” (IFU) document(s) should be
included in the application dossier, as part of the IB or as a separate document referenced from
IB. Instructions for use should contain:
•
•

The information to be provided with the device when placed on the market according to
the requirements listed in chapter III, Annex I of the MDR,to the extent that such
information is available,
Instructions on the use and operation of the device need to be sufficiently detailed to
prevent user errors and should allow the reader to understand how the device is to be
operated without having an actual device at hand. Graphic illustrations are recommended.

•

Information on preparation for use and any intended re-use (e.g., cleaning, sterilization),
any pre-use safety or performance checks and any precautions to be taken after use (e.g.,
disposal), if relevant.

•

Instructions for installation and maintenance of the device, including any precautions to
be taken into consideration prior to installation and service, to ensure user and patient
safety.

•

Storage and handling requirements as well as shelf life (when appropriate) of the
investigational device should be specified.

If the investigational device already bears the CE-marking and is to be used outside the intended
purpose of the CE mark during the clinical investigation study specific IFU document(s) should
be included in the application dossier, as part of the IB or as a separate document referenced
from IB. Moreover:
•

A description of how the device will be used differently during the clinical
investigation must be included in the IB. There may be situations when the
difference in use vs the CE mark is minimal and there may be situations where the
difference is significant. Only where there are minimal differences of use, it may
be sufficient that the clarification of the use difference is provided in the IB itself.
Provided that safe and effective use of the device can be ensured without a study
specific IFU, the CE marked IFU does not need to be updated.

•

The manufacturer’s IFU, covered by the CE mark, should be provided, in addition.

12

Medical Device

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-5

If the investigational device and/or comparator device already bears the CE-marking, and is to be
used within the intended purpose of the CE-mark during the clinical investigation, the
manufacturer’s IFU, covered by the CE mark, must be provided.

2.2.2.

Labels

Labels of the investigational device should contain, to the extent that such information is
available, the information to be provided with the device when placed on the market 18,
according to the requirements listed in chapter III, Annex I of the MDR. Note in particular the
specific requirement which is applicable if the investigational device is intended for clinical
investigation only; to include the text ‘exclusively for clinical investigation” on the labels.
Sponsor needs to check national legislation, which may require labels to include ‘exclusively for
clinical investigation” in national language.
It is recommended to include the graphic presentation of the device labels, either in the IB or as
separate documents which are referenced from the IB.
Note that the requirements for labelling apply also to investigational software devices.

2.2.3.

Training

2.2.4.

Implant card

Training needs and plans for training should be described in the IB.

In the case of a clinical investigation with an implantable device, it is recommended that a study
implant card is provided to the patient for safety reasons. Refer to article 18 of the MDR for
detailed requirements on content of the implant card, and to MDCG guidance documents MDCG
2019-8 19 and MDCG 2021-11 20 for additional guidance.

2.3.

Pre-clinical evaluation

According to section 2.3, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include a pre-clinical
evaluation based on relevant pre-clinical testing and experimental data, in particular in-design
calculations, in vitro tests, ex vivo tests, animal tests, mechanical or electrical tests, reliability
tests, sterilisation validation, software verification and validation, performance tests, evaluation of
biocompatibility and biological safety, as applicable.

2.3.1.

General recommendations regarding pre-clinical evaluation

Note that it is a requirement of the MDR that the investigational device(s) conform(s) to the
applicable general safety and performance requirements (GSPR) set out in Annex I of the MDR
18 Investigational devices are not required to include UDI labelling.

apart from the aspects covered by the clinical investigation and that, with regard to those aspects,
every precaution has been taken to protect the health and safety of the subjects. This includes,
where appropriate, technical and biological safety testing and pre-clinical evaluation, as well as
provisions in the field of occupational safety and accident prevention, taking into consideration
the state of the art. 21
As a general principle, pre-clinical tests have to be completed before a clinical investigation
application is made. Testing would at least have to be completed to an extent that supports the
planned use of the device in the clinical investigation. As an example, if the exposure to the
device in the clinical investigation is shorter than the planned exposure of the final marketed
device, it might be sufficient to provide the data that ensures that the characteristics and
performance of the device is not adversely affected during the time the device is used in the
clinical investigation. The level of objective evidence of compliance available versus planned
should be easily accessible through the GSPR information (refer also to section 2.7 below).
In situations where some aspects of pre-clinical testing have not been completed, this should be
clearly highlighted and justified. If equivalence is claimed as a reason for not performing some of
the pre-clinical testing, clarify the technical, biological, and clinical grounds for this 22.
The IB should include a summary of the pre-clinical testing that has been performed on the
investigational device, together with an evaluation of the results of such testing, justifying its use
in/on human subjects.
Pre-clinical testing should be made according to relevant standards and common specifications,
unless a justification based on scientific grounds is provided to not conduct certain tests or not
adhering to standards and/or common specifications.
Any deviations from acceptance criteria need to be justified.
Test summaries could preferably be provided in tabular format and should include:
•

Reference standard or common specification

•

Reference to test report for traceability 23

•

For each test, information on:
•

Specific reference in the standard applied

•

GLP status when relevant (if non-GLP, this should be justified)

•

Acceptance criteria

•

•

The applicant should either confirm that the device used was identical to the
investigational device for clinical use (including e.g., sterilization) or detail any
differences between the device used tested pre-clinically (e.g., mechanical testing,
fatigue testing, reliability testing, animal studies, biocompatibility studies) and used
clinically. If the device that will be used in the clinical investigation differs from the
device used in pre-clinical studies, a justification of the transposability of the preclinical results should be provided.

•

It should be clearly indicated whether the test has been performed on parts of, or
the entire device.

Note that during assessment of the clinical investigation application, the full study reports of any
pre-clinical study may be requested; to reduce the overall time to clinical investigation approval
(take into consideration there is only one possible round of questions following MDR), the
applicant may consider submitting the full study reports of certain critical studies (such as animal
tests, if applicable) at the time of the initial application along with a justification for doing so. Please
note that even if full pre-clinical study-reports are submitted, there is an obligation to include a
summary of the pre-clinical studies in the IB. This summary should provide an overview of the
scope, results and evaluation of the results, accessible also to non-experts.
Note that if references are made to separate reports, the reference should point to the sections
of interest in the referenced document.

intended purpose as stated by the manufacturer. The manufacturer should establish (i.e. define,
document, and implement) the clinical performance requirements of the device and the
corresponding device performance specifications for the intended use and device claims.
Provide information on conducted performance tests. If no performance testing has been
conducted, this should be explicitly justified (e.g. when there is a previous version of the device
with the same intended purpose and function, for which performance has been evaluated, that is
already placed on the market, and the current investigational device does not implement any
significant change that might impact performance).

Usability tests

Usability is defined in the European standard EN 62366-1 30 as the characteristic of the user
interface that establishes effectiveness, efficiency, ease of user learning and user satisfaction in
the intended use environment.
All aspects of usability, including effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction, can either
increase or decrease safety of a medical device. Usability is created by characteristics of the user
interface that facilitate use, i.e., to make it easier for the user to perceive information presented
by the user interface, to understand and to make decisions based on that information, and to
interact with the medical device to achieve specified goals in the intended use environments.
Many of these factors can influence safety and performance 31 to various extents.
Usability test is defined as a method for exploring or evaluating a user interface with intended
users within a specified intended use environment 32. Usability tests may be preclinical or clinical
depending on the test design. In situations where the usability test fulfils the definition of a clinical
investigation 33, the test is to be reported in the Existing clinical data section of the IB, while the
pre-clinical usability tests are to be presented in the Preclinical evaluation section.

2.3.2.3.1.

Mechanical, electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility tests

Mechanical and electrical safety tests are important to ensure that the investigational device is
safe for users and patients. The extent of testing required varies depending on type of device,
and may include tests of both materials, parts, and the final device.
There are specific standards for some types of devices, and the manufacturer is expected to
adhere to those that are relevant, or describe the measures taken and procedures used to achieve
at least the same requirement level as described in the relevant standard.
As an example, the IEC 60601 standard series is applicable to electrical devices.

2.3.2.3.2.

Biocompatibility and biological safety

To address the compatibility between an investigational device and biological tissues, cells and
body fluids, a biological risk assessment should be carried out according to ISO 10993 standard
series.
ISO 10993 part 1 provides the general principles for a risk-based approach to biological safety
evaluation and material characterization. The other parts of the ISO 10993 standard series cover
tests methods for different aspects of biocompatibility and biological safety.
The extent of biocompatibility and biological testing will depend on the intended purpose, available
information, and demonstration of equivalence to other devices. Guidance on equivalence is
provided in MDCG 2020-5.
Results from the evaluation of biocompatibility and biological safety shall be summarized in the
IB. The following information will have to be provided, at a minimum,
-

adhered to and if anything has been added such as additives or colorants.
The nature, degree, frequency, and duration of the exposure.
Criteria for determining the acceptability of the material for the intended purpose and if
applicable demonstration of equivalence to other devices.
Rationale for test strategy (selection and/or waiving of tests) and test samples. Material
characterization according to ISO 10993-18 is expected, and when applicable
toxicological risk assessment according to ISO 10993-17. Further, there are special
requirements in point 12, Annex I of MDR for devices incorporating a substance
considered to be a medicinal product and devices that are composed of substances or of
combinations of substances that are absorbed by or locally dispersed in the human body.

Software verification and validation

For devices that incorporate software or for software that are devices in themselves, describe the
software design and development process and evidence of the validation of the software, as used
in the finished device. This information should typically include the summary results of all
verification, validation and testing performed both in-house and in a simulated or actual user
environment prior to final release. It should also address all of the different hardware
configurations and, where applicable, operating systems identified in the information supplied by
the manufacturer.
For software, a number of standards are available. Three standards are elaborated upon
underneath, but this list is not exhaustive, and it should be noted that other standards can also
be applicable.
IEC 62304:2006 Medical device software – Software life cycle processes, covers both software
as a component of a medical device and standalone software (a medical device in its own right).

safety and security of health software products.
IEC 60601-1:2005 Medical electrical equipment – Part 1: General requirements for basic safety
and essential performance, contains a section specifically on programmable electrical medical
systems.
For the choice of methods and standards used for software verification and validation, the
manufacturer should provide a rationale.

2.3.2.3.4.

Cybersecurity tests

For devices that incorporate software or for software that are devices in themselves, the software
should be designed and manufactured in accordance with the state of the art, considering the
principles of the development life cycle, risk management, including information security,
verification and validation 34.
A description of how testing for verification and validation of security was performed should be
provided. Methods can include security feature testing, fuzz testing, vulnerability scanning and
penetration testing. Additional security testing can be done by using tools for secure code analysis
and tools that scan for open source code and libraries used in the device, to identify components
with known issues. Please refer to MDCG 2019-16 Guidance on Cybersecurity for medical
devices for further details.

2.3.2.3.5.

Validation of cleaning, disinfection and sterilization

Existing clinical data

According to section 2.4, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include existing clinical
data, in particular:
-

from relevant scientific literature available relating to the safety, performance, clinical
benefits to patients, design characteristics and intended purpose of the device and/or of
equivalent or similar devices.
other relevant clinical data available relating to the safety, performance, clinical benefits
to patients, design characteristics and intended purpose of equivalent or similar devices
of the same manufacturer, including length of time on the market and a review of
performance, clinical benefit and safety-related issues and any corrective actions taken.

If applicable an overview of ongoing and completed clinical investigations with the investigational
device should be provided. Tabular presentation of clinical investigation information is
recommended, including number of subjects, indication for use, endpoints, etc. In addition, it
might be relevant to provide such information on devices that have similar characteristics, as well
as information on studies with the investigational device that relate to other indications for use. If
equivalence with previous generations of the device or competitor devices based on the same
technology is claimed, the demonstration of equivalence should be done in line with the provisions
in Section 3 of Annex XIV of the MDR and the MDCG guidance 2020-5 Clinical Evaluation Equivalence. A guide for manufacturers and notified bodies.
The overview must provide sufficient and clear information on the previous clinical
investigation(s), including sites/centres, safety and performance results and an analysis of
adverse device effects, serious adverse events (SAE) and any history of modification or recall of
the investigational device.
In case the clinical investigation has a phased approach, and the study is expanded to other sites
that were not involved in the initial phase, it is recommended to review and update, if necessary,
the IB with a summary or interim analysis of the current status discussing any notable information
such as SAEs. Ensure that interim analyses are based on clean data.
For CE-marked devices evaluated outside the intended purpose as well as in situations where
there are previous marketed generations of the device, please provide a summary of the latest
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for class II-III devices or Post Market Surveillance Report
(PMSR) for class I devices.
If applicable any compassionate use of the device should be described, with information on the
extent of use and any relevant finding if available.

2.5.

Risk management of the investigational device

According to section 2.5, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include a summary of
the benefit-risk analysis and the risk management, including information regarding known or
foreseeable risks, any undesirable side-effects, contraindications, and warnings.
Sponsors conducting clinical investigations of CE marked devices which are being investigated
outside the intended purpose for which they have been CE-marked, need to make sure that the
differences in use (e.g. different duration, location, user or patient population) and any new risks
that arise from them have been appropriately addressed in the risk management and that this is
described in the IB. The risk management process needs to be described. It should describe risk

21

Medical Device

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-5

analysis, risk evaluation and risk control/mitigation (this last part includes benefit-risk analysis). It
should also describe the levels used for assigning probabilities and severities of harm and the
risk-acceptability criteria that are used (in other words: When do the benefits outweigh the risks?).
Refer to ISO 14971:2019 40 and ISO/TC 24971:2020 41 for more info on the application of risk
management to medical devices and Annex H in ISO 14155:2020 on the application of ISO 14971
to clinical investigations.
When needed, the competent authority may request that the full Risk Analysis Table, Risk
Management Plan and/or Risk Management Report as well as actual data and evaluations from
specific tests are provided. If these documents are referenced in the IB, the references to the
sections of interest in the documents should be provided in the IB.
Some examples of types of risk analyses:
-

HAZOP: Hazard and Operability
FMEA: Failure mode and effects analysis
FTA: Fault tree analysis
Procedure analysis

The risk management methods and techniques listed above should normally be used in
combination so that all reasonably foreseeable risks are identified and managed.
Detail what information was used to estimate the risks. For example published standards or
articles about similar devices, expert assessments, tests or simulations.
It might be useful to describe the estimation scales that are used for probability and severity
estimations. For example, is it a risk matrix of 3 x 3, a 4 x 5, a 5 x 5. Note that matrices with more
than five levels can require significantly more data to be able to distinguish between the various
levels and to avoid overlap of the levels. Rationales for the selection of matrices and their outcome
scores should be documented. It is also to be noted that matrices with three levels might not
always be sufficiently accurate for adequate decision making. There is no need that these
matrices be balanced. For example, a 4 × 5 matrix could be appropriate for a given application.
Regarding probabilities levels such as 1:10, 1:100 may be used. The levels of severity should be
selected based on what is relevant for the device, its intended use and users.
Risk control measures should be taken to reduce any identified risks as far as possible. Risk
control measures are generally divided into three broad categories, in order of priority:
•

Risk elimination/reduction through safe design and manufacture, e.g. identifying risks
through pre-clinical testing and pre-clinical evaluation and making changes in design
or manufacturing in advance of the clinical investigation; completion of bench testing,
pre-clinical evaluation, and verification and validation of design prior to
commencement of the clinical investigation application; designing the clinical
investigation to be conducted in accordance with relevant international standards,
consensus guidance, and good clinical practice; performance of the study at
specialised clinical sites only, with investigators meeting specific specialist criteria.

•

Protective measures, e.g.; physical protective measures of the device; in the context
of a clinical investigation, measures such as staged enrolment and interim pre-

specified subject safety assessment, pre-specified stopping rules, narrow study
population with more favourable benefit-risk profile, independent study oversight (such
as data monitoring committees, clinical events committees), frequent and accurate
reporting and investigation of SAEs and device deficiencies (DDs), accurate recording
of AEs/SAEs/DDs, including the timing and clinical context and a description of any
medical interventions provided and the associated outcomes.
•

Communication of safety information and residual risks, e.g., through patient
information sheet; training of investigational staff on residual risks; provision of
warnings, precautions, and contra-indications on labelling, in the instructions for use,
and in the IB; optimizing communication among sites in order to rapidly communicate
and informs sites of any emerging risks; communicating safety data and residual risks
with ethics committee(s) and competent authority(ies) to determine if any additional
subject protection measures are needed.

Please provide, in the IB, information on any identified residual risks, including risk-benefit
analysis of these residual risks. Please provide a list of warnings, precautions, and contraindications for the investigational device.

2.5.1.

Anticipated Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device
Effects (SADEs)

Based on their internal risk management documents sponsors are expected to assess anticipated
frequency of occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and serious adverse device effects
(SADEs). The outcomes of this assessment could preferably be presented in a tabular format in
the IB.The following table is an example of recommended characteristics of the events to include.
Anticipated
SAE/SADE

Related to
device or
procedure

Probability of
occurrence

Reference (basis of these numbers)

Such a table will help the sponsor with its duties regarding the risk assessment of the device and
the procedures. It could also be used by the competent authorities for the assessment of the riskbenefit of the clinical investigation and safety follow up during the conduct of study. When the
same source is used, it can reduce the risk of divergent interpretation between sponsor and
competent authorities.
In the safety analysis of the SAE reports, the table would help determine whether the benefit/risk
ratio of the clinical investigation has changed due to the reported SAE/SADE. When a SAE/SADE
is reported it can be compared to the table to determine whether it was listed among the
anticipated SAEs/SADEs and the observed/reported frequency of SAEs/SADEs can be compared
to the expected/previously reported frequency.

Sponsors are reminded that if new data arises that is likely to substantially impact the safety,
health or rights of the subjects or the robustness or reliability of the clinical data generated by the
clinical investigation, it shall notify within one week the member states in which the clinical
investigation is being conducted 42. The new data needs to be reflected in updated documents
included with the notification of substantial modification to the competent authorities. When
updating the IB during the conduct of the clinical investigation, the sponsor is expected to revise
the table with up-to-date information including safety reports arising from the ongoing clinical
investigation.
Sponsors are further encouraged to link information in the anticipated SAE table to the IMDRF
codes 43 that will be used in the future European database on medical device (EUDAMED) 44, and
which are already used in the manufacturers incidents report (MIR) 45. This will support the device
community (manufacturer, competent authorities, notified body) to get a global view of the safety
of a device throughout its lifecycle.

Note that methods specified in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC shall be used to verify the quality,
safety and usefulness of substances which, if used separately, would be considered to be a
medicinal product within the meaning of point (2) of Article 1 of that directive. 46
For CE-marked devices which are unaltered but used outside the intended purpose, the quality
aspects in section 2.6.2 may be considered as appropriately addressed during the conformity
assessment by the Notified Body, and the evidence submitted may be adapted accordingly.

2.6.1.

General requirements

For medicinal substances the chemical name, chemical and structural formula should be
presented.
In case a medicinal product is included in the device, it could be relevant to reference that a

Fulfilment of General Safety and Performance Requirements

According to section 2.7, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include a list detailing
the fulfilment of the relevant GSPR set out in Annex I of the MDR, including the standards and
any common specifications applied, in full or in part, as well as a description of the solutions for
fulfilling the relevant GSPRs, in so far as those standards and common specifications have not or
have only been partly fulfilled or are lacking.
The IB should provide an overview of which GSPRs are applicable for the investigational device
and a rationale for any GSPRs indicated as not applicable. Further, it should be clearly indicated

53 Note for guidance on minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via

human and veterinary medicinal products (EMA/410/01 rev.3) (europa.eu).
54 EMA/CHMP/BWP/706271/2010 Committee for medicinal products for human use (CHMP) Guideline on
plasma-derived medicinal products.

which GSPRs that have already been addressed by objective evidence and which GSPRs that
will be addressed in the proposed study. Reference can be made to the relevant GSPR
documentation.
The overview should indicate the means (e.g. standard, CS, internal procedure) to address each
applicable GSPR and the corresponding evidence, e. g. by listing the report(s). It is not sufficient
to list the standards only and it is not sufficient to list the file in which the report will be placed, e.
g. the risk management file. It is also not appropriate to list the title of a report that is not yet
available. The GSPR documentation should thus contain both a prospective and retrospective
summary of compliance, and clearly show the evidence already evaluated.
With regard to the GSPRs that are not yet met but will be covered by the investigation, please
identify them clearly and indicate how every precaution has been taken to protect the health and
safety of the subjects and other users.
If some GSPRs are not relevant for the investigational device, this should be indicated and briefly
justified.
All of the information above is preferably presented in the format of the checklist of GSPRs,
standards, common specifications and scientific advice, which can be found as an annex in the
MDCG 2021-8 guidance 55. This template has two sections: Section A where standards, common
specifications and scientific advice can be listed, and the level of compliance is indicated. Section
B is a matrix for documenting the fulfilment of the GSPRs, referencing the applied standards or
common specifications, as well as the evidence of conformance, documentation and
justification/comment in case of deviation. If documenting the conformance with a particular
requirement is the purpose of the current clinical investigation, this should be clearly indicated in
the matrix.
In case CE-marked devices are investigated in the clinical investigation, fulfilment of the GSPRs
for the intended purpose(s) covered by the CE-mark should be confirmed by providing the EU
Declaration of Conformity 56 issued by the manufacturer and the certificate issued by the Notified
Body 57 (if applicable, depending on device classification).

2.8.

Procedures

According to section 2.8, chapter II, Annex XV of the MDR, the IB should include a detailed
description of the clinical procedures and diagnostic tests used in the course of the clinical
investigation and in particular information on any deviation from normal clinical practice.
All involved procedures may impact the overall risk assessment of the clinical investigation and
the sponsor needs to ensure that risks associated with the planned use of the investigational
device have been included in the risk assessment.
If the use of the investigational device deviates from normal clinical practice this should be
highlighted. Note that it is appropriate to describe what is considered normal clinical practice in
this section.

Specify any other devices or medicinal products to be used in combination with the investigational
device and comment on their regulatory status. It is necessary to describe any potential new risks
with such combinations and how these are managed. In addition, it is necessary to ensure that
the combined use planned in the investigation does not impact the regulatory status of the other
devices or medicinal products.
