Introduction
A clinical evaluation assessment report (CEAR) is a report used by the notified body to clearly document the
conclusions of its assessment of the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the clinical evaluation report
(CER) and the related clinical evaluation that was conducted – a core requirement of the Medical Device Regulation
(EU) 2017/745 (MDR).
The clinical evaluation must be a part of the manufacturer's quality management. It should also be aligned with and
reflected in other aspects of the technical documentation, such as:
• The interface of the clinical evaluation with the risk management process and its appraisal and analysis of the preclinical and clinical evaluation and their relevance for the demonstration of conformity with the relevant
requirements in Annex I.1
• Post-market surveillance including any corrective and preventive actions involving the device.
• Post-market clinical follow-up plan and where appropriate the post-market clinical follow-up report.
• Instructions for use, which provide adequate information on intended purpose, proper use and warnings about
risks to patients and healthcare practitioners.
As part of its conformity assessment activities the notified body shall examine, validate and verify that manufacturers'
procedures and documentation adequately address the requirements relating to the technical documentation2 and
clearly document its assessment3.
The notified body shall review the clinical evidence presented by the manufacturer in the clinical evaluation report
and the related clinical evaluation that was conducted, which includes4:






Assessing the suitability of using data from claimed equivalent devices, taking into account factors such as new
indications and innovation. The notified body shall clearly document its conclusions on the claimed equivalence,
and on the relevance and adequacy of the data for demonstrating conformity. For any characteristic of the device
claimed as innovative by the manufacturer or for new indications, the notified body shall assess to what extent
specific claims are supported by specific pre-clinical and clinical data and risk analysis.
Verifying that the clinical evidence and the clinical evaluation are adequate and shall verify the conclusions drawn
by the manufacturer on the conformity with the relevant general safety and performance requirements. That
verification shall include consideration of the adequacy of the benefit-risk determination, the risk management,
the instructions for use, the user training and the manufacturer's post-market surveillance plan, and include a
review of the need for, and the adequacy of, the PMCF plan proposed, where applicable.
Considering the clinical evaluation and the benefit-risk determination, and whether specific milestones need to be
defined to allow the notified body to review updates to the clinical evidence that result from post-market
surveillance and PMCF data.

The outcome of this assessment must be clearly documented in the CEAR.5 A harmonised CEAR template provides a
standardised method for documenting the notified body’s assessment of the manufacturer’s clinical evaluation and
related documents. CEARs in this format will also support specific additional requirements such as the clinical
evaluation consultation procedure6 and reviews by designating authorities.7
Scope
This template applies to MDR Annexes IX section 4 and Annex X section 3. It also applies to assessments of technical
documentations on a sampling basis for class IIa/IIb devices in accordance with Annex IX sections 2.3 and 3.5 and

Section 10 of Annex XI(A).8 Aspects related to the clinical evaluation assessment are also laid down in Section 4.5.5
and other relevant sections of Annex VII. It also applies to medical devices for which clinical data is not deemed
appropriate,9 to demonstrate conformity with Annex I, and the demonstration of an adequate justification for this.10
Approach to Template
Please note that the explanatory text under each heading provides brief descriptions of the type of information which
will be included by the notified body, however it is not an all-inclusive list and further detail may be required depending
upon the device or the intended purpose for which it will be used. This template represents the minimum content for
a CEAR and needs to be incorporated into the process and procedures of the notified body.11 The CEAR shall also make
a recommendation to support a final review and a final decision to be taken by the notified body.
Any non-compliances identified during the assessment of the aspects described in the relevant sections of the
template, as well as the appropriate follow up actions taken by the manufacturer to close them need to be
documented. This template may be used by the notified body to document the non-compliance/deficiencies and
queries raised during the assessment and the assessment of responses received. It is important to note that the
completed CEAR may not necessarily contain comprehensive information regarding the non-compliance/deficiencies,
which were raised by the notified body during the course of the assessment. The CEAR shall document the outcome12
and the conclusions13 of the assessment.
Designating authorities shall assess whether the clinical evaluation assessment was conducted appropriately,
considering the assessment, procedures, associated documentation and the conclusions;14 Designating authorities will
have access to the complete ‘audit trail’ of the notified body.
Expert panels who are conducting a clinical evaluation consultation procedure shall assess the CEAR, however they
may not have access to the complete conformity assessment for the device and associated procedures and
documentation. To enable the expert panel work, the CEAR shall provide sufficient information with respect to the
clinical evidence provided by the manufacturer, in particular concerning the benefit-risk determination, the
consistency of that evidence with the intended purpose, including the medical indication or indications and the PMCF
plan.15 Expert panels may also request the notified body to present its conclusions regarding the clinical evaluation
assessment report.16
It is only once all the non-compliances have been closed out that the relevant tick-box should be completed to signal
that the assessment is positive. In the rare event that there is one or more open minor non-compliances at the
conclusion of the assessment stage, this must be clearly described in the template, together with appropriate followup actions to close them, and expected completion timelines to be followed by the manufacturer under the
supervision of the notified body.
The sections covered in Annex I of this template are generally applicable depending on the type of assessment. The
sections covered in Annex II may be applicable, depending upon the device under evaluation. All applicable sections
should be completed, relevant conclusions reached and corresponding boxes ticked for the report to be complete.
The CEAR should be signed-off by the relevant personnel in accordance with the quality management system of the
notified body. When making available the CEAR to third parties, the notified body should treat the personal data within

☐ Address all device sizes, variants, model and accessories?
☐ Address the same clinical condition?
Further information regarding literature search methods is available in MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4, section A5.
Searches for the device in question, equivalent devices and other devices (for example to support a description of the state of the art) should be described separately.
With respect to the selection criteria of the literature review, does it relate to both below:
☐ The device under evaluation or to a device demonstrated to be equivalent?
☐ The state of the art or alternative available treatment option?
The clinical evaluation should clearly describe the selection criteria with respect to the regulatory purpose to which it will apply. The CER should clearly differentiate between the two types
of data referenced above. If the data does not relate to either of the above, provide a rationale with respect to its inclusion.
Literature search protocol21
Provide a brief summary of the literature search strategy applied, commenting on:

The adequacy of search terms: for example, it should be sufficiently broad to establish benchmarks, determine the general state of the art, determine potential risk, adverse
events, undesirable side-effects, etc.
Note that a search which is restricted to the manufacturer’s own product or the name of their chosen equivalent could miss important information and therefore is not
acceptable.

Databases used (to minimize bias multiple databases should be used).

•

Acceptability of inclusion and exclusion criteria.

•

Both favourable and unfavourable data included.

•

Strategies for avoiding duplication of data (for example, across different publications or between manufacturer and published data).

•

Literature search and review protocol (i.e. how did the manufacturer test this protocol to ensure comprehensive identification of relevant data / demonstrate that all relevant
data has been retrieved?).

•

Any deviations from the manufacturer’s literature search protocol.

•

Overall conclusions regarding the adequacy of search methods, likelihood of having retrieved all relevant data, and methods used to avoid bias.

Nota bene:
•

A literature search and other retrieval of data should be carried out based on a search protocol. The search protocol should document the planning of the search before execution.

•

Once the searches have been executed, the adequacy of the searches should be verified and a literature search report should be compiled to present details of the execution, any
deviations from the literature search protocol, and the results of the search.

•

It is important that the literature search is documented to such degree that the methods can be appraised critically, the results can be verified, and the search reproduced if
necessary.

•

Abstracts lack sufficient detail to allow issues to be evaluated thoroughly and independently, but may be sufficient to allow a first evaluation of the relevance of a paper. Copies of
the full text papers and documents should be obtained for the appraisal stage.

•

The literature search protocol(s), the literature search report(s), and full text copies of relevant documents using URL links, become part of the clinical evidence and, in turn, the
technical documentation for the medical device.

Data appraisal:
Provide a brief summary of the manufacturer’s data appraisal methods (i.e. how they determine whether the data from a given study or other source of data is of sufficient quality and
relevance to be included in the clinical evaluation. This includes evaluation of criteria including study design, sources of bias, peer review, relevance to subject device, etc. Retrieved studies
and data sets should be weighted on the basis of scientific quality and relevance to the scope and objectives of the clinical evaluation for the subject devices).
Justify the acceptability of the appraisal in terms of:
