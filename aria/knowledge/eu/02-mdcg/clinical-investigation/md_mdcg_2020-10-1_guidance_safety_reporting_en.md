Introduction

Safety reporting in clinical investigations of medical devices shall be performed in line with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 –
Medical Device Regulation (MDR) Article 80(2):
The sponsor shall report, without delay to all Member States in which the clinical investigation is being conducted, all of the following by means of
the electronic system referred to in MDR Article 73:
a) any serious adverse event that has a causal relationship with the investigational device, the comparator or the investigation procedure or
where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;
b) any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not occurred,
or circumstances had been less fortunate;
c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in points a) and b).
The period for reporting shall take account of the severity of the event. Where necessary to ensure timely reporting, the sponsor may submit an
initial report that is incomplete followed up by a complete report.
Upon request by any Member State in which the clinical investigation is being conducted, the sponsor shall provide all information referred to in
paragraph 1.
For post-market clinical follow up (PMCF) investigations of CE-marked devices1 used within the intended use covered by the CE-marking, reporting
requirements of MDR Article 80(5) and (6) apply. This means that the vigilance provisions laid down in Articles 87 to 90 and in the acts adopted
pursuant to Article 91 shall apply for PMCF clinical investigations. However, this guidance document is still relevant for PMCF clinical investigations
as the reporting of serious adverse events where a causal relationship to the preceding investigational procedure has been established shall follow
the reporting procedures of clinical investigations as outlined in Article 80.

1.1 Safety reporting in the absence of Eudamed
Since the electronic system referred to in Article 73 (Eudamed) will not be available and fully functional at the Date of application of the MDR this
guidance outlines the procedures for safety reporting in clinical investigations in the absence of Eudamed.
This document defines Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting modalities and includes a summary tabulation reporting format.

Scope

2.1 Clinical investigations of medical devices
The reporting modalities and format set out in this guidance apply to:


Pre-market clinical investigations covered by Articles 62 and 74(2) of the MDR conducted with:
a) Non-CE marked devices,
b) CE marked devices used outside the intended use(s) covered by the CE-marking.
c) The term pre-market clinical investigation may also include some studies covered by MDR Article 82.
As MDR Article 82 allows member states to define national requirements for such clinical investigations, sponsors are encouraged to check
with the applicable NCA2 whether this guidance or other reporting procedures should be applied.
In situations where a clinical investigation has started using a non-CE marked device, and the right to bear the CE marking has been obtained
before the end of the clinical investigation, the SAE reporting continues until completion of the investigation, according to the clinical
investigation plan and these guidelines apply throughout the SAE reporting period.
For pre-market clinical investigations involving CE marked comparator devices used within their intended purpose, SAEs occurring in or to
subjects that are in the comparator arm of an investigation shall also be reported in accordance with these guidelines.
Note: SAEs concerning CE marked devices which meet the vigilance reporting criteria also need to be handled under the post-market
surveillance/vigilance system.



Those Post-Market Clinical Follow Up (PMCF) investigations that involve procedures additional to those performed under the normal
conditions of use of the device, and where those additional procedures imposed by the clinical investigation plan are invasive or
burdensome, covered by MDR Article 74(1). For these clinical investigations the safety reporting for events pertaining to MDR Article 80(6)
follow the Serious Adverse Event reporting process only, and are outlined in this guidance. Events pertaining to MDR Article 80(5) are
reported following the vigilance process only and are outside the scope of this guidance.



Note that other post-market clinical investigations may be subject to safety reporting requirements in line with this guidance due to
national requirements following MDR Article 82, but there is no such general requirement. Sponsors are encouraged to check with the
applicable NCA whether this guidance or other reporting procedures should be applied.



Due to the transitional provisions in MDR Article 120(11) this guidance also covers clinical investigations which have started to be conducted
in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD) prior to 26 May 2021. These
investigations may continue to be conducted after date of application of the MDR, but the reporting of serious adverse events and device
deficiencies shall be carried out in accordance with the MDR requirements from 26 May 2021 and onwards.

2.2 Medical devices used in clinical trials of medicinal products (drug trials)


2

A CE-marked device which is used outside its intended purpose, or a non-CE marked device in a clinical drug trial would implicitly have to
be assessed for safety and performance and the study shall follow both MDR (Chapter VI) and the applicable legislation for clinical drug
trials. This guidance document is then relevant for compliance with the MDR regarding safety reporting.

For the purpose of this guidance," NCAs" encompasses the National Competent Authorities of the EEA, Switzerland and Turkey.

If a drug-device study (or a drug trial) is not undertaken to assess the safety or performance of a device used in the study, the reporting
requirements of MDR Article 80 do not apply, as long as the device is CE marked and used within its intended purpose. This guidance is not
applicable, but the vigilance reporting provisions of MDR apply in those situations, as for any commercially available device. Sponsors
should make sure that the device manufacturer is notified about any incidents related to the device and the legal manufacturer of the
device is responsible for the subsequent vigilance reporting.

Definitions

3.1 Investigational device
A device that is assessed in a clinical investigation
(MDR Article 2(46))
Note: An investigational device can be a non-CE marked device or a CE marked device. The definition in MDR Article 2(46) does not differentiate
between different regulatory statuses of devices. However, the reporting requirements are different depending on whether the clinical
investigation is done for purposes described in Article 62, 74 or 82. The definition is understood to cover also the devices investigated in PMCF
investigations, even if they are not subject to notification per Art 74.1.

3.2 Adverse Event (AE)
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or any untoward clinical signs, including an abnormal laboratory finding,
in subjects, users or other persons, in the context of a clinical investigation, whether or not related to the investigational device.
(MDR Article 2(57))
Note:
a. This definition includes events that are anticipated as well as unanticipated events
b. This definition includes events occurring in the context of a clinical investigation related to the investigational device, the comparator or
the procedures3 involved.

3.3 Adverse device effect (ADE)
Any adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device or a comparator.

3.4 Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE)
Any serious adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has been identified in the last risk assessment document
upon serious adverse device effect occurred.

3.5 Device deficiency (DD)
Any inadequacy in the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of an investigational device, including malfunction, use errors
or inadequacy in information supplied by the manufacturer.
(MDR Article 2(59))

3.6 Incident
Any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to
ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect.
(MDR Article 2(64))

3

For the purpose of safety reporting all activities related to the use of a medical device may be considered procedures

Page 6 of 19

3.7 New Finding
New information discovered as the result of an inquiry/investigation/test based on the occurrence of the event. Follow-up from the event.

3.8 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Any adverse event that led to any of the following:
a) death,
b) serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in any of the following:
i. life-threatening illness or injury,
ii. permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,
iii. hospitalisation or prolongation of patient hospitalisation,
iv. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body
function,
v. chronic disease,
c) foetal distress, foetal death or a congenital physical or mental impairment or birth defect
(MDR Article 2(58))

3.9 Serious adverse device effect (SADE)
Any adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.

3.10 Serious incident
Any incident that directly or indirectly led, might have led or might lead to any of the following:
a) the death of a patient, user or other person,
b) the temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health,
c) a serious public health threat.
(MDR Article 2(65))

3.11 Unanticipated serious adverse device effect (USADE)
Any serious adverse device effect, the nature, severity or outcome of which is not consistent with the reference safety information.

Reporting method

A new template for the Summary Reporting Form should be used for all studies from 26 May 2021. The tabular format featured in the Appendix
needs to be filled in/updated for each reportable event or for new findings/updates to already reported events. It shall be transmitted to all NCAs
where the clinical investigation is being performed. For a new finding or update, the line of the SAE needs to be updated and the first column set
to “m”. Write the new findings in the free description of event column and highlight the additions. When applicable, update the others columns
as well.
For more details on how to complete the form refer to section 10. Reporting form.

4.1 Transition to reporting via Eudamed
Once Eudamed is available and fully functional the obligations and requirements that relate to performing safety reporting via Eudamed shall apply
from the date corresponding to six months after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 34(3) of the MDR.

Page 7 of 19

4.1.1 Ongoing events at time of transition to Eudamed
It is acknowledged that at the time of transition to reporting via Eudamed, there will be ongoing events for which initial reports have been made
according to the procedures described in this document. For these reportable events follow-up and final reports will be submitted to the NCAs by
the same procedure, but all new reportable events shall be entered in Eudamed.
Whether retrospective uploading of previous event reports to Eudamed will be possible is not clear at the time this guidance is issued.

4.2 Overview of formats to be used by sponsors when reporting to NCAs
Under directives legislation
Until May 25th, 2021:

MDR.

4.3 Collecting reports from investigators
The format in which sponsors wish to receive single event reports from investigators will be up to the sponsor to design and they may be adapted
to an individual clinical investigation. When sponsors design such reporting forms, they should consult this guidance document to ensure all
relevant details are captured in the reports from the investigator, so that the sponsors can fulfil their reporting obligations.

5

Reportable events

For the purpose of this guidance and based on the definitions above, the following events are considered reportable events in accordance
with MDR Art. 80(2):
a) any serious adverse event that has a causal relationship with the investigational device, the comparator or the investigation procedure or
where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;
b) any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention had not
occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate;
c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in points a) and b).
Serious adverse events related to a CE marked device which is part of the investigation procedure (for example a CE-marked implanting tool used
in combination with a non-CE marked investigational device) are reportable per MDR Article 80(2) if there is a causal, (or reasonably possible)
relationship to the device, the comparator or the investigation procedure. The reporting procedures described in this guide should then be
followed in addition to the normal vigilance reporting procedures for CE marked devices.

Page 8 of 19

All causality assessments should be made using the guidance in section 9. Only causality level 1 (i.e. “not related”) is excluded from reporting. If
either the sponsor or the investigator has assigned a higher causality level than "not related", the event should be reported.

National legislation

No provisions in MDR. Safety reporting may be regulated in national
legislations in the country where the investigation is conducted.

5.1 Exceptions for PMCF investigations falling under MDR Article 74.1
Following Article 74.1 the SAE reporting for these PMCF clinical investigations is governed by Articles 80(5) and 80(6).
Thus the provisions of vigilance laid down in Articles 87-90 and acts adopted pursuant to Article 91 shall apply. However, the SAEs where a causal
relationship between the serious adverse event and the preceding investigational procedure has been established shall follow the reporting
procedures of clinical investigations as outlined in Article 80.
This means that:




For the purpose of this guidance (safety reporting in clinical investigations) reportable events in PMCF clinical investigations are those
serious adverse events where a causal relationship between the serious adverse event and a preceding investigational procedure has
been established. The other relationship categories i.e. not related, possible and probable do not need to be reported in the context
of the clinical investigation under Article 80.
In the context of vigilance, articles 87-90 need to be taken into account and this concerns the Serious Incidents where a relationship
between the incident and the device or a procedure stated in the IFU is at least reasonably possible. Also not related, possible and
probable events need to be reported in the context of vigilance (Art. 87-90).

It is thus possible that events occurring in such clinical investigations need to be reported to both the competent authorities in charge of SAE in
clinical investigations AND to the competent authorities in charge of vigilance, as outlined above, including a relationship to a procedure stated in
the IFU.
Page 9 of 19

“Preceding investigational procedure” shall be understood as a procedure which is imposed by the Clinical Investigation Plan and which has taken
place before (or coincided in time) with the serious adverse event. This includes both the investigational device application procedure and any
additional burdensome or invasive procedure(s) which defines whether the study is subject to notification requirements following MDR article
74(1).

5.2 Reportable events occurring in other Member States / Third Countries
5.2.1 Reportable events occurring in other MS
The sponsor shall report the reportable SAEs per clinical investigation (CI). If several CIs are conducted with the same device, only those SAEs that
happen in CIs that have the same clinical investigation plan (CIP) code should be reported for those CIs, and only to those MS where a CI with that
specific CIP code is being conducted.
It is acknowledged that the same CI can be conducted under different versions of the same clinical investigation plan (same CIP code) in different
Member States, e.g. with country specific adaptations, and in those cases the SAE reporting can normally be combined for all the versions of the CIP
for the same clinical investigation.
5.2.2 Reportable events occurring in Third Countries
Reportable events occurring in Third Countries4 in which a clinical investigation is performed under the same clinical investigation plan
( s e e 5 . 2 . 1 Reportable events occurring in other MS for what is meant with same CIP) have to be reported in accordance with this
guidance to the NCA(s) of the European countries in which the clinical investigation is being conducted.



The NCA shall start receiving the reportable events occurring in Third Countries as soon as the clinical investigation is authorised to start in
that Member State.
Events occurring in Third Countries after the participating European sites have closed shall continue to be reported.

5.3 Transition period for reportable events in pre-market clinical investigations initiated under directives legislation
It is acknowledged that the MDR implies changes to the reporting requirements compared to the directives’ requirements where all SAEs should
be reported regardless of relatedness. Under MDR sponsors are no longer obliged to report SAEs that are “not related” to the clinical investigation
procedures or the investigational device. At the date of application for MDR there will be ongoing events for clinical investigations initiated under
directives legislation. As from the 26th of May 2021 sponsors are no longer expected to submit follow-up reports to NCAs for events that have been
deemed “not related“ (see section 9 of this document for guidance on causality assessment). For ongoing events that have a causality assessment
other than “not related” follow up reports will still have to be provided.
To facilitate the transition and give time for sponsors to update Clinical Investigation Plans and study procedures in clinical investigations a sponsor
may continue to report all SAEs to NCAs until Eudamed reporting is mandatory (see section 4.1 Transition to reporting via Eudamed). This applies
only to studies which have started to be conducted5 in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 90/385/EEC or Article 15 of Directive 93/42/EEC
prior to 26 May 2021.

5.4 Transition for reportable events in PMCF clinical investigations initiated under directives legislation
In case of PMCF studies which required SAE reporting according to the Pre-MDR national legislations, MDR article 80 (5) and 80(6) shall apply from
May 26th, 2021.

4

Countries other than Switzerland, Turkey and those belonging to the EEA.
For the purpose of safety reporting this is defined as “Authorised to start in the individual Member State in line with applicable directives legislation, regardless of whether
any subjects have been recruited in the Member State or not.”
5

Page 10 of 19

6

Report by whom

Reportable events have to be reported by the sponsor of the clinical investigation, which could be the manufacturer, the legal representative
or another person6 or entity,.

7

Report to whom

Reportable events must be reported at the same time to all NCAs where the clinical investigation has commenced using the summary tabulation
featured in the Appendix.
A list of clinical investigation contact points within the NCAs is published at the Commission's homepage.
For the purpose of this guidance, an investigation is considered to have commenced in an individual Member State:
•
•

For investigations under the directives: When the sponsor is authorized to start the investigation in accordance with the notification
procedures in that Member State.
For investigations started under the MDR: When the sponsor is authorized to start the investigation in that Member State in accordance
with the provisions laid out in the MDR.

Member States may also require separate reporting to the Ethics Committee(s).

8

Reporting timelines

8.1 Report by sponsor to NCAs.
The sponsor must report to all NCAs where the clinical investigation is authorised to start:
•

For all reportable events as described in section 5 which indicate an imminent risk of death, serious injury, or serious illness and that
requires prompt remedial action for other patients/subjects, users or other persons or a new finding to it: Immediately, but not later
than 2 calendar days after awareness by sponsor of a new reportable event or of new information in relation with an already reported
event.
This includes events that are of significant and unexpected nature such that they become alarming as a potential public health hazard. It
also includes the possibility of multiple deaths occurring at short intervals.
These concerns may be identified by either the NCA or the manufacturer.

•

Any other reportable events as described in section 5 or a new finding/update to it: Immediately, but not later than 7 calendar days
following the date of awareness by the sponsor of the new reportable event or of new information in relation with an already reported
event.

In some cases, a different periodicity or different modalities may be agreed between the participating NCAs and the sponsor according to the
investigation’s design and to the pathology under clinical investigation. This would allow implementation of adequate provision for clinical
investigations in which SAE frequency is expected to be high due to the natural progression of the disease (e.g. palliative oncology).

6

Contact person established by the sponsor in line with Article 62(2) if accepted by Member State.

Page 11 of 19

8.2 Report by the investigator to the sponsor
The sponsor shall implement and maintain a system to ensure that the reporting of the reportable events as defined under chapter 5 will be
provided by the investigator to the sponsor immediately, but not later than 3 calendar days after investigation site study personnel’s
awareness of the event.

9

Causality assessment

The relationship between the use of the medical device7 (including the medical - surgical procedure) and the occurrence of each adverse event
shall be assessed and categorized.
During causality assessment activity, clinical judgement shall be used and the relevant documents, such as the Investigator’s Brochure, the
Clinical Investigation Plan or the Risk Analysis Report shall be consulted, as all the foreseeable serious adverse events and the potential risks are
listed and assessed there8. The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural history of the underlying
disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be considered.
The above considerations apply also to the serious adverse events occurring in the comparison group.
For the purpose of harmonizing reports, each SAE will be classified according to four different levels of causality:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Not related
Possible
Probable
Causal relationship

The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the serious adverse event to the investigational
device, the comparator or the investigation procedure.
1. Not related: Relationship to the device, comparator or procedures can be excluded when:
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational device, or the procedures related to application of the
investigational device;
- the serious adverse event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is
previously known) and is biologically implausible;
- the discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impact on the serious adverse event;
- the event involves a body-site or an organ that cannot be affected by the device or procedure;
- the serious adverse event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition, an effect
of another device, drug, treatment or other risk factors);
- the event does not depend on a false result given by the investigational device used for diagnosis9, when applicable;
In order to establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of
device/procedures and the serious adverse event.

7

Intended as both investigational device and comparator.
For a comparator device, the Operator’s Manual could be a relevant document.
9
If an investigational device gives an incorrect diagnosis, the patient might, for example, receive an unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany that
treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed with a serious disease. In other cases, the patient might not receive an effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits
that treatment would confer) or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or condition.
8

Page 12 of 19

2. Possible: The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the relationship with procedures, is weak but
cannot be ruled out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and
an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed, or no information has been obtained
should also be classified as possible.
3. Probable: The relationship with the use of the investigational device or comparator, or the relationship with procedures, seems
relevant and/or the event cannot be reasonably explained by another cause.
4. Causal relationship: the serious adverse event is associated with the investigational device, comparator or with procedures beyond
reasonable doubt when:
- the event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures;
-

the event has a temporal relationship with investigational device use/application or procedures;
the event involves a body-site or organ that
o the investigational device or procedures are applied to;
o the investigational device or procedures have an effect on;

-

the serious adverse event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known);
the discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use
(or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the serious adverse event (when clinically feasible);
other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or
treatment) have been adequately ruled out;
harm to the subject is due to error in use;

- the event depends on a false result given by the investigational device used for diagnosis10, when applicable;
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of
device/procedures and the serious adverse event.
The sponsor and the investigators will distinguish between the serious adverse events related to the investigational device and those related to
the procedures (any procedure specific to the clinical investigation). An adverse event can be related both to procedures and the investigational
device. Complications caused by concomitant treatments not imposed by the clinical investigation plan are considered not related. Similarly,
several routine diagnostic or patient management procedures are applied to patients regardless of the clinical investigation plan. If routine
procedures are not imposed by the clinical investigation plan, complications caused by them are also considered not related.
The relationship between a serious adverse event and the procedure or the device, needs to be assessed separately. This does however not mean
that they are mutually exclusive, a serious adverse event can be related to both the procedure and the device, or it can be related only to the
procedure or only to the device. When it is unclear whether an event is related to the device or to the procedure, the investigator should:
• set the Relationship to device to possible (or higher)
AND
• set the Relationship to procedure to possible (or higher)

10

If an investigational device gives an incorrect diagnosis, the patient might, for example, receive an unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany that
treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed with a serious disease. In other cases, the patient might not receive an effective treatment (thereby missing out on the benefits
that treatment would confer), or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or condition.

Page 13 of 19

Since it is the healthcare provider who performs the procedures and manages/handles the medical device(s), the causality assessment of this
healthcare provider should prevail.
In some particular cases the event may not be adequately assessed because information is insufficient or contradictory and/or the data cannot
be verified or supplemented. The sponsor and the Investigators will make the maximum effort to define and categorize the event and avoid
these situations. Where an investigator assessment is not available and/or the sponsor remains uncertain about classifying the serious adverse
event, the sponsor should not exclude the relatedness; the event should be classified as “possible” and the reporting not be delayed.
Particular attention shall be given to the causality evaluation of unanticipated serious adverse events. The occurrence of unanticipated events
related could suggest that the clinical investigation places subjects at increased risk of harm than was to be expected beforehand.

10 Reporting form
The reporting form template for the summary SAE tabulation is given in the Appendix of this document.
The reporting form is study specific and covers only a given clinical investigation, defined by a distinct clinical investigation plan. English is the
recommended language for the reporting form. The report form can be modified in any applicable software (not only Microsoft Excel) but
the file needs to be compatible with Microsoft Excel when sent to the participating NCAs.
The template form contains inserted filters and functionality to facilitate use of preferred terminology in the reporting. These are important for the
analysis and should be maintained.
Sponsors who generate the excel report file by automated processes may implement other technical features in their systems for excel file
generation to ensure the preferred terms listed in metadata are used.
The table gives a cumulative overview of the reportable events per clinical investigation and will be updated and transmitted to participating
NCAs each time a new reportable event or a new finding to an already reported event is to be reported. More detailed information has to be
provided on request of an NCA, if so requested by using the individual study specific reporting form (see further section 4.3 Collecting reports
from investigators).

10.1 Completion guidelines: Form header
10.1.1 EUDAMED/CIV-ID
The union-wide Single Identification Number mentioned in MDR Article 70(1) will not be possible to generate until Eudamed for MDR is fully
functional. For the transition period, clinical investigations will get tracking numbers (CIV-ID) upon registration in the Eudamed2 database which
is performed by the NCA upon receipt of an application. This CIV ID is provided to the sponsor during the NCA’s handling of the initial application
for the clinical investigation and should be entered on the safety reporting form.
The CIV ID should already be available for a clinical investigation started under the directives’ legislation, where it should be indicated on the
MEDDEV 2.7/3 reporting form etc. Sponsors who are not aware of the CIV ID of their clinical investigations are invited to contact the concerned
NCA to get this information.
10.1.2 Title of Clinical Investigation
The identifying title of the Clinical Investigation. The title indicated here should be consistent with other title entries (such as in clinical investigation

Unanticipated SADE
Choose option Yes or No
An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect12 is an effect which by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the
current risk assessment. Procedures associated with the use of a device should be addressed in the risk assessment, which makes it possible to
determine whether the procedure related SAEs are Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect or not. SAEs related to procedures imposed by
the clinical investigation plan but not with the use of the device should not be considered Serious Adverse Device Effects.
