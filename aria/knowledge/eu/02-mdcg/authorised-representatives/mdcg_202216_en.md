1. Introduction  
 
Where the manufacturer of a device is not established in a Member State, the device may only 
be placed on the Union market1 if the manufacturer designates a sole authorised 
representative. The term ‘device’ will be understood to include medical devices, accessories 
for medical devices, products listed in Annex XVI of the MDR, in vitro diagnostic medical 
devices, accessories for in vitro diagnostic medical devices and also, custom-made devices2. 
For manufacturers who are not established in the Union the authorised representative plays a 
pivotal role in ensuring the compliance of the devices produced by those manufacturers and 
in serving as their contact person established in the Union. Article 11 of the Regulation (EU) 
2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic 
medical devices (IVDR) outlines the obligations of and introduces enhanced responsibility for 
the authorised representative. References to ‘the Regulations’ should be understood to cover 
both the MDR and IVDR. 
 
2. Scope 
This guidance document is written for authorised representatives, manufacturers and other 
economic operators, and intends to provide guidance on relevant requirements under the 
Regulations. Where clarification is already covered by other MDCG guidances, this guidance 
on authorised representatives includes a reference.  
The requirement to have an authorised representative is not applicable to devices intended 
for clinical investigation (MDR) or performance study (IVDR). To this end, Article 62(2) MDR 
and Article 58(4) IVDR state that ‘where the sponsor of a clinical investigation or performance 
study is not established in the Union, that sponsor shall ensure that a natural or legal person 
is established in the Union as its legal representative’. As the legal representative is not 
defined as the authorised representative, these requirements are not further included in this 
guidance.  
 
3. Definitions  
 
Economic operator: a manufacturer, an authorised representative, an importer, a 
distributor or the person referred to in Article 22(1) and 22(3) MDR (Article 2(35) MDR) 
and a manufacturer, an authorised representative, an importer or a distributor (Article 2(28) 
IVDR). 
 
Manufacturer: a natural or legal person who manufactures or fully refurbishes a device or 
has a device designed, manufactured or fully refurbished, and markets that device under 
its name or trademark (Article 2(30) MDR and Article 2(23) IVDR).  
                                               
1 The ’Union market’ refers to the territories of the European Union Member States, and due to the European 
Economic Area (EEA) is extended to Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland, and via the  Customs Union Agreement to 
Turkey. For Turkey, please see also the ‘Notice to stakeholders EU-Turkey Customs Union Agreement in the field 
of medical devices’ on the Commission website.   
2 Please note there are specific requirements applying to custom-made devices outlined in Annex XIII MDR 
‘Procedure for Custom-Made Devices’ and as such, some of the authorised representative obligations elaborated 
in this guidance may not be applicable for custom-made devices. MDCG 2021-3 ‘Questions and Answers on 
Custom-Made Devices & considerations on Adaptable medical devices and Patient-matched medical devices’ may 
also be consulted for information on obligations relating to custom-made devices.

 
Authorised representative: any natural or legal person established within the Union who 
has received and accepted a written mandate from a manufacturer, located outside the 
Union, to act on the manufacturer’s behalf in relation to specified tasks with regard to the 
latter’s obligations under this regulation (Article 2(32) MDR and Article 2(25) IVDR).  
 
Importer: any natural or legal person established within the Union that places a device 
from a third country on the Union market (Article 2(33) MDR and Article 2(26) IVDR). 
 
Distributor: any natural or legal person in the supply chain, other than the manufacturer 
or the importer, that makes a device available on the market, up until the point of putting 
into service (Article 2(34) MDR and Article 2(27) IVDR).  
 
Generic device group: a set of devices having the same or similar intended purposes or 
a commonality of technology allowing them to be classified in a generic manner not 
reflecting specific characteristics (Article 2(7) MDR and Article 2(8) IVDR). 
 
4. Designation and mandate 
 
Where a manufacturer of a device is not established in a Member State, the device may only 
be placed on the Union market if the manufacturer designates a sole authorised representative 
(Article 11(1) MDR and IVDR). 
 
As regards its portfolio of devices therefore, a manufacturer can have more than one 
authorised representative if the devices fall under different generic device groups (as defined 
in Article 2(7) MDR and Article 2(8) IVDR.3). However, for one specific generic device group, 
the manufacturer should designate only one authorised representative (i.e. a ‘sole’ authorised 
representative’).     
 
Article 11(2) of the Regulations provide that ‘the designation shall constitute the authorised 
representative's mandate, it shall be valid only when accepted in writing by the authorised 
representative and shall be effective at least for all devices of the same generic device group’. 
 
The manufacturer and the authorised representative are free to configure the structure of their 
contractual relationship as they see appropriate, as long as there is a written mandate that 
meets the minimum requirements of Article 11(3) of the Regulations and the content of which 
is agreed between the parties. A mandate should be drawn up irrespective of whether the 
authorised representative is independent/outside of, or is part of the same larger organization 
as the manufacturer.  
 
Article 11(3) of the Regulations requires the authorised representative to perform the tasks 
specified in the mandate agreed between the authorised representative and the manufacturer. 
Upon request, the authorised representative has to provide a copy of the mandate to the 
competent authority. Article 11(3) of the Regulations describes the minimum tasks that the 
mandate (in relation to the devices that it covers) should comprise and which the manufacturer 
should enable the authorised representative to perform. The mandate may however also 
                                               
3 If applicable, the manufacturer may take into account ‘MDCG 2019-13 Guidance on sampling of MDR Class IIa / 
Class IIb and IVDR Class B / Class C devices for the assessment of the technical documentation’,  which elaborates 
on the term ‘generic device group’ in that context.  


Medical Devices 
     
Medical Device Coordination Group Document  
MDCG  2022-16

contain additional agreed tasks between the parties. The manufacturer could for instance 
mandate the authorised representative to lodge, on its behalf, an application for conformity 
assessment according to annex IX, X, XI MDR/IVDR with a notified body at the pre-market 
stage.  
 
Article 11(4) of the Regulations specifies however that ‘The mandate shall not delegate the 
manufacturer’s obligations laid down in Article 10(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11),(12)’ 
for the MDR’ and Article 10(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (8), (9), (10) and (11) for the IVDR 
respectively. Whilst the manufacturer therefore can not delegate its responsibility for these 
tasks, the authorised representative is not prevented from assisting in the performance of 
those tasks.    
 
Importers should verify that the authorised representative in accordance with Article 11 has 
been designated by the manufacturer (Article 13(2)(b) MDR and IVDR). 
 
To verify this, a check that the authorised representative’s name appears on relevant 
documentation such as the EU declaration of conformity, any relevant certificate and device 
labelling could be performed. Moreover, the designation could be verified using the EUDAMED 
database, or by contacting the manufacturer or the authorised representative directly to 
confirm that a designation has taken place. In the latter case, a letter of designation issued by 
a manufacturer or a copy of it made available  by the authorised representative could also be 
used in order to confirm to third parties that a designation has taken place.4 
 
5. Registration & verification obligations 
 
a) The authorised representatives’ own obligations 
 
Article 11(3)(c) of the Regulations states that the authorised representative should comply with 
the registration obligations laid down in Article 31 MDR and Article 28 IVDR. This means the 
authorised representative must register its details in EUDAMED5 providing in particular the 
information referred to in Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI of the Regulations.  
 
In addition to registration, the authorised representative must verify that: 
 
 
its own registered information is updated within one week of any change occurring 
(MDR Article 31(4)/IVDR Article 28(4)) 
 
the accuracy of the data it has submitted at intervals defined in Article 31(5) 
MDR/Article 28(5) IVDR, namely not later than one year after initial submission of the 
information, and every second year thereafter.  
 
                                               
4 See also MDGC 2021-27 ‘Questions and Answers on Articles 13 & 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746’  for further information on the obligations of importers.  
5 Prior to the full functionality of EUDAMED, reference should be made to ‘MDCG 2021-1 Guidance on harmonised 
administrative practices and alternative technical solutions until EUDAMED is fully functional’ for the MDR, and 
MDCG 2022-12 ‘Guidance on harmonised administrative practices and alternative technical solutions until 
Eudamed is fully functional (for Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices)’.

Further information on registration procedures for economic operators and management of 
mandates for authorised representatives in EUDAMED, including termination of a mandate, is 
provided in the ‘EUDAMED: Economic Operator user guide’6.   
 
b) The authorised representative’s verification obligations toward the manufacturer  
 
Article 11(3)(c) of the Regulations also outlines the authorised representative’s obligation to 
verify that the manufacturer has complied with its UDI and devices registration obligations in 
EUDAMED, as set out in Articles 27, 29 MDR and Articles 24, 26 IVDR 
 
It is noted that in line with Article 11(4) of the Regulations, the manufacturer’s obligation to 
register its information and devices in EUDAMED cannot be delegated to the authorised 
representative. 
 
 
6. Minimum tasks & responsibilities of the authorised representative 
 
The minimum tasks & responsibilities of the authorised representative are described in Article 
11(3) (a) - (h) of the Regulations. The manufacturer should enable the authorised 
representative to perform the tasks mandated. 
 
Pursuant to Article 11 (3)(a) of the Regulations the authorised representative verifies that the 
EU declaration of conformity and technical documentation have been drawn up (i.e. checks 
the existence of such documents) and, where applicable, that an appropriate conformity 
assessment procedure has been carried out by the manufacturer. If the authorised 
representative considers or has reason to believe that the conformity assessment procedure 
is not appropriate for the device in question, they may inform the manufacturer. 
 
Article 11(3)(b) of the Regulations describes the task of the authorised representative to keep 
a copy of the technical documentation, the EU declaration of conformity and, if applicable, a 
copy of the relevant certificate (including any amendments and supplements of such a 
certificate), issued in accordance with Article 56 MDR or Article 51 IVDR at the disposal of 
competent authorities for the period referred to in Article 10(8) MDR and Article 10(7) IVDR, 
of the devices for which it is designated. This includes a period of at least 10 years after the 
last device covered by the EU declaration of conformity has been placed on the market, and 
in the case of implantable devices, a period of at least 15 years after the last device has been 
placed on the market. 
 
The manufacturer’s obligation to ensure the authorised representative has the necessary 
documentation ‘permanently available’ in order to fulfil the tasks specified in Article 11(3) of 
the Regulations, is outlined in the third sub-paragraph of Article 10(8) MDR and Article 10(7) 
IVDR. ‘Permanently available’ in this context means it will be mandatory for the manufacturer 
to provide the authorised representatives with the requisite documentation, in their most recent 
versions and for certificates this includes amendments or supplements, either in hard or 
                                               
6 Please see 'EUDAMED: Economic Operator user guide How economic operators can use the actor registration 
module’, noting in particular section 2.3 ‘Managing mandates’ and sub-section 2.3.4 of ‘Terminating a mandate’.

electronic copy. In practical terms having ‘permanent access’ to such documents, should imply 
constant availability via electronic or physical storage, either shared or otherwise.    
 
 
 Article 11(3)(d) outlines that in response to a request from a competent authority, the 
authorised representative must provide the competent authority with all the information 
and documentation necessary to demonstrate the conformity of a device, in an official 
Union language determined by the Member State concerned.  
 
In addition to documentation referred to in Article 11(3)(b) of the Regulations, there is 
information/documentation detailed in the Annexes of the Regulations, which, if applicable7, is 
to be taken into account/ kept available by the authorised representative. This includes:  
 
 
Annex IX, Chapter III, section 7, 88 MDR 
 
Annex X, section 7 MDR 
 
Annex XI, section 9, 10.5, 17 or 18.4 MDR 
 
Annex IX, section 6 IVDR  
 
Annex X, section 6 IVDR                                                                                                                        
 
Annex XI, section 6 IVDR                               
 
Please note that for custom-made devices, the statement referred to in section 1 of Annex XIII 
may be drawn up by either the manufacturer or its authorised representative. This statement 
must also be kept for a period of at least 10 years after the device has been placed on the 
market, and a period of at least 15 years in the case of implantable devices. Section 8 of 
Annex IX MDR also applies. 
 
To ensure the authorised representative can comply with the above mentioned requirement 
and cooperate effectively with the authorities, the authorised representative is advised to 
maintain open communication lines with the manufacturer and should verify that: 
 
 
the necessary documentation has been drawn up by the manufacturer; 
 
the necessary documentation is accessible to the authorised representative in their up 
to-date versions  
 
The authorised representative should be able to demonstrate to the competent authority (e.g. 
during an inspection) that the above verifications have been performed, through their internal 
records.  
  
 
Article 11(3)(e): forward to the manufacturer any request by a competent authority of 
the Member State in which the authorised representative has its registered place of 
business for samples, or access to a device and verify that the competent authority 
receives the samples or is given access to the device;  
                                               
7 Given Annexes IX, X, XI MDR/IVDR pertain to conformity assessment activities performed by a notified body, ‘if 
applicable’ in this context refers to devices for which notified body involvement is required.  
8 Annex IX, section 8 MDR states ‘Each Member State shall require that the documentation referred to in Section 
7 is kept at the disposal of competent authorities for the period indicated in that Section in case a manufacturer, 
or its authorised representative, established within its territory goes bankrupt or ceases its business activity prior 
to the end of that period’.

 
Article 11(3)(f): cooperate with the competent authorities on any preventive or 
corrective action taken to eliminate or, if that is not possible, mitigate the risks posed 
by devices;  
 
In addition to cooperation with the competent authorities upon request in vigilance or market 
surveillance cases, meeting this requirement may involve the authorised representative 
coordinating and communicating with importers and distributors and other entities in the supply 
chain as relevant: 
 
 
Article 11(3)(g): immediately inform the manufacturer about complaints and reports 
from healthcare professionals, patients and users about suspected incidents related to 
a device for which they have been designated. 
 
 
7. Liability 
 
According to the Article 11(5) of the Regulations the authorised representative is legally liable 
for defective devices under the following terms: “Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this 
Article, where the manufacturer is not established in a Member State and has not complied 
with the obligations laid down in Article 10, the authorised representative shall be legally liable 
for defective devices on the same basis as, and jointly and severally with, the manufacturer”.9 
The phrase ’Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of Article’ should be understood as meaning 
that whilst the manufacturer cannot delegate its obligations referred to in Article 11(4), the 
authorised representative may nonetheless remain legally liable for defective devices if the 
manufacturer has not complied with its obligations laid down in Article 10 of the Regulations.  
 
The authorised representative’s potential joint liability under Article 11(5) of the Regulations is 
conditional upon the manufacturer’s failure to comply with its obligations, and the authorised 
representative can therefore only be liable in cases where: 
 
 
First, the manufacturer’s liability for a defective device is established under applicable 
Union or national law, e.g. under the product liability Directive 85/374/EEC as 
transposed into national law which establishes “strict liability”10 for defective products; 
and  
 
Second, it is established that the manufacturer has not complied with its obligations 
under Article 10 MDR/IVDR. 
 
In light of the above, the authorised representative may have a particular interest to verify that 
the manufacturer has fulfilled its obligations, including the manufacturer’s obligation to have 
                                               
9 Please also see MDR Recital 35 / IVDR Recital 34 which state: “The liability of the authorised representative 
provided for in this Regulation is without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 85/374/EEC, and accordingly the 
authorised representative should be jointly and severally liable with the importer and the manufacturer’’. 
10 Directive 85/374/EEC establishes a regime of “strict liability”, i.e. the plaintiff does not have to prove negligence, 
only that the device caused damage. See further section 1.4 of the ‘Commission Notice - The ‘Blue Guide’ on the 
implementation of EU products rules 2022’.  
 


Medical Devices 
     
Medical Device Coordination Group Document  
MDCG  2022-16 
 
Page 8 of 10 
 
 
measures in place to provide sufficient financial coverage (e.g. liability insurance) under Article 
10(16) of the Regulations. Matters of liability would ultimately however be for the competent 
courts to decide upon. This includes whether a causal relationship needs to be established 
between the manufacturers’ non-compliance with its obligations under Article 10 of the 
Regulations and the damage caused by a defective device, in order to trigger the authorised 
representative’s joint and several liability.  
 
Finally, with reference to the phrase “on the same basis as… the manufacturer’’ in Article 11(5) 
of the Regulations, ‘same’ means that when the liability of the authorised representative is 
alleged within the framework of a specific legal regime on liability for defective products, the 
authorised representative is afforded the same rights to defend itself as the manufacturer 
under that regime. 
 
8. Termination of the mandate 
 
According to the s Article 11(3)(h) of the Regulations, the mandate should enable the 
authorised representative to terminate the mandate if the manufacturer acts contrary to its 
obligations under the Regulations. The termination of the mandate is therefore the right of the 
authorised representative,  
  
Given that under Article 11(2) of the Regulations the mandate is ‘effective at least for all 
devices of the same generic device group’ of a manufacturer, the termination of the mandate 
is only possible with respect to the whole generic device group and not a specific device within 
that group, unless the specific device is removed/withdrawn from the market and so is outside 
the scope of the effective mandate. 
 
Article 11(6) of the Regulations states that ‘an authorised representative who terminates its 
mandate on the ground referred to in point (h) of paragraph 3 shall immediately inform the 
competent authority of the Member State in which it is established and, where applicable, the 
notified body that was involved in the conformity assessment for the device of the termination 
of the mandate and the reasons therefore’. In the event of a problematic termination (e.g. 
where the manufacturer fails or refuses to address a non-compliance identified, or is either 
not responsive to or traceable by the authorised representative), the out-going authorised 
representative is also advised to inform the competent authorities and where applicable, the 
notified body, of the extent of the manufacturer’s non-compliance.  
 
It may be relevant for the authorised representative who terminates the mandate to thereafter 
still cooperate with the competent authorities for devices placed on the market during the 
period in which it was designated. This would in particular be relevant where no new 
authorised representative has yet been designated for those devices.  
 
 
9. Change of authorised representative  
 
Article 12 of the Regulations requires that ‘the detailed arrangements for a change of 
authorised representative shall be clearly defined in an agreement between the manufacturer, 
where practicable the outgoing authorised representative, and the incoming authorised 


Medical Devices 
     
Medical Device Coordination Group Document  
MDCG  2022-16 
 
Page 9 of 10 
 
 
representative’. It also further specifies the minimum aspects to be addressed in the 
agreement (Article 12 (a) – (d) MDR/IVDR) including relevant dates, transfer of documentation 
and communication. 
 
In the case of a termination based on Article 11(3)(h) of the Regulations, the agreement may 
also address the reason of the mandate termination by the previous authorised representative.  
 
In general, a tripartite agreement should exist under Article 12 of the Regulations, except in 
cases where this is ‘not practicable’ i.e. in particular where the outgoing authorised 
representative ceases to exist (for example, due to bankruptcy), they are no longer traceable 
or, where justified, for other substantial reasons making the conclusion of an arrangement 
between the parties not possible. Where it is not possible to involve the outgoing authorised 
representative in a tripartite agreement, the obligation under Article 12(d) (to forward 
complaints to the manufacturer or incoming authorised representative) should apply.11  
 
 
10. Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC) 
 
Article 15(6) of the Regulations state that authorised representatives shall have permanently 
and continuously at their disposal at least one Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance 
(PRRC) who possesses the requisite expertise regarding the regulatory requirements for 
devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices in the Union. Such persons should possess the 
requisite expertise in accordance with Article 15(6) MDR or IVDR.  
 
Further guidance on the PRRC is included in the MDCG 2019-7 Guidance on PRRC12, which 
highlights that the PRRC for an authorised representative and for an 'outside EU' manufacturer 
cannot be the same person. In addition, there should be a clear contractual relationship in 
place between the authorised representative and the PRRC. 
 
Finally, it is noted that authorised representatives whose mandate with the manufacturer also 
covers ‘legacy devices’, are not required to appoint a PRRC for those devices. Please see 
section 2 of MDCG 2021-2513  Report of the ad hoc task-force on transitional provisions for 
MDR and MDCG 2022-814 for IVDR, for further information.  
 
 
11. Market Surveillance  
 
In addition to its minimum responsibilities under Article 11(3) of the Regulations and other 
obligations covered in the mandate, it is noted that authorised representatives:

 
may be consulted in the context of market surveillance measures taken by competent 
authorities under Articles 95 & 97 MDR/Articles 90 & 92 IVDR, regarding devices 
presenting serious risk to health and safety of patients or presenting other non-
compliances respectively. 
 
may be required to make documentation and information available to competent 
authorities as part of their market surveillance activities under Article 93(3)(a) 
MDR/Article 88(3)(a) IVDR. 
 
may be subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the competent 
authorities as part of their market surveillance activities under Article 93(3)(b) 
MDR/Article 88(3)(b) IVDR. 
12.  Transitional provisions 
 
Further guidance on the MDR/IVDR transitional provisions is included in the MDCG 2021-2515 
Report of the ad hoc task-force on transitional provisions for MDR and MDCG 2022-816 for 
IVDR. These indicate that the requirements for authorised representatives under the 
Directives continue to apply for ‘legacy devices’. In addition, the MDR/IVDR requirements 
concerning market surveillance, post-market surveillance, vigilance and registration of 
economic operators and devices apply for ‘legacy devices’. For authorised representatives, 
this includes Article 11(3)(c)-(g) MDR/IVDR and the mandate between the manufacturer and 
the authorised representative should be updated accordingly.  
 
The market surveillance cooperation provisions outlined in section 11 of this document also 
apply to authorised representatives whose mandate with the manufacturer covers ‘legacy 
devices’.
