Interplay between the Medical Devices Regulation
(MDR)1 & In vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices
Regulation (IVDR)2 and the Artificial Intelligence Act
(AIA)3
Introduction
This document provides a first set of answers, that will be continuously developed
and updated, to the most frequently asked questions related to the joint application of
the AIA and the MDR or IVDR4 for manufacturers. This Frequently Asked Questions
(FAQ) document is primarily aimed at (but not limited to) medical device
manufacturers, notified bodies and competent authorities. All references to
‘manufacturer’ within the meaning of the MDR/IVDR should be understood as
references to ‘provider’ in accordance with the AIA. ‘Deployer’ defined in the Article
3(4) AIA as a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body using AI
systems under their authority, unless the use is for a personal non-professional
activity. The AIA does not define the concept of ‘user’ which is defined in the
MDR/IVDR as any healthcare professional or lay person who uses a device.
Therefore, the concept of ‘deployer’ under AIA cannot be understood as referring to
‘user’ under MDR/IVDR.
The MDR and IVDR requirements address risks related to medical device software,
however, they do not explicitly address risks specific to AI systems. The AIA
complements the MDR/IVDR by introducing requirements to address hazards and
risks for health, safety and fundamental rights specific to AI systems. In line with the
New Legislative Framework approach, this means a simultaneous and
complementary application of the MDR/IVDR and the AIA for medical devices that
contains one or more high-risk AI system.
For the purposes of this document, AI systems used for medical purposes are
referred to as Medical Device Artificial Intelligence (MDAI). All references to MDAI
shall be understood to also cover MDR Annex XVI products, accessories to medical
devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices and accessories to in vitro diagnostic
medical devices.

2 Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on in vitro diagnostic

medical devices
3 Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2024 laying down
harmonised rules on artificial intelligence
4 On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in the Commission notice ‘The “Blue Guide” on the
implementation of EU product rules 2022’, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation
legislation, such as the MDR and the IVDR and the AIA , may be applicable to one product, since the making
available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union
harmonisation legislation.

The guidance provided in this document is without prejudice to the guidance that the
European Commission may adopt on the basis of the AIA.
In order to ensure consistency, avoid duplication and minimise additional burdens,
manufacturers of MDAI, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Article 8 of the AIA, have
a choice of
integrating, as appropriate, the necessary testing and reporting
processes, information and documentation they provide with regard to their MDAI into
documentation and procedures that already established under the MDR/IVDR.
Manufacturers of MDAI, are strongly encouraged to use this flexibility provided in
paragraph 2 Article 8 of the AIA. In applying this flexibility, MDAI manufacturers,
however, shall ensure that MDAI are fully compliant with all applicable requirements
of the AIA, MDR or IVDR and any other applicable Union legislation.

Scope of application and classification

1. When does the AIA apply to the ‘medical device software’?
According to MDCG 2019-115, "medical device software" (MDSW) refers to software
intended, either alone or in combination, to fulfil a medical purpose as defined in
Article 2(1) MDR or Article 2(2) IVDR. The AI Act (AIA) defines an AI system in Article
3(1) as a machine-based system that is designed to operate with varying levels of
autonomy and that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment, and that, for explicit
or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such
as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or
virtual environments.6
Note 1: all references to Medical Device Artificial Intelligence (MDAI) shall be
understood to also cover MDR Annex XVI products, accessories to medical devices,
in vitro diagnostic medical devices and accessories to in vitro diagnostic medical
devices.
Note 2: Refer to MDCG 2019-11 for further details on the qualification and
classification of software, including the distinction between MD and IVD software and
on the definition of an AI system to the Commission Guidance on the AI system
definition7.
2. Under what conditions is a MDAI considered a high-risk AI system within
the meaning of the AIA?
A MDAI is considered a high-risk AI system under Article 6(1) AIA if it meets both of
the following conditions:
1. the MDAI is a safety component8 9 ,or the AI system is itself a medical
device and
2. the MDAI is subject to a third-party conformity assessment by a notified
body in accordance with the MDR/IVDR (See table 1 below).

2024/1689 (AIA).
7 Commission Guidelines on the definition of an artificial intelligence system established by Regulation (EU)
2024/1689 (AI Act), C(2025) 924 final.
8 AIA Art 3(14) defines safety component as ‘a component of a product or of an AI system which fulfils a safety
function for that product or AI system, or the failure or malfunctioning of which endangers the health and safety of
persons or property’. European Commission is preparing horizontal guidelines on the classification of AI systems
as high-risk that will also cover the concept of ‘safety component’.
9 As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within
the scope of [MDR or IVDR], it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under the AIA if the product concerned
undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to the
[MDR or IVDR].

3. When do provisions on high-risk AI systems apply to MDR Annex XVI
devices?
The AIA applies to devices covered by the MDR and therefore also applies to an
Annex XVI device if it is or it contains an AI system and fulfils the conditions of Article
6(1) AIA (refer back to Q2).
4. Does the AIA impact the risk classification of MDAI under the MDR/IVDR?
The classification of an AI system as a high-risk under Article 6(1) AIA does not imply
that the medical device or in vitro diagnostic medical device falls in a higher risk class
under the MDR and IVDR.11 Therefore, the AIA does not impact the risk classification
of medical devices or in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) under the MDR or
IVDR.
It is rather the classification of a medical device under the MDR/IVDR which
determines whether the AI system qualifies as high-risk under Article 6(1) AIA (refer
back to Q2). The classification of MDAI under the MDR or IVDR determines the
applicable legal requirements for high-risk AI systems under Article 6(1) AIA and
therefore impacting the regulatory scrutiny and oversight required for the high-risk
MDAI.
The application of Article 5 AIA, prohibited AI practices and Article 50 AIA
transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems does not
depend on the MDR/IVDR classification.12

II. Requirements
1. Management Systems
5. How do the MDR/IVDR and AIA address the lifecycle management for MDAI?
The MDR and IVDR require manufacturers to manage the entire lifecycle of MDAI,
ensuring that the MDAI remains safe and performant throughout its use.13
The AIA reinforces this by also expecting continuous review, oversight, and
consistent performance of high-risk MDAI throughout the lifecycle14 and post-market
monitoring that is proportionate to the nature and risks of the AI system15.
This includes design choices allowing natural persons to oversee functioning of highrisk MDAI and to ensure that they are used as intended and that their impacts are
addressed over the system’s lifecycle,16 a risk management system that shall be
understood as a continuous iterative process planned and run through the entire
lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular systematic review and updating,
analysing data provided by deployers or collected through other sources on the
performance of the high-risk MDAI in its lifetime to assess continued compliance.
This may include activities such as high-risk MDAI design, development, testing,
deployment, monitoring, and updates, along with comprehensive documentation of
all relevant changes and their impacts.
For high-risk MDAI that continues to learn after being deployed the post-market
monitoring system is key to ensuring continued performance and compliance. It helps
identify and address emerging risks in a timely and efficient manner and ensures that
updates are communicated to relevant parties, including patients or professional
users (as applicable), deployers and notified bodies, as necessary.17
6. How do the MDR, IVDR and the AIA address the implementation of a quality
management system?
Jointly, the AIA and MDR or IVDR emphasize the importance of quality management
to ensure the safety and performance of MDAI. The MDR and IVDR require
manufacturers to establish, document, implement, maintain, keep up to date and
continually improve a quality management system to ensure compliance with the
MDR and IVDR in the most effective manner and in a manner that is proportionate to
the risk class and the type of the device.

15 Article 72, par. 1, AIA
16 Article 14 and recital 73 AIA
17 AIA Recital 155, Article 15(4), Article 9, 11, 15, Annex IV.

Page 7 of 27

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

Similarly, the AIA mandates that providers/ manufacturers implement quality
management systems for AI systems to ensure compliance with the AIA. 18 The
quality management system required under the AIA covers substantive requirements,
procedural obligations and at least thirteen aspects, to be implemented in a
proportionate manner according to the size of the provider’s organization. Similar to
the MDR / IVDR, this includes a strategy for regulatory compliance, the
documentation of a quality management system, which should encompass written
policies, procedures, and instructions regarding aspects such as risk management
and performance testing.19
The quality management system obligations under the AIA are specifically targeted to
the AI system. Therefore, the AIA requirements are complementary to the quality
management system required under the MDR or IVDR and applicable to the overall
MDAI. As the quality management system obligations under the AIA are specifically
targeted to the AI system, additional requirements such as data and data
governance, record-keeping, transparency, human oversight must be integrated, as
appropriate (non-exhaustive).20
To ensure this complementarity and to avoid unnecessary administrative burden,
manufacturers of AI systems may include the elements of the quality management
system provided by the AIA as part of the existing quality management system
provided by the MDR and IVDR.21
In addition, the development of harmonised European and international standards
relevant to quality management systems for high-risk MDAI is ongoing, including
under the framework of the AIA and MDR/IVDR, to support consistent implementation
and compliance across manufacturers.
7. What risk management requirements are outlined in the MDR, IVDR and AIA
for high-risk MDAI?
The MDR, IVDR and AIA require a risk management system that is a continuous
iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle of the device, including in both the
pre-market and post-market phases.22 The process primarily aims at identifying and
mitigating risks on health, safety and fundamental rights.23
Risk management requirements specific to high-risk MDAI include ongoing
assessments of known and reasonably foreseeable risks that the high-risk MDAI can
pose to fundamental rights, data biases, and system robustness, including
identification, analysis, and mitigation of risks related to system design, development,
and deployment, and may include training to deployers. This includes measures to
ensure the safety and reliability of high-risk MDAI in healthcare settings through
18 Article 17
19 AIA, Article 17
20 Refer to Section 2 Chapter III)
21 Recital 81, Article 8 (2) and Article 17 (3) AIA

MDCG 2025-6

comprehensive risk assessments, documentation of risk mitigation measures, and
continuous monitoring of system performance.24 These requirements aim to prevent,
and address known and reasonably foreseeable risks to ensure the safety and
performance of MDAIs.
Manufacturers of high-risk MDAI may integrate the additional risk management
requirements specific to MDAI set out in paragraphs 1-9 of Article 9 of the AIA into the
testing, reporting processes, information and documentation required under the AIA
into their existing documentation and procedures under the MDR and IVDR.25 Risk
management systems under both AIA and MDR/IVDR require a manufacturer to
reduce the identified and assessed risks, and to address risks in their risk
management systems that can reasonably be mitigated. This refers not only to
organisational measures, but also to specific actions taken during the development
and design of MDAI.

2. Data Governance
8. What data governance requirements are specified in the AIA, MDR and IVDR
for high-risk MDAI?
Data is addressed in both the AIA and the MDR/IVDR, though with a different scope
and focus.
The MDR/IVDR mandate that clinical data used for device evaluation is robust,
reliable, and derived from well-designed studies. To support the generation of
sufficient clinical evidence, the clinical or performance evaluation must be based on
clinical data representative of the intended use of the device. The procedures and
techniques for verifying, validating and controlling the design of the devices as well
as documented information arising from those procedures and techniques, should be
documented as part of the clinical evidence (and reviewed by the notified body).
Article 10 AIA provides further specifications related to the data and datasets of AI
systems. Moreover, it includes a provision for exceptional processing of special
categories of personal data.26 These requirements aim to ensure that high-risk MDAI
is built and validated on trustworthy data.
To ensure that MDAI performs as intended and safely, high-quality data plays a
central role in providing structure and in ensuring performance, especially for the
development of high-risk MDAI-based on machine learning techniques. High-quality
data sets for training, validation and testing of MDAI require the implementation of
appropriate data governance and management practices. The data governance and
management practices, in the case of personal data, should be fully compliant with
the GDPR provisions and include transparency about the original purpose of the data
collection. The requirements related to data governance can be complied with by
24 AIA, Article 72
25 Recital 64 AIA
26 Article 10(5) AIA

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

having recourse to third parties that offer certified compliance services including
verification of data governance.27
To ensure comprehensive data governance practices for MDAIs, datasets for training,
validation, and testing must be relevant, sufficiently representative, and, to the best
extent possible, free of errors and complete.28 When training, validating and testing
high-risk MDAI, manufacturers must ensure that the datasets are sufficiently
representative of the target population, and in relation to the performance study
population specifications on selection criteria and decisions related to the size of the
performance study population are defined.29 Manufacturers must implement
procedures ensuring data transparency and integrity and examine the data in view of
possible biases, with detailed documentation of compliance. For further information
on generation on clinical evaluation (MDR) / performance evaluation (IVDR) of
MDSW, see MDCG 2020-1.
9. What requirements are in place under the AIA, MDR and IVDR to ensure
monitoring and mitigation of unwanted bias in MDAI?
The AIA requires high-risk MDAI manufacturers to implement data governance and
management practices appropriate for the claimed intended purpose, including with a
view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety of persons, have
a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination prohibited under
Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future operations
Furthermore, manufacturers must implement appropriate measures to detect, prevent
and mitigate possible biases identified.
In addition, the AIA introduces requirements on record keeping arising from logging
capabilities implemented for high-risk MDAI, which aim to facilitate the traceability,
such as identification of situations whereby an MDAI may present a risk due to
potential bias in the training, validation or testing data sets in the initial system
development or as a result of substantial modification. The AIA, as one of the
essential requirements, requires all high-risk MDAI to have technical capabilities for
the automatic recording of events (logs) over the lifetime of the MDAI.
The record-keeping and logging requirements under the AIA also involve sufficiently
representative datasets analysing relevant data provided by the deployers. The MDR
and IVDR complements this by requiring that clinical data used in device evaluation
be robust and reliable, ensuring that high-risk MDAI perform consistently across the
intended use population. Documentation of these activities and their effectiveness is
required by all three regulations (refer to Section 3 for more on technical
documentation).

MDCG 2025-6

Furthermore, the requirements for appropriate record keeping include logging
capabilities as part of post-market monitoring.
The aim is to ensure that
manufacturers put in place appropriate mechanisms to detect possible bias not
originally detected in pre-market activities but rather as a result post-market
monitoring or learning.
10. How does the AIA define different types of data required to demonstrate
compliance of the AI system?
The AIA introduces four definitions related to data that include:
Article 3 (29) AIA defines ‘training data’ as data used for training an AI system
through fitting its learnable parameters;
Article 3 (30) AIA ‘validation data’ means data used for providing an evaluation of the
trained AI system and for tuning its non-learnable parameters and its learning
process in order, inter alia, to prevent underfitting or overfitting;
Article 3 (31) AIA ‘validation data set’ means a separate data set or part of the
training data set, either as a fixed or variable split;
Article 3 (32) AIA ‘testing data’ means data used for providing an independent
evaluation of the AI system in order to confirm the expected performance of that
system before its placing on the market or putting into service.
11. How do the MDR, IVDR and AIA address training, validation and testing data
used for high-risk MDAI?
The importance of utilising data which is appropriate for the intended purpose of the
MDAI is essential in order to produce accurate and (clinically) relevant outputs. In
accordance with the claimed intended purpose of the device. The training data used
must be representative of the intended patient population.30
The MDR and IVDR require that clinical data used for device evaluation is robust,
reliable, and derived from well-designed studies.31 Data collection protocols aim to
ensure that the relevant characteristics of the intended patient population (for
example, in terms of age, gender, sex, race, ethnicity, geographical location, medical
condition), intended use environment, and measurement inputs are sufficiently
represented in a sample of adequate size in the datasets for training, validation,
testing, and monitoring so that results can be reasonably generalized to the targeted
population. These are fundamental for clinical / performance evaluations and
important to manage any unintended bias or dataset drift, promote appropriate and
generalizable performance across the intended patient population, assess usability,

and identify circumstances and subgroups where the model may underperform
including over time.
Manufacturers should employ stringent data governance practices to maintain data
integrity and prevent unwanted bias.32 In addition, the validation of training data used
MDAI is paramount and should be demonstrated as part of the studies to ensure the
accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of the MDAI.
As outlined in the AIA, training, validation and testing data sets for high-risk MDAI
must be of high quality, sufficiently representative, free of errors (to the best extent
possible), complete in the view of the intended purpose , include the appropriate
statistical properties and be examined in view of possible biases that are likely to
affect the health and safety of persons, have negative impact on fundamental rights
ore lead to discrimination prohibited under Union law.33 The AIA also requires the
inclusion of measures to address data privacy and security concerns, as well as
transparency in data collection and processing.
Note: In line with the AI Act the Commission will develop horizontal guidelines on the
practical implementation of the requirements and obligations for high-risk AI systems
including on the requirements included in Article 1034 on data and dataset.35
Moreover, in line with the European Commission standardisation request
CEN/CENELEC Joint Technical Committee 21 is working on the developing a
harmonised standards on data and bias.
The Commission horizontal guidelines and the harmonized standards in support of
the AI Act will provide further clarifications on the scope of the requirements related to
data and data governance of the AI Act. The specific application of AI act provisions
on data and data governance in the context of medical devices will be developed
following the adoption of horizontal guidelines.

3. Technical Documentation
12. What technical documentation is required by the MDR/IVDR and AIA for
MDAI?
The MDR, IVDR and the AIA mandate the provision of comprehensive technical
documentation for MDAI. The MDR/IVDR require detailed descriptions of software,
software architecture, data processing methods, and risk management strategies. 36
The AIA requires additional documentation, focusing on transparency and
accountability, including risk assessments, data governance practices, and
performance testing outcomes of the high-risk MDAI.37

This documentation should include detailed information about the device's design,
development, key design choices, functionality, performance characteristics, system
architecture, computational resources to develop, train and test, and intended use
and purpose. Manufacturers must also provide evidence of conformity with relevant
regulatory requirements, including training, validation and test data, risk
assessments, and quality management processes.38 All three regulations aim to
ensure that manufacturers maintain detailed and up-to-date records to demonstrate
compliance.
Note: Where it relates to technical documentation, Article 11 (2) of the AIA indicates
that a single set of technical documentation shall be drawn up for high-risk MDAI.
13. Will the assessment of the technical documentation by a notified body as it
is defined in Annex VII of the AIA follow a sampling of MDR Class IIa / Class
IIb and IVDR Class B / Class C devices as it is laid out in MDCG 2019-13?
Yes, sampling rules of the governing conformity assessment procedure remain
applicable. Therefore, high-risk MDAI are governed by the applicable sampling rules
under the MDR and IVDR.
Background: The MDR and IVDR establish the need to assess the technical
documentation of at least one representative device per generic device group (for
Class IIb and Class C) and for each category of devices (for Class IIa and Class B)
prior to issuing a certificate.39 Section 2.3 and 3.4 of Annex IX of IVDR and MDR (and
section 10 of Annex XI of the MDR) defines that the quality management system
assessment must be accompanied by the assessment of technical documentation for
devices selected on a representative basis.

4. Transparency and human oversight
14. What requirements do the
transparency and for MDAI?

AIA

and

MDR/IVDR

impose

regarding

The AIA and MDR/IVDR put in place complementary obligations that address both
manufacturers and deployers to ensure transparency in the development,
deployment and use of MDAI.
Under the AIA, transparency is a core requirement for high-risk MDAI. It introduces
on providers a legally binding requirement to design and develop high-risk MDAI in
such a way as to ensure that operation of high-risk MDAI is sufficiently transparent to
enable deployers, to interpret outputs correctly and use the system appropriately,
supported by clear and comprehensible instructions for use.40
Furthermore, manufacturers must ensure that high-risk MDAI intended to interact
directly with natural persons are designed and developed in such a way that the

MDCG 2025-6

concerned users of high-risk MDAI, regardless of risk class, are informed that they
are interacting with an AI system unless this is obvious from the point of view of a
user who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into
account the circumstances and the context of use.41,42 Additionally, it imposes
transparency obligations on deployers, including the requirement to inform providers
appropriately and ensure proper use of the system.43
The MDR/IVDR embed transparency requirements within the General Safety and
Performance Requirements (GSPRs).44 They require that manufacturers provide
clear and accessible information regarding the device’s intended purpose, operation
and limitations.45 In addition, they require that software development follows the state
of the art, incorporating lifecycle and risk management processes that inherently
support traceability, documentation, and usability.46 These elements contribute to
transparency and the broader goal of ensuring that deployers and notified bodies can
understand how the MDAI contributes to its performance and risk profile. In addition
to Annex I, Annex II and III of the MDR/IVDR also impose detailed documentation
requirements, including on software development and performance evaluation, which
contribute to transparency and traceability throughout the device lifecycle.
Accordingly, the MDR/IVDR and AIA collectively support a coherent regulatory
framework that ensures MDAI systems are designed, documented, and deployed in a
transparent and explainable manner. Therefore, transparency requirements are not
optional design features, but essential requirements to be addressed within the
manufacturer’s risk and quality management systems and verified through the
conformity assessment procedure. These requirements collectively ensure that
users, deployers, and patients are adequately informed about the nature, operation
and limitations of MDAI.
15. How do the MDR/IVDR and the AIA address transparency, explainability and
data processing requirements for high-risk MDAI?
The AIA provides that transparency, including the accompanying instructions for use,
should assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision
making by them.47 Deployers should, inter alia, be in a better position to make the
correct choice of the system that they intend to use in light of the obligations
applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use the
AI system correctly and as appropriate. This is further supported by requirements for
clear and comprehensible instructions for use, the provision of information on the
system’s capabilities and limitations, and documentation that enables the
explainability of AI-based decisions.
41 Further transparency requirements for certain AI systems are contained in AIA Article 50.
42 Article 50 AIA.
43 Article 26 AIA.
44 Annex I MDR and IVDR.
45 Annex I GSPR 23 MDR and IVDR.
46 Annex I GSPR 14.2(h) MDR and IVDR.
47 Articles 12 and 13 AIA, as clarified in recitals 71 and 72 AIA.

MDCG 2025-6

Transparency requirements related to data processing include obligations regarding
data quality, management, and documentation.48 Data used for training, validation
and testing of high-risk MDAI must be relevant, representative of the intended
purpose, free of errors and bias, (to the extent possible) and sufficiently
comprehensive. These provisions aim to ensure the robustness and performance of
high-risk MDAI but also their transparency in terms of data processing. As explained
in Question 11 above, the Commission will provide horizontal guidelines on the
practical implementation of Article 10 AI act on data and data governance which will
provide further clarifications on the meaning and practical application of this
provision. This is aligned with MDR/IVDR which require manufacturers to ensure that
users are provided with comprehensive and comprehensible information regarding
the device, its performance and risks (Annex I). Where applicable, the information
provided must describe how software, including AI components, contributes to the
performance of the device, and must be reflected in the instructions for use or user
interface. Furthermore, MDR/IVDR Annex I, Chapter III, also supports informed
decision-making by users.
In this sense, the AIA expands and reinforces the MDR and IVDRs foundational
principle that information provided to deployers must be clear, complete, and
actionable, especially when decisions may impact health outcomes or fundamental
rights. Taken together, the MDR/IVDR and AIA establish a framework in which
transparency and explainability are not only expectations but binding obligations for
high-risk MDAI. Manufacturers must ensure that deployers can understand the logic,
limitations, and behaviour of AI components within a medical device. This includes
implementing safeguards, interpretation tools, and user interfaces that make AI
outputs meaningful and trustworthy. The integration of these requirements throughout
the high-risk MDAI lifecycle, design, documentation and record-keeping, labelling,
and post-market surveillance ensures that MDAI is developed and deployed in a
manner that supports patient safety, professional accountability, and public trust.
16. How do the MDR/IVDR and the AIA address the accountability of MDAI?
Accountability is addressed in both the AIA and the MDR/IVDR, though with a
different scope and focus.
The MDR/IVDR, include requirements for documentation and clinical and
performance evaluation. They require that the information provided to users be clear
and complete, including details on how the device operates and, where applicable,
how embedded software components (including MDAI) contribute to device
functionality.49 The documentation50 required must describe the design and
functioning of the software, including how inputs are processed and how outputs are
generated, thereby supporting explainability and accountability in practice. To
promote trust and accountability, the AIA introduces explicit obligations concerning

48 Article 10 AIA.
49 Annex I MDR and IVDR.
50 Annex II MDR and IVDR.

MDCG 2025-6

transparency.51 Transparency contributes to explainability which in turn facilitates
accountability.
As such, high-risk MDAI must be designed and developed in a manner that enables
deployers to understand how the system functions and reaches its outputs. This
includes information on the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of the highrisk MDAI, as well as documentation to support interpretability of outputs.
These combined obligations enable both developers and deployers of high-risk MDAI
to demonstrate and communicate how high-risk MDAI-based decisions are made.
Moreover, these obligations support robust traceability of changes, informed use, and
post-market control mechanisms that reinforce the safe and trustworthy deployment
of MDAI and enhance accountability throughout the product lifecycle.
17. How do the MDR, IVDR and AIA address usability engineering for MDAI?
The MDR and IVDR require manufacturers to apply usability engineering principles to
MDAI in the design and development to ensure their safe and effective use by
intended users. Manufacturers must eliminate or reduce as far as possible risks
related to use errors, having particular regard to the knowledge of the user and
consideration of whether training might be appropriate. It is recommended that AI
systems, especially those in healthcare, be designed with user-centric principles to
facilitate safe and effective interaction. Documentation of usability engineering
processes and outcomes is required under all three regulations.
18. What human oversight requirements are included in the MDR, IVDR and AIA
for high-risk MDAI?
The AIA emphasizes the importance and sets a legal obligation on the manufacturer
to design and develop AI systems, including high-risk MDAI, with appropriate human
oversight mechanisms.
In particular, human oversight measures should guarantee that the system is
designed by the manufacturer with in-built operational constraints that cannot be
overridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator. 52 This
involves designing high-risk MDAI to allow human intervention in critical decisionmaking processes. The MDR and IVDR support this by requiring that MDAI, be
designed for safe and performant use.53 The AIA details that oversight measures
should be commensurate with the risks, level of autonomy, and context of use of the
high-risk MDAI. Thus, clearly defined and documented human oversight mechanisms
as well as appropriate instructions for use54 will be necessary to ensure safe and
performant use and deployment of high-risk MDAI and allow appropriate supervision
by healthcare professionals and institutions.

19. Can human oversight for medical devices be understood as a part of
existing risk management measures such as a design measure (e. g. ‘stop’
button)?
Human oversight in addition to the design and operational requirement (see Q18), is
also considered a risk mitigating factor that aims to prevent or minimise the risks to
health, safety or fundamental rights when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance
with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse. 55
Proper human oversight could be understood as a risk management measure which
calls for manufacturers to, in the following order of priority:
a) eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible through safe design and
manufacture take adequate protection measures, and
b) (where appropriate) include including alarms, if necessary, in relation to risks
that cannot be eliminated and
c) provide information for safety.
For MDAI, specific considerations as to what level of human oversight is necessary
and appropriate according to the level of risk associated with possibly e.g. robotic
driven surgical medical device intervention where a healthcare professional oversees
the operation and has variable possibilities to ‘override’ the MDAI. However, the
software design should not allow human intervention in critical parts of the surgical
operation of a highly autonomous surgical MDAI whereby leaving the patient at risk.
The manufacturer must include considerations as part of the risk assessment and
management.
20. How do the MDR/IVDR and AIA approach informed consent in the context of
MDAI?
The MDR/IVDR and AIA both include provisions aimed at protecting individual rights
through transparency and informed interaction with MDAI.
Under the MDR and IVDR, informed consent is explicitly required in the context of
clinical investigations and performance studies.56 These provisions ensure that
individuals participating in such studies are adequately informed of the risks, benefits,
and objectives of MDAI.
The AIA complements these requirements by introducing additional transparency
obligations that extend to the general deployment of high-risk AI systems (see
Question 14). Furthermore, the requirements on human oversight57 and
transparency58 reinforce the need to provide deployers and affected persons with
sufficient information to understand the system’s capabilities, limitations, and
potential risks.
55 Article 14(2) of the AIA.
56 Article 69 MDR and Article 59 IVDR.
57 Article 14 AIA.
58 Article 13 AIA.

Page 17 of 27

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

Together, these requirements contribute to safeguarding patient autonomy and
support the ethical deployment of MDAI.

21. How do the MDR/IVDR and AIA address the traceability of high-risk MDAI?
Traceability is a key component of both regulatory frameworks, albeit with different
focal points.
The MDR and IVDR require that devices, including those incorporating AI, are
traceable throughout the supply chain and device lifecycle.59 This includes
obligations related to Unique Device Identification (UDI), registration, and postmarket surveillance.
With the same intent, under the AI Act the EU declaration of conformity, among other
information, requires “AI system name and type and any additional unambiguous
reference allowing the identification and traceability of the AI system” to be included.
Moreover, Article 12 AIA introduces requirements related to functional traceability.
Article 12 mandates that high-risk AI systems maintain logs of system performance
and behaviour throughout their lifecycle to support monitoring and post-market
monitoring. Article 12 and recital 71 underscore that logging and documentation are
essential to ensure system traceability of the functioning of a high-risk AI system.
Thus, the concept of traceability is applied in two interrelated ways: (1) traceability of
device movement and lifecycle and (2) traceability of system functioning and
performance. Together, these ensure that both the hardware and software
dimensions of high-risk MDAI are adequately monitored and controlled.

5. Accuracy, Robustness and Cybersecurity
22. What cybersecurity measures are required by the AIA and MDR/IVDR?
The MDR, IVDR and AIA emphasise the need for robust cybersecurity measures in
both the pre-market and post-market stages of high-risk MDAI. The MDR and IVDR
underline that any risks associated with the operation of the device must be
acceptable so as to enable a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into
account the generally acknowledged state of the art. This can only be achieved
through the establishment of an adequate balance between benefit and risk during all
possible operation modes of a device. To this end, there is a need to consider the
relationship between "safety” and “security" related risk.60
The cybersecurity measures implemented by manufacturers must aim to prevent
unauthorised access, cyberattacks, exploits, manipulation and ensure operational
resilience. The AIA requires for high-risk MDAI the implementation of technical

59 Article 25 MDR and Article 22(1) IVDR.
60 See MDCG 2019-16.

Page 18 of 27

Medical Devices

MDCG 2025-6

solutions to address AI specific vulnerabilities.61 Manufacturers of high-risk MDAI
should ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks and take suitable
measures to secure AI specific assets such as training data sets or trained model as
well as appropriate the underlying ICT (Information and communications technology)
infrastructure.62
Manufacturers of MDAI should implement measures to secure data transmission and
storage, prevent unauthorised access,63 data and model poisoning, and detect and
respond to cybersecurity incidents. These requirements are also applicable at the
level of data governance (e.g. at the time of developing the MDAI, through the use of
training, validation and testing data).
Manufacturers must also conduct risk assessments to identify potential cybersecurity
vulnerabilities and implement appropriate mitigation measures.64 The technical
solutions aiming to ensure the cybersecurity of MDAIs shall be appropriate to the
relevant circumstances and the risks.
As cybersecurity65 is part of the essential requirements for high-risk AI systems, and
thus an obligation of the manufacturer,66 it should be part of the risk management
system,67 and the quality management system68 and therefore subject to conformity
assessment.69 All three regulations require manufacturers to establish procedures to
consider safety and security risk aspects from an early stage of design and
throughout the entire life cycle, taking into account the operational environment of
use and ICT infrastructure.70
Note: medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices are out the scope of
Regulation (EU) 2024/2847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23
October 2024 on horizontal cybersecurity requirements for products with digital
elements and amending Regulations (EU) No 168/2013 and (EU) 2019/1020 and
Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (Cyber Resilience Act).

III. Clinical /Performance Evaluation and
Testing
23. What criteria is specified in the AIA for evaluating the performance of MDAI?
The AIA specifies criteria for ensuring the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of highrisk MDAI. While the AIA does not explicitly use the term “clinical evaluation” or
"performance evaluation," it mandates requirements such as accuracy, robustness,
and cybersecurity for high-risk MDAI, which are essential aspects of performance71
as well as specifically requires testing of high-risk MDAI against prior defined metrics
and probabilistic thresholds to ensure that high-risk MDAI perform consistently for
their intended purpose and that they are in compliance with the requirements of the
AIA.72 Article 9 (8) specifically states that testing of high-risk MDAI shall be
performed, as appropriate, at any time throughout the development process.
The AIA mandate validations of AI training pipelines to ensure the reliability and
accuracy of the AI systems. This includes validating design, manufacturing, data
collection, preprocessing, model training, and quality management processes under
various conditions, with continuous monitoring to address potential issues.73
24. What specific requirements do the MDR, IVDR and AIA impose for the
clinical (MDR) or performance (IVDR) evaluation of high-risk MDAI?
The MDR and IVDR require manufacturers to validate MDAI outputs through rigorous
testing in the form of clinical or performance evaluation to ensure compliance and
that the MDAI performs as intended.74Manufacturers must perform software
verification and validation activities to ensure that MDAI meets specified
requirements and functions correctly. This requires clinical validation to demonstrate
that the MDAI is safe and provides accurate, reliable, and clinically relevant
outputs.75 Similarly, the AIA mandates verification and validation of high-risk MDAI to
ensure it operates as intended and meets safety and performance requirements. In
addition to the MDR and IVDR, the AIA introduces the requirement for the validation
of high-risk MDAI, in terms of transparency, human oversight, accuracy, robustness
and cybersecurity.76 Furthermore, the AIA requires that validation of high-risk MDAI
involves verifications that the high-risk MDAI does not infringe on fundamental rights.
All three frameworks emphasize testing under various conditions, documentation of
evaluation processes, and continuous monitoring to ensure compliance. These
regulations require manufacturers to provide evidence to support their claims,
ensuring that MDAI adhere to rigorous safety and performance standards.

MDCG 2025-6

This includes testing documentation of validation processes, and continuous
monitoring to address any issues that may arise.77 The regulations provide flexibility
in choosing validation methods but emphasise the importance of demonstrating that
the MDAI functions correctly and meets specified requirements. In addition, clinical or
performance evaluation should also support the generation of clinical evidence of the
MDAI including clinical benefit within the intended patient population, in alignment
with the intended purpose and risk classification of the device.
For high-risk MDAI that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into
service, the AIA introduces an additional consideration to be taken into account as
part of the clinical or performance evaluation in the form of pre-determined
changes.78
For further information on establishing clinical evidence, see MDCG 2020-01
“Guidance on Clinical Evaluation (MDR) / Performance Evaluation (IVDR) of Medical
Device Software”.
Note: Guidance on Pre-determined Change Control Plans for MDAI is currently under
development at the level of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum
(IMDRF) which will likely serve as a basis for future EU guidance on the subjectmatter.
25. How might manufacturers conduct clinical investigations and clinical
performance studies in conformity with both MDR/IVDR and the AIA?
High-risk MDAI must be supported by clinical evidence to demonstrate the device’s
safety, performance, and, where applicable, clinical benefit. In accordance with the
MDR and IVDR, such clinical evidence may need to be generated through a clinical
investigation (under the MDR) or a performance study (under the IVDR), as
appropriate.
Where high-risk MDAI undergoes a clinical investigation or performance study, this
constitutes real-world testing under the AIA.79 In such cases, paragraph 3 of Article
60(1) applies, which allows real-world testing of high-risk AI systems prior to their
placing on the market or putting into service, provided that such testing is in
accordance with applicable Union or national laws, including those under the MDR
and IVDR.
Although the AIA does not apply to AI systems that are not yet placed on the market
or put into service,80 the AIA introduces a specific provision for Annex III high-risk AI
systems which states that under certain conditions, these systems may undergo
testing in real-world conditions prior to their placing on the market or putting into

77

Articles 9, 10, 12 and 17 AIA.

78 Article 43 AIA.
79 Article 60(1) AIA.
80 Article 2(8) AIA.

MDCG 2025-6

service.81 Article 60(1), third subparagraph, explicitly states that such real-world
testing is permitted "without prejudice to Union or national law on the testing in realworld conditions of high-risk AI systems that are medical devices or in vitro diagnostic
medical devices.”
26. What processes are outlined in the MDR, IVDR and AIA for generating
clinical evidence to support the safety and performance of MDAI?
The MDR and IVDR introduce requirements on the generation of clinical evidence to
support the safety and performance of MDAI. The MDR/IVDR require manufacturers
to generate clinical evidence through the conduct of clinical/performance evaluations,
which may be generated through clinical investigations and clinical performance
studies (as applicable) to demonstrate conformity with the applicable requirements. 82
This involves designing and conducting studies to evaluate the performance,
reliability, and (clinical) impact of MDAI, with specific requirements for study design,
data collection, and statistical analysis. All three regulations emphasise the
importance of generating robust evidence to demonstrate the safety, performance
and effectiveness of MDAI.

IV. Conformity assessment
27. Which conformity assessment procedure apply to AI systems in the scope
of the MDR/IVDR and AIA?
For AI systems classified as high-risk MDAI under Article 6(1) (See Q2) the relevant
conformity assessment procedure is determined by the MDR/IVDR.83 For high-risk
MDAI, where both AIA Annexes I and III apply, Annex I alone should prevail for that
MDAI.
An AI system that is classified as high-risk MDAI based on Article 6(2) AIA and falls
into one of the areas listed in Annex III points 2 to 9, in accordance with paragraph 2
Article 43 (2) AIA, shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set in Annex VI
AIA. This is the procedure based on internal control which does not provide for the
involvement of a notified body.
An AI system that is classified as a high-risk MDAI based on Article 6(2) AIA, and falls
into area listed in Annex III point 1, in accordance with Article 43(1) AIA, shall follow
one of the conformity assessment procedures provided in this article.
For example, if an AI system used for healthcare, such as an emergency triage
system, qualifies as MDAI, then the conformity assessment procedure following AIA
Art. 6 (1) is applicable. AI systems that qualify as high-risk AI systems under Article
6(1) AIA must comply with both MDR or IVDR and the AIA.
81 Article 60.
82 Annex XIV MDR and IVDR.

83

Article 43 (3) AIA

Page 22 of 27

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

However, if an AI system qualifies solely as a biometric categorisation system under
Annex III Section 1 (b) AIA, then this system must comply only with the requirements
and obligations of the AIA and undergo a conformity assessment procedure in
accordance with Article 43 (1) AIA.
28. What is the process for demonstrating conformity to both the AIA and
MDR/IVDR?
High-risk MDAI undergoes the relevant conformity assessment procedure based on
the device's risk classification under the MDR and IVDR.84 Most MDAI are classified
as Class IIa (MDR), B (IVDR), or above, meaning that they require a notified body to
conduct a quality management system audit, technical documentation review, and
inspections to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements.
According to Article 43(3) AIA, for high-risk MDAI the requirements set in Articles 8 to
15 AIA and specific provisions related to the assessment of quality management
system and technical documentation covered in Annex VII point 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and the
fifth paragraph of point 4.6 AIA must be assessed or taken into consideration as part
of the conformity assessment procedure under MDR and IVDR.

V. Substantial Modification/significant
change
29. Will the type of substantial modifications under AIA be aligned with the
changes that could necessitate a new conformity assessment under
MDR/IVDR?
The concept of substantial modification is an autonomous concept under the AIA
which is defined in Article 3 (23). In accordance with Article 43(4) of the AIA, high-risk
MDAIs that have been subject to a conformity assessment procedure shall undergo a
new conformity assessment procedure in the event of a substantial modification,
regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be further distributed or
continues to be used by the current deployer.
In accordance with Article 96 (1) (c) AIA, the Commission will develop guidelines on
the practical implementation of the provisions related to substantial modification.
Once published, an assessment on application to medical devices and in vitro
diagnostic medical devices will be necessary.
30. When do changes to a high-risk MDAI after being placed on the market or
put into service not constitute a substantial modification under AIA and
MDR/IVDR?
In addition to MDR/IVDR requirements for the implementation of procedures to
manage updates and modifications to MDAIs, high-risk MDAIs that continue to learn
84 Article 16(f) and Article 43(3) AIA, Article 52 MDR or Article 48 IVDR

Page 23 of 27

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

after being placed on the market or put into service have the possibility of having predetermined changes plan checked at the time of the conformity assessment (Article
43(4) AIA). Changes to high-risk MDAIs that have been pre-determined by the
manufacturer and assessed at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and
are part of the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in AIA
Annex IV point 2(f) shall therefore not constitute a substantial modification.
Therefore, such pre-determined change should not be understood as a change to the
certified medical device or IVD under MDR Annex IX Section 4.10 and IVDR Annex
IX Section 4.11. The above-specified rule should be included in the change
management procedure of the MDR/IVDR device and in the technical documentation
as provided in AIA Annex IV point 2(f). It is essential that at the time of conformity
assessment, the pre-determined changes must be clearly specified and adaptable to
the device's evolving nature. This performance, documented in the technical
documentation, should include a detailed description of the initial performance
expectations alongside mechanisms for validating and managing changes that occur
post-market.
Note: Guidance on Pre-determined Change Control Plans for MDAI is currently under
development at the level of the International Medical Device Regulators Forum
(IMDRF) which will likely serve as a basis for future EU guidance on the subjectmatter.
31. Do high-risk MDAI that are already on the market and that undergo a
significant change in the design (Article 111 AIA) before 2 August 2027 need
to undergo a new conformity assessment following the entry into force of
the AIA?
No. Considering that as per the ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product
rules 2022[1], the term “placing on the market” refers to each individual product
rather than to a type of product.
AIA Art. 6(1) sets out the conditions for an “Annex I high-risk AI system”. The date of
application of obligations for “Annex I high-risk AI systems” is 2 August 2027,
meaning:
-

If the medical device has been placed on the market/put into service before 2
August 2027:
o If the AI system is subject to any significant changes in its design on
or after 2 August 2027, EU AIA obligations apply, including
obligations for “Annex I high-risk AI systems”
o If the AI system is subject to any significant changes in its design
before 2 August 2027: obligations for “Annex I high-risk AI
systems” do not yet apply

-

If the medical device is placed on the market/put into service on or after 2
August 2027, then EU AIA obligations apply, including obligations for
“Annex I high-risk AI systems”
Page 24 of 27

Medical Devices
Joint Artificial Intelligence Board and
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

AIB 2025-1
MDCG 2025-6

Note: Article 111 (2) AIA gives provisions for high-risk AI systems already placed on
the market or put into service and says that the EU AIA applies to high-risk AI
systems that are subject to significant design changes already as of 2 August 2026.
However, because EU AIA, Art. 6 (1) only applies as of 2 August 2027 (as specified in
EU AIA, Art. 113 (c)), AI systems that are part of a medical device (or that are
themselves medical devices) are not classified as high-risk AI systems prior to 2
August 2027, and therefore Art. 111 (2) does not apply to them prior to 2 August
2027. It is, however, to be assumed that Article 111 (2) applies to such “Annex I highrisk AI systems” by analogy, i.e. for significant changes on or after 2 August 2027.

VI. Post-market monitoring
32. What post-market surveillance requirements are outlined in the MDR/IVDR
and AIA for MDAI?
Both the MDR/IVDR and AIA mandate that manufacturers establish and implement
post-market monitoring and surveillance systems to monitor the performance and
safety of MDAI after they are placed on the market. This includes systematic
collecting and analysing data on device performance, risk analysis, adverse events
assessment and reporting, and other safety-related issues, as well as taking
appropriate corrective and preventive actions as necessary. Manufacturers must also
implement a vigilance system, report adverse events and other safety-related
information to regulatory authorities and users as required.85 Manufacturers must
regularly update their risk and quality management systems and compliance
strategies based on post-market monitoring and regulatory feedback.
33. How do the MDR/IVDR and AIA mandate continuous performance
monitoring mechanisms for MDAI?
The MDR/IVDR require manufacturers to establish post-market surveillance systems
to monitor the performance and safety of medical devices and IVDs, including MDAI,
after they are placed on the market.86 Similarly, the AIA mandates post-market
monitoring and a post-market monitoring plan to actively and systematically collect,
document, and analyse relevant data on the performance of high-risk MDAIs through
their lifetime and ensure continuous compliance with requirements of Article 8 to 15
AIA. The post-market monitoring system shall be proportionate to the nature of the
technology and the risks of the system, to ensure ongoing compliance with safety
and performance standards.87
34. What new dimensions of requirements does the AIA introduce to the
existing post-market surveillance requirements of the MDR/IVDR?
Firstly, what doesn’t change is the obligation of the manufacturers for post-market
monitoring of MDAI. Both MDR/IVDR and AIA include obligations on the
85

Article 83 MDR; Article 78 IVDR Article 72 AIA
MDR, Article 83, IVDR Article 78
87
Article 72 AIA.
86

MDCG 2025-6

manufacturer to establish and document a post-market monitoring system that is riskbased and clearly established in the quality management system that the device
continues to operate as intended.
The major monitoring change required by the AIA will be the need, where relevant, to
detect for interaction with other AI systems, including other devices and software.
Furthermore, deployers are required to monitor the operation88 and where relevant
inform the manufacturer.89
In accordance with Article 72(3) AIA, the Commission shall adopt implementing act
laying down detailed provisions establishing a template for the post-market
monitoring plan and the list of elements to be included in the plan by 2 February
2026. In accordance with Article 72 (4) paragraph 4, the necessary elements of the
post-market monitoring plan and the elements of the template adopted under the AIA
may be integrated into already existing post-monitoring plan under the MDR/IVDR,
provided it achieves an equivalent level of protection.

VII. Other questions
35. Should ‘in-house’ MDAI manufactured and used only within health
institutions be classified as a high-risk AI system?
As stated in Question 2 of this FAQ, one of the conditions to determine if an AIsystem is high-risk is that the MDAI must be subject to a third-party conformity
assessment by a notified body designated under the MDR and or IVDR.
Consequently, MDR/IVDR in-house developed medical devices and in vitro
diagnostic medical devices manufactured and used only within health institutions
established in the Union are not subject to third-party conformity assessment,
provided that the conditions of Article 5(5) are met.
Therefore, such a MDAI is not classified as a high-risk AI system. Nevertheless, other
AIA obligations apply including but not limited to prohibited practices.
Note: due to the inherent possible risks associated with in-house MDAI and in order
to ensure their safety and performance, the AIB and MDCG will provide further
guidance and clarifications on appropriate requirements for in-house MDAI.
36. Are MDAI manufacturers required to define some minimum AI training e.g.
to medical physics experts and radiologists to be able to understand
potential risks of diagnostic support tools?
The MDR, IVDR and AIA require manufacturers to ensure training of deployers using
MDAI when appropriate as part of their risk management to ensure appropriate use,
reduce foreseeable misuse and oversight during its deployment. One of the essential

requirements of the AIA for high-risk AI systems includes transparency and provision
of information for deployers.90
As explained in Recital 72 of the AIA, the accompanying instructions for use, should
assist deployers in the use of the system and support informed decision making by
them. Deployers, should be in a better position to make the correct choice of the
system that they intend to use in light of the obligations applicable to them, be
educated about the intended and precluded uses, and use the AI system correctly
and as appropriate.
In addition, when human oversight measures are identified commensurate with the
risk, level of autonomy and context of use, the natural persons to whom human
oversight is assigned must be enabled to understand the capabilities and limitations
and be able to duly monitor. Manufacturers should advise on education and training
which would provide a sufficient understanding on the MDAI interpretability of the
generated output to mitigate reasonably foreseeable misuses. Similarly, MDR and
IVDR require manufacturers to supply information on special training required to use
the device.91
Furthermore, the AIA obliges manufacturers and deployers of AI systems, to ensure,
to their best extent, a sufficient level of AI literacy of their staff and other persons
dealing with the operation and use of AI systems on their behalf, taking into account
their technical knowledge, experience, education and training and the context the AI
systems are to be used in, and considering the persons or groups of persons on
whom the AI systems are to be used.92

Answers document on the topic.

91 Annex I MDR and IVDR.
92 Article 4, as explained in Recital 20 AIA.
