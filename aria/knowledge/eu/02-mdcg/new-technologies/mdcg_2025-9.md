2. Introduction
In certain circumstances, a medical device (MD) or in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD)
may be described as a breakthrough device (BtX) when it represents an innovation that is
expected, based on available information, to offer a novel diagnostic or therapeutic option
addressing an unmet medical need for a particular patient population with serious and lifethreatening diseases or conditions when compared with state of the art.
In alignment with the MDR and IVDR, this guidance presents recommendations for facilitating
a streamlined pathway for CE marking and market access of breakthrough devices, to allow
for timely patient access without compromising the clinical evidence requirements for these
devices. It describes the opportunities and benefits available to manufacturers of BtX with the
aim of eliminating undue delays and supporting the safe innovation and availability on the
market of BtX. This document provides guidance for a process that accommodates the needs
of these devices and provides considerations for the clinical or performance evaluation of
breakthrough medical devices (BtMD) and breakthrough in vitro diagnostic medical devices
(BtIVD).
In the absence of specific provisions in the MDR or IVDR, the application of regulatory
requirements to breakthrough devices should be balanced and proportionate in light of Article
35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (health care)1, so that the pre-market clinical evidence
requirements are sufficiently met without unduly hindering or delaying patient access to these
breakthrough devices. As such, clinical evidence requirements should be balanced between
pre-market and post-market to ensure patient safety and clinical benefit while fostering
innovation. To that end, this document provides guidance with the aim of facilitating the
appropriate, timely, and proportionate pre-market collection of clinical data for MDs and data
on the performance for IVDs. In addition, guidance is provided with regard to the collection of
PMS and PMCF/PMPF data for breakthrough devices.
This guidance has been developed so that a MD or IVD can be designated as a BtMD or BtIVD
at an early stage of its development, months to years before it is expected to achieve market
access. BtX designations may be granted to multiple MDs or IVDs in development that have
the same proposed intended purpose(s) or indication(s), and a BtX’s breakthrough status is
not influenced by the placement on the market of another MD or IVD with the same intended
purpose. Once designated, a BtX can avail of certain supports and benefits to aid in its
development and timely market access, as described later. A device’s breakthrough status
may remain valid for as long as needed for the purposes of applying this guidance.
It is important to note that the status as a breakthrough device does not confer market
exclusivity for that device. The criteria should not be interpreted so as to prevent more than
one device in a given therapeutic area being designated as a BtX. Similarly, the existence of
a BtX in a specific therapeutic area is not alone a reason to prevent a manufacturer from
justifying BtX status for another similar device intended for use in the same disease or
condition.

1 “Everyone has the right of access to preventive health care and the right to benefit from medical

treatment under the conditions established by national laws and practices. A high level of human
health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and
activities.”

Of note, in some cases, a BtX might also qualify as an orphan medical device in accordance
with MDCG 2024-10. In such cases, the guidance provided in both MDCG 2024-10 and this
guidance document may be relevant to the device, and both guidance documents can be
considered to complement each other.

3. Scope
This document provides guidance for manufacturers, expert panels and notified bodies on the
process and regulatory considerations relevant for qualifying, assessing and certifying
breakthrough medical devices and breakthrough IVDs. It describes some key roles of actors
in this context, including EMA expert panels and national competent authorities, and outlines
the supports and opportunities available to manufacturers of BtX. This guidance also provides
considerations on the clinical evaluation / performance evaluation of BtX, as well as the role
of non-clinical data and preclinical evaluation, and post-market clinical follow-up / performance
follow-up for these devices.
This guidance document may apply to medical devices and IVDs across all technologies and
risk classifications.
Custom-made devices, in-house devices, and products listed in MDR Annex XVI without an
intended medical purpose are outside the scope of this guidance.

4. Breakthrough device criteria
4.1

Criteria

For the purposes of this guidance, a MD or IVD will be considered a breakthrough device if it
meets each of the following criteria:
1. Novelty
The device introduces a high degree of novelty with respect to the device technology,
the related clinical procedure, and/or the application of the device in clinical practice,
AND
2. Positive clinical impact
The device is expected to provide a significant positive clinical impact on patients or
public health, for a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition, by
either of the following:
o Offering a significant positive clinical impact on patients or public health
compared to available alternatives and the state of the art, OR
o Fulfilling an unmet medical need where there is an absence or insufficiency of
available alternative options for that purpose.

4.2

Considerations on meeting the criteria

This section should be read in conjunction with the criteria outlined in Section 4.1 above, which
define the conditions under which a medical device or in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD)
may be considered a Breakthrough Devices (BtX) for the purposes of this guidance.
The intention of this section is to provide further considerations and interpretative guidance to
support the assessment of whether a device meets each of the BtX criteria — namely, novelty
and positive clinical impact. These considerations aim to promote consistency and
transparency in the application of the criteria while allowing flexibility to accommodate the
diversity of technologies, clinical contexts, and intended purposes falling within the scope of
the Regulations.
The examples and elements described in the following subsections are illustrative rather than
exhaustive. They are intended to guide manufacturers, notified bodies, and competent
authorities in determining whether a device demonstrates a sufficient degree of novelty and
potential for significant positive clinical impact to be regarded as a breakthrough technology.
4.2.1

Degree of novelty

Novelty is mentioned directly in both the MDR and IVDR. In general, novelty relates to certain
characteristics of the device, the related clinical procedure, or the application of the device in
clinical practice, that otherwise do not have an established history of use in the state of the
art2. A high degree of novelty is required for a device to be considered BtX;

Novelty with respect to device technology may include novelty of the:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

materials, including their composition, chemical, physical and biological characteristics,
duration of contact of materials with human tissues or body fluids, or changes in the
release characteristics of substances,
design, including new or modified specifications and properties,
manufacturing process,
sustainability, circularity, durability, reusability or environmental impact of materials,
design or manufacturing process,
mechanism of action,
incorporated technologies or components that are integral to the functioning of the device,
e.g., biomarkers, analytes, test platform, or combination/integration with other devices,
type of sample or specimen,
device portability e.g. near patient tests/self-tests,
level of automation e.g. laboratory workflow automation,
site of application for an established material, leading to new/modified contact with and/or
mechanical loading of the same or different tissues,
technologies including medical device artificial intelligence (MDAI), devices with
nanotechnology or advanced materials, or devices for precision medicine.

Novelty with respect to the related clinical procedure or to the application of a device in clinical
practice3 may include novelty of the:
•
•
•
•
•

intended purpose or indication, for example for IVDs detection/measurement of
biomarkers to a different/new clinical condition
intended user, e.g., level of public access, application of the device to lay users,
mode of application, e.g., novel procedural approach or deployment methods, early
detection/prediction/screening, monitoring/disease management,
or application of existing technologies in a novel context,
interface or interaction of patients or users with the device, including control, maintenance,
and adjustment.

Additional considerations
Where a device’s novelty constitutes a e.g. first-in-class device, the first certification of that
type of device4, or is introducing an innovation that is expected to result in a paradigm shift,
that device is more likely to represent sufficient novelty with respect to qualifying as
breakthrough.
Unless the device offers a substantial and clinically meaningful deviation from the relevant
state of the art, it may be challenging for the device to qualify as breakthrough the novelty is
limited to incremental, sustaining improvement or iterative changes.
As novelty increases, uncertainty may also increase regarding the expected safety or
performance of the device in question. This reflects the fact that devices with a high degree of
novelty are divergent from alternatives and state of the art, and thus there is less relevant
supporting information from similar devices to help inform the risk evaluation for the novel
device. Where a high degree of novelty is associated with such increased uncertainty, the

device may only be considered BtX if there is adequate justification for how the device is
expected to provide a significant positive clinical impact, i.e., for how it is expected to
contribute to a clinically meaningful improvement in patient or public health outcomes
compared to available alternatives and the state of the art.
This is further illustrated in Table 1, see Appendix.
4.2.2

Significant positive clinical impact on patient or public health

A MD or IVD can be considered breakthrough only if it is reasonably expected to provide a
significant positive clinical impact to patient or public health for life-threatening or irreversibly
debilitating diseases or conditions, in the context of current alternative options (if any) and
state of the art. The device’s expected clinical impact needs to be compared with alternatives
and the state of the art in terms of clinical performance, clinical benefit, safety, risks, and
quality of life for patients. Where there are no or insufficient alternatives available, there needs
to be sufficient justification as to how the device in question addresses an unmet medical
need, on an individual and/or population level, that is not fulfilled by the current state of the
art.
The manufacturer should justify how the expected clinical impact of the device can contribute
to a clinically meaningful improvement in health outcomes on an individual (patient health)
and/or population (public health) level5. When assessing the clinical impact of a device, the
totality of expected benefits and foreseeable risks need to considered and sufficient rationale
is needed to justify how the expected clinical impact will be positive. The following aspects
should be considered when assessing the clinical impact of the device:
Clinical impact on patient health: effects on an individual level
Clinical impact on patient health is understood, in this context, as the totality of benefits,
harms and related risks at the individual level. Clinical impact on patient health refers to a
MD or IVD’s expected or potential impact on:
•
•

•

•
•
•
•

diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a life-threatening or irreversibly
debilitating disease or condition,
clinical outcomes, for example differences in safety and/or clinical performance
compared with state of the art and alternatives (if any) leading to changes in:
mortality, morbidity, health-related quality of life, burden of treatment, frequency or
duration of hospitalisations, mode of administration, severity, duration and frequency of
effects, need for medical or surgical re-intervention, etc.
provision of care to individuals or specific groups of patients, e.g.:
differences in mode of administration, procedural efficiency, or cost-effectiveness,
resulting in clinical benefits or advantages to patients compared with state of the art,
risks, hazards, and negative clinical outcomes, related to the use of the MD or IVD,
risks related to incompatibility with the use of other MDs or IVDs,
risks related to specific groups of patients, with a focus on vulnerable populations,
risks related to medical device dysfunction due to reasonably foreseeable misuse.

Clinical impact on public health: effects on a population level

5 Per Commission guidance for expert panels on CECP (2020/C 259/02) https://eur-

lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52020XC0807(01)

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

Clinical impact on public health is understood as the net potential benefits and risks
stemming from the clinical impacts on a population level. Clinical impact on public health
refers to a MD or IVD’s expected or potential impact on:
•
•
•
•

•

individual patient health, cumulatively expressed on a population level,
prevention, diagnosis, management, and treatment of serious public health threats6 and
conditions associated with significant risk to public health,
response to and management of diseases and conditions that represent local, regional,
national, European, and/or international health emergencies,
system-level benefits, for example, by enabling clinically accepted treatment pathways to
be delivered in a significantly more cost-effective, efficient, scalable, and/or simplified
manner with a greater capacity compared with state of the art,
market penetration, which may lead to an increased uptake and exposure of the device
to patients, which may in turn increase the probability of benefits and/or harms on a
population level.

For the purpose of meeting the BtX clinical criterion, a complete set of clinical data is not
required at the time of designation. Instead, the manufacturer should demonstrate a
reasonable expectation that the device could provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis
of the disease or condition identified in the proposed indications for use and intended purpose.
This includes a reasonable expectation that the device could perform as intended and that it
could more effectively treat, diagnose, prevent, or improve the management of the relevant
disease or condition, compared to available alternatives and the state of the art. To
demonstrate meeting the BtX clinical criteria, manufacturers could include relevant information
from scientific literature, data supporting scientific validity, pre-clinical data (e.g., bench,
animal, simulation), preliminary clinical data and performance data.
The level and type of information needed may vary depending on the intended use of the
device, its technology and features, and the available standard of care alternatives. The
manufacturer should consider the totality of information regarding the proposed device, its
function, potential for technical success, potential for clinical success, potential for a clinically
meaningful impact, and its potential benefits and risks. For new devices, information relevant
for estimating the clinical impact will typically come from the clinical evaluation (for MD) or
performance evaluation (for IVD) during the pre-market phase. For modifications of existing
devices, evaluation of the clinical impact may also draw on relevant post-market information.
Information from medical literature (e.g. systematic reviews, clinical treatment guidelines,
consensus statements from relevant scientific and clinical experts or medical societies) may
be used to support the justification of the expected clinical impact. For example, the literature
may highlight relevant gaps in clinical management of the disease in the existing state of the
art, which can help justify how the proposed breakthrough device is needed to address those
gaps. Relevant non-clinical, clinical, and performance data on the device, available
alternatives (if any), and the state of the art may be used to support a statement that the
breakthrough device will provide an expected positive clinical impact.
Examples that may offer positive clinical impact on patient or public health, compared to
alternatives, include:

a device intended to treat, prevent, or diagnose a life-threatening or irreversibly
debilitating disease or condition that results in clinically significant improvements in
patient-relevant clinical outcomes,
an IVD, including companion diagnostics, intended to provide information for a lifethreatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition in a way that could lead to
clinically significant improvements in clinical outcomes (e.g., earlier diagnoses, greater
sensitivity and specificity, more effective treatment),
a device intended to treat or prevent a severe side effect associated with the treatment
of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition,
a device intended to treat a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating condition that has
a significantly lower risk of harm compared to alternatives.
an IVD intended to rapidly diagnose or detect a disease with potential to cause a public
health emergency, that is significantly more cost-effective, efficient, and scalable, with
a greater capacity and speed compared.
a device intended to facilitate the delivery of early and effective care to patients in the
community in a more cost-effective manner, leading to clinical benefit to the individual
patient and system-level benefits through reductions in hospitalisations and capacityrelated burdens on the healthcare institution.

4.2.3

Life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition

In this context, a disease or condition is considered life-threatening if it is highly likely to
result in death in the absence of major medical intervention. Treatment options may be
limited in such cases, and typically major medical intervention is required to interrupt the
course of the disease or condition7.
A disease or condition is considered irreversibly debilitating if it is associated with morbidity
that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning or quality of life for an individual,
population or subpopulation. Short-lived or self-limiting morbidity is generally not considered
irreversibly debilitating; however, in certain cases, diseases or conditions that are persistent
or recurrent may be considered irreversibly debilitating.
Determining if a disease or condition is irreversibly debilitating should be based on its impact
on factors such as survival, activities of daily living, and the likelihood that there will be
disease progression and increase in severity over time if left untreated or under the current
state of the art of clinical practice. Examples of such diseases or conditions may include
cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction.
4.2.4

Available alternatives and the state of the art

Manufacturers are required to describe the current state of the art for management of the
disease or condition in question, including determining whether relevant available
alternatives exist on the EU market (i.e., whether there is an alternative drug, biological
product, MD/IVD, combination product, or clinical procedure available on the EU market for
the same specific indication(s)).

7 Certain IVDs may be considered to provide benefit for life-threatening conditions either by being

explicitly stated in the IVDR classification rules (Annex VIII), as outlined in MDCG 2020-16, or by
being determined based on the nature of the condition itself.

11

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

There may be a number of currently available potential alternatives with varying relevance in
the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease
in the EU, including options that are no longer used or are used only rarely. Therefore, when
considering potential alternatives, the manufacturer should focus on options that reflect the
current state of the art for the same specific indication(s), including the disease stage, for
which their device is being developed.
In evaluating the state of the art, consideration should be given to any relevant scientific
standards and guidance, including recommendations by appropriate authoritative scientific
bodies, clinical practice guidelines, and other reliable information that reflects current clinical
practice. When a proposed BtX is indicated for a subgroup within a broader disease
population, the state of the art for the broader population should be considered available
alternatives for the subgroup, unless duly justified.

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

PART A: Pre-clinical, Clinical, and Performance
Evaluation Considerations
5. General considerations
For BtX, as for all devices, clinical evidence8 must demonstrate compliance with the
requirements of the MDR or IVDR, including that the benefit-risk ratio is acceptable. To that
end, the manufacturer is required to conduct a clinical evaluation (for MDs) or a performance
evaluation (for IVDs).9
As described in section 4.2.2, a device with a high degree of novelty may be associated with
uncertainty regarding the device’s expected safety or performance, due to limited prior
scientific knowledge or data from similar devices (if any). These devices may be associated
with new risks or unexpected side effects; the necessary clinical evidence has to appropriately
address this uncertainty.
For BtX, a balanced approach is needed to ensure that the level of uncertainty associated with
the device doesn’t unnecessarily prevent timely patient access to devices that provide
significant positive clinical impact compared with the state of the art and alternatives (if any).
When comparing the life-cycle clinical evidence requirements of BtX with other devices, the
overall clinical evidence necessary does not differ. However, for BtX, given the potential for
significant positive clinical impact, consideration should be given to whether the necessary
longer term data10 can be collected in a way that would allow for more timely availability of
these devices to patients without compromising the clinical evidence needed to confirm the
acceptability of the benefit risk ratio.
In particular in cases where the BtX is fulfilling unmet medical needs it may be acceptable for
a BtX to be placed on the market with a higher level of uncertainty and more limited pre-market
clinical evidence provided that a well-defined plan is in place to collect confirmatory data
through comprehensive PMS and PMCF/PMPF.
In summary, provided that the available pre-market data give an appropriate level of
assurance of safety and clinical performance of the device and support the manufacturer’s
claim of significant positive clinical impact compared with the state of the art and available
alternatives, it may be appropriate for certain confirmatory data to be collected through welldefined, scientifically valid, and milestone-based PMS, PMCF/PMPF plans (e.g. studies,
investigations, other activities).
With respect to clinical evidence requirements, it may, in general, be acceptable to place a
BtX on the market provided that all of the following can be justified for the device in question:

8 For BtMD, clinical evidence must be provided by clinical data, whereas for BtIVD, clinical evidence

must be provided by scientific validity, analytical performance, and clinical performance data, per
MDR Article 61(1) and IVDR Article 56(1), respectively.
9 In accordance with MDR Chapter VI and Annex XIV and IVDR Chapter VI and Annex XIII.
10 Clinical data for MDs; scientific validity, analytic performance, and clinical performance data for
IVDs.

13

Medical Device

MDCG 2025-9

the available data11 sufficiently demonstrates:
o
o

that the benefit-risk ratio is acceptable; and
that it is reasonably expected the device will provide a clinical benefit12,
taking into account the clinical condition, the state of the art, and the
safety of patients,

-

the manufacturer has an appropriate PMS, PMCF/PMPF plan (see section 9), with a
clear justification as to why the clinical data to be collected through PMCF/PMPF are
not being collected in the pre-market phase,

-

users and patients will be adequately informed (e.g. by provision of information in the
labelling, IFU, SSCP/SSP (if applicable), and/or other accompanying documentation)
of the breakthrough status of the device and instructions to users on how to report
incidents, complaints, and other clinical experience to the manufacturer,

-

appropriate measures are in place to meet any conditions or provisions of certification
that have been imposed by a notified body.

Risk management
It is good practice in the planning phase of the device development to document in the risk
management file how evidence will be provided to demonstrate that risks, including in
particular increased risks or new risks arising from the innovative nature of the design or
technology, have been identified and effectively mitigated. Risk management is a lifecycle
process, which must be linked also in an early stage of the development with the clinical
evaluation process to ensure that the residual risks have been weighed against the benefits
offered by the BtX device. This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of safety and
performance, while supporting the availability of the innovation's benefit for the patients, as
well as during the clinical investigations / performance studies in the treatment group, and
during the post-market phase.
In the early stages of developing BtX devices, safety and performance data from patient use
are in principle unavailable. This means that the occurrence rates of side effects, incidents,
and harms from residual risks may not be fully quantifiable or quantified under certain
assumptions. As such, the manufacturer’s criteria for accepting risks, when the probability of
harms cannot be fully estimated or estimated accurately, become particularly significant. Input
from the state of the art assessment will need to provide the risks levels of the currently
accepted clinical practice and specific focus on the new design features and/or resulting
clinical procedure needs ensure that acceptable risk levels are determined from a safety
perspective.
Appropriate technical and clinical inputs should be considered to verify and validate (as far as
possible), the assumptions made in relation to the estimated occurrence levels, the predicted
harm(s) associated with the hazards, the severity of those harms and the acceptance criteria,
all in comparison with current state of the art. An estimation of the occurrence rate is
necessary before the clinical investigation(s) / clinical performance study, in order to establish
the acceptance criterion which will enable identification of unacceptable risks while the studies
are conducted according to the plan and clinical data are gradually collected. These data,
including PMCF/PMPF, enable the continuous verification of the initial estimation, and a data11 Including non-clinical/pre-clinical data, clinical data for MDs, and scientific validity, analytical

based quantification of all known clinical risks and is expected to be incorporated into the risk
management process.
Considerations relevant for IVDs
The principles outlined above remain relevant for IVDs, however consideration of IVD specific
aspects is warranted.
When it comes to IVD BtX, the performance evaluation should include the evaluation of the
analytical performance, scientific validity, and clinical performance. In line with the guidance
in the rest of this document, manufacturers should utilise avenues at their disposal to generate
data where required and possible.
Similar to BtXMDs, there may be insufficient existing evidence to draw on for certain BtIVDs.
In such circumstances it may be challenging to demonstrate scientific validity based on
available information. There may be a need to conduct proof of concept studies or other
activities to generate evidence to support the scientific validity. Consideration may be given to
additional methodologies, e.g. in-silico, to support the evidence body for scientific validity.
Given the potential for limitations with respect to both scientific validity and clinical
performance, the robustness of the analytical performance data is key for BtIVDs. The use of
novel markers or markers without certified reference materials can lead to challenges in
assessing BtIVDs. Where there are no comparative methods, comparisons to other welldocumented methods or the composite reference standard can be used where appropriate
and justified (IVDR Annex XIII, 1.2.2). In the absence of comparator assays, consider other
means to verify performance e.g. robust orthogonal testing, creation of internal reference
material etc.
Considerations relevant for MDAI
In the case of BtX that are or contain one or more high-risk AI systems (MDAI), additional
considerations are required due to the simultaneous and complementary application of both
the MDR/IVDR and the AI Act.13 These considerations apply across the entire device life cycle,
including design, pre-clinical, clinical, and performance evaluation, post-market surveillance
and change management activities.
Particular attention should be given to the quality and representativeness of data sets used
for training, validation and testing of MDAI. Manufacturers should implement robust data
governance and management practices, ensuring that data are relevant, accurate, complete
and representative to the best extent possible, and that appropriate measures are in place to
identify and mitigate bias in the data sets used for training, validation and testing, in
accordance with the requirements of the AI Act. These practices form a core part of both the
risk management system and the clinical evaluation or performance evaluation process, given
the significant influence that data integrity has on device safety and performance.
In this context, manufacturers are expected to ensure that the clinical evidence adequately
demonstrates the performance, reliability, and generalisability of the MDAI within its intended
purpose and intended use environment. The evaluation should take into account the dynamic
characteristics of MDAI, including the impact of training, updates, and data drift, as well as the
controls established through Pre-Determined Change Control Plans (PCCPs) to manage any
modifications in a predictable and transparent manner.

MDCG 2025-9

When applying the principles outlined in the IMDRF guidance “Good Machine Learning
Practice for Medical Device Development: Guiding Principles”, manufacturers should ensure
that the AI system’s design and validation processes are consistent with the MDR/IVDR
requirements on risk management, clinical evidence, and post-market follow-up. This
integrated approach supports a continuous demonstration of conformity, ensuring that the
safety and performance of the MDAI remain consistent throughout its lifecycle while preserving
the benefits of innovation for patients and healthcare systems.

6. Considerations on non-clinical data and preclinical evaluation
Pre-clinical testing, verification and validation including usability testing are essential to
demonstrate the safety of the device and to support a hypothesis that the device is safe and
performs as intended. The non-clinical data must sufficiently demonstrate the safety of the
device prior to conducting clinical investigations or performance studies. At the time of
conformity assessment, clinical/performance data for BtX devices may be limited due to their
innovative nature. Non-clinical data should reduce the risk of remaining uncertainties as far as
possible and consequentially, this data should be as robust and comprehensive as possible.
For non-BtX devices, manufacturers utilise e.g. existing scientific and clinical literature,
validated test methods, product-specific standards, and commonly accepted criteria, which
create a basis for demonstrating how the device will perform in the clinical setting and whether
it is safe when used as intended. Due to the innovative nature of BtX and the inherent limited
experience, it is recognised that there might be specific challenges for pre-clinical evaluations.
These include limited appropriate standards for testing, verification and validation, and the
lack of availability of reference materials for biocompatibility or appropriate test criteria. The
following sections outline some important considerations in the generation of pre-clinical data
for BtX devices considering the challenges associated with such devices.
Pre-clinical literature research
Pre-clinical literature search in relation to the materials used, the technologies applied, specific
design elements, etc. should be conducted and the results analysed to:
• establish the current state of the art in relation to any alternative therapies, if available,
• identify risks associated with the materials, technologies used etc in the subject device,
• support the justification of superiority/breakthrough of the design or technology of the
subject device in achieving its intended safety or performance characteristics,
• establish that there are sound scientific principles supporting the use of the novel
device's aspects in question
Such data, even if originating from fields/areas unrelated to medical applications, should be
considered and analysed if relevant to the intended purpose or otherwise justified, and
demonstrating safety and performance of the device.
Biological safety evaluation
The biological safety evaluation for BtX devices should be conducted following the same
process as for non-BtX devices, within the context of the risk management process. Any
specific risks introduced by novel materials or manufacturing technologies/methods in relation
to the biological safety of the device must be carefully evaluated considering the intended use
(including all intended users and target patient groups, medical indication, part of the body or
type of tissue interacted with, duration of contact, etc). Together with the information on the
16

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

intended use and any reasonably foreseeable misuse, available information on chemical,
physical and biological characteristics forms an important starting point. Depending to what
extent these data are sufficient to address identified biological risks, an appropriately justified
strategy and planned content for the biological evaluation of the medical device, including any
requirements for additional data generation must be developed, as well as the relevant
endpoints to be evaluated.
For novel medical devices, depending on their characteristics it can be appropriate to evaluate
additional biological effects other than those generally indicated for evaluation. Potentially,
relevant endpoints include e.g. cytotoxicity, irritation/sensitisation, systemic toxicity, local
effects after tissue contact, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, haemocompatibility,
developmental/reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Important elements
include for example, toxicologic evaluation of leachables and contaminants, degradation
characteristics and degradation products in the case of absorbable devices, specific biological
risks in case of nanomaterials. In certain cases, toxicokinetic studies to determine absorption,
distribution, metabolism and excretion may be required.
Animal testing should be carried out only when other available scientific data and in vitro
studies cannot provide sufficient information to address the safety of a medical device. If
animal testing is required, it should be performed according to the relevant standards and with
appropriate study designs. The 3Rs principle, replacement, reduction, and refinement should
be applied, in order to optimise animal welfare.
Bench testing
For BtX devices, rigorous bench testing including relevant verifications and validations, is most
likely necessary for addressing technological uncertainties, especially in the absence of
applicable standards. If relevant standards exist, these should be utilised where possible in
bench testing. In the absence of standards, manufacturers are required to define critical
performance parameters and relevant acceptance criteria based on clinical simulation,
analogous methodologies, or theoretical models (“in silico” – see below). This involves
developing detailed, custom test protocols for various conditions, including worst-case
scenarios. Any test methodology chosen should be validated and appropriate for providing
evidence towards the intended purpose of the device, The choice of the model(s) should be
justified considering the intended use and the patient population.
Bench testing results from early prototype evaluation provide the evidence that risk mitigation
actions are effective and as such feed into risk management, allowing demonstration
appropriate risk control before a device is applied in a patient setting.
In silico modelling & simulation
The design and pre-clinical development of BtX, including the rationalisation of animal testing,
can be supported and accelerated through the use of digital models and simulations. These
simulations and digital models can provide valuable input for establishing and updating the
Clinical Evaluation Plan or Performance Evaluation Plan, and can complement the pre- market
clinical or performance data. It should be noted that any in silico model intended to support
the assessment of BtX is required to demonstrate its credibility through appropriate verification
and validation activities prior to being accepted as part of the evidence base in support of the
assessment of BtX devices.
Long-term non-clinical data
As a general principle, the MDR and IVDR require that safety and performance of the device
is maintained during the shelf life and time the device remains in the patient or in use (lifetime).
Due to the innovative nature of BtX devices, some real time non-clinical data may not be
available at the time of the clinical investigation, performance study or certification. In such
17

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

cases, simulated use/ageing data have to be considered as preliminary evidence.
For long term performance data, e.g. the resistance of implants against cyclic loading, or the
long-term stability of electrodes in active implants, simulated use models may serve to
generate preliminary data for the device’s long-term performance in the patient.
Manufacturers are expected to provide a plan for confirming simulated long-term test results
by real-time and real-world data. In this context, the manufacturer is required to
comprehensively identify any limitations of the simulated use testing data which require
support by long-term real-world data. In any such long-term study planning, adequate interim
analysis timepoints are expected to be specified, to identify deviations from the initial
assumptions on the device performance and safety at an early stage to allow to initiate
countermeasures where necessary.
Usability aspects
For BtX devices, robust usability testing is essential for safety and performance, requiring a
strong useability engineering process approach from concept to post-market. If the BtX device
utilises a technology that hasn’t been used before, manufacturers should understand and
clearly document the diverse user profiles, use environments, and clinical workflows where
the device is expected to be used (incl. reasonably foreseeable misuse). The user interfaces
(where applicable) should be intuitive and ergonomically designed to minimize errors or harm
to the patients/users. This includes measures such as clear UIs, effective alarms, and
comprehensive instructions, all aimed at preventing use-related hazards. Additionally,
appropriate training should consider learnability.
Critical to this process are iterative design and extensive usability testing, starting with early
"formative" evaluations and culminating in "summative" validation with representative users in
realistic scenarios. Manufacturers should also integrate proactive risk management
throughout development, ensure standards are duly considered, and implement robust postmarket surveillance to continuously improve device usability and ensure ongoing patient
safety.
Novelty in manufacturing aspects – validation of the manufacturing processes including
appropriate in-process and final inspections
BtX devices, amongst others, may utilise novel materials, or novel manufacturing technologies
not used before in medical devices. It is expected that the technical documentation includes
clear and traceable device specifications, together with a description of the manufacturing
processes and their validation, the incoming inspection, in-process controls and continuous
monitoring and final product testing. In the absence of broadly accepted solutions, the
methods and acceptance criteria employed to furnish evidence that the finished device meets
the specifications set out by the manufacturer must be supported by a documented scientific
justification by the manufacturer. This description enables the competent authority and/or
notified body to verify the appropriateness of the process validation during the on-site audit,
inspection and/or technical documentation assessment. Also risks related to the
manufacturing and use of novel materials must be duly considered as applicable.

7. Considerations on premarket clinical evidence
7.1

Clinical Evaluation Overview

As with all devices, the manufacturer of BtX has to establish and update a clinical evaluation
plan (CEP), with particular attention to the following steps:
-

a detailed description of intended clinical benefits to patients with relevant and
18

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document
-

-

-

MDCG 2025-9

specified clinical outcome parameters;
a specification of methods to be used for examination of qualitative and quantitative
aspects of clinical safety with clear reference to the determination of residual risks and
side-effects;
an indicative list and specification of parameters to be used to determine, based on
the state of the art in clinical practice, the acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio for the
various indications and for the intended purpose or purposes of the device;
an indication how benefit-risk issues relating to specific components such as use of
pharmaceutical, non- viable animal or human tissues, are to be addressed;
a clinical development plan including premarket clinical investigations and PMCF
activities.

As the CEP may be used to guide the provision of scientific advice, this document should
clearly identify the innovative nature of the device. The CEP should outline the special
challenges relating to balancing the uncertainty relating to the device's innovative nature and
the timely lifecycle generation of clinical data. Given the novel nature of BtX, clinical
investigations and performance studies are considered a key source of pre-market clinical
evidence for the clinical evaluation.

7.2

Clinical Investigations / Performance Studies

BtMD that are implantable devices and/or class III devices require the performance of clinical
investigations in accordance with MDR Article 61(4). Similarly, for BtIVD, clinical performance
studies in accordance with Section 2 of Part A of Annex XIII must be carried out unless it is
duly justified to rely on other sources of clinical performance data14.
When designing clinical investigations or performance studies for BtX, the accumulation of
clinical data throughout the lifecycle of the device should be taken into consideration. It should
be considered that premarket studies may focus on safety and short- and medium-term
performance to attain sufficient clinical data which enables timely patient access to innovative
devices which can produce significant positive clinical impact or fulfill an unmet medical need.
In the absence of traditional approaches to generating clinical evidence for BtIVDs, such as
comparison to other well-documented methods or reference standards, a clinical performance
study comparing performance of the novel device to the current clinical standard practice is
required. Nevertheless, there may be challenges in generating clinical performance data in a
timely fashion. The use of Bayesian methodologies to support generating clinical performance
data may be warranted. In addition, simulations may be considered to supplementing clinical
performance data from in-vitro testing provided care is taken to avoid overinterpretation and
the limitations are clearly documented.
As such, while short- and medium-term performance data may be accepted at pre-market
stages, the data should be supplemented by post market clinical investigations, other PMCF
or PMPF activities.
Appendix A.2 provides further considerations on clinical investigations for breakthrough
devices, with particular attention to:

Choice of comparator/control

8. Post market surveillance and PMCF/PMPF
Implementing a comprehensive PMS system is essential for monitoring the continued safety
and performance for BtX.15
The clinical data collected from PMS, including serious incidents, should be carefully
evaluated and acted upon as part of the life-cycle evaluation of these devices. In addition to
the need for collecting any missing supportive data and evidence as part of the post-market
stage, it is foreseeable that some potential rare or latent risks may not be fully characterised
at the time of conformity assessment; in this context, it may be appropriate to further
characterise these risks or long-time performance through appropriate and scientifically robust
PMCF/PMPF.
When it comes to BtIVD, an increased focus of PMPF should be on confirming the
performance characteristics. This may include confirmation of a combination of scientific
validity, analytical performance, and/or clinical performance through proper post market
Performance Follow-up activities. The focus should be on generating data to reduce
uncertainties. This may involve PMPF studies, use of External Quality Assurance schemes,
monitoring of real-world performance of the IVD or other activities.
Where necessary, the manufacturer should aim to prospectively enrol a representative
majority of patients into pre-defined and structured PMCF/PMPF activities with appropriate
length of follow-up, until such a time as the data is sufficient for confirming the safety and
performance throughout the expected lifetime of the device.
As discussed in PART B, it may be appropriate for specific conditions or provisions of
certification to be defined by the notified body for a BtX. These conditions may include the
completion of specific PMCF/PMPF activities with pre-defined milestones and timelines for
completion of these activities.16

8.1

PMCF / PMPF Plan

It is essential that there is an appropriate and comprehensive PMCF/PMPF plan that aims to
further confirm the BtX’s safety and performance throughout its expected lifetime, confirm the
continued acceptability of identified risks, and detect emerging risks on the basis of factual
evidence. It should be ensured and verified that the PMCF/PMPF plan is implemented and
followed to completion. This plan should outline how risks will be monitored, assessed, and
mitigated throughout the PMCF/PMPF, and outline how the manufacturer will take appropriate
action where these data raise new concerns regarding the safety or performance of these
devices. Documents related to specific planned PMCF activities may be provided at the time
of conformity assessment, for example Clinical Investigation Plans for planned PMCF
investigations.
Due consideration needs to be given with respect to the potential challenges that may be faced
during execution of the PMCF/PMPF plan, which may require adjustment of the expected time
frame and milestones. Continued discussion between the manufacturer and the notified body

devices”.

may be appropriate to discuss any challenges or substantial changes faced with respect to
delivery of the PMCF/PMPF plan.
Please refer to MDCG 2020-7 and MDCG 2020-8 for general guidance on PMCF plans and
PMCF evaluation reports respectively.

8.2

PMCF investigations / PMPF studies

With respect to the general requirements and expectations for PMCF investigations / PMPF
studies, particular attention should be made in the following areas for BtX:
•

Consider any possible condition(s)/specific provision(s) provided by the notified body
in the certification and their impact on the PMCF investigation / PMPF study.

•

Consider any rare or latent risks that may not be fully characterised at the time of
conformity assessment that are intended to be further characterised through
appropriate PMCF investigations / PMPF studies.

•

PMCF investigations / PMPF studies should allow for continuous monitoring and
evaluation of these devices over the expected lifetime of the device. Long-term followup is especially important in diseases or conditions with slow progression or where the
benefits or risks of the device may manifest over an extended period.

•

Where possible, for the duration of recruitment into a PMCF investigation / PMPF
study, the manufacturer should plan to enrol a representative majority17 of
patients/patient samples exposed to the device in each study site. This is particularly
important for devices that carry significant risks (i.e. high residual risks or risks of
causing serious harm) and should take into consideration the clinical data available at
the time of CE certification, especially data that demonstrates device safety.

•

PMPF studies should focus on confirming the BtIVD performance which was
established in the pre-market phase. In particular this includes seeking to address the
uncertainties faced during BtIVD development. For example, where there were
challenges in generating scientific validity data a focus of PMPF would be to confirm
the scientific validity. Similarly, if limitations in sample size were present an emphasis
on the clinical performance assessment from a larger population would be appropriate.

8.3

Registries

In relation to BtX, and in particular for high risk interventional or implantable BtMDs, registries
are considered as a valuable tool in building a broad and comprehensive knowledge base that
can follow the device through its lifetime. As such, it is recommended that BtMD are enrolled
in registries as part of PMCF plan where appropriate and feasible.
The manufacturer should identify and, where appropriate, support the development of suitable
registries for collecting representative data on patients with the disease/condition as well on
those receiving the specific device, with the aim of comparing outcomes in patients across
Europe and worldwide. Where available and suitable, manufacturers are encouraged to use
registries established and governed by national bodies or speciality medical associations.
17 See IMDRF Principles of International System of Registries Linked to Other Data Sources and

Tools (2016).

21

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

The manufacturer should use available guidance and suitable methodologies to demonstrate
sufficient access to, and quality of, the data within the registries, for the purposes of confirming
the safety and performance of the device throughout the device’s life cycle.
For BtIVDs EQA schemes may provide another source of PMPF data similar to registries for
BtMDs.

8.4

Other PMCF/PMPF data

In the post-market setting, PMCF/PMPF data can be collected from sources other than
through PMCF / PMPF studies. These sources are often referred to as ‘real world data’ and
can be used to generate ‘real world evidence’. This clinical data is collected in the postmarket setting during the routine use of the device in clinical practice. The evaluation of realworld data should aim to detect any rare complications and understand any factors that may
affect the clinical performance of the device. For BtIVDs the data obtained through use of
real world use may be a useful and practical source of PMPF data.

9. Clinical / Performance Evaluation Report (CER /
PER)
The general MDR and IVDR requirements18 regarding the CER and PER apply to BtMD and
BtIVD respectively. Within the CER/PER, the manufacturer of a BtX should ensure that the
following information is presented in sufficient detail:
•
•
•
•
•

•

summary of the state of the art and available alternatives (if any),
summary of how the device meets the criteria for breakthrough status,
summary of any relevant interactions, dialogues, or advice from expert panels or
notified bodies as described in PART B,
summary of relevant premarket data including data from clinical investigations /
performance studies,
summary of the PMCF/PMPF plan, including:
o the type of PMCF/PMPF data to be generated to confirm the safety, clinical
performance and clinical benefit of the device throughout its expected lifetime,
o information on how this data will be generated in a timely manner,
o justification for collecting this data in the post-market setting rather than premarket,
o confirmation that the manufacturer will prospectively enrol a representative
proportion of patients into PMCF/PMPF activities including PMCF/PMPF
studies and registries,
a plan with regular, pre-defined intervals on when the CER/PER will be updated, as
well as a plan to update the CER/PER if new information becomes available that may
change the benefit-risk profile of the device.

18 Per Chapter VI and related Annexes of the MDR and IVDR, as applicable.

MDCG 2025-9

PART B - Procedural Considerations
Expert panels, established under MDR Article 106, are composed of independent scientific
and clinical experts and play a key role in ensuring consistent and scientifically sound
evaluations of certain high-risk medical devices. The following paragraphs address the
designation procedure, as well as different scenarios for the consultation of an expert panel
depending on the state of advancement of the device’s regulatory status.

10.

Involvement of Expert Panels

Expert panels, established under Article 106 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), are
composed of independent scientific, technical, and clinical experts and contribute to ensuring
that the evaluation of certain medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs)
is consistent, evidence-based, and scientifically sound. Their involvement enhances
regulatory predictability, promotes high public health protection standards, and facilitates
innovation in areas of unmet medical need.
This section outlines the potential interactions between the expert panels and manufacturers
of devices designated as breakthrough technologies (BtX), including both Breakthrough
Medical Devices (BtMDs) and Breakthrough In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (BtIVDs). The
engagement of expert panels may occur at different stages of a device’s development or
conformity assessment process, depending on its maturity and regulatory context. Where
necessary, additional scientific or technical experts will be added to the team advising or
providing an opinion on specific BtX devices.
For the purposes of this guidance, expert panels may play up to four distinct roles in the BtX
framework:
•

10.1. Providing an opinion on BtX status designation;

•

10.2. Providing early scientific advice under Article 61(2) MDR for certain devices;

•

10.3. Providing early pre-clinical or clinical advice, in line with Article 106 MDR; and

•

10.4. Conducting consultations under the Clinical Evaluation Consultation Procedure
(CECP), pursuant to Article 54(1) MDR.

The type and extent of expert panel engagement will depend on the stage of device
development, the nature of the evidence available, and the regulatory pathway applicable. For
example, early-stage devices may benefit primarily from non-clinical or regulatory scientific
advice under the pilot framework (section 10.3), whereas more advanced devices subject to
notified body review may later enter a CECP process (section 10.4).
In addition to the pre-clinical or clinical advice from the expert panels, after confirmation of the
breakthrough status, regulatory advice may also be requested from a competent authority.
The EMA expert panel secretariat will act as the contact point for that request and liaise with
the relevant authority/ies.
Where relevant, similar principles will apply to BtIVDs, with expert advice tailored to analytical
and clinical performance considerations under the IVDR. The Commission, together with the
MDCG and expert panel secretariats, will further clarify the modalities for BtIVD interactions
to ensure coherence across both legal frameworks.
23

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

10.1

MDCG 2025-9

Breakthrough status opinion / designation

To be designated as a BtX, manufacturers must request scientific advice from the expert
panels established in accordance with MDR Article 106 for an opinion on the BtX status of the
device.
An opinion on the BtX status of a medical device or IVD can be requested from the expert
panels at any time of development, as long as there is sufficient data supporting the BtX
criteria, i.e., an application with detailed supportive evidence on how the device in question
meets the criteria set out in section 4 will be required.
The expert panels will endeavour to provide an opinion on the BtX status within 60 days, and
to prioritise the applications submitted for BtX status. The Secretariat will notify the MDCG of
the expert panels’ opinion regarding the breakthrough status of a device as soon as a
conclusion is reached. A device which has received such an opinion may be referred to
thereafter as BtX designated.
A BtX, once designated, can avail of certain supports and benefits to aid in its development
and timely market access. Therefore, the breakthrough criteria have been developed so that
they can be applied to a MD or IVD at an early stage of its development. It is possible that BtX
designations may be granted to multiple MDs or IVDs in development that have (a) similar
proposed intended purpose(s) or indication(s) and that fulfil the breakthrough criteria. It is also
possible that in the intervening period between BtX designation and market access, a different
MD or IVD may be placed on the market with the same intended purpose. However, once
attributed, the breakthrough status of a BtMD or BtIVD may remain valid for as long as needed
for the purposes of applying this guidance, and the placement on the market of another MD
or IVD with a similar intended purpose does not change the breakthrough status given to a
MD or IVD.

10.2
Early advice for BtX class III devices and class IIb active
devices intended to administer and/or remove a medicinal
product
Manufacturers of class III devices and class IIb active devices intended to administer and/or
remove a medicinal product may request early scientific advice in accordance with Article
61(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR). This provision enables consultation with an expert
panel with the aim of reviewing the manufacturer’s intended clinical development strategy and
proposals for clinical investigation.
Within the context of breakthrough technologies (BtX), this mechanism provides an
opportunity for manufacturers to obtain targeted scientific input on their evidence-generation
strategy early in the development process and facilitates prioritised assessment by notified
bodies (see section 11.1).It is therefore recommended that manufacturers of BtX devices
falling within the scope of Article 61(2)use this possibility to seek expert panel advice on their
planned clinical development and clinical investigation strategy. Such engagement may also
cover proposed post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) activities where relevant to the
demonstration of ongoing safety and performance and in particular if a BtX device is intended
to be placed on the market with less reliance on pre-market data compared with similar nonBtX novel devices (see sections 5 and 8).
24

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

The expert panel will review the proposed strategy and provide written advice reflecting its
scientific and clinical considerations. The expert panels will endeavour to provide their advice
within 60 days, and to prioritise the devices that received a positive opinion regarding their
BtX status.
The manufacturer must give due consideration to the expert panel’s advice — both on the BtX
status and on the clinical development approach — and document it in the clinical evaluation
report.
To maximise the value of the consultation, requests should clearly identify the specific
scientific or methodological questions for which expert input is sought, and highlight how such
advice could reduce regulatory uncertainty, support evidence generation, or facilitate timely
access to the EU market.

10.3

Early advice for BtX from other device risk classes

In accordance with MDR Article 106(11), for devices from other risk classes than those
outlined in section 10.2, the expert panels may be requested to provide advice on the criteria
for an appropriate data set for assessment of the conformity of a device, in particular with
regard to the clinical data required for clinical evaluation.
For breakthrough in vitro diagnostic devices (BtIVDs), a parallel approach may be envisaged,
allowing expert advice from panels established under MDR Article 106. This could cover
analytical and clinical performance study design, validation strategies, ensuring alignment with
the objectives of the BtX framework.
It is recommended that manufacturers of such BtX devices use this possibility to seek expert
panel advice on their planned clinical development and clinical investigation strategy. Such
engagement may also cover proposed post-market clinical follow-up (PMCF) activities where
relevant to the demonstration of ongoing safety and performance, and in particular if a BtX
device is intended to be placed on the market with less reliance on pre-market data compared
with similar non-BtX novel devices (see sections 5 and 8).

10.4

Clinical Evaluation Consultation Procedure (CECP)

The consultation of an expert panel in relation to a BtX described in sections 11.2 and 11.3 is
independent of the clinical evaluation consultation procedure (CECP) required under MDR
Article 54(1). However, the areas that were subject to consultation of the expert panels will be
taken into account during the CECP.
The notified body should indicate in their CECP submission if the device has been subject to
an advice procedure, and reflect in the clinical evaluation assessment report how the advice
has been taken into consideration.

25

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

10.5
Advice provided in parallel by the Expert panels and the
Member State Coordination Group on Health Technology
Assessment (HTA)
Class III implantable devices and class IIb active devices intended to administer and/or
remove a medicinal product are eligible for a parallel HTA Coordination Group
(HTACG)/Expert Panels (ExP) Joint Scientific Consultation (JSC). Devices that are
designated as breakthrough are likely to be exemplary applicants to such procedure.

11.

Notified body activities and responsibilities

The notified body’s assessment of a designated19 BtX should take into account the
considerations described in this guidance. When performing conformity assessment activities,
notified bodies should ensure that the approach applied to BtX devices remains scientifically
rigorous, proportionate, and responsive to innovation while maintaining a high level of health
and safety protection.

11.1

Prioritisation of BtX and access to structured dialogue

For devices that meet breakthrough criteria, including the potential to address significant
unmet medical needs or offer clinically meaningful advantages over existing solutions,
notified bodies should:
•

Prioritise BtX files during planning and resource allocation, in view of their potential
to address unmet medical needs or offer clinically meaningful advantages over
existing solutions;

•

Engage in early and structured dialogue with manufacturers to clarify expectations
regarding the generation of clinical evidence, the design of performance or usability
studies, and the development of post-market surveillance and PMCF strategies; and

•

Coordinate, where appropriate, with expert panels to ensure coherence between
scientific advice and the conformity assessment process, thereby facilitating a timely
and consistent evaluation.

Notified bodies may also, outside of the CECP process, seek supplementary scientific or
clinical advice from the expert panels where additional clarification or input is deemed
necessary to support the assessment of a BtX device.
Such proactive interaction and prioritisation should contribute to a more efficient conformity
assessment, improved predictability for manufacturers, and ultimately to earlier access to
safe and effective breakthrough technologies for patients and healthcare systems.

11.2
Support to NBs in the clinical assessment of BtMDs in line
with MDR Article 106(11)
The notified body involved in the conformity assessment of a medical device which was
granted BtMD status may seek advice from an expert panel in accordance with MDR Article
106(11). Before submitting such a request, the notified body should consult the manufacturer
to inform them and in case further input into to the request is needed. Having regard to the
limited capacity of the expert panels, notified bodies are advised to reach out to the EMA
expert panel secretariat as early as possible to include an envisaged request for advice in
the expert panels’ planning.
The request for advice from the notified body will concern the clinical data required for the
manufacturer’s clinical evaluation, taking into account the considerations of this guideline.
For that purpose, the notified body should put forward to the expert panels specific questions
for which it seeks the panels’ advice. Those questions should be based on a preliminary
analysis of the clinical evaluation provided by the manufacturer.
The notified body should determine the timing of the consultation in agreement with the
manufacturer depending on how it fits best in the overall conformity assessment procedure.
The expectation is that the consultation will be conducted in parallel of the conformity
assessment procedure with minimal impact on the overall timelines.
The expert panels will endeavour to provide their advice within 60 days, and to prioritise the
devices that received a positive opinion regarding their BtX status.

11.3

Considerations for SMEs manufacturing BtX

In line with Annex VII, Section 1.2.8 of MDR and IVDR, notified bodies must ensure that their
terms of service are fair and reasonable, taking into account the needs of SMEs. This is also
of relevance to SMEs manufacturing breakthrough devices.
Therefore, in addition to the requirement to establish and publish transparent fee structures20
that take into account the interest of micro, small, and medium enterprises21, notified bodies
should consider adopting the following in the context of SMEs manufacturing BtX:
•

Provide support and structured dialogue mechanisms to help navigate regulatory
expectations,

•

Establish procedures to facilitate the conformity assessment of breakthrough devices
in a transparent and timely manner that is cost-effective and proportionate to the
interests of SMEs.

11.4

Certification with Specific Conditions or Provisions

BtX for which the pre-market clinical evidence is deemed sufficient but needs to be completed
or confirmed through PMCF/PMPF, are a good example where notified bodies can make use
of the possibility to issue certificates with specific conditions or provisions. These conditions
should be proportionate to the characteristics of the BtX, including its intended purpose, target

20 In accordance with MDR Article 50 and IVDR Article 48.

population, duration of use, benefits and risks, clinical evidence, and any rare or latent risks
or other aspects that may not have been fully characterised in the pre-market setting. Due
consideration should be given to the guidance on clinical evidence and PMCF/PMPF in this
document, as well as any relevant advice, opinions, or supports that have been provided to
the BtX manufacturer, including scientific advice from EMA expert panels and regulatory
advice from NCAs.
Specific conditions or provisions20 may include, for example:
•
•
•

•

Defined PMCF/PMPF activities, e.g., PMCF studies, within a specified period of time
to generate additional clinical data,
Enhanced surveillance and monitoring, including periodic milestone reporting on
safety and performance,
Informing users and patients (in the labelling, IFU, SSCP/SSP and/or other
accompanying documentation) of:
o the BtX status of the device,
o the clinical evidence supporting the BtX,
o instructions to users on how to report incidents, complaints, and other clinical
experience to the manufacturer.
BtX manufacturer should inform the EMA/MDCG that they have achieved market
access (see Section 14 for more details on Transparency).

11.5

Surveillance Activities by Notified Bodies

For breakthrough devices, notified bodies should re-assess the updated clinical evaluation
reports and the results of any PMCF/PMPF studies, at an increased frequency that is
proportionate to the level of clinical risk for the device.
The notified body should consider PMS data, including the main findings from PMCF/PMPF
as part of the agreed surveillance activities and PSUR22 evaluation and verify whether the
device’s benefit-risk profile continues to support the placing of the device on the market. As
part of their surveillance activities and post-certification monitoring, notified bodies need to
monitor compliance with any conditions/provisions that are binding for the manufacturer and
associated with the certification decision, such as updates to clinical (performance) data at
defined intervals. Where applicable, especially if listed as part of the conditions for certification,
the notified body also needs to review the clinical evaluation that the manufacturer has
updated based on its PMS, PMCF/PMPF.
When the conditions/provisions on the certificates are not fulfilled/met by the manufacturer,
the notified body should consider the impact thereof on the certificate’s validity, as specified
in their procedures. Not fulfilling the conditions/provisions could ultimately lead to suspension
or withdrawal of the certificate.

12.

Roles of National Competent Authorities

Among their responsibilities, NCAs are responsible for assessing clinical investigations of
MDs and clinical performance studies of IVDs, , market surveillance, enforcement, and

22 Pursuant to MDR Article 86 / IVDR Article 81.

28

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

coordination of regulatory activities at both national level and EU level. In the context of
breakthrough devices, NCAs can play a role in:
•

Supporting BtX manufacturers (especially SMEs) in understanding the requirements
laid down by the MDR and IVDR and other potentially applicable legislation,

•

Facilitating the priority assessment of clinical investigations and clinical performance
studies of BtX requiring NCA authorisation, including coordinated assessments23
where applicable,

•

Communicate with MDCG, Expert Panels, and Notified Bodies in cases of emerging
safety issues.

DAs are responsible overseeing notified body and can play a role within the scope of NCA
oversight as designating authority, ensuring that surveillance activities agreed by notified
bodies for BtMDs and BtIVDs reflect the risk profiles and data generation pathways of these
devices and verification that SME interests are being appropriately reflected.
Several member states have established innovation offices or other forms of contacts to
support manufacturers with their regulatory activities, including but not limited to information
on compliance with the MDR and IVDR, and on the requirements surrounding clinical
investigations and clinical performance studies Some NCAs may provide tailored regulatory
advice and information to developers at national level. The EMA expert panel secretariat will
act as the contact point for that request and liaise with the relevant authority/ies.

13.

Funds to support innovation

Recognising that breakthrough devices often require significant early investment in regulatory
strategy, clinical development and PMCF/PMPF, this section intends to provide a high-level
overview of available instruments.
By leveraging both EU-wide programs and national initiatives, medical device companies can
access a broad spectrum of funding opportunities to support their innovation and growth
objectives.

13.1

National Funding Mechanisms

Many countries have designated agencies or contact points that provide guidance on
available funding opportunities and application procedures.

13.2

European Funding mechanisms

At Union level, developers of breakthrough devices may be supported through:
•

The EU4Health Programme, particularly for technologies aligned with digital health,
cancer, and rare diseases;

•

The European Innovation Council (EIC) Accelerator, which offers blended financing
(grants + equity) to high-risk, high-impact innovations;

23 Per MDR Article 78 and IVDR Article 74.

29

Medical Device

MDCG 2025-9

•

Horizon Europe health clusters and the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI) for
collaborative R&D efforts;

•

The InvestEU Programme, which includes access to risk-sharing instruments for
SME-led health technology innovation.

•

Enterprise Europe Network (EEN): EEN provides support for SMEs seeking to
innovate and grow internationally, including advice on funding and access to finance.

14.

Transparency of BtX

In the interest of transparency and the coordinated governance and oversight of the
procedures described in this guidance, it is essential that all relevant stakeholders, including
users, healthcare professionals and patients have appropriate access to information regarding
the Btx status and evidence base.
The manufacturer should ensure that such transparency is achieved through the clear and
consistent communication of relevant information in the device’s labelling, instructions for use
(IFU), Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) or Summary of Safety and
Performance (SSP), and/or other accompanying documentation, as appropriate.
This information should include, as relevant:
o
o
o

o

o

The designation of the device as a Breakthrough Technology (BtX)
The EUDAMED registration details, ensuring public traceability of the device
in accordance with the MDR/IVDR requirements;
The SSCP or SSP, providing accessible and up-to-date information on the
device’s performance, safety, and clinical evidence, as made available
through EUDAMED;
The clinical investigation or performance study registration details (if
applicable), including references to relevant public registries where
information on ongoing or completed investigations is available;
Instructions to users, health professionals, and patients on how to report
incidents, complaints, and other clinical experiences directly to the
manufacturer, as part of the device’s post-market surveillance system.

The Commission will aim to develop a public dashboard to facilitate access to information on
the number of BtX designated, those currently undergoing certification with the name and
number of the notified bodies, those who have received certificates and have achieved market
access.
Manufacturers and notified bodies are expected to proactively communicate relevant updates
on the BtX status or supporting evidence through this publicly accessible dashboard, in line
with applicable regulatory and confidentiality requirements.

As novelty increases, uncertainty may also increase with respect to the expected safety or performance of the device, as
less relevant supporting information from similar devices is available to help inform the risk evaluation for the novel
device. Where a high degree of novelty is associated with increased uncertainty, the device may only be considered BtX
if there is adequate justification for how the device is expected to provide a significant positive clinical impact, see 4.2.3.
Three qualitative levels (low, medium, and high) of uncertainty are described below.
Low level of uncertainty: Expected safety and performance well understood. Unlikely to have unidentified risks
Medium level of uncertainty: Possible that there are existing unidentified new/emerging risks
High level of uncertainty: Likely to have existing unidentified new/emerging risks

Appendix A.2 – Considerations on Clinical
Investigations and Performance Studies for BtX
Study Design:
While randomized controlled trials (RCT) are often considered the preferred study design for
clinical investigations of medical devices, this study design may not suit many BtX devices for
example, where there are no alternatives or where available alternatives are not considered
to offer similar patient benefit (lack of equipoise). In these cases, simpler methodological
approaches may be acceptable if well justified. In cases where the state of the art may already
provide satisfactory diagnostic or therapeutic options, a comparative study design may be
more appropriate. The choice of design should be carefully considered and justified on a caseby-case basis in terms of its strengths and limitations (e.g. vulnerability to bias or confounders)
and its ability to assess and confirm the positive clinical impact on patient and/or public health.
As an illustrative example, adaptive and sequential designs may be an appropriate design for
confirmatory pre-market clinical investigation. These studies are based on interim analyses
that are planned to be carried out over the course of the CI/PS.
An adaptive design may allow for potential changes in parameters (e.g. sample size
requirements, randomization ratios, number of analyses) as the study progresses. However,
care should be taken to ensure the integrity of the study is not compromised as a consequence
of excessive interim analyses or adaptations. Where possible, all anticipated or potential
adaptations of the study should be described in the CI/PS plan, based on anticipated results
of the planned interim analyses.
A sequential design is based on interim analysis of the study’s primary endpoints, and unlike
adaptive studies, no adaptation of parameters is allowed. Instead, the stepwise methodology
allows for continued, periodic analyses after each predefined group/cohort/stratum of patients
reach their outcome, thus allowing for interim opportunities to determine whether there is
sufficient evidence of clinical benefit or lack thereof.
Where appropriate, the findings from interim analyses may demonstrate sufficient clinical
evidence for initial conformity assessment and market access. In this event, where possible
and where there still is equipoise, the study should continue in the post-market setting to
completion as planned in the CI/PS plan, to verify the finding from interim analysis, and to
ensure appropriate follow-up for the study participants. Although adaptive and sequential
methodologies can provide more flexibility, it is important to note that this approach can be
vulnerable to type I (false positive) error. This potential for error should be considered when
evaluating clinical data generated from these study designs.
The below table illustrates suggested study designs for certain high risk BtMD, as adapted
from recommendations24 developed by CORE-MD research consortium.

* This table gives study design recommendations for certain high risk (Class III / implantable)
interventional BtMDs. It is acknowledged that this table may not be applicable to certain
BtMDs, such as lower risk (non-implantable, non-Class III) or non-therapeutic BtMDs.
Similarly, this guidance is not foreseen as being directly applicable to BtIVDs.
** As described in Section 8 of this guidance, PMCF activities should be designed to confirm
the safety and clinical performance of BtX throughout their expected lifetime. Thus, the
duration of follow up of all patients enrolled in a PMCF study should be appropriate for the
lifetime evaluation of the safety and clinical performance of the BtX.
*** The study designs listed in the final row should only be considered if it can be duly justified
as to their appropriateness, with justification as to why the recommended study designs are
not suitable for the BtMD in question.
Objectives
It may be suitable for the primary objectives of their pre-market clinical investigations of BtMD
to focus on the assessment of short- to medium-term performance and patient safety
Pre-market performance studies of BtIVD should focus on establishing a base level of
evidence to confirm/establish the safety and analytical performance. It is acknowledged that
challenges may exist with respect to the generation of clinical performance data.
For PMCF investigations of medical devices, the objectives should aim to evaluate the overall
safety, performance, and clinical benefit of the device throughout its expected lifetime, with a
suitable focus on long-term endpoints.

33

Medical Device
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-9

For PMPF studies, the focus should be on confirming the safety and performance through the
use of planned activities, for example, long term studies, EQA schemes, real world evidence
collection etc. (See section 8)].
Endpoints:
Although disease-specific clinical endpoints remain the standard, such endpoints may not be
sufficiently established, understood, or validated in the context of BtX. In this regard,
appropriately validated surrogate endpoints can be considered, if justified. In these cases,
relevant disease-specific clinical endpoints should subsequently be investigated, where
possible, in the post-market setting, e.g., in PMCF investigations / PMPF studies.
When selecting endpoints, due consideration should be given with respect to how the
endpoints can be used to confirm the claimed positive clinical impact of the BtX on patient
and/or public health. When considering positive clinical impact on patient health, it is important
to identify and consider the priorities and needs from the perspective of the patient. To that
end, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and other patient-centric measures can be considered
for inclusion e.g. as secondary/exploratory outcomes and endpoints or as primary endpoints
for evaluating clinical benefit in exceptional circumstances where it can be justified that other
endpoints cannot be collected in the target population. When considering the inclusion of
PROs and other clinically relevant endpoints, input from independent patients’ representatives
should be sought, if available and appropriate.
Choice of comparator/control
As previously discussed, the choice of comparator is dependent on several factors including
equipoise and the availability (or absence thereof) of suitable alternatives.
In general, a concurrent active comparator is the preferred option if appropriate, where the
active comparator is an appropriate alternative or represents the current state of the art. Sham
or placebo may be appropriate controls, however subjects in these arms must receive the
state of the art in management of their condition – i.e., they must receive care at least to the
same level as the care they would receive in normal clinical practice.
In some circumstances, data from open-label studies with historical controls might be
acceptable, however this design must be well justified, including justification as to why other
study designs are not appropriate.
