Guidance on application of UDI rules to
device-part of products referred to in Article
1(8), 1(9) and 1(10) of Regulation 745/2017

February 2019

This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group
(MDCG) established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is
composed of representatives of all Member States and it is chaired by a
representative of the European Commission.

1. Scope
Article 1(8),1(9), 1(10) of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) set
the basic criteria to determine whether and to what extent the relevant legislation on
medical devices, medicinal products, human tissue and cells apply to certain
products containing a medical device part. In particular,
“8. Any device which, when placed on the market or put into service, incorporates, as
an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, would be considered to be a
medicinal product as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC, including
a medicinal product derived from human blood or human plasma as defined in point
10 of Article 1 of that Directive, and that has an action ancillary to that of the device,
shall be assessed and authorised in accordance with this Regulation.
However, if the action of that substance is principal and not ancillary to that of the
device, the integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC or Regulation
(EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as applicable. In
that case, the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex
I to this Regulation shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part
are concerned.
9. Any device which is intended to administer a medicinal product as defined in point
2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC shall be governed by this Regulation, without
prejudice to the provisions of that Directive and of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with
regard to the medicinal product.
However, if the device intended to administer a medicinal product and the medicinal
product are placed on the market in such a way that they form a single integral
product which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is
not reusable, that single integral product shall be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC
or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, as applicable. In that case, the relevant general
safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall apply
as far as the safety and performance of the device part of the single integral product
are concerned.”
10. Any device which, when placed on the market or put into service, incorporates, as
an integral part, non-viable tissues or cells of human origin or their derivatives that
have an action ancillary to that of the device shall be assessed and authorised in
accordance with this Regulation. In that case, the provisions for donation,
procurement and testing laid down in Directive 2004/23/EC shall apply.
However, if the action of those tissues or cells or their derivatives is principal and not
ancillary to that of the device and the product is not governed by Regulation (EC) No
1394/2007, the product shall be governed by Directive 2004/23/EC. In that case, the
relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to this
Regulation shall apply as far as the safety and performance of the device part are
concerned”.

2. Application to UDI rules to the device part of products referred to in
point 1 that are governed by the medical device Regulations
EXAMPLES:
- Catheters coated with heparin or an antibiotic
- Soft tissue fillers incorporating local anaesthetics
- Implantable infusion pump
- Spacer devices for use with metered dose inhalers
- Bone void filler with an antibiotic
- Bone void filler with animal growth factors, where the action of the growth
factors is demonstrated to be ancillary to that of the physical filler
If a product referred to in point 1 is assessed and authorised in accordance with the
Medical device regulations, the device part will be subject to all UDI-related
obligations.
3. Application to UDI rules to the device part of combination products that
do not fall under the medical device Regulations
EXAMPLES:
- Non-reusable autoinjectors containing a medicinal product as integral part
- Nebulizers precharged with a specific medicinal product
- Patches for transdermal drug delivery
- Wound dressings impregnated with an antibiotic, where the primary intended
purpose is to administer the antibiotic to the wound
- Bone void filler with animal growth factors, where the action of the growth
factors cannot be demonstrated to be ancillary to that of the physical filler
In general terms, if a product referred to in point 1 is governed by the medicinal
product or tissue and cell legislation, the device part is required to comply only with
the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I to the
Regulation on medical devices. This cannot be interpreted as meaning that the
relevant obligations related to UDI, as laid down in Chapter III and Annex VI of the
Regulation on medical devices, apply to the medical device part or the package of
the relevant combination. For this reason, the medical device part is not mandatorily
required to comply with any UDI-related obligation. This also means that a UDI is not
needed on the package that combines the medicinal product and the medical device1 2.

However, if the medical device part bears a UDI on its label, that should not be deemed as being in contrast with the
applicable medical device legislation
For products such as prefilled syringes which are made on the basis of a UDI direct part marked (MDR compliant)
syringe it shall be noted that, while UDI rules do not apply to the device part of the integral product, the direct mark
UDI on the syringe shall not be removed unless that mark compromises the safety and performance of the integral
product.
