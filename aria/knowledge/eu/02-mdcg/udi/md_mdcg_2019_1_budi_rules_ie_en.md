In order to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, the quality of the code value
entered in Eudamed, the Basic UDI-DI requirements on format should be as close as
possible to the ones for the UDI-DI. In particular,


the Basic UDI-DI code value shall have maximum 25 characters, so that it
does not differ too significantly from the maximum length of the UDI-DI as
established by the issuing entities;



a check digit/character must be part of the Basic UDI-DI, based on an
algorithm defined by the issuing entity. This algorithm shall be provided by the
issuing entities to the Commission and to the manufacturers.
