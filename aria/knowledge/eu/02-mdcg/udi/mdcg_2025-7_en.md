Background
The introduction of the Unique Device Identification (UDI) system referred to in Article 27 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices1 (‘the MDR’) aims to ensure an adequate level
of identification and traceability of medical devices. Basic UDI-DIs, UDI-DIs and UDI-PIs shall
be assigned (in compliance with the rules of the designated issuing entities) by manufacturers
to all devices, other than custom-made devices, prior to their placement on the market. To
further strengthen and enhance traceability and recording of UDIs, manufacturers shall register
Basic UDI-DIs and UDI-DIs in UDI/Device registration module2 of the European Database on
Medical Devices (Eudamed)3.
For devices presenting a high level of individualisation (‘highly individualised devices’), notably
contact lenses and spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading
spectacles, and in order to adapt the UDI-DI assignment criteria to such kind of devices, the
assignment of a ‘Master UDI-DI’ has been foreseen according to Annex VI, Part C, Sections
6.6.1 and 6.6.2 of the MDR, as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2023/2197 on Master UDI-DI for contact lenses4 and by Commission Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2025/1920 on Master UDI-DI for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear
reading spectacles5. The Master UDI-DI technical solution aims to group highly individualised
devices with specific similarities in terms of relevant design parameters under a common
identifier to be assigned and registered in the UDI/Device registration module of Eudamed,
thus relieving manufacturers, distributors and the Eudamed database from having too many
identifiers assigned for similar devices. The Master UDI-DI technical solution for such devices
is being developed by the EU UDI issuing entities6.
According to MDCG 2021-24 Guidance on classification of medical devices7, corrective contact
lenses are considered to be class IIa (short-term use) or class IIb (long-term use) medical
devices. Spectacle frames (i.e. glasses), spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading
spectacles are considered to be class I medical devices.
This MDCG Position Paper aims at clarifying the timelines of the implementation of the Master
UDI-DI to the abovementioned devices, as established in the respective Delegated
Regulations, and the obligation to label the Master UDI-DI and to use the UDI/Device
registration module of Eudamed, and the interrelation between them.

Reference dates
•

Application of UDI labelling requirements:

As established in Article 123(3)(f) of the MDR, the provisions of Article 27(4) on the placement
of UDI carriers on the label of the device and on all higher levels of packaging apply for classes
IIa and IIb devices from 26 May 2023, while for class I devices they apply from 26 May 2025.
•

Mandatory use of the UDI/Device registration module in Eudamed:

As established in Article 29 and in Article 123 of the MDR, as amended by Regulation (EU)
2024/18608, and 6 months after the publication on the Official Journal of the European Union
(OJEU) of the notice on the functionality referred to in Article 34(3) of the MDR9, the use of the
UDI/Device registration module of Eudamed becomes mandatory to use as from 28 May 2026.
•

Implementation of Master UDI-DI to contact lenses:

As established in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2197 of 10 July 2023, as
amended, the Master UDI-DI assignment solution must be implemented by manufacturers of

the representation of the time lapses when the use of the UDI/Device registration
module in Eudamed is mandatory but not the Master UDI-DI assignation solution yet:
-

for contact lenses: from the second quarter (Q2) 2026 to the fourth quarter (Q4) 2026

-

for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles: from the
second quarter (Q2) 2026 to the fourth quarter (Q4) 2028

Considerations and way forward
The different and partially overlapping timelines for the assignment, labelling and registration
of the ‘highly individualised devices’ subject to the Master UDI-DI assignment solution (contact
lenses, spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles) make that
the obligation to label the Master UDI-DI and register those devices in the UDI/Device
registration module of Eudamed follows the Master UDI-DI assignment obligation, with time
laps spanning from about 5 months for contact lenses to about 29 months for spectacle frames,
spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles.
However, the relevant Commission Delegated Regulations, in their respective Articles 2 in fine,
provide for the possibility for manufacturers to voluntarily assign a Master UDI-DI before it
becomes mandatory on the respective dates of application. This means that manufacturers
should try to assign Master UDI-DIs as soon as possible even before the assignment becomes
mandatory, with the obligation to label it and register the devices in Eudamed immediately
following, after the assignment is done.
From 26 May 2025 until the Master UDI-DI assignment solution (acting as UDI-DI for highly
individualised devices) is fully available through the relevant Commission Delegated

Regulations and the appropriate EU UDI issuing entity10 standard, the abovementioned highly
individualised devices will continue to be identified with either an issuing entity identifier or
similar internal manufacturer device identifier as for the current procedures.
Manufacturers of contact lenses, spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear
reading spectacles are strongly encouraged to make use of the voluntary assignment of Master
UDI-DI before the mandatory dates of application in due time, to be able to take advantage of
the features offered by the Master UDI-DI assignment solution.
On the other hand, once the Vigilance and post-market surveillance module in Eudamed is
mandatory to use11, Master UDI-DI, if assigned, should be used for reporting of vigilance cases
for contact lenses, spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles
even though the application dates of the Commission Delegated Regulations on Master UDIDI have not passed yet.
More information on the implementation of the Master UDI-DI assignment solution for contact
lenses, spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles is available
on the guidance documents MDCG 2024-14 Rev. 112 and MDCG 2025-813, including the
practical handling of reporting of vigilance cases.
