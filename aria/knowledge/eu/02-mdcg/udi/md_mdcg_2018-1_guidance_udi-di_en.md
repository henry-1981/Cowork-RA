Guidance on BASIC UDI-DI and changes to UDI-DI
Introduction
The new Medical Device Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746 introduce a
Unique Device Identification (UDI) system for medical devices.
Main provisions related to the establishment of the UDI system are contained in
Chapter III and Annex VI of the two medical device Regulations.
The main features of the UDI system and relevant obligations for operators will be
provided in a dedicated Q/A paper to be published by the Commission in spring
2018.
This guidance is intended to provide a clarification on the notion of Basic UDI-DI, its
use in relevant documentation and the factors triggering UDI-DI changes.
The Basic UDI-DI
The Basic UDI-DI is the main key in the database and relevant documentation (e.g.
certificates, declaration of conformity, technical documentation and summary of
safety and clinical performance) to connect devices with same intended purpose, risk
class and essential design and manufacturing characteristics.
It is independent/separate from the packaging/labelling of the device and it does not
appear on any trade item.
Any Basic UDI-DI shall identify the devices covered by that Basic UDI-DI in a unique
manner.
Link with between Basic UDI-DIs and certificates or declaration of conformity
In accordance with Annex XII of the medical device Regulations, the scope of the
certificates shall unambiguously identify the device or devices covered. The scope of
EU technical documentation assessment certificates, EU type-examination
certificates and EU product verification certificates shall include, together with the
Basic UDI-DI, a clear identification, including the name, model and type, of the device
or devices, the intended purpose, as included by the manufacturer in the instructions
for use and in relation to which the device has been assessed in the conformity
assessment procedure and the risk classification.

Each of the abovementioned certificates shall identify and cover all devices
associated with the same Basic UDI-DI, that is referred to in that certificate.
The association between different Basic UDI-DIs, where applicable, shall be
identified through the technical dossiers.
In accordance with Annex IV of the two Regulations, the declaration of conformity
shall contain the Basic UDI-DI and the product and trade name, product code,
catalogue number or other unambiguous reference allowing identification and
traceability of the device covered by the EU declaration of conformity.
Changes of UDI-DI
A new UDI—DI shall be required whenever there is a change that could lead to
misidentification of the device and/or ambiguity in its traceability. In particular, a new
UDI-DI shall be required in the case of any change of the following elements: name
or trade name, device version or model, labelled as single use, packaged sterile,
need for sterilization before use, quantity of devices provided in a package, critical
warnings or contra-indications (e.g. containing latex or DEHP), CMR/Endocrine
disruptors1 2.
A UDI-DI shall be associated with one and only one Basic UDI-DI.
Regarding changes to the specific data elements listed below3, the following
considerations should be noted:
1. Is the Device Directly Marked (Yes/No)
The database design will force the creation of a new UDI-DI only if there is a change
from Yes to No and not vice versa for this data element.
2. Manner in which production of the device Is controlled (expiry date or
manufacturing date, lot number, serial number, software identification) - Type
of UDI-PI
As long as there is no change to the label, a change to this data element will not
require the allocation of a new UDI-DI.
It should be noted that a new regulatory decision classifying an existing product as CMR/Endocrine
disruptor might not result in a new UDI-DI for products already containing that substance. The decision on
whether to assign a new UDI-DI should be based on the conformity assessment of the product with regard
to the impact of the information provided and the significance of the change.
2
Specific attention shall be paid to the fact that changes of colour or language might also require a new UDIDI when those changes might lead to misidentification of product or change the product
safety/performance. For example:
A- Change of colour coding of e.g. connectors, latex-free surgical gloves, blood tubes
B- Two identical self-testing devices, that exist in parallel and cannot be substituted due to local labelling
requirements (IVD Article 10(10) of Regulation 746/2017), requires different UDI-DIs
Specifications of EU designated issuing entity should be used as a reference source to identify other
possible examples.

3. Maximum number of Reuses
Annex VI Part B, 17 states that the manufacturer shall provide to the UDI database the
maximum number of reuses of the device concerned, if applicable.
‘If applicable’ should be understood to cover those devices where based on clinical
evidence and as a result of the risk management process, a manufacturer has
demonstrated a maximum number of reuses, which should not be surpassed. This may
include but is not limited to devices for which there is evidence of degradation or
deterioration beyond a certain number of re-uses.
Whilst the maximum number of re-uses depends on multiple factors such as the material,
the user and relevant process changes, examples of devices where this requirement
could apply include:
•
•
•
•

Minimally-invasive robotic instruments,
Larynx masks,
Surgical instruments : scalpels, curettes, clamps, drills, burs,
Endoscopic devices: biopsy forceps, polyp retrieval basket.

Without prejudice to ‘if applicable’, it is noted that the MDR generally does not require a
maximum number of re-uses for re-usable devices. 1
If a maximum number of re-uses is established and claimed by the manufacturer, this
number shall be provided to the UDI Database in EUDAMED and in addition, reflected in
the instructions for use in accordance with Annex I, GSPR 23.4 (n).
For such products whose maximum number of re-uses is determined, a change to this
data element will require the allocation of a new UDI-DI.
WARNING: This guidance does not address requirements for reprocessed devices,
systems or procedure packs, software, Annex XVI, nor for cases of parallel trade or
own brand labelling. Specific requirements for those products are addressed in specific
guidance.
