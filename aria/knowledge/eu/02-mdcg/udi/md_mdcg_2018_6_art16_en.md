Relevant obligations arising from Article 16(1)
Any distributor, importer or other natural or legal person that assumes the obligations
incumbent on manufacturers in accordance with Article 16(1), assumes all the
relevant responsibilities related to UDI, including UDI labelling.
This means that those economic operators must also apply for registration as
Manufacturers, receive a Single Registration Number (SRN), apply for the
appropriate conformity assessment procedure and feed and provide UDI-product
registration.
However, in accordance with the provision of Article 16(1)a, when a distributor or
importer enters into an agreement with a manufacturer whereby the manufacturer is
identified as such on the label, the manufacturer is responsible for meeting the
requirements placed on manufacturers in this Regulation, including the relevant UDI
obligations.

Relevant obligations arising from Article 16(2) to 16(4)
The distributor or importer carrying out the operations in Article 16(2) shall ensure
that:
- the activities mentioned in points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 are performed by
means and under conditions that in no way compromise the readability of the UDI
carrier and its information identifying the actual device.
- the specific procedures are part of the distributor's or importer’s quality
management system.
