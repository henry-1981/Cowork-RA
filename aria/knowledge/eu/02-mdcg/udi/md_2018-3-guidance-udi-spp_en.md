Section 3.2

Introduction of Example 2, new

1. Scope
This guidance should be read in conjunction with the Guidance on "Basic UDI-DI and
changes to UDI-DI"1 and the Guidance on "UDI database. Definitions, descriptions
and formats of the UDI core elements"2. The guidance is not intended to be
exhaustive in relation to all UDI obligations associated with systems and procedure
packs. The scope of this guidance is therefore limited to the aspects specifically
addressed below. For UDI-related aspects that are not specifically mentioned in this
guidance, the reader should make reference to the relevant provisions of Medical
Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR).

2. Definitions
In accordance with Article 2 of the MDR,
‘procedure pack’ means a combination of products packaged together and placed on
the market with the purpose of being used for a specific medical purpose;
‘system’ means a combination of products, either packaged together or not, which
are intended to be inter- connected or combined to achieve a specific medical
purpose;
“Specific medical purposes” are defined in Article 2(1) of the MDR.
Examples of procedure packs are first aid kits, orthodontic procedure packs and skin
traction kits.
Examples of systems are x-ray systems.

Article 22 of the Medical Device Regulation lays down certain obligations for natural
or legal persons, that combine medical devices bearing a CE marking alone or
together with other products which are not devices and are compliant with the
respective legislation which apply to them, in order to place that combination on the
market as either a system or a procedure pack. That combination is intended to
achieve a specific medical purpose.
For the purpose of this guidance and operations related to EUDAMED, the natural or
legal person referred to in Article 22(1), 22(2) and 22(3) of the Medical Device
Regulation shall be called the "system or procedure pack producer".

3.2 Exemption with regard to "system or procedure pack producer"
Based on a request of a client or hospital, a natural or legal person in the supply
chain may make available together different products, including CE marked devices,
which are – in that entire combination – neither placed on the market by that natural
or legal person, nor intended by that natural or legal person to be used together for a
specific medical purpose. Devices made available in the described manner are not
considered as systems or procedure packs in accordance with the relevant
definitions provided in Article 2 of the MDR. In this case, that natural or legal person
is not regarded to be a system or procedure pack producer in accordance with Article
22.1, and is considered to be a distributor as per Article 2(34) of the MDR. It is to be
noted that an importer may also make available devices to a client or hospital, in
such manner.
Example 1: a distributor supplies, upon request of a client, in one shipment, sterile
tweezers, a sterile needle and surgery gloves.
Example 2: Multi-device surgical sets comprised of individual devices delivered in
trays for replenishment and sterilization for the request and for convenience of the
healthcare provider and the healthcare system.
Under the conditions set in Article 22(4), systems and procedure packs are to be
treated as devices in their own right and the related natural or legal persons shall
assume the obligations incumbent on manufacturers. This specific scenario is out of
the scope of the present guidance. Manufacturers of such devices shall refer to
general guidance on UDI which is available on the DG GROW website 3.

4. Registration of systems and procedure packs
The system or procedure pack producer shall apply for registration as a system or
procedure pack producer and obtain an SRN.
Systems and procedure packs shall undergo a UDI registration, as described in
Article 29(2) of the MDR. Before placing on the market a system or procedure pack
pursuant to Article 22(1) and (3), that is not a custom-made device, the system or
procedure pack producer shall assign to the system or procedure pack, in
compliance with the rules of the issuing entity, a Basic UDI-DI and shall provide it to
the UDI database together with the other core data elements referred to in Part B of
Annex VI related to that system or procedure pack.
The UDI data elements applicable for systems and procedure packs are listed in the
Annex to this guidance.

5. Specific UDI rules for systems and procedure packs
The Basic UDI-DI shall identify systems or procedure packs having the same group
of components and the same intended purpose4, regardless of the original
components manufacturers.
System and procedure packs shall be assigned and bear their own UDI (including
both UDI-DI and UDI-PI), in accordance with Annex VI, Part C, points 3.7 and 6.3.1.
of the MDR

This is to prevent that two systems or procedure packs with the same intended purpose, but having one or
more components coming from different manufacturers, would need to be assigned two different Basic UDIDIs.
