Introduction and scope
The introduction of the Unique Device Identification (UDI) system referred to in Article 27 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)1 aims to ensure an adequate level of
identification and traceability with respect to medical devices. Basic UDI-DIs, UDI-DIs and UDIPIs shall be assigned (in compliance with the rules of the designated issuing entities) by
manufacturers to all devices, other than custom-made devices, prior to their placement on the
market.
To further strengthen and enhance traceability and recording of UDIs, manufacturers shall
register Basic UDI-DIs and UDI-DIs in the European database on medical devices (Eudamed)2.
For contact lenses, which are devices presenting a high level of individualisation (‘highly
individualised devices’), the assignment of a Master UDI-DI has been foreseen according to
Annex VI, Part C, Section 6.6.1 MDR, as amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2023/2197 on Master UDI-DI for contact lenses3, in turn amended by Commission Delegated
Regulation (EU) 2025/788 as regards the date of application4.
Even though all economic operators have to contribute to an appropriate level of traceability
according to Article 25 MDR, the main responsibility to apply the means to achieve proper
identification and traceability of the device lies with the manufacturer.
This document aims to provide guidance in the implementation of Master UDI-DI rules for
contact lenses as regards its structure, assignment, labelling and registration in Eudamed.
NOTE: this document is intended to be read in conjunction with Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on
medical devices (MDR), Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2197 as amended by
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/788, and other MDCG Guidance documents on
UDI5.

1. Terminology6
Standard contact lenses (covering both standard soft contact lenses and rigid gas permeable
(RGP) contact lenses): mass-produced contact lenses which are generally held in stock by the
manufacturer / distributor / eye care professional and have a limited range of parameters.
Example: standard soft daily disposable contact lenses.
Made to Order contact lenses (soft or rigid): lenses where (part of) the production process is
initiated based on a specific individual order. These typically have a wide range of parameters.
Example: lathe cut 3-monthly made-to order lens.
Contact Lens Design Parameters: the contact lens parameters that are used to identify the
clinical sizes towards the users, eye care professionals and other concerned stakeholders: e.g.
Base Curve, Diameter, Add Power, Axis…
Basic UDI-DI: the primary identifier of a device model, which means the identifier to connect
devices with the same intended purpose, risk class and essential design and manufacturing
characteristics. For contact lenses the parameters to trigger the assignment of Basic UDI-DI
may include for example the material, filters and tint, lens type (spheric/toric/multifocal etc.). It
is the main key for records in the UDI database in Eudamed and is referenced in relevant
certificates and EU declarations of conformity. Rules for Basic UDI-DI do not change for
contact lenses.
Master UDI-DI: the unique identifier used for grouping certain highly individualised devices.
Such highly individualised devices present specific similarities with respect to pre-defined
clinically relevant parameters (e.g. a single Master UDI-DI should be assigned to contact
lenses that have the same combination of contact lens design parameters, including at least
base curve and diameter). The Master UDI-DI is the access key to device information related
to a group of devices with the same intended purpose and the same principal design, stored
in Eudamed. Master UDI-DI assignment should follow the rules of EU designated issuing
entities. The Master UDI-DI shall be associated to a Basic UDI-DI, which shall be assigned per
the MDR and MDCG 2018-1.
UDI-PI: according to Annex VI, Part C, Section 1 MDR, the different types of UDI-PIs include
serial number, lot number, software identification and manufacturing or expiry date or both
types of date. The UDI-PI types also apply to contact lenses. The UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDIPI) intends to enable the automatic identification of the individual device to conform with the
UDI requirements in the MDR.

6 For UDI-related definitions and other terminology, see Part C of Annex VI to the MDR.

2. The Master UDI-DI
The hierarchy of assignment of Basic UDI-DI (BUDI) and Master UDI-DI (MUDI) differs from
the assignment of UDI-DI. In figure 1 below, each and every sub-box would be assigned a
UDI-DI, yielding a huge number of UDI-DIs which is not practicable and would introduce
unnecessary complexity with no added value for authorities and economic actors. The
assignment of Master UDI-DI on grouped level, corresponding to the second row from the top
in figure 1, will be more appropriate.

2.1 Master UDI-DI assignment
2.1.1 Standard contact lenses
The Master UDI-DI for standard contact lenses will be assigned to a given combination of
contact lens design parameters as defined by the manufacturer, including at least the ‘Base
Curve’ (BC) and ‘Diameter’, and completed with other relevant parameters as indicated on the
labelling for the end-user, the eye care professional etc.
When a lens is available in one material, in spheric, toric and multifocal design variants, it
would be covered by three Basic UDI-DI (one material + design type) and around 9 Master
UDI-DIs, corresponding to each variant.
See some examples below:
Basic UDI-DI 1: material XY + Spheric design
•
•
•
•
•

Master UDI-DI 1-1: Spheric Design
Master UDI-DI 1-2: Spheric Design
Master UDI-DI 1-3: Spheric Design
Master UDI-DI 1-4: Spheric Design
etc.

Base Curve value x, Diameter value a
Base Curve value y, Diameter value b
Base Curve value x, Diameter value b
Base Curve value z, Diameter value c

Basic UDI-DI 2: material XY + Toric design
•

Master UDI-DI 3-1: Multifocal design
Master UDI-DI 3-2: Multifocal design
Master UDI-DI 3-3: Multifocal design
Master UDI-DI 3-4: Multifocal design
etc.

Base Curve value x, Diameter value a
Base Curve value y, Diameter value b
Base Curve value x, Diameter value b
Base Curve value z, Diameter value c

Note: the above examples are for explicatory purposes only.

UDI-PI
No specific production identifiers (PIs) are required to be assigned to standard contact lenses,
the provisions of Annex VI Part C as regards the PIs apply.

Labelling
The rules on UDI carrier in section 4 of Part C of Annex VI to the MDR apply to the Master
UDI-DI.

In figure 2 below, an example of labelling. This is for illustrative purposes only to reflect how
the Master UDI-DI identifier could appear and does not reflect a requirement to align exactly
as shown nor a fully compliant label. The example reflects the Automatic Identification Data
Capture (AIDC) and Human Readable Interpretation (HRI) carriers, which may be combined
with other information and barcoding to meet requirements set out in the MDR, in particular,
when it comes to the automated identification of the individual device. Format and HRI may
vary based on the designated issuing entities. The below label is based on the GS1 issuing
entity8 Master UDI-DI standard.

Figure 2: Example labelling for Master UDI-DI identifier

The placement of UDI carrier (including Master UDI-DI) on contact lens packaging is
dependent on provisions and requirements in the MDR, specifically space constraints and
sales unit requirements in Annex VI Part C 4.2 and 4.3. Requirements on labelling of contact
lens blisters are dependent on space constraints and what is considered the lowest level of
packaging that is used by the final user as per the MDR requirements. If contact lens blisters
are considered the lowest level of packaging that is used by the final user per the MDR, the
Master UDI-DI may be labelled once for a contact lens strip of e.g. 5 units, provided that the
manufacturer has carried out the relevant risk management.

2.1.2 Made to order (MtO) contact lenses
The Master UDI-DI will be assigned to made to order (MtO) contact lenses based on a
combination of contact lens design parameters as defined by the manufacturer and combined
with other relevant parameters. The assignment of Master UDI-DI does not need to include the
actual values of parameters.

Example
The contact lens design will be defined by the combination of design parameters, with the
parameters including at least base curve and diameter. Examples of combination of design
parameters include:

Spherical Design = Base Curve + Diameter + Power
Toric Design = Base Curve + Diameter + Power + Cylinder + Axis
Multifocal Design = Base Curve + Diameter + Power + Add Power
Master UDI-DI 1 = Material A, Spherical Design
Master UDI-DI 2 = Material A, Toric Design
Master UDI-DI 3 = Material A, Multifocal Design
Master UDI-DI 4 = Material B, Spherical Design
Master UDI-DI 5 = Material B, Toric Design
Master UDI-DI 6 = Material B, Multifocal Design

Note: the above examples are for explicatory purposes only.

UDI-PI
A unique lot / serial number should be used as UDI-PI for made to order contact lenses.

Labelling
The rules on UDI carrier in section 4 of Part C of Annex VI MDR apply to the Master UDI-DI.
In figures 3 and 4 below, some labelling examples for MtO contact lenses. These are for
illustrative purposes only to reflect how the Master UDI-DI identifier could appear and do not
reflect a requirement to align exactly as shown nor a fully compliant label. The examples reflect
the AIDC and HRI carriers, which may be combined with other information and barcoding to
meet requirements set out in the MDR. Format and HRI may vary based on the designated
issuing entities. The labels are based on the GS1 and HIBCC issuing entities9 Master UDI-DI
standards.

3. Master UDI-DI assignment on container package, packaging
levels and packaging variants
The Master UDI-DI may be associated to a grouping regardless of pack size that have the
same combination of contact lens design parameters, which would include identification of all
units of use, pack sizes and higher levels of packaging in that grouping. Pack size does not in
itself impact key design parameters. Per Regulation (EU) 2017/745 Annex VI Part C, higher
levels of packaging shall have their own UDI-DI. As the Master UDI-DI replaces the UDI-DI for
contact lenses, higher levels of packaging shall have their own Master UDI-DI, if applicable.
Quantity is a trade item level attribute, and many would fall under the same combination of
contact lens design parameters.
If within the same package there are contact lenses with different Master UDI-DIs, then the
package should be considered as a transport container that should not have an assigned
Master UDI-UDI.

4. Vigilance reporting
4.1 Vigilance reporting for Regulation contact lenses
In case of vigilance reporting on contact lenses fully compliant with the MDR, the manufacturer
should provide the full UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI) for example in the Manufacturer Incident
Report (MIR) form (both when using of a PDF MIR10 and the Eudamed Vigilance and PostMarket Surveillance module).
The provisions of Annex VI Part C MDR for the assignment of PIs apply also to contact lenses,
no specific production identifiers (PIs) are required (except unique lot / serial number for MtO
contact lenses). The design of the UDI carrier has to ensure the automated identification of the
individual device (or the individual lot/batch of devices). Since one Master UDI-DI
encompasses a range of devices, it is important that the manufacturer should provide the full
UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI) it has assigned to the specific contact lense(s) involved in the
incident. The UDI shall enable the retrieval of relevant data for traceability of the devices in the
quality management system (QMS) of the manufacturer.
Note: due to the timeline for the application of the Master UDI-DI assignment obligation, there
is a possibility that contact lenses may not yet be registered in the UDI/Devices Registration
module of Eudamed when it becomes mandatory. Manufacturers should engage with an
issuing entity as soon as possible, and at least before the Vigilance and Post-Market
Surveillance module of Eudamed becomes mandatory11, in order to be able to assign Master
UDI-DIs in due time and to handle the reporting of vigilance cases in Eudamed.

4.2 Vigilance reporting for legacy contact lenses
The same principles as for other legacy devices apply. For information on legacy device
registration in connection with vigilance reporting in Eudamed, please refer to the Q&A
document for the transitional provisions and gradual roll-out of Eudamed12, in particular Q8
and Q14.
For legacy devices that are contact lenses, the devices may be identified by Eudamed ID or
UDI-DI (for instance, GTIN13) in combination with the UDI-PI for the purpose of vigilance
reporting in Eudamed.

5. Timeline for the application of the Master UDI-DI
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2197 on Master UDI-DI for contact lenses was
published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) on 20 October 2023 and
entered into force on 9 November 2023. It was amended by Commission Delegated Regulation
(EU) 2025/788 as regards the date of application and accordingly it applies from 9 November
2026, so it provides for a three-year transition period as from its entry into force before the
assignment of Master UDI-DI to contact lenses becomes mandatory. It also provides for the
possibility for manufacturers to comply in advance, by assigning Master UDI-DIs before the
mandatory application, pending the technical solution is available from the EU issuing entities.
Until the assignment of Master UDI-DI becomes mandatory, contact lenses can be placed on
the market without it being assigned. However, nothing prevents the manufacturers from
assigning other types of identifiers (such as GTIN or other standards) for different identification
purposes or assigning a Master UDI-DI on a voluntary basis.
The obligations on UDI carriers for Master UDI-DI for contact lenses are applicable as from the
date when Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2197 as amended by Delegated Regulation
2025/788 becomes applicable. The obligation to register contact lenses in Eudamed should
be applicable as from when the transition period for the mandatory use of the UDI/Device
Registration module expires. Legacy contact lenses can be registered in Eudamed for the
purpose of serious incident reporting without a Master UDI-DI or other identifier assigned, using
the equivalent Eudamed ID and Eudamed DI.
The “MDCG 2025-7 Position Paper: Timelines of the implementation of ‘Master UDI-DI’ to
contact lenses and spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready to wear reading spectacles”14
provides timeline clarification for highly individualised device (HID) manufacturers on Master
UDI-DI assignment and device labelling requirement in regard to the Class I device
requirements laid down in Article 123(f) MDR. Eudamed device registration for HID is also
clarified against the Eudamed gradual roll-out timeline applicable to all medical devices other
than HID.
All this information is available on the section “Master UDI-DI for highly individualised devices”
of the Commission webpage “Public Health > Medical Devices - Topics of Interest > Unique
Device Identifier - UDI”15.

6. Device registration in Eudamed
For contact lenses, the Master UDI-DI will be registered and used in Eudamed in lieu of the
UDI-DI when special device type ‘Standard soft contact lenses’ or ‘Rigid gas permeable (RGP)
contact lenses’ or ‘Made to order (MtO) soft contact lenses’ or ‘Made to order (MtO) rigid gas
permeable contact lenses’ is selected. Sizes will be registered in ranges.
Legacy contact lenses should not be registered in Eudamed unless a vigilance action is
required.
More information is available in the Eudamed information centre16 and in the user guide17 of
the UDI/Devices Registration module of Eudamed18.
