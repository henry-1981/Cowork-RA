Introduction and scope

The introduction of the Unique Device Identification (UDI) system referred to in Article 27 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)1 aims to ensure an adequate level of
identification and traceability with respect to medical devices. Basic UDI-DIs, UDI-DIs and UDIPIs shall be assigned (in compliance with the rules of the designated issuing entities) by
manufacturers to all devices, other than custom-made devices, prior to their placement on the
market.
To further strengthen and enhance traceability and recording of UDIs, manufacturers shall
register Basic UDI-DIs and UDI-DIs in the European Database on Medical Devices
(Eudamed)2.
For certain groups of devices that are presenting a high level of individualisation (‘highly
individualised devices’, HID), Annex VI, Part C MDR has been amended with provisions on
assignment of Master UDI-DI to HIDs. Provisions for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and
ready-to-wear reading spectacles have been introduced in Section 6.6.2 by Commission
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920 on Master UDI-DI for spectacle frames, spectacle
lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles3.
Master UDI-DI is intended as the identifier of a group of HID (i.e. contact lenses, spectacle
frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles) presenting specific similarities
with respect to defined design (clinically and non-clinically) relevant parameters.
Even though all economic operators have to contribute according to Article 25 MDR, it is the
sole responsibility of the manufacturer to comply with the UDI requirements in order to ensure
an appropriate level of traceability of the device, according to Article 10(7) MDR.
This document aims to provide guidance in the implementation of Master UDI-DI rules for
spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles as regards its
structure, assignment, labelling and registration in Eudamed.
NOTES: This document is intended to be read in conjunction with Regulation (EU) 2017/745
on medical devices (MDR), Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920, MDCG 20257 position paper4 and MDCG guidance documents on UDI5.
Information on Master UDI-DI for highly individualised devices has been collected in a specific
section of the Commission webpage on Unique Device Identifier - UDI6.

Terminology7

Spectacle frame: Highly individualised device intended to hold spectacle lenses in front of the
patient's eyes. As an adaptable highly individualised medical device (see MDCG 2021-38, page
3), it is fitted and adjusted at the point of care according to the manufacturer's instructions.
These necessary steps are traditionally carried out by an eye care professional (e.g. optician
or an optometrist) to adapt to the specific anatomical features of an individual patient prior to
use. The frame may be part of a combination with other highly individualised medical devices
(e.g. lenses) that are assembled and shaped to form a spectacle.
Spectacle lens: Highly individualised device with an intended purpose to correct vision
impairment such as eye refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism and presbyopia).
Spectacle lenses are supplied following a prescription from an eye care professional (e.g.
ophthalmologist). The spectacle lenses may be assembled and shaped to be part of a
combination with another highly individualised medical device (e.g. spectacle frame) to form a
spectacle.
Ready-to-wear reading spectacle: Highly individualised device intended to correct vision
impairment for near vision activities and reading. The device is ready to use and is a premounted non-prescription reading spectacle. This device is composed of two identical singlevision spectacle lenses with limited spherical power range assembled and shaped into a
spectacle frame.
Full-rim spectacle frame: A type of spectacle in which the frame front completely surrounds
the lenses with a frame material, either metal, plastic or others or a combination of it.

Figure 1: Example of full-rim spectacle frame (plastic)

Half-rim spectacle frame (also known as a semi-rimless spectacle frame): A spectacle frame
design where only part of the lenses is enclosed by the frame, while the other part is left open
or supported by a thin wire usually made of nylon material.

Figure 2: Example of half-rim spectacle frame (metal)

Rimless spectacle frame: A type of spectacle frame where the lenses are mounted directly
to the bridge and temples without a surrounding frame usually by means of screws.

7 For UDI-related definitions and other terminology, see Part C of Annex VI to the MDR and international

recognized standard for spectacle frame.

Basic UDI-DI: Primary identifier of device sharing the same intended purpose, risk class and
same essential design characteristics. It is the main key for records in the UDI database and
is referenced in the EU declaration of conformity. It is not to be reflected on device label.
Master UDI-DI: Unique identifier used for grouping certain devices presenting a high level of
individualisation (‘highly individualised devices’, HID) as for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses
and ready-to-wear reading spectacles as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU)
2025/1920. It is acting as UDI-DI as defined in Part C of Annex VI to the MDR. Such HID share
the same combination of design parameters (clinical and non-clinical). It is the access key to
the device dataset registered in Eudamed. Master UDI-DI assignment for manufacturer should
follow the rules defined in the following documents and reflected in this guidance document:
• Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR)
• Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920
• EU designated issuing entities standard.
UDI-PI: according to MDR Annex VI, Part C, Section 1, the different types of UDI-PIs include
lot number and/or manufacturing date among others. The UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI)
intends to enable the automatic identification of the individual device to conform with the MDR
UDI requirements.

Basic UDI-DI and Master UDI-DI

Assignment rules of UDI-DI per the MDR is defined in its Annex VI, Part C, Section 3.9.
However, the assignment rules of Master UDI-DI differ from the assignment rules of UDI-DI. It
also affects the triggers which requires the assignment of a new UDI-DI per MDR.
Master UDI-DI is acting as UDI-DI and should be assigned to devices sharing the same
essential design characteristics, the same intended purpose and the same combination of
design parameters.
The table below compares different device identifiers given by the assignment of Master UDIDI for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles.

Basic UDI-DI assignment scheme for spectacle lenses reflecting parameters and values
(assignment triggers):

Master UDI-DI
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920: “A UDI-DI shall be assigned to spectacle
lenses that have the same combination of design parameters, including at least groups of
mean spheres (spherical equivalent power), groups of addition power and groups of similar
vision impairments (‘Master UDI-DI’).
Master UDI-DI design parameters for assignment are based on intended purpose of a
spectacle lens to correct vision impairments, defined by its nominal prescription (spherical
power, cylinder if applicable and addition if applicable) expressed in groups of spherical
equivalent power values range and 3 groups of addition values range.

14 Commercial indexes are seen with precision of 2 digits after comma (e.g. 1.52).
15 Refractive index expressed in e ray (ne) according to applicable standards.

MDCG 2025-8

Master UDI-DI assignment rules
For spectacle lenses of a nominal prescription to be manufactured, spherical equivalent power
(mean sphere) is thus expressed by the formula:
M = Spherical power in dioptres + (cylinder in dioptres/2)
This formula can be applied whatever a nominal cylinder is prescribed or not for a patient.
Spherical equivalent power calculation examples:
•

Example n° 1: Prescribed spectacle lens of +2.00 D (cylinder = 0.00 D)
M = +2.00 D + (0/2) = +2.00 D

•

Example n° 2: Prescribed spectacle lens of +1.00 D (+2.00D) equivalent to
+3.00 D (-2.00 D)
M = +1.00 D + (+2.00 D/2) or +3.00D + (-2.00 D/2) = +2,00 D

•

Example n° 3: Prescribed spectacle lens of -2,00 D (+4,00) equivalent to
+2,00 D (-4,00)
M = -2.00 D + (+4.00 D/2) or +2.00 D + (-4.00 D/2) = 0.00 D

The result of spherical equivalent power allows to position the spectacle lens in a typical
spectacle lens spherical equivalent power values range intended to correct specific vision
impairment group categories that are specified as follows:
• Spherical equivalent power values range < 0.00 D without prescribed cylinder are
spherical or aspherical spectacle lens in concave minus range and are usually prescribed
to correct vision impairment myopia.
• Spherical equivalent power values range < 0.00 D with prescribed cylinder are toric
spectacle lens still in concave minus range but are usually prescribed to correct vision
impairment myopia + astigmatism.
• Spherical equivalent power value = 0.00 D without prescribed cylinder are spherical
or aspherical spectacle lens in afocal range and are usually prescribed when one patient’s
eye does not need correction seen as emmetropia, but the other patient eye does.
• Spherical equivalent power value = 0.00 D with prescribed cylinder are toric spectacle
lens still in afocal range and are usually prescribed when one patient’s eye does need a
correction for vision impairment emmetropia + astigmatism.
• Spherical equivalent power values range > 0.00D without prescribed cylinder are
spherical or aspherical spectacle lens in convex positive range and are usually prescribed
to correct vision impairment hyperopia.
• Spherical equivalent power values range > 0.00D with prescribed cylinder are toric
spectacle lens still in convex positive range and are usually prescribed to correct vision
impairment hyperopia + astigmatism.
Another spectacle lens design parameter to consider, if applicable, is addition in dioptres that
can be prescribed to complement one of the 6 vision impairment group categories mentioned
previously. This spectacle lens is either power variation or multifocal lens usually to correct
additional vision impairment presbyopia. This parameter for Master UDI-DI assignment is split
Page 14 of 43

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2025-8

in 3 groups of addition values range, Mild/Low, Moderate, Advanced/High specified as
follows:
• Mild/Low presbyopia with a typical nominal prescribed addition value in range (assignment
trigger) between > 0.00 D and < 1.25 D
• Moderate presbyopia with a typical nominal prescribed addition value in range (assignment
trigger) between ≥ 1.25 D and < 2.00 D
• Advanced/High presbyopia with a typical nominal prescribed addition value in range
(assignment trigger) ≥ 2.00 D
For one combination of Basic UDI-DI parameters values (assignment triggers) and taking into
account the spectacle lens prescription, the manufacturer will assign a Master UDI-DI to the
spectacle lens based on its intended purpose link to vision impairments. Its intended purpose
start with its initial nominal prescription (spherical power, cylinder) expressed in a spherical
equivalent power range (assignment trigger) and in group of additions values range if
applicable (assignment trigger).

Basic UDI-DI assignment scheme reflecting parameters and values (assignment triggers):

Master UDI-DI
Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920: “A UDI-DI shall be assigned to ready-towear reading spectacles that have the same combination of design parameters, including at
least the horizontal boxed lens size and lens spherical power (‘Master UDI-DI’)”.
Master UDI-DI assignment for ready-to-wear reading spectacles is a combination of 3 Basic
UDI-DI parameters and 2 Master UDI-DI design parameters, each with their respective values.
Master UDI-DI design parameter:
•

Frame horizontal boxed lens size with discrete values in a typical range between 40
mm and 60 mm (assignment triggers)

•

Labelling for ready-to-wear reading spectacles
The rules on UDI carrier in section 4 of Part C of Annex VI to the MDR and relevant issuing

The label layout shown below is for illustrative purposes only, to show how the UDI (Master

Master UDI-DI assignment on container package, packaging
levels and packaging variants

According to Part C of Annex VI to the MDR, higher levels of packaging must have their own
UDI-DI. As the Master UDI-DI replaces the UDI-DI for spectacle frames, spectacle lens and
ready-to-wear reading spectacles, higher levels of packaging must have their own Master UDIDI, if applicable.
Spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles: Typically 1
sale/trade unit corresponds to 1 spectacle frame or 1 spectacle lens or 1 ready-to-wear reading
spectacle. Hence, higher levels of packaging than device packaging (cartons) are typically
containing frames or lenses or ready-to-wear reading spectacles where multiple Master UDIDIs have been assigned to the devices. Consequently, higher levels of packaging are most
often to be considered as shipping containers for logistic purpose and should not have an
assigned Master UDI-DI reflecting its contents.
In the event of a secondary packaging containing multiple devices (sale/trade items) with same
assigned Master UDI-DI and corresponding to 1 sales unit, a Master UDI-DI may have to be
assigned to the higher level of packaging other than device package to reflect its content.

5.

Vigilance reporting for spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and
ready-to-wear reading spectacles

For spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles as highly
individualised devices, in case of vigilance reporting following a serious incident, the
manufacturer should provide the UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI) of devices involved through
the Manufacturer Incident Report (MIR) form (both when using a PDF MIR16 and the Eudamed
Vigilance and Post-Market Surveillance module).
Since one Master UDI-DI encompasses a range of devices (group of devices) that can have
multiple references, catalogue numbers and multiple PI’s values, it is important that the
manufacturer provide devices UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI) but also segregate more
precisely, through its internal QMS/product traceability/product internal codification, devices
involved in the serious incident reflected by at least one UDI (Master UDI-DI + UDI-PI)
assignment.
Note: due to the timeline for the application of the Master UDI-DI assignment obligation, there
is a possibility that spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles
may not yet be registered in the UDI/Devices Eudamed module when it becomes mandatory.
When issuing entities Master UDI-DI codification standard will be fully available, manufacturers
should engage with an issuing entity as soon as possible, and at least before the Vigilance
and Post-Market Surveillance module of Eudamed becomes mandatory, in order to be able to
assign Master UDI-DIs in due time and to handle the reporting of vigilance cases in Eudamed.

Timeline for the assignment, application and Eudamed
registration of device’s Master UDI-DIs

Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/1920 on Master UDI-DI for spectacle frames,
spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear reading spectacles was published in the Official Journal
of the European Union (OJEU) on 23/09/2025 and entered into force on 13/10/2025. It applies
from 01/11/2028, providing three-years transitional period as from its entry into force before
the assignment of Master UDI-DI to spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready-to-wear
reading spectacles labelling becomes mandatory.
The “MDCG 2025-7 Position Paper: Timelines of the implementation of ‘Master UDI-DI’ to
contact lenses and spectacle frames, spectacle lenses and ready to wear reading spectacles”17
provides timeline clarification for highly individualised device (HID) manufacturers on Master
UDI-DI assignment and device labelling requirement in regard to the Class I device
requirements laid down in Article 123(f) MDR. Eudamed device registration for HID is also
clarified against the Eudamed gradual roll-out timeline applicable to all medical devices other
than HID.
Spectacle frames, spectacle lens, ready to wear reading spectacles produced prior to 1st of
November 2028 are not required to have a Master UDI-DI on the label.
All this information is available on the section “Master UDI-DI for highly individualised devices”
of the Commission webpage “Public Health > Medical Devices - Topics of Interest > Unique
Device Identifier - UDI”18.More information is available in the Eudamed information centre19
and in the user guide20 of the UDI/Devices Registration module of Eudamed21.
