1 Scope and target audience
Medical devices can be manufactured and used within EU health institutions (in-house
devices), on a non-industrial scale, to address the specific needs of target patient groups
which cannot be met, or cannot be met at the appropriate level of performance, by an
equivalent CE-marked device available on the market. In-house medical devices are
exempted from most of the provisions of Regulations (EU) 2017/745 (medical devices
Regulation, MDR) and (EU) 2017/746 (in vitro diagnostic medical devices Regulation, IVDR),
provided the health institution adheres to the conditions laid out in Article 5(5) of the relevant
Regulation. In order to ensure the highest level of health protection, Article 5(5) sets a
number of rules regarding the manufacture and use of such in-house medical devices.
The provisions in Article 5(5) are the basis for the regulatory control and oversight of inhouse devices. This document provides guidance on the application of some of these rules.
It is written for healthcare professionals and researchers of health institutions aiming to
design, manufacture, modify and use in-house devices. In addition, this guidance document
intends to foster harmonised application of Article 5(5) by the national competent authorities.
Both Regulations also state that any natural or legal person offering diagnostic or therapeutic
services through distance sales to patients in the Union must use devices that comply with
the MDR or IVDR (Article 6(2)). Of importance here is that the exemption provision from
Article 5(5) is only applicable to health institutions within the Union.
While most recommendations in this document pertain to both medical devices and in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (IVDs), some are specific to IVDs; such cases are explicitly
mentioned.
Regulation (EU) 2022/112 deferred the application of some, but not all, provisions for inhouse IVDs. A schematic overview of the timing of the applicability of IVDR Article 5(5)
provisions can be found in Annex B of this guidance. Note that the corresponding Article 5(5)
of the MDR has already been fully applicable since 26 May 2021.

2 Clarification of commonly used terms in this guidance
document
 General safety and performance requirements: the relevant general safety and
performance requirements of either the MDR or the IVDR are applicable to in-house
devices and are laid down in Annex I of each Regulation.
 Health institution: an organisation the primary purpose of which is the care or treatment
of patients or the promotion of public health (definitions 29 and 36 of the IVDR and MDR,
respectively). According to recitals 29 and 30 of the IVDR and MDR, health institutions
include hospitals as well as institutions, such as laboratories and public health institutes
that support the health care system and/or address patient needs, but which do not treat
or care for patients directly. The concept of health institution does not cover
establishments primarily claiming to pursue health interests or healthy lifestyles, such as
Page 3 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

gyms, spas, wellness and fitness centres. The recognition as a health institution can also
depend on national legislation and could thus differ between Member States.
 In-house device: a device that is manufactured and used only within a health institution
established in the Union and that meets all conditions set in Article 5(5) of the MDR or
IVDR.
 IVDR: Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April
2017 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and
Commission Decision 2010/227/EU.
 MDR: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April
2017 on medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002
and Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and
93/42/EEC.

3 Guidance on terms used in Article 5(5) of the MDR and the
IVDR
With the exception of the relevant general safety and performance requirements set out in
Annex I, the requirements of the MDR and IVDR shall not apply to devices manufactured
and used only within health institutions established in the Union, provided that specific
conditions are met.

3.1 Which devices are referred to in Article 5(5)?
3.1.1 MDR
According to Article 1(4) of the MDR, the term ‘devices’ means (1) medical devices, (2)
accessories for medical devices and (3) products listed in Annex XVI.
(1) ‘medical device’ is defined in Article 2(1) of the MDR.
(2) ‘accessory for a medical device’ is defined in Article 2(2) of the MDR.
(3) ‘products listed in Annex XVI’ refers to the groups of products without an intended
medical purpose that are listed in Annex XVI of the MDR. Applicability of the MDR to
these products, and therefore application of Article 5(5), will be effective from the date
of application of common specifications for these products.
Note:
Custom-made devices are out of scope of Article 5(5) and should follow the relevant
requirements of the MDR.

Page 4 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

3.1.2 IVDR
According to Article 1(2) of the IVDR: the term ‘devices’ means (1) IVDs and (2) accessories
for IVDs.
(1) ‘IVD’ is defined in Article 2(2) of the IVDR.
(2) ‘accessory for an IVD’ is defined in Article 2(4) of the IVDR.

3.1.3 General
Whenever the term ‘device’ is used in this guidance document, it refers to the definitions in
Article 1(4) and Article 1(2) of the MDR and IVDR, respectively.
Note:
 A protocol, in the form of a written procedure (in paper or digital format, e.g. describing
the manufacture or use of an in-house device), that is shared between health
institutions is not considered as a device according to the definitions above.
Consequently, the MDR and IVDR do not apply to such protocols.
 Patient specimens are not considered as devices according to the definitions above.
Consequently, the MDR and IVDR do not apply to these and patient specimens can be
shared between health institutions.
 While delivery of the results (reading the results from the in-house device) should occur
in the health institution that manufactured the in-house device, this should not preclude
the sharing of results between health institutions or with the patient.
 Any product or a combination of products that meets the definition of ‘device’ must
comply with the MDR or IVDR; i.e. either be CE marked, or be manufactured in-house
by a health institution and thus comply with Article 5(5), or be an investigational device
(MDR) or a device for performance study (IVDR), or be a custom-made device (MDR),
or be exceptionally allowed a derogation from CE marking by a competent authority.
 According to the second paragraph of Article 5(5), member states retain the right to
restrict the manufacture and the use of any specific type of in-house devices. Health
institutions are advised to consult national legislation or may contact their competent
authority for possible restrictions in their country.

3.2 How to understand the terms ‘manufactured and used’?
A device must be manufactured and used only within the same health institution in order for
Article 5(5) to apply.

3.2.1 How to understand the term ‘manufactured’?
Manufacturing a device by a health institution can include:
Page 5 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

 manufacturing a device from raw materials, from parts or components of a device or of
another type of product or from an existing device or another type of product,
 combining a device with another device or another type of product, where the
combination creates a new device,
 modifying an existing device in order to create a new device.

3.2.2 How to understand the term ‘used’?
Devices can only be defined as in-house devices when their manufacture and use is limited
to health institutions established in the Union. This use within health institutions can either be
physical or, for instance for medical device software, remote, provided they are not made
available to another legal entity (see section 3.4 in this guidance). The act of using an inhouse manufactured device is performed within the health institution when the device is used
in the care or diagnosis of a patient. If, during the lifecycle of the device, the device is used
outside the health institution’s legal entity, it cannot be in-house.
Notes:


The IVDR and MDR generally do not regulate the actual use of a device by a
healthcare professional. Nevertheless, the use of CE marked devices by healthcare
professionals outside the manufacturer’s intended purpose may be subject to national
provisions.
However, where a health institution (as opposed to an individual healthcare
professional) changes the intended purpose of a CE-marked device, in view of its use
in the health institution with that changed intended purpose, then Article 5(5) applies.



RUO (research use only) products are not regulated by the MDR and IVDR and are
not considered to be in-house devices when they are used for research purposes
only.
However, where a health institution (as opposed to an individual healthcare
professional) ascribes to a RUO product an intended purpose such that it would meet
the definition in Article 2(1) MDR or 2(2) IVDR in view of its use in the health
institution, then Article 5(5) applies. National legislation on quality of care may also
apply.
In‐house devices may include RUO products as components, provided that the
resulting in‐house device complies with the requirements of Article 5(5).

3.2.3 General
Examples of devices that would fall under the definition of an in-house device:

Page 6 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

 PCR master mix: a health institution orders primers based on scientific literature and
manufactures its own in-house master mix containing buffer, primers, dNTPs, cofactors
and enzymes to run PCRs on human DNA/RNA specimens.
 A health institution develops in-house a medical device software that is used on site by
healthcare professionals.

Examples of devices that do not fall under in-house devices:
 Medical device applications where patients can use the application outside the health
institution, e.g. by entering or accessing medical data that are subsequently used by
the healthcare professional.
 Orthopaedic braces that can be adapted (and thus ‘used’) by patients themselves
outside the health institution.
 Self-tests cannot fall under Article 5(5) if used outside the health institution’s legal
entity. However, an in-house manufactured self-test can be used within the health
institution by lay persons. Also, an in-house device can be used in the health
institution’s laboratory for the analysis of a specimen that is collected by patients
themselves and consecutively sent to the laboratory.
 Devices manufactured in-house purely for economic motives/financial interests, without
clinically relevant reasons.

3.3 Compliance with the relevant general safety and performance
requirements
Health institutions must ensure that their in-house manufactured devices are compliant with
the relevant general safety and performance requirements in Annex I of the MDR and
IVDR. Some important aspects of this are described below.
 Chapter I of Annex I describes the establishment of a risk management system and the
regular update of the benefit-risk ratio assessment. Note that device risks do not only
pertain to patient risks, but also to risks to the users, as well as to risks related to use
error.
 Chapter II of Annex I describes requirements regarding design, manufacture and
performance of devices and is therefore also particularly relevant to in-house devices.
Health institutions should carefully check what provisions apply to their in-house
devices as this information will also be paramount to establishing proof on nonequivalency of available CE marked devices (see section 3.6 in this guidance).
 Chapter III of Annex I defines requirements for the information that is supplied with the
device. While a number of the provisions in this chapter do not apply to in-house
devices, some are relevant to safely use the device in a way that allows it to achieve its
intended purpose, e.g.:
Page 7 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

- operating instructions/protocols,
- information on substances or mixtures which may be considered as being
dangerous,
- expiry or production dates of the manufactured devices or batches,
- storage and handling conditions,
- the lot/serial
purposes.

number or an equivalent means of identification for traceability

Note:
It is essential that health institutions properly document and regularly update the proof of
compliance of their in-house devices with Annex I as this documentation contains critical
information that will be used by competent authorities to assess compliance with Article 5(5).
Additionally, critical changes made to in-house devices should be evaluated and
documented.

3.4 Legal entity
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(a).
In-house devices shall not be transferred to another legal entity.
Healthcare systems are organised differently in different member states. Therefore, the
concept of legal entity can differ. The national competent authority may clarify how legal
entity is understood nationally.
Examples of legal entities:
 One hospital1 can be one legal entity when there is only one health institution (one
organiser) within the hospital.
 One hospital1 can accommodate several legal entities when there are different health
institutions (different organisers) within the same hospital. The different health
institutions can have different organisational numbers and different quality
management systems.
 Several hospitals1 can belong to the same legal entity when they are all part of one
health institution (one organiser). They share the same organisational number, quality
goals and quality management systems and the same healthcare strategy, even
though they might be spread over different locations.

3.5 What is an appropriate quality management system?
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(b).

1 The term ‘hospital’ can be exchanged for any of the examples provided in the definition of health institution as

described in section 2.

Page 8 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

The manufacture and use of in-house devices must occur under an appropriate quality
management system (QMS).

3.5.1 MDR
The QMS should be in compliance with Article 5(5), the relevant requirements of Annex I,
national legislation and applicable ISO-standard(s) if the health institution is
certified/accredited.
Article 10(9) of the MDR describes the minimal aspects that a QMS for manufacturing CEmarked medical devices should cover. This Article can be used as guidance (with some
MDR-specific exceptions) on what an appropriate QMS for manufacturing in-house devices
is. If applicable, ISO-standards concerning for instance manufacturing and risk management
can be used, especially if harmonized with the MDR.
Examples of areas covered by an appropriate QMS:
 Compliance to Article 5(5) and Annex I, MDR
Health institutions must determine how the requirements of Article 5(5) will be met.
A declaration must be drawn up and published (e.g. via the health institution’s web site,
see also section 3.8 of this guidance), confirming compliance with the general safety and
performance requirements of Annex I, Article 5(5) (e). To make this declaration, there is a
need to identify the applicable general safety and performance requirements and to
document compliance with these relevant requirements for the device in question (see
also section 3.3 of this guidance).
 Responsibility of the management
This includes resource management.
According to Article 5(5) (g), the health institution must take all necessary measures to
ensure that all devices are manufactured in accordance with the documentation referred
to in Article 5(5) (f).
 Risk management
Health institutions that manufacture in-house devices must establish, implement,
document and maintain a risk management system. Risk management must be
understood as a continuous iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle of a device,
requiring regular systematic updating, as per Point 3 Annex I.
 Identify, generate and appraise data
There is a need for supporting data and analysis of that data to justify that the target
patient group´s specific needs cannot be met or cannot be met at the appropriate level of
performance in another way than by manufacturing and using the health institution´s

Page 9 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

device. The experience gained from clinical use of the device should be used to review
the device performance, Article 5(5) (c), (f) and (h).
 Manufacturing
The health institution must draw up documentation that makes it possible to have an
understanding of the manufacturing facility, the manufacturing process, the design and
performance data of the devices, including intended purpose, Article 5(5) (f).
 Traceability
According to Article 5(5) (e) (ii), health institutions must make publicly available the details
necessary to identify the devices. Chapter III, Annex I describes labelling. The system of
identification of devices links to Article 5(5) (h), which states that health institutions shall
take all necessary corrective actions. So, the identification of the device can be a part of a
product tracking system to identify the affected products and involved patients.
 Monitoring, analysis and continuous improvement
The health institution must review experience gained from clinical use of the device and
take all necessary corrective actions, Article 5(5) (h).
 Communication with competent authorities
According to Article 5(5) (d), (f) and the second last subparagraph of 5(5), the health
institution must be prepared to provide detailed information to the competent authority.

3.5.2 IVDR
The laboratory of the health institution must be compliant with standard EN ISO 15189 or
where applicable national provisions, including national provisions regarding accreditation
and certification.
Article 10(8) of the IVDR describes the minimal aspects that a QMS for manufacturing CEmarked medical devices should cover. This Article can be used as guidance (with some
IVDR-specific exceptions) on what an appropriate QMS for manufacturing in-house devices
is. If applicable, ISO-standards concerning for instance manufacturing and risk management
can be used, especially if harmonised with IVDR.
Examples of areas covered by an appropriate QMS:
 Compliance to Article 5(5) and Annex I, IVDR
Health institutions must determine how the requirements of Article 5(5) will be met.
A declaration must be drawn up and published (e.g. via the health institution’s web site,
see also section 3.8 of this guidance), confirming compliance with the general safety and
performance requirements of Annex I, Article 5(5) (f). To make this declaration, there is a
need to identify the applicable general safety and performance requirements and to
Page 10 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

document compliance with these relevant requirements for the device in question (see
also section 3.3 of this guidance).
 Responsibility of the management
This includes resource management.
According to Article 5(5) (h), the health institution must take all necessary measures to
ensure that all devices are manufactured in accordance with the documentation referred
to in Article 5(5) (g).
 Risk management
Health institutions that manufacture in-house devices must establish, implement,
document and maintain a risk management system. Risk management must be
understood as a continuous iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle of a device,
requiring regular systematic updating, as per Point 3 Annex I.
 Identify, generate and appraise data
There is a need for supporting data and analysis of that data to justify that the target
patient group´s specific needs cannot be met or cannot be met at the appropriate level of
performance in another way than by manufacturing and using the health institution´s
device. The experience gained from clinical use of the device should be used to review
the device performance, Article 5(5) (d), (g*) and (i).
* applies only to class D devices unless regulated otherwise by national provisions.
 Manufacturing
The health institution must draw up documentation that makes it possible to have an
understanding of the manufacturing facility, the manufacturing process, the design and
performance data of the devices, including intended purpose, Article 5(5) (g*).
* applies only to class D devices unless regulated otherwise by national provisions.
 Traceability
According to Article 5(5) (f) (ii), health institutions must make publicly available the details
necessary to identify the devices. Chapter III, Annex I describes labelling. The system of
identification of devices links to Article 5(5) (i), which states that health institutions shall
take all necessary corrective actions. So, the identification of the device can be a part of a
product tracking system to identify the affected products and involved patients.
 Monitoring, analysis and continuous improvement
The health institution shall review experience gained from clinical use of the device and
take all necessary corrective actions, Article 5(5) (i).
 Communication with competent authorities

Page 11 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

According to Article 5(5) (e), (g*) and the second last subparagraph of 5(5), the health
institution must be prepared to provide detailed information to the competent authority.
* applies only to class D devices unless regulated otherwise by national provisions.
Note:
For in-house IVDs, the laboratory of the health institution should be in compliance with the
standard EN ISO 15189 or with national provisions, including national provisions regarding
accreditation. Compliance with the standard EN ISO 15189 may be understood as
accreditation to the standard or other means of compliance. However, as the manufacturing
process of a device and the compliance to the relevant requirements of Annex I is not in the
scope of this standard, compliance with EN ISO 15189 alone does not constitute an
appropriate QMS for the manufacture of in-house IVDs.

3.5.3 General
For both medical devices and IVDs, the QMS can cover the whole health institution or parts
of the health institution involved in the manufacturing, modification and use of the in-house
device. A QMS should include a process for obtaining information about equivalent CEmarked devices that become available on the market (see section 3.6 in this guidance).

3.6 Justification that the target patient group’s specific needs cannot be met,
or cannot be met at the appropriate level of performance, by an
equivalent device available on the market
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(d)/(c).
The health institution must justify in its documentation that the target patient group's
specific needs cannot be met, or cannot be met at the appropriate level of performance by an
equivalent device available on the market.

3.6.1 Target patient group’s specific needs
In this context, the target patient group should be understood as a group of patients who
have in common the same disease, condition or characteristics, and who could benefit from
using the device.
The specific needs should be understood as needs for:
 a specific device (as clarified in section 3.1 of this guidance) or;
 a specified level of performance of a device for certain performance characteristics.

Examples:
Page 12 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

 The health institution’s target population is paediatric while CE marked devices are only
targeted at the adult population and there are significant differences in the values
between adults and children (e.g. some hormone levels).
 Oestradiol can be measured in healthy females with commercial immunoassays,
however in breast cancer females on aromatase inhibitors, a more sensitive LCMS
method is needed.
 For a particular patient group, an in-house IVD usefully combines the analysis of 2 or
more CE marked IVDs, thereby avoiding excess, sometimes painful, patient specimen
taking.

3.6.2 Equivalent device in the context of the justification
3.6.2.1 MDR
Annex XIV.3 of the MDR describes device characteristics that should be taken into
consideration for the demonstration of (non-)equivalence. These characteristics are divided
into technical, biological and clinical aspects.
 Technical: the device is of similar design, is used under similar conditions, has similar
specifications and properties including physicochemical properties, uses similar
deployment methods, has similar principles of operation and critical performance
characteristics.
 Biological: the device uses the same materials or substances in contact with the same
human tissues or body fluids for a similar kind and duration of contact, has similar
release characteristics of substances, including degradation products and leachables.
 Clinical: the device is used for the same clinical condition or purpose, including similar
severity and stage of disease, at the same site in the body, in a similar population, has
the same kind of user, has a similar relevant critical performance in view of the
expected clinical effect for a specific intended purpose.

Note:
There is a different usage of the terms ‘similar’ and ‘same’ in the device characteristics
described above. The health institution should consult the ‘MDCG 2020-5 guidance on
Clinical Evaluation – Equivalence’ for further guidance on the subject. A justification of nonequivalence based on technical, biological or clinical aspects of the device should be
documented.

3.6.2.2 IVDR
The IVDR does not provide a description of equivalent devices. However, some of the
equivalence characteristics listed in the MDR are also applicable to IVDs (see above).
Justification that the patient group’s specific needs cannot be met, or cannot be met at the
Page 13 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

appropriate level of performance, by an equivalent device available on the market can be
based on technical, biological or clinical aspects e.g. different intended purpose, different
clinical conditions, different patient group, different conditions of use, different principles of
operation, different approved specimen materials, different critical performance
characteristics or different critical technical specifications.
A justification of non-equivalence based on technical, biological or clinical aspects of the
device should be documented.

3.6.3 Process for producing and reviewing the justification
Before manufacturing an in-house device for the first time, a health institution should
examine the market for the presence and availability of equivalent CE-marked devices. It is
appropriate to describe this process in the QMS for the in-house device. The European
database on medical devices, EUDAMED, could serve as one of the sources of information
for the identification of equivalent CE-marked alternatives (e.g. for higher risk class devices,
a summary of safety and (clinical) performance is publicly available in EUDAMED). Other
sources of information comprise information from manufacturers, distributors, scientific
conferences etc. On the basis of its findings, the health institution should justify why the
target patient group’s specific needs cannot be met, or cannot be met at the appropriate level
of performance, by an equivalent device available on the market. This justification should be
documented.
The health institution should continue gathering information about the availability on the
market and performance of potentially equivalent CE-marked devices in order to keep their
in-house device manufacturing up-to-date with market developments. The health institution
should review its justification on a regular basis, in view of its findings.
Once the in-house device is in use, a possible subsequent availability on the market of an
equivalent device does not invalidate the initial justification regarding the fulfilment of the
requirements set out in Article 5(5) at moment of the start of the in-house manufacturing.
However, in such a case the health institution should review and update its justification. If a
CE-marked device turns out to be at least equivalent to the in-house device and meets the
target patient group’s specific needs at the appropriate level of performance, a transition
process towards the usage of the CE marked device should start.

3.6.4 Availability on the market
Market in this context should be understood as the market of CE-marked devices in the
relevant member state. Availability means that the equivalent device is accessible to the
health institution according to EU, national and local rules and regulations. EUDAMED will be
one of the main sources of information regarding availability on the market.

MDCG 2023-1

3.7 What kind of information can be requested from health institutions by
competent authorities?
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(e)/(d).
The health institution must provide information upon request on the manufacture and use
of in-house devices to its competent authority, which must include a justification of their
manufacturing, modification and use.
Examples of what information can be requested:
 When an in-house device is put into service:
- device type,
- intended purpose,
- target patient group,
- data on the design, on safety and performance and on the expected benefit from the
device,
- a justification for the lack of equivalent CE-marked alternatives, or the lack of
equivalent CE-marked alternatives with an appropriate level of performance, that
meet the target patient group’s specific needs,
- description of the manufacturing process,
- description of modifications performed,
- information regarding use: procedures, use in combination with other devices (data
on compatibility) etc.
 After the device has been used routinely:
- all information as described above,
- number of units or batches manufactured in a certain period and a justification of the
production numbers,
- data regarding the performance of the device during routine use: performance
outcome, incidents or complaints, corrective actions undertaken.
Note:
Health Institutions should check whether national provisions exist on notifying the competent
authority when an in-house device is put into service, modified or its use discontinued.

3.8 Public declaration
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(f)/(e).

Page 15 of 20

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

The health institution must draw up a declaration which it must make publicly available,
including:
 the name and address of the manufacturing health institution,
 the details necessary to identify the devices (product name, product code or reference,
description or other unambiguous reference allowing the identification of the device,
intended use),
 a declaration that the devices meet the general safety and performance requirements
set out in Annex I of the IVDR or MDR and, where applicable, information on which
requirements are not fully met with a reasoned justification therefor.
Health institutions should consult possible national legislation, rules or guidance regarding
the exact declaration format, language requirements and the publication conditions that need
to be fulfilled (e.g. publication on the health institution’s website and/or on a dedicated
webpage from the competent authority). A proposed declaration format is provided in Annex
A of this guidance. Health institutions should regularly review their public declaration and
update it as necessary.

3.9 Documentation requirements
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(g)/(f).
For all medical devices and for class D IVDs (or any other IVD class if obliged by national
legislation), the health institution must draw up documentation that makes it possible to have
an understanding of the manufacturing facility, the manufacturing process, the design
and performance data of the devices, including the intended purpose, and that is
sufficiently detailed to enable the competent authority to ascertain that the general safety and
performance requirements set out in Annex I of the MDR and IVDR are met. Health
institutions should consult national provisions regarding possible documentation
requirements for class A, B and C IVDs.

The following aspects (non-exhaustive list of examples that might be applicable) should be
taken into account when drafting documentation for in-house devices.
 Manufacturing facility: description of the infrastructure, the services and the work
environment needed to safely manufacture the device in a way that the product fulfils
the requirements, listing of the equipment that is essential for production etc.
 Manufacturing process: explanation of the manufacturing processes, including a
description of the raw materials, control of suppliers, final product testing etc.
 Design: principles of operation of the device and its mode of action, technical
specifications including chemical, physical and biological properties, technology used,
software development, listing of applied standards, common specifications and

MDCG 2023-1

guidelines that are essential to meet the relevant general safety and performance
requirements etc.
 Performance data: according to Annex I of the IVDR/MDR, devices shall be designed
and manufactured in such a way that they are suitable with regard to the performance
they are intended to achieve, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the
art. A description of, where applicable, the analytical and the clinical performance
data supporting the intended purpose should be provided.
 Intended purpose of the device: specification of indications and contra-indications,
the patient target group or groups, information provided by the device, function of the
device (e.g. screening, monitoring, diagnosis, …), what type of specimen is used by an
IVD device etc.

All information should be presented in a clear, organised, readily searchable and unequivocal
way. Annex II of the MDR/IVDR can be used as guidance for documentation purposes. The
documentation must be kept up to date.

3.10 Vigilance, incidents and corrective actions
Reference to the IVDR/MDR: Article 5(5)(i)/(h).
The health institution must review experience gained from clinical use of the devices and
take all necessary corrective actions.
Health institutions should have a documented procedure in place to collect clinical and
performance data and to process incidents and corrective actions for in-house devices. They
should consult national legislation on possible requirements regarding reporting of incidents
and corrective actions.

3.11 Industrial scale
The last sentence of Article 5(5) of both Regulations states that the exemption provisions do
not apply to devices manufactured on an industrial scale. Furthermore, the recitals of the
Regulations state that healthcare institutions should be able to manufacture, modify and use
devices in-house and thus meet, on a non-industrial scale, the specific needs of a patient
group that cannot be met at an appropriate level of performance by an equivalent device
available on the market.
There is no definition of the term ‘industrial scale’ in the MDR or the IVDR. It should be
distinguished from the term ‘mass-produced’. The concept is a combination of many factors
to be considered on a case-by-case basis, including e.g. volume of production, commercial
aspects and manufacturing process.
The exemption provisions in Article 5(5) of the Regulations should only be applicable to
devices that are produced by the health institutions in order to meet the patient groups’
Page 17 of 20

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2023-1

specific needs, and therefore, the manufacturing process should not produce more than the
estimated number of required devices.

Note:
 ‘Industrial scale’ is not synonymous to ‘mass-produced’. A mass-produced medical
device is defined in the IMDRF/PMD WG/N49:2018 document as a medical device that
is based on standardised dimensions/designs; that is not designed for a particular
individual; and that is typically produced in a continuous production run or homogenous
batch.
 In case of IVDs, the analysis of a large number of patient specimens does not
automatically render an in-house IVD to a device produced on an industrial scale.
