Introduction

The transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)
have been amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607. In particular, the transitional period
has been extended from 26 May 2024 until 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028,
depending on the risk class of the device and subject to certain conditions1.
This document provides updated guidance as regards the applicability of MDR
requirements to ‘legacy devices’ and ‘old’ devices, taking into consideration the
amendments to the MDR transitional provisions2. The annex contains a non-exhaustive
table illustrating MDR requirements applicable or not applicable to ‘legacy devices’.

2.2. Terminology used in this guidance
Legacy devices should be understood as devices, which, in accordance with Article
120(3) of the MDR, are placed on the market or put into service after the MDR’s date
of application (DoA) and until either 31 December 2027 or 31 December 2028 if the
conditions set in Article 120(3c) of the MDR are fulfilled3. Those devices can be:
➢

devices which are class I devices under Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD), for which
an EC declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2021 and for
which the conformity assessment procedure under the MDR requires the
involvement of a notified body;

➢

devices covered by a valid4 EC certificate issued in accordance with Directive
90/385/EEC (AIMDD) or the MDD prior to 26 May 2021.

‘Old’ devices are those devices that were placed on the market or put into service
before 26 May 2021 in accordance with the AIMDD or the MDD or in accordance with
the applicable rules before the Directives had entered into force.
MDR devices are those that are placed on the market or put into service as being in
conformity with the MDR other than ‘legacy devices’.
It should be recalled that the concept of ‘placing on the market’ refers to each
individual product, not to a type of product5.
3.

Application of MDR requirements to ‘legacy devices’

3.1. Requirements relating to post-market surveillance, market surveillance,
vigilance, registration of economic operators and of devices
In accordance with Article 120(3d) of the MDR, the requirements of the MDR relating to
post-market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic
operators and of devices apply to ‘legacy devices’. This provision is the same as in the
initial version of the MDR and has not been changed by Regulation 2023/607.
That means that all relevant MDR requirements set out in Chapter VII of the MDR on
post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance apply to ‘legacy devices’.
To determine the applicability of requirements which depend on the risk class of a
device (e.g. Article 85 or Article 86 of the MDR) the legacy device’s risk classification in
accordance with the MDD should be taken into account. A possible change of their risk
class under the MDR is relevant only for determining the end of the transitional period.
Active implantable devices and their accessories subject to the AIMDD should be

To provide guidance for manufacturers and other actors in deciding whether or not a device is covered by the
extended transitional period provided for in Article 120 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), as amended by
Regulation (EU) 2023/607, see flowchart. Products falling outside the scope of the MDR (e.g. products referred to
in Article 1(6), point (h), MDR) cannot be subject to an application or a written agreement for conformity
assessment with a notified body in accordance with Section 4.3 of Annex VII MDR, so that they do not benefit
from the extended transitional period.
See Article 120(2) MDR regarding the extended validity of certificates.
See Article 2(28) MDR and Section 2.3. of the Commission Notice - The ‘Blue Guide’ on the
implementation of EU products rules 2022, OJ C 247, 29.6.2022, p. 1.

considered as class III devices for the purpose of applying the relevant MDR
requirements during the transition period.
In addition to the requirements set out in Chapter VII MDR, also other MDR
requirements related to post-market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance,
registration of economic operators and devices should apply to ‘legacy devices’.
Such an approach respects the wording of Article 120(3d) of the MDR. At the same
time, it extends the application of the MDR to those requirements that support a wellfunctioning vigilance and market surveillance system as well as proper registration of
economic operators and devices.
Firstly, the general obligations of manufacturers and importers to place only devices
on the market that are in conformity with the MDR (Articles 10(1) and 13(1) of the
MDR) apply, whereas for ‘legacy devices’ conformity with the MDR means conformity
with the MDD or AIMDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article
120(3d) of the MDR. In addition, the obligations of economic operators set out in the
following provisions should also apply to economic operators with respect to ‘legacy
devices’:6
➢

for manufacturers: Article 10(10), (12)-(15);

➢

for authorised representatives7: Article 11(3)(c)-(g);

➢

for importers: Article 13(2), 2nd subparagraph, (4), (6)-(8), (10);

➢

for distributors: Article 14(2), last subparagraph, (4)-(6).

MDR requirements that are not related to post-market surveillance, market
surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and devices should in
principle not apply to economic operators in respect to ‘legacy devices’. Examples for
provisions not applicable in respect to ‘legacy devices’ are Article 15, Article 16(3)
and (4), Article 188, Article 199, Article 2510, Article 2711, Article 32. This is without
prejudice to the possibility for economic operators to follow any MDR requirements
also for ‘legacy devices’, especially if they deal with both ‘legacy devices’ and MDR
devices and want to apply the same procedures for all devices.
6

11

In all cases, ‘conformity with the requirements of this Regulation’ shall mean for ‘legacy devices’ conformity with
the MDD or AIMDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article 120(3d) MDR.
The requirement that manufacturers not established in the EU shall designate an authorised representative
(Article 11(1) MDR) stems already from the AIMDD and MDD and therefore also applies to ‘legacy devices’. For
the purpose of clearly identifying the relevant competent authority, Article 11(7) should be applied also in respect
of ‘legacy devices’ clarifying that any reference to the competent authority of the Member State in which the
manufacturer has its registered place of business shall be understood as a reference to the competent authority
of the Member State in which the authorised representative has its registered place of business.
Without prejudice to national rules on implant cards applicable to ‘legacy devices’.
For legacy devices, the Declaration of Conformity (DoC) needs to refer to the MDD or AIMDD, as applicable. The
manufacturer may additionally declare conformity with Article 120 MDR confirming that the conditions laid down
therein are fulfilled. Where the manufacturer updates its DoC to reflect changes regarding information provided in
the declaration (e.g. changes concerning the address, the authorised representative, or the validity date) the
manufacturer should add a reference to the DoC which was drawn up for the legacy device before 26 May 2021.
In addition, traceability of all versions of the DoC needs to be ensured.
Without prejudice to traceability requirements in the supply chain applicable to ‘legacy devices’ in accordance with
other rules such as on market surveillance of goods or the General Product Safety Directive.
See in this respect also MDCG 2019-5 on registration of legacy devices in EUDAMED.

MDCG 2021-25 Rev 1

Systems and procedure packs
Following the logic of the transitional provisions laid down in Article 120(2) and (3) of
the MDR, the transitional period also applies to systems and procedure packs:
•

for which involvement of a notified body is required pursuant to the MDR,

•

which consist only of ‘legacy devices’12 and

•

for which a declaration has been drawn up in accordance with Article 12(2) of
the MDD prior to 26 May 202113.

In such cases, Article 22 of the MDR does not apply. The transitional period for a
‘legacy system or procedure pack’ ends when the transitional period ends for the
legacy device of the highest risk class according to the MDR that is included in the
system or procedure pack. This also applies where a certificate was issued by a
notified body prior to 26 May 2021 in accordance with Article 12(3) MDD, unless the
certificate has been withdrawn.
A system or procedure pack that is to be treated as a device in its own right pursuant
to the last subparagraph of Article 12(2) MDD needs to meet all the applicable
requirements and conditions set out in Article 120(3) to (3d) MDR to benefit from the
extended transitional period.
3.2. Other MDR requirements
Putting in place a MDR compliant quality management system
In accordance with Article 120(3c), point (d), of the MDR, manufacturers must put in
place a quality management system (QMS) in accordance with Article 10(9) of the
MDR no later than 26 May 2024 in order to be allowed to place their ‘legacy devices’ on
the market after that date. That means that, since 26 May 2024, manufacturers must
comply with Article 10(9) of the MDR, in addition to the requirements relating to postmarket surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators
and of devices, which were applicable already from 26 May 2021. With regard to legacy
devices, compliance of the QMS with the MDR does not need to be certified by a
notified body by 26 May 2024, as the assessment of the QMS will be done by the
notified body as part of the MDR certification.
For some specific QMS aspects listed in Article 10(9) of the MDR, e.g. points (b), (e)
and (f), it needs to be taken into consideration that the QMS covers ‘legacy devices’,
i.e. devices that are not yet (fully) MDR compliant. That means that for those devices it
is not required that manufacturers have identified all relevant general safety and
performance requirements and options to address those requirements, or have put in
place a risk management system as set out in Section 3 of Annex I MDR, nor
conducted the clinical evaluation in line with Article 61 and Annex XIV of the MDR.
12

Including devices that used to be part of a system or procedure pack as ‘legacy device’ and that meanwhile have
demonstrated compliance with the MDR without having undergone significant changes in design or intended
purpose.
Including any combinations of legacy devices covered by the Article 12(2) statement.

Page 7 of 11

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2021-25 Rev 1

However, the manufacturer’s QMS should address how compliance with those
requirements will be achieved during the transitional period.
UDI assignment
As Article 10(9), point (h), of the MDR does not in itself establish a requirement for UDI
assignment, the verification of UDI assignments only applies where UDI assignment is
actually required for the relevant devices. As mentioned in MDCG 2019-5, ‘legacy
devices’ are not subject to the MDR UDI requirements. This approach has not changed
through Regulation 2023/60714.
4. Application of MDR requirements to devices placed on the market prior to
26 May 2021 (‘old’ devices)
Serious incidents involving an ‘old’ device and field safety corrective actions (FSCA)
in respect of ‘old’ devices must be reported in accordance with Article 87 MDR.
Furthermore, Articles 93 to 100 of the MDR, which lay down rights and obligations of
competent authorities with regards to market surveillance activities is also applicable
to ‘old’ devices as this allows competent authorities to check that those devices are
in conformity with the rules applicable at the moment when they were placed on the
market and to take appropriate measures against non-compliant or unsafe devices.
