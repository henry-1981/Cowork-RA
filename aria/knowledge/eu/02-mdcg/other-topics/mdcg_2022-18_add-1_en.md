MDCG 2022-18 ADD.1

The position paper MDCG 2022-18 was published in December 2022 to provide a
uniform approach to the application of Article 97 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on
medical devices (MDR) in situations where a certificate issued under Directive
93/42/EEC (MDD) or Directive 90/385/EEC (AIMDD) has expired or expires before
issuance of the necessary certificate(s) in accordance with the MDR. The use of
Article 97 MDR in those situations was meant to be a temporary solution. The goal of
the position paper MDCG 2022-18 was to contribute to avoiding disruption of supply
of devices on the EU market needed for health systems and patients.
With the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2023/607 on 20 March 20231, the MDR
transitional period and the validity of MDD/AIMDD certificates have been extended,
provided that the conditions in the amended Article 120 MDR are met.
Regulation (EU) 2023/607 has averted the imminent risk of shortages of critical
legacy devices related to the expiry of MDD/AIMDD certificates.
The MDCG therefore considers that the application of Article 97 MDR in accordance
with MDCG 2022-18 to situations where a MDD/AIMDD certificate has expired prior
to the issuance of a MDR certificate has achieved its objective and is not relevant any
more.
The MDCG recommends that national CAs limit the application of Article 97 MDR as
set out in MDCG 2022-18 to very exceptional situations, e.g. where the national
competent authority (CA) has received information justifying the application of Article
97 MDR prior to 20 March 2023.
Where, after 20 March 2023, a competent authority has required or requires a
manufacturer, in accordance with Article 97 MDR, to carry out the applicable
conformity assessment procedure, the condition set out in Article 120(2), second
subparagraph, point (b), of the MDR is not met. Therefore, the expired certificate will
not be considered valid and the extended transitional period set out in Article 120(3a)
MDR does not apply.
