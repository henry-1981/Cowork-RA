Guidance on Implant Card –
‘Device types’
May 2021

This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group
(MDCG) established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is
composed of representatives of all Member States and a representative of the
European Commission chairs it.

Implant Card – ‘Device types’
Article 18 Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5
April 2017 on medical devices (MDR)

Version 1.1
According to Article 18 (a) of the MDR, the manufacturer of an implantable medical device
shall provide together with the device, information allowing the identification of the
device, including the device name, serial number, lot number, the UDI, the device model, as
well as the name, address and the website of the manufacturer.
In accordance with the instructions laid out in MDCG 2019-8, the implant card should also
indicate a ‘device type’ for the implantable medical device in question (see in red below).

As such, this document provides a non-exhaustive list of implantable medical ‘device types’
in order to aid manufacturers in allocating an appropriate term for this requested information.
A balance between the information a patient and a healthcare professional require was a
main driver behind the suggested ‘device types’.
This document will be updated, as appropriate, and following the agreement of the MDCG.
