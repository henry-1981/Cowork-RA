1.

Scope

This document provides guidance for Member States, concerned industry and other
stakeholders on a blueprint of an implant card (IC) required by the MDR (Regulation (EU)
2017/745). It describes the intended use, content and information to be provided by the
manufacturer together on the IC and a definition of fields to be completed by the implanting
healthcare institutions or healthcare providers according to national law in Member States.
Whereas the intended purpose and most of the data elements of the IC are already defined in
Article 18 of the MDR, this document contains the description of other data elements which
must be completed by the healthcare institution or healthcare provider and which must be
considered by the individual Member State when implementing Article 18 MDR as required1.

2.

Purposes of the Implant Card

The aim of introducing an IC has been to achieve three main objectives:
1. Enable the patient to identify the implanted devices and to get access to other
information related to the implanted device (e.g. via EUDAMED, and other websites).
2. Enable patients to identify themselves as persons requiring special care in relevant
situations e.g. security checks.
3. Enabling e.g. emergency clinical staff or first responder to be informed about special
care/needs for relevant patients in case of emergency situations.

3.

Legal consideration on Implant Card design

Article 18 MDR describes the requirements regarding the IC which shall be provided by the
manufacturer together with the device. Whereas Article 18 para 1a) describes the information
which shall be provided by the manufacturer on the IC, Article 18 para 2 lays down the
obligation of Member States to require health institutions to provide the IC to the concerned
patient.
In accordance with Article 18, 1a) the manufacturer should provide the following information
on the IC (preferably on the card itself or, alternatively, as stickers to be placed by the clinician):
• Device name;
• Serial number, lot number;
• Unique device identification (UDI);
• Name, address and the website of manufacturer;
• Device type.2
Article 18, 2 lays down that Member States shall require health institutions (or healthcare
providers) inter alia to make available the IC to the relevant patient. The IC should bear their

1 This guidance doesn’t include the patient information described in Article 18 para 1 (b-d) which might

be provided by the manufacturer by any means that allow rapid access to that information and that
shall be stated in the language(s) determined by the concerned Member State.
2 In Article 18 1a) of the MDR, the term “device model” is used. However, this term which is not defined
in the MDR, is part of the UDI-DI related information to be provided to EUDAMED. To avoid
duplication and in the context of the intended purpose of the IC (to be used in situations requiring
special care or in emergency situations), it is considered that reference to device model in the MDR for
the purpose of the IC shall be read as reference to device type, like “pacemaker”, “hip implant”, etc.
When the European Medical device nomenclature is made available, a “standardised” set of terms of
this nomenclature should be recommended for use in relation to the field “device type”.

identity. For this purpose, the IC provided together with the device should contain blank
fields which shall be filled out by the health institution or healthcare provider, respectively.
Since the establishment of (and the logistics behind) many different national IC designs is very
expensive and of no additional benefit, Member States should ensure that, in the context of
national implementation of Article 18 of the MDR, only the following information is required
to be provided by the health institution or healthcare provider on the IC (together with the
information provided by the manufacturer). Accordingly, a European or international
blueprint for an IC which supports the purposes described in Article 18, 2 should contain the
following blank fields:
1. Name of the patient or patient ID;
2. Name and address of the health institution or healthcare provider who performed the
implantation;
3. Date of implantation.
In order to be fit for the purposes described in Article 18, the outer dimensions of the IC should
be the same as those of credit cards, ATM cards or ID cards (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm /3 3⁄8 ×
2 1⁄8 inches) and with a radius of 2.88–3.48 mm3.

4.

Information to be provided by the manufacturer on the Implant
Card and information to be added by the health institution

The manufacturer shall provide the following necessary information:
1. Device name;
2. Device type;
3. Serial number or, where applicable, lot or batch number;
4. Unique device identification (UDI); the UDI as AIDC4 format and the UDI-DI as HRI5
5. Name and address of the manufacturer of the medical device;
6. Website of the manufacturer of the medical device.
The text provided on the IC and on the instruction for completing the IC by the healthcare
institution or healthcare provider must be legible and at least 2 millimetres high. ‘Text’
includes any: number, letter, symbol, or letter or number in a symbol.
In addition, the manufacturer should design the IC in a way that the following blank fields to
be filled out by the implanting healthcare institution or healthcare provider are available:
1. Name of the patient or patient ID;
2. Name and address of the healthcare institution which performed the implantation;
3. Date of implantation.

3 Dimensions to conform to the standard ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1.
4 AIDC - Automatic identification and data capture format (e.g. linear or 2D-Barcodes)
5 HRI - Human readable interpretation

5.

Use of symbols

To avoid national versions of the IC, the use of symbols is advisable.
The following list contains symbols which have either been validated by users and have been
submitted and accepted for inclusion in an upcoming international standard or already exist
in the ISO database (Online Browsing Platform). The explanation of symbols on the IC should
be provided in a leaflet (see section 7) or on the back of the IC, if space allows.
Article 18(1) lays down that the information provided in the IC shall be stated in the
language(s) determined by the concerned Member State.
List of symbols recommended for use on the IC6:
Patient Name or patient ID

Date of implantation

Name and Address of the implanting healthcare
institution/provider

Name and Address of the manufacturer

Information website for patients

Device Name7

Serial Number

Lot Number/Batch Code

6 The symbols for patient name or patient ID, name and address of the implanting healthcare institution/provider,
date of implantation, name and address of the manufacturer, serial number, lot number/batch code are already
available and published in existing ISO standards. The symbols for device name, patient information website and
UDI have been validated by users according to the ISO 15223-2 process. Note that the symbols listed here to indicate
the following terms: ‘Device Name’, ‘Patient Name or Patient ID’, ‘Date of Implantation’, ‘Name and address of the
implanting healthcare institution/provider’ on the implant card, are used in the ISO context to indicate ‘Medical
Device’, ‘Patient Identification’, ‘Date’, ‘Health Care Center or Doctor’.
7 Please note that in the ISO context, the ‘MD’ symbol is used to identify that the product in question is a medical
device. On the implant card, this symbol is used to indicate the device name.

UDI

UDI as AIDC format

UDI-DI information in a HRI format should be introduced by the wording “UDI-DI”.

6.

Language requirements on specific fields

Despite the nearly complete list of symbols for fields on the IC, there is currently no symbol
available for the required field “Device Type”.
The lack of a symbol and the purpose of this field makes it necessary that the information on
the device type must be provided in the language accepted/required by the concerned
Member State.
There are several possibilities available to provide this information in the necessary languages,
e.g. the information is already printed on the IC in the different languages or stickers are
provided with the IC and the healthcare professional selects the right one etc.

7.

Benefits of an informative instruction leaflet8

As mentioned above (section 5), there is a need to provide, together with the IC, instructions
on how to complete the IC and to explain the used symbols. This information shall be stated
in the language(s) determined by the concerned Member State. For this reason, the use of a
leaflet, containing the relevant information, to be provided together with the IC and the
implantable device, is the recommended solution.
As part of the risk management, the manufacturer has to investigate, by means of an
ergonomic analysis or ergonomic usability test procedure, if the provided instructions are
sufficient to enable the health professional to complete the IC correctly. The instructions must
reflect the solution chosen by the manufacturer (e.g. pre-printed IC, blank IC with sticker(s) to
be added, mixture of both). Special considerations might be needed when providing a system
IC or an IC for a separate implantable component, when there is not yet a common practice
(standard) established.

8.

Implant Card for implantable systems

If an implantable device contains implantable components which might be replaced by other
(or the same) components, for example in case of a later revision, the manufacturers should
consider the use of a System IC. In Annex I to this guide an example is provided.
Ways could be explored by relevant stakeholders to develop common rules on how the
necessary information to be placed on the System IC is delivered with the replaceable
component and how health professionals could ensure that the System IC is appropriately
updated, when necessary.

8 This leaflet should not be confused with any possible vector of information referred to in points “b”, “c” and “d”

of Article 18(1) of the MDR.
