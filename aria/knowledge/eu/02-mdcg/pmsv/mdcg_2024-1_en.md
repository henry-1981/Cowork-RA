1. Introduction 
 
The aim of this Device Specific Vigilance Guidance (DSVG) is to harmonise vigilance 
reporting and provide guidance for manufacturers of Specific Devices.  
 
It provides further clarification for vigilance reporting of Specific Devices to the 
relevant Competent Authority and should be read in conjunction with the 
requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) [1] and 
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) [2].  
This DSVG does not replace or extend any of those requirements. 
 
This document outlines the way to report incidents and serious incidents, defined in 
Article 2(64) and (65) MDR and in Article 2(67) and (68) IVDR, in accordance with 
Articles 87 and 88 MDR and Articles 82 and 83 IVDR, which occurred with Specific 
Devices to the relevant Competent Authority.  
 
 
2. What should be reported 
 
It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to judge each event on its own merit and to 
ensure compliance with the statutory reporting requirements contained within the 
MDR [1] and IVDR [2].     
 
• Individual serious incident  
 
In accordance with Article 87 MDR [1] and Article 82 IVDR [2] manufacturers shall 
report serious incidents to the relevant Competent Authority. Serious incidents are 
defined in Article 2(65) MDR and Article 2(68) IVDR.  
 
This includes circumstances where the manufacturer is uncertain whether the 
incident that occurred with a specific device is reportable or needs time to obtain 
clarification about the root cause of the incident, in accordance with Article 87(6) and 
(7) MDR and Article 82(6) and (7) IVDR. 
 
The notification to the relevant Competent Authority should be reported within the 
timeframes referred to in Article 87(2) to (5) MDR and Article 82(2) to (5) IVDR. 
 
For further information and clarification on what constitutes a serious incident and 
for details on how to apply the reporting timelines of the MDR, please refer to MDCG 
2023-31 “Questions and Answers on vigilance terms and concepts as outlined in the 
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices” [3].  
 
• 
Periodic Summary Reporting 
 
A “Periodic Summary Report” (PSR) is an alternative reporting regime by which 
the manufacturer, in agreement with the respective national Competent Authority 
that is coordinating the periodic summary reporting (and in consultation with the 
Competent Authorities referred to in Article 92(8)(a) MDR and Article 87(8)(a) IVDR), 
can report similar serious incidents with the same device or device type in a 
consolidated way. 
 
 
1 MDCG 2023-3 guidance is under revision to include IVDR aspects. Please refer to the updated version when available 
at the following link: https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-sector/new-regulations_en#guidance.

This is possible when similar serious incidents involving the same specific device 
or device type occur and for which the root cause has been identified or a field safety 
corrective action has been implemented or where the serious incidents are common 
and well documented, as defined in Article 87(9) MDR and Article 83(9) IVDR.  
 
The format, content and frequency of periodic summary reports should be agreed 
with the Coordinating Competent Authority (in consultation with the Competent 
Authorities participating in the Periodic Summary Reporting) (Article 87(9) MDR; 
Article 83(9) IVDR). 
 
Until EUDAMED becomes fully functional, Competent Authorities, economic 
operators and other relevant parties should follow MDCG 2021-1 Rev. 1 “Guidance 
on harmonised administrative practices and alternative technical solutions until 
EUDAMED is fully functional” [4] (as required under the MDR) and MDCG 2022-12 
“Guidance on harmonised administrative practices and alternative technical 
solutions until EUDAMED is fully functional (for Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro 
diagnostic medical devices)” [5] (as required under the IVDR). 
 
• 
Trend Reporting 
 
The requirements for trend reporting are outlined in Article 88 MDR [1] and Article 
83 IVDR [2]. 
 
In accordance with the MDR, the manufacturer should report to a Competent 
Authority any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of 
incidents that are not serious incidents or that are expected undesirable side-effects 
that could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis and which have led 
or may lead to risks to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons that 
are unacceptable when weighed against the intended benefits. Trends should be 
identified by the manufacturer as they can be indicative of a change in the risk-
benefit ratio.  
 
In accordance with the IVDR, the manufacturer should report to a Competent 
Authority any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of 
incidents that are not serious incidents that could have a significant impact on the 
benefit-risk analysis or any significant increase in  expected erroneous results 
established in comparison to the stated performance of the device as referred to in 
points (a) and (b) of Section 9.1 of Annex I and specified in the technical 
documentation and product information.  
 
For further information and clarification on what constitute incidents and undesirable 
side-effects please refer to MDCG 2023-3 “Questions and Answers on vigilance 
terms and concepts as outlined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical 
devices” [3].

** If you can’t use PSR, then report these serious incidents individually, using MIR Form.
 
The format, content and frequency of PSRs should be arranged 
with the Coordinating Competent Authority. 
 
*** Any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents and expected undesirable side-effects/expected erroneous results shall be 
reported by the manufacturer in accordance with Article 88(1) MDR and Article 83(1) IVDR. 
 
 
 
 
4. Clinical References and Clinical Guidelines
