1 Introduction
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on invitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) establish a regulatory framework to ensure a high level
of protection of the health and safety of patients, users and other individuals, whilst supporting
innovation. Devices may only be placed on the Union market if they comply with these
Regulations.
To ensure that devices remain compliant with the requirements of the Regulations and that
real-world experience gained from the use of the devices is taken into account for the product
realisation, manufacturers must have a Quality Management System1 (QMS) comprising a
Post-Market Surveillance (PMS) system2 in place. These systems should be proportionate to
the risk posed by the device and appropriate for the type of the device.
According to, respectively, Recitals 74 MDR and 75 IVDR, Article 10(10) of the MDR/IVDR,
manufacturers are required to implement and keep up to date a PMS system in accordance
with Article 83 MDR/Article 78 IVDR. This obligation reinforces the importance of a structured
and proactive PMS approach as an integral part of the manufacturer’s QMS3.
Manufacturers need to play an active role during the post-market phase by:
• Systematically and actively gathering information from post-market experience with
their devices.
• Using this information to update their technical documentation.
• Cooperating with national competent authorities responsible for vigilance and market
surveillance.
To support this, manufacturers must:
• Establish a comprehensive PMS system, set up under their QMS.
• Base the PMS system on a PMS plan.
Data and insights from PMS activities must be used to:
• Update relevant parts of the technical documentation (e.g., risk assessment, clinical
evaluation).
• identify the need for preventive and/or corrective action.
• Enhance transparency (e.g. through the SS(C)P)
PMS is a continuous process. Manufacturers must carry out PMS throughout the lifetime4 of a
device to monitor its safety, quality and performance.
After having established the initial PMS plan, which is part of the technical documentation5, the
first PMS process cycle begins when the first device has been placed on the market/put into
service and concludes with a report. However, surveillance activities and data collection must
be systematically performed and recorded on a continuous, ongoing basis, throughout the

entire period between the first placing on the market/putting into service and the end of the
intended lifetime of the last device placed on the market/put into service.

2 Scope and Objectives
Unless otherwise stated, this guidance is applicable to all medical devices (MDs) and in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). The main objectives of this guidance are:
1. To describe the PMS system.
2. To describe the PMS plan.
3. To describe the main activities within the PMS system.
4. To clarify the interactions of the PMS system in accordance with Article 83 MDR/Article
78 IVDR with other key aspects of the QMS as described in Article 10(9) MDR and
Article 10(8) IVDR).
Out of scope:
•

This guidance does not provide details on how a manufacturer should prepare a
periodic safety update report (‘PSUR’) or a post-market surveillance report. Specific
guidance on PSUR is provided in MDCG 2022-21. Although not covering post-market
surveillance reports, MDCG 2022-21 may provide useful suggestions on how a
manufacturer can present information in a post-market surveillance report.

•

This guidance does not cover the requirements for health institution exemption under
Article 5(5) MDR/IVDR (in-house devices), though it is expected that health institutions
review experience gained from the use of in-house devices and take all necessary
corrective actions6.

Where this guidance references terms defined or aspects clarified in other documents, the
relevant sources are cited.
Unless otherwise stated, the definitions provided in Article 2 MDR and IVDR apply for this
guidance document. Furthermore, the term ‘device‘ is used as outlined in Article 1(4) MDR and
Article 1(2) IVDR.

3 The PMS System required by the MDR/IVDR
Article 10(9)(i) MDR and Article 10(8)(i) IVDR refer to a PMS system in accordance with Article
83 MDR/Article 78 IVDR. Manufacturers are required to ‘plan, establish, document, implement,
maintain and update’ a PMS system which is to be implemented effectively and in a manner
‘that is proportionate to the risk class and appropriate for the type of device7.

3.1 General obligations
The PMS system must be suited to actively and systematically gathering, recording and
analysing relevant data on the quality, performance and safety of a device throughout its entire

6 For further information on requirements for in-house devices, refer to MDCG 2023-1 Guidance on the health

institution exemption under Article 5(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU) 2017/746.

lifetime. It must also enable the manufacturer to draw the necessary conclusions and support
the determination, implementation and monitoring of any preventive or corrective actions.8
In addition to this requirement, it is in the manufacturer’s interest to use the PMS data to identify
options to improve the usability, performance, and safety of the device.
The PMS system interfaces directly with other aspects of the QMS, such as
clinical/performance evaluation and risk management (see section 6 for further clarification on
the interactions of the PMS system with other key aspects of the QMS).
Figure 1 below provides a general, high-level overview of the PMS system as integral part of
the manufacturer’s QMS.

For a successful implementation of the PMS system the manufacturer must provide for
appropriate structures, procedures, processes and resources. The effectiveness of the PMS
system should be reported to top management, e.g., via management review.
An overview of PMS obligations laid down in the MDR and IVDR is provided in Annex 1 of this
guidance.

3.2 Specific obligations for manufacturers of custom-made devices
under the MDR
The PMS requirements according to Article 83 MDR are applicable to all devices including
Custom-Made Devices (CMD). Section 5 of Annex XIII MDR states that “The manufacturer
shall review, and document experience gained in the post-production phase, including from
PMCF as referred to in Part B of Annex XIV MDR, and implement appropriate means to apply
any necessary corrective action. In that context, it is required to report in accordance with
Article 87(1) MDR to the competent authorities any serious incidents or field safety corrective
actions or both as soon as it learns of them.”
Post-market review is mainly focused on the expected performance. A PMCF plan is therefore
required. This implies that for a CMD, the manufacturer needs to establish and maintain a PMS
system, and to document the experience gained from the post-production phase. Therefore,
even though that Article 84 does not clearly state that the PMS plan should be part of the
documentation held in accordance with Annex XIII MDR, it doesn’t remove the obligation for a
PMS plan. It is recommended that the manufacturer plan and document its experience gained
in the post-production phase, including from PMCF as referred to in Part B of Annex XIV MDR,
and implement appropriate means to apply any necessary corrective action as stated in section
5 of Annex XIII MDR.
For class I devices, the CMD manufacturer must establish a PMS report according to Article
85 MDR whereas, for classes IIa, IIb and III devices, a Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)
according to Article 86 MDR must be established. Both the PMS report and the PSUR should
be part of the CMD documentation according to section 2 of Annex XIII MDR.
To implement a MDR compliant post-market surveillance system, the CMD manufacturer
should establish appropriate communication channels with relevant healthcare
providers/professionals or patients to receive feedback on the quality, performance and in
particular the clinical performance and safety of the devices in the field.
For risk management, post-market surveillance and clinical evaluation life cycle processes as
defined by the MDR, CMD manufacturers should apply these obligations to groups of devices
with the same intended purpose, materials and processes used, principal design etc. and not
to each individual CMD9. In the PMS plan, the relevant CMD placed on the market should be
part of the scope.

4 The PMS plan
Article 84 MDR/Article 79 IVDR refer to the PMS system being based on a PMS plan, which is
part of the technical documentation (except for custom-made devices under the MDR). The
requirements for the PMS plan are outlined in section 1 of Annex III of both the MDR and IVDR.

9 This is clarified in MDCG 2021-3 Questions and Answers on Custom-Made Devices

https://health.ec.europa.eu/document/download/385d7e20-d8b5-49d0-abd78daf269bf1b8_en?filename=mdcg_2021-3_en.pdf

PMS planning starts already during the development of a device. The manufacturer should
think ahead and determine which activities should be carried out to systematically and
proactively collect experience gained from devices they place on the market or put into
service10.
Each device must be covered by a PMS plan. A plan can cover a single device or a group of
devices. For example, devices with the same manufacturing process, design and intended
purpose, or in the same device family can be covered by the same PMS plan. The plan should
clearly state which devices are included within its scope.
The PMS plan specifies the aspects of the device or group of devices to be monitored, the
frequency of monitoring, and the methods to be applied. The chosen methods should be
appropriate and based on the device’s risk profile, and the rationale for selecting these
methods needs to be documented.
Although the fourth indent of section 1(b) of Annex III MDR/IVDR requires that methods and
procedures are covered in the PMS plan, in practical terms, the PMS plan should define what
types of methods are to be applied. An explanation of how and by whom these methods are
to be applied may instead be covered by procedures that are referenced within the PMS plan.
The concept of "proactive" is central to understand the requirements set out in section 1(b) of
Annex III MDR/IVDR, which describe the PMS plan to ensure a “proactive”11 information
collecting process. Similarly, the term “proactive” appears in sections 5 and 6.1 of Part B of
Annex XIV MDR and section 4 and 5.1 of Part B of Annex XIII IVDR in the context of PostMarket Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) and Post-Market Performance Follow-up (PMPF).
“Proactive” emphasizes the manufacturer's obligation to actively seek out available information
and not merely wait for it to arrive through channels such as complaints. Manufacturers should
play an active role during the post-market phase by systematically and actively gathering
information from post-market experience with their devices.
This involves deliberately planning the gathering or generating information from a variety of
sources. These may include, but are not limited to, customer surveys, gathering of clinical
experience, user feedback, screening of scientific literature, other clinical data sources, metaanalyses of published clinical data, evaluation of suitable registers, and post-market studies.
Manufacturers should determine the appropriate methods, and the choice of methods should
be tailored to the specific device or group of devices and reflect the level of innovation and
research activity within the relevant field.
The PMS plan should also reference procedures and frequencies related to the output of the
plan, such as a PMS report for class I devices per Article 85 MDR and classes A and B devices
per Article 80 IVDR and a PSUR for all other classifications per Article 86 MDR/Article 81 IVDR.
Table 1 on the next pages provides a summary of the elements to be covered in the PMS plan
as per section 1(b) of Annex III MDR/IVDR. It also details effective and appropriate methods
and processes for assessing the collected data, including explanations and examples of these
methods.

Explanation

— a proactive and systematic process to collect any
information referred to in point (a). The process shall
allow a correct characterisation of the performance of
the devices and shall also allow a comparison to be
made between the device and similar products13
available on the market

Manufacturers are expected to collect the information referred
to in section 1(a) of Annex III MDR/IVDR and to use it to
address understanding of device usage, safety and
performance, usability as well as identify areas for
improvement. By collecting information on similar products,
the manufacturer can compare their device with similar
products on the market (in terms of design or intended use).
The information is used to demonstrate that the device
remains state of the art (SOTA)14.
Methods and processes for assessing the data are expected
to be proportionate to the type of device. The methods
selected are also dependent upon the type and quality of the
collected raw data15. It is expected that higher-risk devices will
require more specific methods of data analysis.

be used in the continuous reassessment of the
benefit-risk analysis and of the risk management as
referred to in section 3 of Annex I MDR/IVDR
— effective and appropriate methods and tools to
investigate complaints and analyze market-related
experience collected in the field

Suitable indicators and threshold values (i.e., limits beyond
which action should be taken) are to be established in the premarket phase. The data obtained through PMS activities is fed
back into the risk management process and used to reevaluate indicators and threshold values.
Methods and tools are expected to be proportionate to the type
of device: For higher-risk devices, more rigorous approaches
to investigation and analysis of complaints and other marketrelated experience may be required.

The main activities of the PMS system

The PMS system should be suited to actively and systematically gathering, recording, and
analysing relevant data on the quality, performance, and safety of a device throughout its entire
lifetime. This chapter explains the different steps in the cycle of PMS, including the collection,
assessment and analysis of post-market data and guidance on how to process the outputs.

5.1 Determining appropriate sources of available information for PMS
The manufacturer should decide which sources are relevant and appropriate for the device
concerned. When selecting data sources, the different economic operators, users (healthcare
professionals, patient, or lay users) and the situation in which the devices are used need to be
considered. The examples given in Table 2 are intended to provide guidance to manufacturers.
They should not be understood as mandatory elements.
It is up to the manufacturer to select the most appropriate methods, parameters, values,
processes, and tools depending on the type of the device. Data quality and integrity should be
considered before analysing data to ensure the information is reliable. For example, the use
of unverifiable data can lead to over-reaction, as it can be based on non-scientific data sources
such as social and public media.
Table 2 on the next pages provides an explanation of each indent of section 1(a) of Annex III
MDR/IVDR. It describes the information that should be collected and how this should be
utilised.

5.2 Collecting necessary data
The MDR and IVDR require a manufacturer to develop a robust PMS system that enables
them to gather, record and analyse relevant data on the quality, performance, and safety of a
device throughout its entire lifetime actively and systematically. In this way, information is
sought to gain insight into the real-world performance of the device.
The data collection for PMS typically starts once a manufacturer declares the device's
conformity with the requirements of the applicable Regulation and places it on the market or
puts it into service.
When gathering PMS data, manufacturers should establish the processes for receiving,
reviewing, and evaluating information, including the screening of scientific literature, feedback
and complaints provided by users, distributors, importers or other third parties.
In some instances, manufacturers may be required to generate data relating to real-world use
of the device. This is especially applicable in the case of higher risk devices and/or devices
with novel features or applications, in most cases through specific methods and procedures of
PMCF/PMPF.

5.3 Assessment and analysis of data
The PMS system should include the manufacturer’s processes and methods that are used to
effectively assess and analyse the data collected under the PMS plan. In assessing the data,
the manufacturer should refer to the objectives of their PMS (and PMCF/PMPF) plan to
evaluate whether those objectives have been achieved.
Data is assessed to analyse and characterise the performance of the device and to enable
comparisons with similar devices, thus allowing the manufacturer to confirm the continued
acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio. If the analysis reveals previously unknown side effects or
device deficiencies, the manufacturer should ensure that the processes linked to their risk
management are followed.
The manufacturer should also reflect on the performance of their device versus the generally
accepted State of the Art (SOTA)19, taking into consideration datasets relating to different
patient populations, device combinations and/or models and variants.
Furthermore, when assessing the data, it is important that data from different sources is
compared, and conflicting data identified and evaluated. Data quality and validity should be
evaluated to enable the drawing of appropriate conclusions and where necessary to identify
suitable actions.

5.4 Drawing conclusions and determining the need to take action(s)
As outlined in Article 83(2) MDR/Article 78(2) IVDR, drawing the necessary conclusions and
determining the need to take any preventive and corrective actions20 are central aspects of the
manufacturer´s assessment of the overall device safety and performance.

19 Annex I, Chapter 1, Section 1 MDR/IVDR
20 As explained in the MDCG 2022-21, Corrective or Preventive Action(s) (CAPA) which are covered by Article

83(4) MDR, Article 78(4) IVDR first sentence, can be made available to the competent authorities either through
the PSUR or PMS report. All relevant information can be found in the section 2.1.2. of MDCG 2022-21.

13

The drawing of conclusions should be based on the analysis of the data collected.
Furthermore, those conclusions and the actions taken subsequently need to be documented
in (an update of) a summary report, either in the PMS report or in the PSUR21.
Following the outcome of that report, a review of the current PMS plan may be necessary. This
will drive the level of PMS activity required for the next cycle of PMS (based on the device
class, historical data, similar products and including the need for PMCF/ PMPF for example).

6 The interactions of the PMS system with other key aspects of
the QMS
Article 83(3) MDR/Article 78(3) IVDR specifically request that information generated from PMS
activities should be used as input, on a continuous basis, to other processes within the QMS.
Table 3 on the next page provides an overview of potential activities to be considered to fulfill
the requirements listed in Article 83(3) MDR/Article 78(3) IVDR.
Annex 2 of this guidance provides examples demonstrating the various elements and
interactions of a post-market surveillance system with other key aspects of the quality
management system.

Required Information per Article 83(3)
MDR/78(3) IVDR
Update the benefit-risk determination and the
risk management (Art. 83(3)(a) MDR/Art.
78(3)(a) IVDR)

General
Information obtained through PMS activities should be used in the benefitrisk determination process and in the continuous assessment of the overall
benefit-risk profile of the device to ensure that the benefit-risk profile
remains acceptable. Furthermore, the data should be utilised to update the
risk management documentation.

Activity
•
•
•

The suitable indicators and threshold values used in the continuous
reassessment of the benefit-risk analysis of the device should be covered
in the PMS plan and be linked to the risk management documentation (as
referred to Annex I, section 3 MDR/ IVDR).

•

Changes to the benefit-risk profile of the device as a result of PMS
information should be identified, documented, and evaluated for
acceptability. The need to initiate appropriate measures, including
corrective and preventive action should be considered.

Establish procedures to adequately address the
interface between PMS and the risk
management process
Analyse and appraise the data collected by the
planned and established PMS activities
Assess the impact of collected data on the
probability and the severity ratings of existing
risks or if new risks were identified
Evaluate the impact of the collected information
on the overall risk, benefit-risk ratio and risk
acceptability.

Update the design and manufacturing
information, instructions for use and labelling
(Art. 83(3)(b) MDR/Art. 78(3)(b) IVDR)

Information obtained through the PMS process should be used to evaluate
the need for updating the design and manufacturing information, the
instructions for use and the labelling. Therefore, a manufacturer should
ensure that its design and development process consider PMS data as an
input.

•

Take appropriate action when evidence of new or
increased risks is identified (for example, through
identifying previously unknown side-effects and
monitoring of identified side-effects and
contraindications, or through identifying possible
systematic misuse or off-label use of the device.
This could include but is not limited to updates or
changes to the design of the device itself or to the
labelling and IFU.

Update clinical evaluation / performance
evaluation (Art. 61 and Art. 83(3)(c) MDR/
Art. 56 and Art. 78(3)(c) IVDR

PMCF/PMPF should be addressed in the manufacturer's PMS plan and
should be performed pursuant to a documented method laid down in a
PMCF/PMPF plan that specifies the general and specific methods and
procedures for proactively collecting and evaluating the collected
clinical/performance data. The linkage of the PMS plan to the PMCF/PMPF
plan is also described in indent 10, section 1(b) of Annex III MDR/IVDR.22

•

Consider the outputs of any relevant data
associated with PMS in the process of updating
the manufacturer’s clinical evaluation or
performance evaluation.
Analyse the findings of the PMCF/PMPF and
document the results in a PMCF/PMPF
evaluation report that should be used to update
the clinical evaluation/performance evaluation
and the technical documentation. The

Under the MDR, clinically relevant information coming from PMS, in
particular the PMCF data, is considered “clinical data”. Annex XIV Part B

MDR specifies that PMCF must be understood as a continuous process
that updates the clinical evaluation.
Specifically, data obtained by conducting PMCF is aiming to:
•
confirm the safety and performance of the device throughout its
expected lifetime.
•
identify previously unknown side-effects and monitor the identified
side-effects and contraindications.
•
identify and analyze emergent risks on the basis of factual
evidence.
•
ensure the continued acceptability of benefit-risk ratio.
•
identify possible systematic misuse or off-label use of the device,
with a view to verify that the intended purpose is correct.

conclusions of the PMCF/PMPF evaluation
report must be taken into account in the clinical
evaluation/performance evaluation and the risk
management (referred to in section 3 of Annex I
MDR/IVDR).
•

Consider this data from the perspective of the
overall benefit-risk assessment of the device
and in context with existing clinical data or
performance data from the device’s previous
clinical/performance evaluation. If the need for
corrective or preventive measures has been
identified, the manufacturer should implement
them.

•

Within the PMS System, describe how the PMS
data is used to update the SS(C)P, when
applicable23.
Assess any new information generated from the
PMS system for impact on the benefit-risk-profile
(safety/performance profile) for update to the
SS(C)P. Such updates should be aligned with
the information presented in the

Under the IVDR, performance relevant information coming from PMS, in
particular the PMPF data, is considered “relevant scientific data” and
“performance evaluation results”. Annex XIII, Part B specifies that PMPF
must be understood as a continuous process that updates the performance
evaluation.
Specifically, data obtained by conducting PMPF is aiming to:
•
confirm the safety and performance of the device throughout its
expected lifetime,
•
identify previously unknown risks or limits to performance and
contra-indications,
•
identify and analyse emergent risks on the basis of factual
evidence,
•
ensure the continued acceptability of the clinical evidence and of
the benefit-risk ratio.
•
Identify possible systematic misuse.

Update the summary of safety and (clinical)
performance (SS(C)P)
(Art. 32 and Art. 83(3)(d) MDR/Art. 29 and
Art. 78(3)(d) IVDR)

The SS(C)P is applicable to class III and implantable devices (MDR) and
class C and class D devices (IVDR). The purpose of the SS(C)P is to
provide transparency of the clinical data held on the device including
aspects of safety and performance to the health care professional and,
where applicable, patients.

clinical/performance evaluation report and
Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).
Set up processes and procedures to integrate the
data obtained by the PMS system into the QMS,
in order to initiate and document corrective and
preventive actions24 as well as field safety
corrective actions to reduce the risk posed by
devices already placed on the market.

Identify needs for preventive, corrective, or
field safety corrective actions
(Art. 83(3)(e) MDR/Art. 78(3)(e) IVDR)

Manufacturers should set up their PMS system not only to actively collect
but also analyse and utilise relevant data on the quality, performance,
and safety of a device throughout its entire lifetime. The manufacturer
should draw the necessary conclusions as to whether implementation of
corrective or preventive actions is required.

•

Identify options to improve usability,
performance and safety of the device
(Art. 83(3)(f) MDR/Art. 78(3)(f) IVDR)

Information obtained through the PMS process should be used to identify
options to improve the usability, safety, or performance of the device
through linkage to the design and development process. These actions can
be more proactive and strategic and are not necessarily tied to identified
risks. They aim to enhance user experience, clinical outcomes, or
operational efficiency rather than specifically addressing hazards.

•

Ensure design and development process
defines PMS as input to usability, safety, or
performance of the device.

Contribute to PMS of other devices
(Art. 83(3)(g) MDR/Art. 78(3)(g) IVDR)

PMS data regarding the usability, performance, and safety of one device
can contain useful information for the manufacturer’s other devices. Any
new or increased risk identified should be considered by the
manufacturer as to whether it is likely that other devices that share the
same or similar intended purpose, design or processing characteristics
could be impacted by this new information.
Information gathered on non-serious incidents, expected undesirable
side-effects (MDR), or expected erroneous results (IVDR) should be
analysed for any statistically significant increase in the frequency or
severity of those events.

•

When relevant, use the collected information,
analysis, and conclusions as input to the PMS of
other devices. The PMS system can utilize PMS
data systematically across other devices.

•

Review any statistically significant increase in the
frequency or severity that could have a significant
impact on the benefit-risk profile, and which has
led or may lead to risks to the health or safety of
patients, users or other persons that are
unacceptable when weighed against the intended
benefits. These are subject to trend reporting,
according to MDR and IVDR requirements.

Detect and report trends (Art. 83(3)(h) MDR
and Art. 88 MDR/Art. 78(3)(h) and Art. 83
IVDR)
