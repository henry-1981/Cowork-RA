1. Introduction 
 
The aim of this Device Specific Vigilance Guidance (DSVG) is to harmonize vigilance 
reporting and provide guidance for manufacturers of Devices for Cardiac Ablation.  
It provides further clarification for vigilance reporting of Devices for Cardiac Ablation to 
the relevant Competent Authority and should be read in conjunction with the 
requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) [1].  
This DSVG does not replace or extend any of those requirements. 
 
This document outlines the way to report incidents and serious incidents, defined in 
Article 2(64) and (65) MDR, in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 MDR, which occurred 
with Devices for Cardiac Ablation to the relevant Competent Authority. 
 
 
2. What should be reported 
 
It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to judge each event on its own merit and to ensure 
compliance with the statutory reporting requirements contained within the MDR [1].     
 
• 
Individual serious incident  
 
In accordance with Article 87 MDR [1] manufacturers shall report serious incidents to the 
relevant Competent Authority. Serious incidents are defined in Article 2(65) MDR. 
 
This includes circumstances where the manufacturer is uncertain whether the incident 
that occurred with a specific device is reportable or needs time to obtain clarification 
about the root cause of the incident, in accordance with Article 87(6) and (7) MDR. 
 
The notification to the relevant Competent Authority should be reported within the 
timeframes referred to in Article 87(2) to (5) MDR. 
 
For further information and clarification on what constitutes a serious incident and for 
details on how to apply the reporting timelines of the MDR, please refer to MDCG 2023-
31 “Questions and Answers on vigilance terms and concepts as outlined in the Regulation 
(EU) 2017/745 on medical devices” [2].  
 
• 
Periodic Summary Reporting 
 
A “Periodic Summary Report” (PSR) is an alternative reporting regime by which the 
manufacturer, in agreement with the respective national Competent Authority that is 
coordinating the periodic summary reporting (and in consultation with the Competent 
Authorities referred to in Article 92(8)(a) MDR), can report similar serious incidents with 
the same device or device type in a consolidated way. 
 
This is possible when similar serious incidents involving the same specific device or 
device type occur and for which the root cause has been identified or a field safety 
corrective action has been implemented or where the serious incidents are common and 
well documented, as defined in Article 87(9) MDR.  
 
The format, content and frequency of periodic summary reports should be agreed with 
 
1 MDCG 2023-3 guidance is under revision to include IVDR aspects. Please refer to the updated version when available 
at the following link: https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-sector/new-regulations_en#guidance.

the Coordinating Competent Authority (in consultation with the Competent Authorities 
participating in the Periodic Summary Reporting) (Article 87(9) MDR).  
 
Until EUDAMED becomes fully functional, Competent Authorities, economic operators 
and other relevant parties should follow MDCG 2021-1 Rev. 1
 “Guidance on harmonised 
administrative practices and alternative technical solutions until EUDAMED is fully 
functional
” [3] (as required under the MDR).  
 
 
•
 
Trend Reporting 
 
The requirements for 
trend reporting
 are outlined in Article 88 MDR [1].  
 
In accordance with the 
MDR
, the manufacturer should report to a Competent Authority 
any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents that are not 
serious incidents or that are expected undesirable side-effects that could have a 
significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis and which have led or may lead to risks to 
the health or safety of patients, users or other persons that are unacceptable when 
weighed against the intended benefits. Trends should be identified by the manufacturer 
as they can be indicative of a change in the risk-benefit ratio.  
 
For further information and clarification on what constitute incidents and undesirable 
side-effects please refer to MDCG 2023-3 “
Questions and Answers on vigilance terms 
and concepts as outlined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices
” [2].
