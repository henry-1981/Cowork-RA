1. Introduction
The aim of this Device Specific Vigilance Guidance (DSVG) is to harmonise vigilance
reporting and provide guidance for manufacturers of Cardiac implantable electronic
devices and their leads (CIEDs).
It provides further clarification for vigilance reporting of Cardiac implantable electronic
devices and their leads (CIEDs) to the relevant Competent Authority and should be
read in conjunction with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical
devices (MDR) [1].
This DSVG does not replace or extend any of those requirements.
This document outlines the way to report incidents and serious incidents, defined in
Article 2(64) and (65) MDR, in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 MDR, which occurred
with Cardiac implantable electronic devices and their leads (CIEDs) to the relevant
Competent Authority.

2. What should be reported
It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to judge each event on its own merit and to ensure
compliance with the statutory reporting requirements contained within the MDR [1].
•

Individual serious incident

In accordance with Article 87 MDR [1] manufacturers shall report serious incidents to the
relevant Competent Authority. Serious incidents are defined in Article 2(65) MDR.
This includes circumstances where the manufacturer is uncertain whether the incident
that occurred with a specific device is reportable or need time to obtain clarification about
the root cause of the incident, in accordance with Article 87(6) and (7) MDR.
The notification to the relevant Competent Authority should be reported within the
timeframes referred to in Article 87(2) and (5) MDR.
For further information and clarification on what constitutes a serious incident and for
details on how to apply the reporting timelines of the MDR, please refer to MDCG 202331 “Questions and Answers on vigilance terms and concepts as outlined in the Regulation
(EU) 2017/745 on medical devices” [2].
•

Periodic Summary Reporting

A “Periodic Summary Report” (PSR) is an alternative reporting regime by which the
manufacturer, in agreement with the respective national Competent Authority that is
coordinating the periodic summary reporting (and in consultation with the Competent
Authorities referred to in Article 92(8)(a) MDR), can report similar serious incidents with
the same device or device type in a consolidated way.
This is possible when similar serious incidents involving the same specific device or
device type occur and for which the root cause has been identified or a field safety
1 MDCG 2023-3 guidance is under revision to include IVDR aspects. Please refer to the updated version when available

at the following link: https://health.ec.europa.eu/medical-devices-sector/new-regulations_en#guidance.

corrective action has been implemented or where the serious incidents are common and
well documented, as defined in Article 87(9) MDR.
The format, content and frequency of periodic summary reports should be agreed with
the Coordinating Competent Authority (in consultation with the Competent Authorities
participating in the Periodic Summary Reporting) (Article 87(9) MDR).
Until EUDAMED becomes fully functional, Competent Authorities, economic operators
and other relevant parties should follow MDCG 2021-1 Rev. 1 “Guidance on harmonised
administrative practices and alternative technical solutions until EUDAMED is fully
functional” [3] (as required under the MDR).

•

Trend Reporting

The requirements for trend reporting are outlined in Article 88 MDR [1].
In accordance with the MDR, the manufacturer should report to a Competent Authority
any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents that are not
serious incidents or that are expected undesirable side-effects that could have a
significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis and which have led or may lead to risks to
the health or safety of patients, users or other persons that are unacceptable when
weighed against the intended benefits. Trends should be identified by the manufacturer
as they can be indicative of a change in the risk-benefit ratio.
For further information and clarification on what constitute incidents and undesirable
side-effects please refer to MDCG 2023-3 “Questions and Answers on vigilance terms
and concepts as outlined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices” [2].

3. DSVG 03 examples
The following table details Cardiac implantable electronic devices and their leads
(CIEDs) examples indicating what should be reported as device-related problems that
caused or contributed to the incidents or serious incidents.
The list is for illustrative purposes only and does not constitute an exhaustive list:

* The IMDRF Annexes codes associated with each text description are included as guides (please see the Section 5).
** If you can’t use PSR, then report these serious incidents individually, using MIR Form. The format, content and frequency of PSRs should be arranged with the Coordinating Competent Authority.
*** Any statistically significant increase in the frequency or severity of incidents and expected undesirable side-effects shall be reported by the manufacturer in accordance with Article 88(1) MDR.
**** Pacing impedance is typically considered abnormal if a measurement is <200 Ω or >1000-3000 Ω (depending on the lead model). Defibrillation impedance is typically considered abnormal if a measurement is < 20 Ω or > 200 Ω (based on lead model and measurement range of the device).
***** Unless information or evaluation of device indicates not device related.
This guidance is limited to devices used to manage cardiac rhythms known as cardiac implanted electronic devices (CIEDs), including pacemakers, ICDs and CRT-Ds. Cardiac assist devices such as LVADs and BiVADs are not included.
