Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (the IVDR) requires
that the manufacturer shall draw up a summary of safety and performance (SSP) for
class C and D devices, other than devices for performance studies. The SSP shall be
validated by a notified body (NB) and made available to the public via the European
database on medical devices (Eudamed).1
Text elements in italic in the template are general information proposed to be included
in the SSP document.
The SSP should include information dedicated to the intended user, and if relevant, the
patient. The SSP shall be kept updated2 in Eudamed.
If the device is not intended for self-testing, the SSP should be dedicated to the
professional user. Furthermore, where the manufacturer considers it relevant to
provide an SSP for patients, a part dedicated to patients and written in a way that is
clear to lay persons should be added. The SSP template for devices not intended for
self-testing is presented in Section 1.
If the device is intended for self-testing, the SSP should be written in a way that is clear
to the patients/lay persons, for instance taking into consideration the age of the
targeted population. The SSP template for devices intended for self-testing is
presented in Section 2.

Section 1 – SSP Template for devices not intended for self-testing
All the fields/chapters of information have to be filled in even for cases that are not
applicable. In this case “not applicable” should be entered.
Summary of Safety and Performance
This Summary of Safety and Performance (SSP) is intended to provide public access
to an up-to-date summary of the main aspects of the safety and performance of the
device.
The SSP is not intended to replace the Instructions For Use as the main document to
ensure the safe use of the device, nor is it intended to provide diagnostic or therapeutic
suggestions to intended users.
In Section 1.A, the following should be added:
The following information is intended for professional users.
If the SSP includes a part intended for patients/lay persons, the following should be
1 IVDR, Article 29 (1)
2 The manufacturer should verify whether updates of its PMPF evaluation report (Article 56(6)) and the periodic safety

update report (PSUR, Article 81 (1)) require also an update of the SSP.

C (IVDR, Article 48 (7)) for which
the SSP is not yet validated by
the NB)8

4 More detail is expected compared to the information provided in the Instructions for Use.
5 Specifically, in the case of a companion diagnostic a summary of performance data that shows the device is essential for

the safe and effective use of the medicinal product should be included.
6 IVDR Annex IX, 4.5 and Annex X, 3(d)
7 Specifically, for a companion diagnostic co-developed with a medicinal product, the concerned medicinal product study
and device version used in that study should be referenced. If different device versions have been used in the clinical
development program performed, concordance studies should be described
8 For class C devices, a draft SSP should be submitted to the NB involved in the conformity assessment as part of the
application documents. The draft SSP should be validated by the NB. In the circumstance that more than one device is
covered by the relevant certificate, at least one draft SSP should be validated against relevant documents in the technical
documentation during the initial conformity assessment, prior to issuing the certificate. Draft SSPs that are not validated at
the initial conformity assessment should be validated against relevant documents in the technical documentation at least
once during the period of validity of the certificate.
