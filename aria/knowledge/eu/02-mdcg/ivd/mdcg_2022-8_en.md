Introduction

Regulation (EU) 2022/1121 extended the transitional provisions of Regulation (EU)
2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR), in particular its Article 110(3),
in terms of scope and timing. Following the approach set out in the report of the
MDCG ad hoc task-force on transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on
medical devices (MDR) published as MDCG 2021-252, the present document
provides guidance as regards the applicability of IVDR requirements to ‘legacy
devices’ and ‘old’ devices. The annex contains a non-exhaustive table illustrating
IVDR requirements applicable or not applicable to ‘legacy devices’.
II.

Legal provisions and terminology

Article 110(3) of Regulation 2017/746 (IVDR), as amended by Regulation (EU)
2022/112, states:
By way of derogation from Article 5 of this Regulation, the devices referred to in the
second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph may be placed on the market or
put into service until the dates set out in those subparagraphs, provided that, from
the date of application of this Regulation, those devices continue to comply with
Directive 98/79/EC, and provided that there are no significant changes in the design
and intended purpose of those devices.
Devices with a certificate that was issued in accordance with Directive 98/79/EC and
which is valid by virtue of paragraph 2 of this Article may be placed on the market or
put into service until 26 May 2025.
Devices for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to Directive
98/79/EC did not require the involvement of a notified body, for which a declaration of
conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2022 in accordance with that Directive, and
for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to this Regulation requires
the involvement of a notified body, may be placed on the market or put into service
until the following dates:
(a)

26 May 2025, for class D devices;

(b)

26 May 2026, for class C devices;

(c)

26 May 2027, for class B devices;

(d)

26 May 2027, for class A devices placed on the market in sterile condition.

registration of economic operators and of devices shall apply to devices referred to in
the second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph, instead of the corresponding
requirements in Directive 98/79/EC.
Without prejudice to Chapter IV and paragraph 1 of this Article, the notified body that
issued the certificate referred to in the second subparagraph of this paragraph shall
continue to be responsible for the appropriate surveillance in respect of all applicable
requirements relating to the devices it has certified.
Terminology used in this guidance
Legacy devices under the IVDR (hereafter ‘legacy devices’) should be understood
as devices referred to in the 2nd or 3rd subparagraph of Article 110(3) IVDR, which are
placed on the market or put into service after 26 May 2022 (i.e. the IVDR’s date of
application) and until the end of the respective transition period set out in the 2 nd or
3rd subparagraph of Article 110(3), if the conditions laid down in the 1st subparagraph
of Article 110(3)3 are fulfilled. Those devices can be:
a)

devices covered by a valid EC certificate issued by a notified body in accordance
with Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDD) prior to 26
May 2022; or

b)

devices for which a declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2022
in accordance with the IVDD and for which the conformity assessment procedure
pursuant to the IVDR (contrary to the IVDD) requires the involvement of a
notified body.

‘Old’ devices are those devices that were placed on the market or put into service
before 26 May 2022 in accordance with the IVDD or the applicable national rules
before the IVDD had become applicable and which are still on the market or in use
after 26 May 2022.
IVDR devices are those devices that are placed on the market as being in conformity
with the IVDR other than ‘legacy devices’. In order to be placed on the market or put
into service from 26 May 2022 all class A non-sterile devices and all devices not
benefitting from the transitional provisions laid down in Article 110(3) IVDR, i.e. all
‘new’ devices, must be IVDR-compliant.

3

According to the 1st subparagraph of Article 110(3) IVDR, in order to benefit from the transition
period, devices (1) must continue to comply with Directive 98/79/EC and (2) must not be subject to
significant changes in the design and intended purpose. With regard to the meaning of ‘significant
changes’ see MDCG 2022-6 Guidance on significant changes regarding the transitional provision
under Article 110(3) of the IVDR.

Transition periods
For devices covered by a valid EC certificate issued in accordance with the IVDD prior to 26
May 2022 (i.e. devices listed in Annex II IVDD and devices for self-testing), the transition
period ends on 26 May 2025 (see 2nd subparagraph of Article 110(3) IVDR). If placed on the
market before 26 May 2025, those devices may continue to be made available until 26 May
2026 (‘sell-off date’, see 2nd subparagraph, point (a) of Article 110(4) IVDR).
For devices that fall in class D in accordance with the IVDR classification rules for which a
declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2022 in accordance with the IVDD
and for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to the IVDR (contrary to the
IVDD) requires the involvement of a notified body, the transition period ends on 26 May 2025
(see 3nd subparagraph, point (a), of Article 110(3) IVDR). If placed on the market before 26
May 2025, those devices may continue to be made available until 26 May 2026 (‘sell-off
date’, see 2nd subparagraph, point (a) of Article 110(4) IVDR).
For devices that fall in class C in accordance with the IVDR classification rules for which a
declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2022 in accordance with the IVDD
and for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to the IVDR (contrary to the
IVDD) requires the involvement of a notified body, the transition period ends on 26 May 2026
(see 3nd subparagraph, point (b), of Article 110(3) IVDR). If placed on the market before 26
May 2026, those devices may continue to be made available until 26 May 2027 (‘sell-off
date’, see 2nd subparagraph, point (b) of Article 110(4) IVDR).
For devices that fall in class B or class A sterile in accordance with the IVDR classification
rules for which a declaration of conformity was drawn up prior to 26 May 2022 in accordance
with the IVDD and for which the conformity assessment procedure pursuant to the IVDR
(contrary to the IVDD) requires the involvement of a notified body, the transition period ends
on 26 May 2027 (see 3nd subparagraph, points (c) and (d), of Article 110(3) IVDR). If placed
on the market before 26 May 2027, those devices may continue to be made available until 26
May 2028 (‘sell-off date’, see 2nd subparagraph, point (c) of Article 110(4) IVDR).

It should be recalled that the concept of ‘placing on the market’ refers to each
individual product, not to a type of product4.
III.

Application of IVDR requirements to legacy devices

1. Application of requirements set out in Chapter VII of the IVDR on postmarket surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance to ‘legacy devices’
In accordance with the 4th subparagraph of Article 110(3) IVDR, the relevant
requirements set out in Chapter VII of the IVDR on post-market surveillance, market
surveillance and vigilance apply to ‘legacy devices’.
That means that manufacturers of ‘legacy devices’ need to set up a post-market
surveillance (PMS) system based on a PMS plan (Articles 78, 79 IVDR) with the
exception of aspects related to pre-market requirements, which are not applicable to

4

See Article 2(21) IVDR and section 2.3. of the Commission Notice - The ‘Blue Guide’ on the
implementation of EU products rules 2016, OJ C 272, 26.7.2016, p. 1.

MDCG 2022-8

‘legacy devices’, such as to update the summary of safety and performance (Article
78(3), point (d), IVDR).5
As part of the manufacturer’s post-market surveillance system, the post-market
performance follow-up (PMPF) requirements (Annex XIII, Part B, IVDR) should apply
to ‘legacy devices’. PMPF further develops the requirement in Annex III, section 5, of
the IVDD6. That means that, under the IVDR, manufacturers need to “proactively
collect and evaluate performance and relevant scientific data from the use of a
device”. However, this does not mean that the manufacturer would have to draw up,
retrospectively, a performance evaluation report in line with the IVDR as performance
evaluation and its documentation according to the IVDR is a pre-market requirement
not applicable to ‘legacy devices’.
The requirements and procedures related to serious incidents and field safety
corrective actions and trend reporting (Articles 82, 83 and 84 IVDR) as well as
market surveillance provisions apply to ‘legacy devices’.
As Directive 98/79/EC, contrary to the IVDR, does not provide for rules for the
classification of devices in risk classes as specified in the IVDR, an appropriate
distinction cannot be made between ‘legacy devices’ to which Article 80 IVDR (PMS
report)7 and ‘legacy devices’ to which Article 81 IVDR (periodic safety update report,
PSUR)8 apply. Therefore, Article 80 IVDR (PMS report) should, as a minimum
requirement, apply to all legacy devices, unless a manufacturer of ‘legacy devices’
that will fall under class C or D voluntarily prepares a PSUR pursuant to Article 81.
Regarding ‘legacy devices’ covered by certificates issued under the IVDD (i.e. for
devices listed in Annex II IVDD and devices for self-testing), the notified bodies that
issued the respective certificates conduct the ‘appropriate surveillance’ in accordance
with the 5th subparagraph of Article 110(3) IVDR, which essentially is a continuation
of the previous surveillance activities under the IVDD. In the framework of their
surveillance activities, notified bodies should take into account the new requirements
that apply to manufacturers resulting from the transitional provisions. However, there
needs to be flexibility as regards notified bodies’ involvement when reviewing
applicable requirements as part of their ‘appropriate surveillance’, as the notified
bodies responsible for the appropriate surveillance in accordance with the 5th
subparagraph Article 110(3) IVDR9 are not notified bodies designated to conduct
conformity assessments under the IVDR.
2. Application of other IVDR requirements to ‘legacy devices’
In addition to the requirements set out in Chapter VII IVDR, also other IVDR
requirements should apply to ‘legacy devices’, provided that those requirements

5

No full revision of the technical documentation in accordance with Annexes II and III IVDR
required.
According to Annex III, section 5, and Annex IV, last indent of section 3.1, of the IVDD, “the
manufacturer shall institute and keep up to date a systematic procedure to review experience
gained from devices in the post-production phase and to implement appropriate means to apply
any necessary corrective actions, taking account of the nature and risks in relation to the product.”
Article 80 IVDR applies to class A and B devices.
Article 81 IVDR applies to class C and D devices.
A MDCG guidance on appropriate surveillance referred to in Article 110(3) IVDR is under
development.

relate to post-market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance or registration of
economic operators and devices.
Such an approach respects the wording of Article 110(3) IVDR. At the same time it
extends the application of the IVDR to those requirements that support a wellfunctioning vigilance and market surveillance system as well as proper registration of
economic operators and devices.
Firstly, the general obligations of manufacturers and importers to place only devices
on the market that are in conformity with the IVDR (Articles 10(1) and 13(1) IVDR)
apply, whereas for ‘legacy devices’ conformity with the IVDR means conformity with
the IVDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article 110(3) IVDR. In
addition, the obligations of economic operators set out in the following provisions
should also apply to economic operators with respect to ‘legacy devices’ 10:
 for manufacturers: Article 10(9), (11)-(14);
 for authorised representatives11: Article 11(3)(c)-(g);
 for importers: Article 13(2), 2nd subparagraph, (4), (6)-(8), (10);
 for distributors: Article 14(2), last subparagraph, (4)-(6).
Based on this approach, further requirements applicable to ‘legacy devices’ may be
identified by the relevant working groups.
IVDR requirements that are not related to post-market surveillance, market
surveillance, vigilance, registration of economic operators and devices should in
principle not apply to economic operators in respect to ‘legacy devices’12. Examples
for provisions not applicable in respect to ‘legacy devices’ are Article 15, Article 16(3)
and (4), Article 2213, Article 2414, Article 29 IVDR. This is without prejudice to the
possibility for economic operators to follow any IVDR requirements also for ‘legacy
devices’, especially if they deal with both ‘legacy devices’ and IVDR devices and
want to apply the same procedures for all devices.

In all cases, ‘conformity with the requirements of this Regulation’ shall mean for ‘IVD legacy
devices’ conformity with the IVDD and the additional requirements in accordance with Article
110(3) IVDR.
The requirement that manufacturers not established in the EU shall designate an authorised
representative (Article 11(1) IVDR) stems already from the IVDD and therefore also applies to
‘legacy devices’. For the purpose of clearly identifying the relevant competent authority, Article
11(7) should be applied also in respect of ‘legacy devices’ clarifying that any reference to the
competent authority of the Member State in which the manufacturer has its registered place of
business shall be understood as a reference to the competent authority of the Member State in
which the authorised representative has its registered place of business.
However, provisions on performance studies apply to studies started after 26 May 2022
regardless of the device’s status.
Without prejudice to traceability requirements in the supply chain applicable to ‘legacy devices’ in
accordance with other rules such as on market surveillance of goods or the General Product
Safety Directive.
See in this respect also MDCG 2019-5 on registration of legacy devices in Eudamed.

MDCG 2022-8

Application of IVDR requirements to devices placed on the market
prior to 26 May 2022 (‘old’ devices)15

IVDR requirements are in principle not applicable to ‘old’ devices. However, IVDR
provisions should generally apply if they do not directly impact the device, its
documentation or the conditions for the placing or making available of devices on
the market. That means that Articles 88 to 95 IVDR, which lay down rights and
obligations of competent authorities with regard to market surveillance activities,
apply also to ‘old’ devices after 26 May 2022. This allows competent authorities to
check that those devices are in conformity with the rules applicable at the moment
when they were placed on the market and to take appropriate measures against
non-compliant or unsafe devices.
Moreover, the reporting and analysis of serious incidents and field safety corrective
actions occurring after 26 May 2022 in respect of ‘old’ devices should be done in
accordance with Article 82 and 84 IVDR.

15

The application of market surveillance and vigilance provisions to ‘old’ devices has in the past
been interpreted differently at national level.
