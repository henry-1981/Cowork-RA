2 Introduction
The sponsor of a performance study is required to submit an application/notification 1 to the Member State(s) in which a performance
study is to be conducted, accompanied by the documentation referred to in Chapter I of Annex XIV of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on
in vitro diagnostic medical devices (the IVDR). The application/notification must be submitted by means of the electronic system
referred to in Article 69 of the IVDR.
Additionally, the sponsor of a performance study is required to notify 2 the Member State(s) in which a performance study is being or
is to be conducted if it intends to introduce modifications to a performance study that are likely to have a substantial impact on the
safety, health or rights of the subjects or on the robustness or reliability of the data generated by the performance study by means
of the same electronic system.
In the absence of the European database on medical devices (EUDAMED), a series of performance study application/notification
documents have been created to support performance study procedures with respect to the IVDR – see MDCG 2022-19.
To add to these documents, a template for ‘Substantial modification of performance study under Regulation (EU) 2017/746’ is also
provided.
Insofar as possible, the modification of the performance study form includes the same data fields as the EUDAMED system in
development.
Use of templates
This document is intended to be facilitative and its use by the competent authorities and sponsors is encouraged, however it is
important to check with the individual Member State in which the performance study is planned to be conducted for any specific

fully functional.
