1. Foreword
This guidance, relating to the application of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) addresses the classification of in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) and provides clarifications on the classification rules as set out under Annex VIII. This classification guidance also applies to
diagnostic or information society services performed on EU patients or devices put in to service through distance sales.
The guidance has been developed by an expert group representing Member State Competent Authorities, Commission services, notified bodies and industry.
This guidance also takes into account the Corrigendum published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 December 2019. As this document is
intended to provide useful information to ensure the uniform application of the relevant Regulatory provisions, it should always be read in conjunction with the
IVDR.
The primary purpose of this document is to provide guidance to manufacturers, notified bodies and health institutions on how to classify an IVD prior to placing
it on the market, making available on the market or putting into service in the Union. It is also intended to inform regulators and other stakeholders when
assessing the class attributed to an IVD by a manufacturer or a health institution.
It is important to recall that the IVDR sets out a legal empowerment for the classification of IVDs. Therefore, and only at the request of a Member State, or on
its own initiative, the Commission shall after consulting the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG), decide by means of implementing acts, on the
application of Annex VIII to a given device, or category or group of devices, with a view to determining the classification of such devices (Article 47 (3-4) of the
IVDR). To the extent necessary to resolve issues of divergent interpretation and of practical application, the Commission may adopt implementing acts, in order
to ensure the uniform application of the classification rules, taking into account the relevant scientific opinions of the relevant scientific committees (Article 47
(5) of the IVDR).
Examples in this document are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not represent an exhaustive list.

2. Definitions
-

‘confirmatory device’
is a device intended to be used for the confirmation of a reactive result from a first line assay.

-

‘first-line device’

is a device intended to be used to detect a marker or analyte, and which may be followed by a confirmatory assay. Devices intended to be used solely
to monitor a previously determined marker or analyte are not considered first-line assays.
-

‘detecting the exposure to’ an agent

means the indirect detection of an agent (present or past exposure).
- by detecting the presence of surrogate markers, such as antibodies against components of the agent.
-

‘detecting the presence of’ an agent
means the direct detection of the agent, by detecting
- the presence of the agent itself (e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, protozoal agents), or
- the presence of structural components derived from the agent, such as antigens or nucleic acids.

-

‘embryo’ or ‘foetus’
an unborn refers to stages in human development after zygote formation. A zygote is considered an embryo in particular from the period of conception
to approximately the eighth week, and considered a foetus following this period until birth.
Samples from the embryo or foetus include samples from the embryonic/foetal membranes, fluids and excretions, the umbilical cord, and maternal
samples (e.g. blood) containing embryonic/foetal material to be examined.

-

‘offspring’
is the result of conception, at all stages of development, embryo and foetus, premature and full term neonates, child and adult.

MDCG 2020-16 rev.4

‘infective/infectious agent’
is an agent capable of producing infection. This includes iatrogenic infections, i.e. those infections transmitted during medical treatment and care.

-

‘life-threatening’
are diseases, conditions or situations that in general result in death. These are often untreatable, treatment options are limited or require major medical
interventions.1

-

‘marker’ ‘analyte’ or measurand
a substance or material; something that identifies or that is used to identify; a factor that establishes the nature of an entity or event; constituent of a
sample with a measurable property.

-

‘devices for monitoring’
are used for the measurement of the analyte (measurand) levels for the purpose of adjusting treatments/interventions as required.
Devices for monitoring include the following:
- Devices which are used to assess whether an analyte remains within physiological levels or within an established therapeutic drug range. These
types of devices are designed to evaluate an individual’s current state.
- Devices which are used for serial measurement, whereby multiple determinations are taken over time. These types of devices are typically used
for the detection/assessment of disease progression/regression, disease recurrence, minimum residual disease, response/resistance to therapy,
and/or adverse effects due to therapy. These types of devices are designed to evaluate changes in an individual’s state.

-

‘devices for screening’
are used to detect the presence of or the predisposition to a disease, disorder or other physiological state in a specimen from an individual, embryo or
foetus not demonstrating clinically evident symptoms.

MDCG 2020-16 rev.4

Depending on the nature of the condition and the targeted patient population, screening devices may be used routinely or may be restricted to "at risk"
patients.
This also includes (for example) devices intended to assess the suitability of blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs, or in any of their
derivatives for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration, with respect to transmissible agents.
-

‘devices for self testing’ 2
means any device intended by the manufacturer to be used by lay persons, including devices used for testing services offered to lay persons by means
of information society services.

-

'kit’
means a set of components that are packaged together and intended to be used to perform a specific in vitro diagnostic examination, or a part thereof.

-

‘newborn’
a newborn, or neonate, refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth.

-

‘specimen’
is a discrete portion of a body fluid or tissue taken from an individual for examination, study or analysis of one or more quantities or characteristics to
determine the character of the whole. This also includes other materials, for example, hair, nails excretions, secretions, or a sample from the skin surface.

-

‘instrument’
means equipment or apparatus intended by a manufacturer to be used as an IVD medical device.

-

‘transmissible agent’
means a biological substance or entity capable of causing disease or infection in individuals through individual to individual, animal to individual, or
other modes of contact.

2 Article 2(5) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 introduces significant changes to the definition of a device for self testing, please familiarise yourself with these important changes.

3. Principles of Classification
In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/746, devices shall be classified into classes A, B, C and D, taking into account the intended purpose of the devices and
their inherent risks (Article 47).
Robust risk-based classification rules are essential for the correct classification of devices according to Annex VIII as certain requirements set out by the IVDR
are directly linked to device classification.
In particular, the conformity assessment route is highly dependent on classification, which is reflected in concepts such as conformity assessments scrutiny of
class D devices (Article 50), the involvement of European Union reference laboratories for high-risk devices (Article 100) and a consultation with a national
medicines agency or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for companion diagnostics (Article 48(3)).
Many post-market requirements are also class dependent, e.g. annual surveillance assessments for class C and D devices, or the requirement to prepare a postmarket surveillance report or Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) for a given device (Articles 80 and 81).
3.1 Intended purpose
The classification of a device is defined by its intended purpose, as specified by the manufacturer. This covers the use for which a device is intended according
to the data supplied by the manufacturer on the label, in the instructions for use, in the performance evaluation or in promotional or sales materials or statements.
It is therefore important that the manufacturer clearly indicates the purpose for which the device is intended. Where there is a foreseeable risk that a device may
be used for purposes which are covered by other classification rules and which would result in classification of a device into a higher class, a clear limitation of
use should be included in the Instruction for Use (IFU) and the technical documentation of the device.
For a device to be specifically intended for a purpose referenced in a particular classification rule, the manufacturer must clearly indicate that the device is
intended for such a specific purpose in the information accompanying the device. Where several classification rules or sub-rules apply, the intended purpose of
the device and its claims should be sufficiently specified to enable a clear attribution of the class. Ambiguous claims may lead to higher classification (Annex VIII
1.9).
Example: A device intended to screen blood and tissue donations for syphilis would fall under class D according to rule 1. Alternatively, a device intended to
diagnose syphilis, a sexually transmitted agent, in the individual would fall under class C according to rule 3a.

3.2 Application of the rules
All implementing rules, all classification rules, and all indents are to be taken into account for the classification of an IVD or an accessory for an IVD.
3.2.1
Technology
Unless otherwise specified, the rules presented below apply equally to all technologies, principles of detection or analytical procedures.
3.2.2
Specimen
Unless specified in the classification rule, the rules apply equally to all specimen types. For example, rule 3a is equally applicable to specimens derived from
blood, urine, specimens collected on swabs etc. In contrast, rule 3b specifies a specimen type (cerebrospinal fluid or blood).
3.2.3
Software
Medical device software (MDSW) is software that is intended to be used, alone or in combination, for a purpose as specified in the definition of a “medical
device” in the medical devices regulation or in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation.
Software which drives a device or influences the use of the device shall fall within the same class as the device.
If the software is independent of any other device, it shall be classified in its own right (Regulation (EU) 2017/746; Annex VIII 1.4). The application of the
classification rules shall be governed by the intended purpose of the MDSW.
See also: MDCG 2019-11 Guidance on Qualification and Classification of Software in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 – MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 – IVDR
3.2.4 Devices used in combination
When classifying devices that are used in combination, implementing rules play a key role in determining the classification of individual devices.
Examples of devices used in combination include:
•
•

A control which is used in combination with a reagent or
Software which drives or influences the use of an analyser.

Under the implementing rules, some devices are classified based on the classification of another device; for example:
•

Software, which drives a device or influences the use of a device, shall fall within the same class as the device.

•
•

MDCG 2020-16 rev.4

Calibrators intended to be used with a device shall be classified in the same class as the device.
Control materials with quantitative or qualitative assigned values intended for one specific analyte or multiple analytes shall be classified in the same
class as the device.

In addition, for combinations of devices it is worth noting that implementing rules 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 respectively state:
•
•
•

Application of the classification rules shall be governed by the intended purpose of the devices.
If a device is intended to be used in combination with another device, the classification rules shall apply separately to each of the devices.
Accessories for an in vitro diagnostic medical device shall be classified in their own right separately from the device with which they are used.

See Annex 1 for further examples.

RULE 1

Devices intended to be used for the following purposes are classified as class D:
Rule 1 first indent

Devices intended to be used for the detection of the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent in blood, blood
components, cells, tissues or organs, or in any of their derivatives, in order to assess their suitability for transfusion,
transplantation or cell administration.
RATIONALE
Rule 1; first indent applies to all devices intended to assess the suitability of blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs or their derivatives for
transfusion, transplantation or cell administration, with respect to transmissible agents. The result of the test will be a major determinant as to whether the
analysed donation will be used.
Devices typically falling under this rule are intended for the detection of those agents for which the EU has harmonised the donor and donation testing
requirements within the context of risk of transmission of infection (European Directives 2002/98/EC 3, 2006/17/EC4, 2010/45/EU (corrigendum: 2010/53/EU) 5).
Those agents are listed in the examples below.
It must be noted that:
- Member States’ national legislation may impose testing of additional transmissible agents in blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs or
their derivatives when intended for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration.
- Manufacturers may intend devices for the detection of the presence of, or exposure to, transmissible agents, other than those mentioned in the
above-cited Directives, to assess the suitability of blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs or their derivatives for transfusion, transplantation
or cell administration. In that case, these devices are classified in class D according to this rule.
3 DIRECTIVE 2002/98/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 27 January 2003 setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing,

storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC
4 COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/17/EC of 8 February 2006 implementing Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards certain technical
requirements for the donation, procurement and testing of human tissues and cells
5 DIRECTIVE 2010/45/EU DIRECTIVE 2010/45/EU (corrigendum: 2010/53/EU) OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 7 July 2010 on standards of quality and
safety of human organs intended for transplantation

MDCG 2020-16 rev.4

Some devices can detect the same agent for completely different intended purposes than the intended purposes covered by this rule.
Where there is a foreseeable risk that tests may be misused to assess the suitability of blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs for transfusion,
transplantation or cell administration or their derivatives, a clear limitation of use should be included in the IFU and the technical documentation of
the devices.
For example: “This test device is not intended to be used to detect the presence of or exposure to or for screening for transmissible agents in blood, blood
components, cells, tissues, organs or any of their derivatives in order to assess their suitability for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration”.

EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices typically falling under this rule are those that detect agents for which the EU has clearly harmonised the donor and donation testing requirements,
as outlined in the relevant European directives.
European directives 2002/98/EC (on blood), and 2006/17/EC (on tissues and cells):
- Hepatitis B (HBs-Ag).
- Hepatitis C (Anti-HCV).
- Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1/2 (Anti-HIV 1/2).
In addition, the European directive 2006/17/EC (on tissues and cells) references Treponema pallidum and in certain circumstances, depending on the donor’s
history and the characteristics of the tissue or cells donated: Human T-Lymphotropic Virus- I; Malaria (Plasmodium spp.); Cytomegalovirus; Trypanosoma cruzi;
Epstein Barr virus; Toxoplasma gondii.
European directive 2010/45/EU (corrigendum: 2010/53/EU) (on organs) :
- Hepatitis B.
- Hepatitis C.
- Human Immunodeficiency Virus.
Member States’ national legislation may impose testing of additional transmissible agents in blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs or their
derivatives when intended for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration (for example West Nile Virus, hepatitis E virus...)
NOTE 1: devices detecting the presence of, or exposure to a transmissible agent listed above are classified in class D according to this rule only if they are
intended to be used to assess the suitability for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration of blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs, or any
of their derivatives. See intended purpose.

NOTE 2: Tests intended for detection of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease when available, would fall under this rule when intended to assess the suitability of
blood, blood components, cells, tissues or organs or their derivatives for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration.
Rule 1 second indent

Devices intended to be used for the detection of the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent that causes a lifethreatening disease with a high or suspected high risk of propagation
RATIONALE
Rule 1; second indent applies to devices which are intended to be used for the detection of the presence of or the exposure to a transmissible agent that
causes a life-threatening disease with a high or suspected high risk of propagation.
Several factors contribute to the risk of propagation of a pathogen within a population, namely:
-

the direct or in-direct transmissibility (i.e. the probability of infection when there is contact between a susceptible and an infected individual). This
includes for example consideration of the infectious dose and route of transmission e.g. aerosol, zoonosis, vector-mediated.
the contact rate of infected and susceptible individuals (i.e. the number of contacts per time), and
the duration of infectiousness.

For the purposes of this document, the risk of propagation of a pathogen within a population is considered to be the risk for the general European population.
This rule applies regardless of whether the test is a first line, confirmatory or supplemental assay.

EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended for:
-

Hepatitis B Virus.

Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic fever.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 and 2.

-

Highly virulent influenza virus.
Human T-Lymphotropic Virus I and II.
SARS CoV
MERS Coronavirus.
Smallpox virus.
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (when available).

NOTE 1: Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is considered under this rule due to the suspected high risk of propagation.
NOTE 2: The list of high-risk agents may be updated based on quantitative analysis of new scientific evidence on the incidence, pathogenicity, burden of
mortality and morbidity, and transmission dynamics of infectious agents in the population.
Rule 1 third indent

Devices intended to be used for determining the infectious load of a life-threatening disease where monitoring is critical
in the process of patient management
RATIONALE
Rule 1; third indent applies to devices intended to be used for determining the infectious load in the context of life-threatening infectious diseases, after the
disease status of the patient has been previously determined, and for which patient management options, including specific treatment, are based on
monitoring the infectious load.
Viral load is typically performed by nucleic acid amplification based tests (NAT).
In the case of Hepatitis B, the DNA viral load determined by molecular biology complies with the present rule due to its importance for the initiation of
treatment, the evaluation of the treatment efficiency and the change of treatment, if necessary. Hepatitis B antigen tests intended for monitoring are not
critical in the process of patient management and thus they do not fall under this rule.

RULE 2

Devices intended to be used for blood grouping , or to determine foeto-maternal blood group incompatibility1, or tissue
typing to ensure the immunological compatibility of blood, blood components, cells, tissue or organs that are intended for
transfusion or transplantation or cell administration, are classified as class C
except when intended to determine any of the following markers:

RATIONALE
Rule 2 applies equally to donor and recipient testing. This rule classifies blood grouping devices into two classes depending on the likelihood that a blood
group marker could cause an immunogenic response or a severe haemolytic transfusion reaction. The red blood cell markers listed in this rule are critical for
ensuring immunological compatibility and safe transfusion of blood and blood components. Devices related to these markers, either intended as screening,
diagnostic, confirmatory or supplemental devices are class D devices.
These class D devices includes those intended for:
-

The determination of the expression of ABO and Rhesus (Rh) D, Weak D, C, E, c, e in donor and recipient e.g. by serological testing or molecular
genotyping.
The determination of partial D, as these D antigen positive patients are at risk of anti-D alloimmunization.
The detection of anti-A and anti-B antibodies for reverse ABO typing, as ABO blood grouping requires both forward (antigen) and reverse (antibody)
typing.
Screening, detection or identification of red cell antibodies for the Rh system (anti RH antibodies), Kell system (anti-KEL1 antibodies), Kidd system
(anti-JK1 and anti-JK2 antibodies) and Duffy system (anti-FY1 and anti-FY2 antibodies).

RULE 3

General comment:
Rule 3 covers a range of devices as reflected in its indents (a)-(m). Devices falling under Rule 3 (when not classified as Class D according to rules 1 & 2) are to
be classified in class C, irrespective of the indent applied. It may be possible for a device to fall under more than one Rule 3 indent.

The following are in class C if they are:
(a) Devices intended for detecting the presence of, or exposure to, a sexually transmitted agent
RATIONALE
Rule 3a applies to devices detecting agents whose main mode of transmission is sexual. Sexually transmitted infections are a group of infections that may be
transmitted through vaginal, oral and anal sexual intercourse. The agents that cause sexually transmitted infections may pass from person to person through
blood, semen, vaginal or other bodily fluids.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended for the detection of:
-

Chlamydia trachomatis.
Haemophilus ducreyi.
Herpes simplex virus 1&2.
Human papilloma virus (HPV).
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

-

Mycoplasma hominis.
Mycoplasma genitalium.
Trichomonas vaginalis.
Treponema pallidum.
Ureaplasma urealyticum.
Monkeypox virus.

NOTE: Although the two parasitic diseases amebiasis and giardiasis have a main mode of transmission that is nonsexual in nature (through contact with
infected food or water, or faeces), these two parasites are still commonly transmitted by oro-anal sexual contact. Nevertheless, diagnostic devices intended
to determine intestinal infections caused by Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia would not fall under this rule as they are captured under Rule 6.

(b) Devices intended for detecting the presence in cerebrospinal fluid or blood of an infectious agent without a high or
suspected high risk of propagation
RATIONALE
Rule 3b applies to devices intended for detecting the presence of an infectious agent (either the agent itself or component thereof) e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal,
parasitic, protozoal infectious agents, specifically in specimens derived from cerebrospinal fluid or blood.
Devices intended for the detection of antibodies against the infectious agent are not covered by this rule.
Several factors contribute to the risk of propagation of a pathogen within a population, namely:
-

the direct or in-direct transmissibility (i.e. the probability of infection when there is contact between a susceptible and an infected individual). This
includes for example consideration of the infectious dose and route of transmission e.g. aerosol, zoonosis, vector-mediated.
the contact rate of infected and susceptible individuals (i.e. the number of contacts per time), and
the duration of infectiousness.

For the purposes of this document, the risk of propagation of a pathogen within a population is considered to be the risk for the general European population.
This rule applies to devices independent of the route of transmission or source of the infectious agent.
This rule also applies to microbiological media intended for the detection of relevant infectious agents in cerebrospinal fluid or blood specimen.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended for detecting the presence of:
-

Bacterial pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group B Streptococcus, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenza type B, Listeria spp., Borrelia
burgdorferi, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Fungal pathogens: Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus spp.
Viral pathogens: Herpes simplex virus 1&2, human herpes virus 6, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus, West Nile virus, chikungunya, Dengue, Zika,
hepatitis A, hepatitis E.
Parasitic pathogen: Toxoplasma gondii.
Prion agents: sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome, Kuru, Fatal Familial Insomnia.

(c) Devices intended for detecting the presence of an infectious agent, if there is a significant risk that an erroneous result
would cause death or severe disability to the individual, foetus or embryo being tested, or to the individual's offspring
RATIONALE
Rule 3c applies to devices intended for detecting the presence of an infectious agent (either the agent itself or component thereof) e.g. bacterial, viral, fungal,
parasitic, protozoal infectious agents.
Devices intended for the detection of antibodies against the infectious agent are not covered by this rule.
This rule does not have any specimen type restrictions and is applicable to specimens being tested from the individual, foetus or embryo.
This rule applies if there is a significant risk that an erroneous result would cause death or severe disability. It is the risk of death or severe disability to an
individual that must be considered. In this context, the risk of death or severe disability to the individual should take into account that an erroneous result in
a healthy individual does not carry the same risk as an erroneous result in (for example) a pregnant, immunocompromised, or vulnerable individual. This rule
also applies to an embryo or foetus being tested, or the individual’s offspring where an infectious agent can be detrimental to the viability/development of
the embryo/foetus leading to death or disability, both current and future e.g. developmental disability
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended for detecting the presence of:
-

-

Bacterial pathogens: Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Haemophilus influenzae type B meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria
meningitis (Listeria monocytogenes), Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium spp., Legionella spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, methicillin-resistant

(d) Devices intended for pre-natal screening of women in order to determine their immune status towards transmissible
agents
RATIONALE
Rule 3d applies to devices specifically intended to screen pregnant women for their immune status towards transmissible agents. These are in particular
transmissible agents that may cause infections in the embryo and foetus. The term ‘immune status’ refers to the presence, absence or level of an immune
response acquired by the women following an infection or vaccination.
Devices covered by this rule are intended for the screening of pregnant women before birth in order to identify the presence of an acquired appropriately
targeted immune response to transmissible agents. The absence of such acquired maternal protection is associated with an enhanced risk of transmission of
the agent to the embryo/foetus upon infection of the mother. These mothers may be recommended to take preventive measures.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended to determine for prenatal screening the immune status of women towards:
-

Cytomegalovirus.
Rubella virus.
Toxoplasma gondii.
Varicella zoster virus.
Zika.

(e) Devices intended for determining infective disease status or immune status, where there is a risk that an erroneous
result would lead to a patient management decision resulting in a life-threatening situation for the patient or for the
patient's offspring
RATIONALE
Rule 3e applies to devices for both the determination of the infective disease status and the determination of the immune status of a patient.
‘Determination of infective disease status’
The determination of the infective disease status provides information on the state, condition or evolution of a disease caused by an infective agent, which
may include the effectiveness of a specific treatment. In this context, the determination of the infective disease status typically involves the measurement of
infective agents, antibodies to infective agents, surrogate markers or analytes in specimens from patients.
‘Determination of immune status’
The determination of the immune status provides information on the state or condition or evolution of the immune response acquired by the patient in
relation to infection with a pathogenic agent, vaccinations, allergic, immunotoxic, autoimmune and alloimmune reactions such as transfusion reactions and
transplant rejection reactions.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended to determine:
-

Salmonella typhi in faeces, for the assessment of the carrier-status of patients.
Antibodies from lymphocyte secretions immunoassay intended for the detection of active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
Quantitative virus-specific NAT tests (e.g. Cytomegalovirus, John Cunningham virus, Adenovirus, Enterovirus) to monitor an immunocompromised
patient’s (e.g. transplant patient) response to antiviral therapy.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus specific polymerase chain reaction assay for pre-surgical screening of patients
to determine nasal carriage.
Assays intended for the detection of IgM antibodies against rubella virus to identify an acute infection in pregnant women in order to determine
whether specific treatment is necessary for protecting the foetus from virus-induced damage due to a lack of previously acquired immunity.
Assays intended for the detection of IgM antibodies against HEV.
Enzyme immunoassay intended for the quantitation of intrathecal antibodies against rubella virus in the diagnosis of rubella virus-induced

(f) Devices intended to be used as companion diagnostics
RATIONALE
Rule 3f applies to devices intended to be used as companion diagnostics.
‘Companion diagnostic’ (CDx) is defined in Article 2(7) as a device which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding medicinal product to:
a) identify, before and/or during treatment, patients who are most likely to benefit from the corresponding medicinal product; or
b) identify, before and/or during treatment, patients likely to be at increased risk of serious adverse reactions as a result of treatment with the
corresponding medicinal product.
For a device to be defined as a CDx, there should be a link to a medicinal product with an International Non-proprietary Name (INN)6.
The identification of patients may comprise a quantitative or qualitative determination of specific markers. Such specific markers can be present in healthy
subjects and/or in patients.
The emphasis ‘before and/or during treatment’ implies that CDxs may be intended to be applied before a treatment with a corresponding medicinal product
is initiated, or during treatment, to identify if (still) the patient is (a) likely to benefit from the corresponding medicinal product or (b) likely to be at increased
risk of serious adverse reactions.
Devices that are intended to be used for monitoring treatment with a medicinal product in order to ensure that the concentration of relevant substances in
the human body is within the therapeutic window are not considered to be CDxs (e.g. devices intended for blood glucose monitoring, devices intended for
measurement of cyclosporine concentration in blood, devices intended for measurement of metabolites of a medicinal product).
Devices intended to determine quantitative or qualitative specific marker(s) to establish the dosage of a particular medicinal product, for patients that are
already eligible to receive that medicinal product, are not considered to be CDxs. For example, devices intended to measure creatinine concentration can be
used for estimating kidney function to determine the optimal dosage of medicinal products with renal elimination. Another example is devices identifying
CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 genotypes of a patient to determine the appropriate dosage of an already prescribed medication.
Annex II to this guidance provides a flowchart to help determine whether an IVD is a CDx.
6 The IVDR requires the INN to be provided in the instructions for use of the CDx. In case several INNs are linked to a single CDx, all INNs should be listed in

the IFU.

treatment with enasidenib.
A device intended for the demonstration of individuals homozygous for the non-functional DPYD variant DPYD*2A, that typically have complete
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. The DPYD gene encodes DPD, an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in fluorouracil
metabolism. Capecitabine, a chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of colon cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, and metastatic breast cancer,
is a prodrug that is enzymatically converted to its active form, fluorouracil. Individuals who are carriers of non-functional DPYD variants, may not be
able to metabolise capecitabine at normal rates, and are at risk of potentially life-threatening capecitabine toxicity, such as bone marrow suppression
and neurotoxicity.

(g) Devices intended to be used for disease staging, where there is a risk that an erroneous result would lead to a patient
management decision resulting in a life-threatening situation for the patient or for the patient's offspring
RATIONALE
Rule 3g applies to devices where the intended purpose is for the staging of a disease.
Disease staging involves the determination of distinct phases or periods in the course of a disease, or the level of severity of a disease that can be assessed
by, for example, the life history of an individual, organism, markers or any biological or physiological process. The purpose of disease staging is to provide
information with respect to patient management, the appropriateness and accuracy of treatment decisions, and/or for prognosis or prediction.
For the majority of diseases, determination of disease stage involves taking into account the complete clinical picture which may involve investigative
procedures, examining the patient/patient history and measurement of markers or analytes in patient specimens.
This rule applies to devices where the information provided from the device is intended to be used for disease staging and where the patient management
decision, being solely or principally based on an erroneous result, has the potential to result in a life-threatening situation.
This rule does not include:
- Devices for the staging of cancer as these devices are classified under rule 3h.
- Devices where the result is not intended to be used for staging a particular disease e.g. markers which are indicative of the presence of an affected
health condition in general.

(h) Devices intended to be used in screening, diagnosis, or staging of cancer
RATIONALE
Rule 3h applies to devices with the specific intended purpose to be used in screening, diagnosis or staging of cancer.
‘Cancer’ is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. It can affect almost any part of the body. The growths often invade surrounding tissue and can
metastasise to distant sites. Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases characterised by the growth of abnormal cells which can invade nearby
tissues and may spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. Other common terms used are ‘malignant tumours’ and ‘malignant
neoplasms’.
The scope of this rule is limited to cancer. Two distinct cases should be considered:
1. Cancer is a term for diseases (including malignant neoplasia or malignant tumours) characterised by abnormal cells which divide without control and
invade nearby tissues. Additionally, these cells can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems, in the process that
leads to the development of secondary tumours or metastases. Many cancers form solid tumours, which are masses of tissue. Cancers of the blood,
such as leukaemia, generally do not form solid tumours.
2. Cells may present hyperplasia (increased density of cells) and dysplasia (abnormal appearance) or form a carcinoma in situ (no invasion of nearby
tissues). These precancerous or premalignant cells may or may not develop into cancer.
This rule applies to devices for both cancerous and precancerous conditions, where the devices are intended to be used in screening, diagnosis, or staging
of cancer.
Disease staging involves the determination of distinct phases or periods in the course of a disease, or level of severity of a disease that can be assessed by,
for example, the life history of an individual, organism, markers or any biological or physiological process. The purpose of disease staging is to provide
information with respect to patient management, the appropriateness and accuracy of treatment decisions, and/or for prognosis or prediction.
Non-malignant neoplasms or non-malignant tumours do not spread into, or invade, nearby tissues. Therefore, they do not fulfil the criteria of cancer. These
benign tumours may grow larger, and the growth tends to be slow.
Devices that are intended to be used in screening, diagnosis, or staging of cancer, may have the following functions: screening, patient management,
monitoring, diagnosis or aid to diagnosis, prognosis and prediction.

(i) Devices intended for human genetic testing
RATIONALE
Rule 3i applies to devices for human genetic testing. Genetic testing involves the detection of specific alleles, mutations, genotypes, karyotypes or epigenetic
changes that are associated with heritable traits, diseases or predispositions to disease for the individual or their descendants.
Several methods can be used for genetic testing (for example) 7:
-

Molecular genetic tests (or gene tests) study single genes or short lengths of DNA to identify its constitution, or variations or mutations that lead
to a genetic disorder.
Chromosomal genetic tests analyse whole chromosomes or long lengths of DNA to see if there are large genetic changes, such as an extra copy of
a chromosome which causes a genetic condition.

The results of a genetic test can provide a medical status, confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or determine a person’s chance of developing or
passing on a genetic disorder.
Some examples include devices intended for:
-

-

Newborn Screening: Newborn screening is used just after birth to identify genetic disorders, to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions. Such
early detection allows treatment to begin immediately, which can reduce or eliminate the effects of the condition.
Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic testing is used to identify or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition.
Carrier testing: Carrier testing is used to identify people who carry one copy of a gene mutation that could result in a genetic disorder in one’s
offspring. For some genetic disorders, two copies of the gene mutation are required to cause the genetic disorder (autosomal recessive). Whereas
for others, one copy of the gene mutation is required either i) in the absence of a second normal copy resulting in the genetic disorder (X-Linked
recessive) or ii) in the presence of a normal copy can result in a genetic disorder (autosomal dominant). This type of testing provides information
about a couple's risk of having a child with a genetic condition.
Prenatal testing: Prenatal testing is used to detect changes in a foetus's genes or chromosomes before birth.
Preimplantation testing: Preimplantation testing, also called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), is a specialised technique used to detect
genetic changes in embryos obtained through in vitro fertilisation.

7

On the topic of biochemical genetic tests, according to the wording of rule 3i, it was determined that these tests may be classified by this indent but may be better classified
under other rule indents depending on the intended purpose. Biochemical genetic tests are considered to be tests which provide information on the amount or activity level of
proteins; where abnormalities in these proteins result from a genetic disorder, for example, for inborn errors of metabolism.

Predictive and presymptomatic testing: Predictive and presymptomatic types of testing are used to detect gene mutations associated with
disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's risk of developing disorders with
a genetic basis. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a late-onset genetic disorder.
Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing: genetic testing provided through advertising and selling or (free) provision of genetic tests directly to
consumers.

(j) Devices intended for monitoring of levels of medicinal products, substances or biological components, when there is a
risk that an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in a life-threatening situation for the
patient or for the patient's offspring
RATIONALE
Rule 3j applies to devices intended to monitor an analyte with the purpose of adjusting patient management, such as treatments/interventions, as required
i.e. it is intended to be used for observing, checking, or keeping a record of the level, activity, presence, absence etc. of an analyte.
Monitoring tests may be intended to evaluate an individual’s current state and/or changes in an individual’s state. This is likely to be achieved by repeated or
multiple determinations of an analyte over time, at appropriate intervals. These devices are intended to determine whether results are within expectation, for
the detection/assessment of disease progression/regression, disease recurrence, minimum residual disease, response/resistance to therapy, and/or adverse
effects due to therapy.
This rule does not apply to devices intended to be used in the diagnosis or screening of a condition where only a single measurement is required for this
purpose, but would apply to diagnostic tests where multiple/serial measurements over time are intended by the manufacturer and where an erroneous result
may result in a life threatening situation for the patient or their offspring e.g. when monitoring the change in concentration of a biological compound over
time to aid diagnosis, such as with troponin to help determine an acute cardiac event.
Rule 3j is also applicable to the monitoring of non-life threatening conditions. It covers a wide range of analytes where the device provides an important,
critical, or sole determinant for the correct patient management decision and an erroneous result may result in the life of the patient or patient’s offspring
being at risk due to inappropriate treatment decisions.
Analytes measured by devices intended for monitoring may be medicinal products (Article 1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended), substances (drug,
chemical, or biological entity/component) or biological components (pertaining to living organisms, or components of a living organism – this would include
for example: antibodies, endogenous markers, platelets, cord blood, bone marrow, stem cells etc).
If the device is intended for a specific intended target population (e.g. paediatrics, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, etc.) then the risk to
this population should be taken into account when determining if there is a risk that an erroneous result would lead to a patient management decision
resulting in a life-threatening situation for the patient or their offspring.
With respect to the patient’s offspring, the viability/development of the embryo/foetus, both current and future shall be taken into account.

(k) Devices intended for management of patients suffering from a life-threatening disease or condition
RATIONALE
Rule 3k applies to devices intended for patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases or conditions.
The device provides an important, critical, or sole determinant for the correct patient management decision, and provides information for the purpose of
patient management, such as treatments/interventions, as required.
The classification of these devices is primarily based on the life-threatening nature of the disease or condition and the impact of the provided information on
patient management (e.g. determining an initial course of therapy or erroneous decision resulting in life-threatening harm to the patient). This includes
devices intended to detect drug resistant pathogens associated with a life-threatening condition (e.g. sepsis, necrosing skin or tissue condition) directly from
collected specimen such as blood, skin or tissues, in order to take a patient management decision. However, rule 3k does not apply to devices used in
conjunction with microbiological culture methods that are only intended to test drug resistance of an already detected pathogen including drug sensitivity
testing such as sensitivity discs and tablets or Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) panels, where such devices are not intended for the management of
patients suffering from a life-threatening infection.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
Devices intended for:
-

-

(m) Devices intended for screening for congenital disorders in new-born babies where failure to detect and treat such
disorders could lead to life-threatening situations or severe disabilities
RATIONALE
Rule 3m applies to devices intended for screening new-born babies for a defect which is present from birth i.e. a structural or functional abnormalities,
including metabolic disorders, where an erroneous result could lead to a failure to detect and treat such birth disorders, which could lead to a lifethreatening situation or severe disability of the individual. This includes genetic testing where the intended purpose covers screening for congenital
disorders in neonates.
This rule applies to devices intended to be used for screening8 new-born babies shortly after birth for disorders that are treatable, but not clinically evident
in the new-born period. Some of the conditions included in new-born screening are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done.
New-born babies who screen positive undergo further testing to confirm whether they are affected with a congenital disorder. For these confirmatory and
supplemental devices, and for congenital disorders that are clinically evident, in particular rules 3j and 3k shall be taken into consideration.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)

(b) Devices intended for near-patient testing are classified in their own right
RATIONALE
Rule 4b applies to devices intended for near-patient testing. The classification of devices for near-patient testing follows the intended purpose of the device,
as established by the manufacturer. This brings the classification of devices for near-patient testing in line with that of other devices intended for professional
use. The manufacturer should check all the rules to determine the correct device classification.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
For the below examples, the device is intended for near-patient testing:
-

Class D (under Rule 1): Rapid test for detection of human immunodeficiency virus.
Class D (under Rule 2): Pre-transfusion ABO compatibility test cards intended to be used at the recipients' bedside as precaution against ABOincompatible transfusion.

RULE 5

The following devices are classified as class A:
(a) Products for general laboratory use, accessories which possess no critical characteristics, buffer solutions, washing
solutions, and general culture media and histological stains, intended by the manufacturer to make them suitable for in
vitro diagnostic procedures relating to a specific examination
RATIONALE
Rule 5a applies to general laboratory products like pipettes, stain powders, glass microscope slides, centrifuges, pipette tips or instrument liquid collection
containers, buffers which usually do not fall under the definition of an IVD medical device. However, as specified in Regulation (EU) 2017/746 Article 1 (3a)
’This regulation does not apply to (a) products for general laboratory use (...), unless such products, in view (...) are specifically intended by their manufacturer to
be used for in vitro diagnostic examinations.’
As a consequence, if such products are specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for in vitro diagnostic examinations, then they are considered as
IVDs and are captured by rule 5.
'Accessory for an in vitro diagnostic medical device' as defined under Regulation (EU) 2017/746 article 2 (4), ‘means an article which, whilst not being itself an
in vitro diagnostic medical device, is intended by its manufacturer to be used together with one or several particular in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) to
specifically enable the in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) to be used in accordance with its/their intended purpose(s) or to specifically and directly assist the
medical functionality of the in vitro diagnostic medical device(s) in terms of its/their intended purpose(s)’.
Whilst not being an IVD in themselves, accessories are to be used in conjunction with a specific IVD. They possess one or more specific characteristics to
specifically enable an IVD to be used in accordance with its intended purpose or to assist the medical functionality of the IVD. Accessories are mentioned in
rule 5 (a) in combination with the attribute ‘accessories which possess no critical characteristics’. This emphasizes that such products can negatively influence
the benefit-risk ratio of the entire in vitro diagnostic medical device.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
-

General microbiological culture media containing selecting agents, antimicrobial chromogenic agents, chemical indicators for colour differentiation.

-

Solutions like cleaners, buffer solutions, lysing solutions, diluents specified for use with an IVD.

-

General reagents (not assay specific) used with a Class A instrument, e.g. general sequencing consumable reagents used with a sequencer.

(b) Instruments intended by the manufacturer specifically to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures
RATIONALE
Rule 5b applies to instruments specifically intended by the manufacturer for in vitro diagnostic procedures. These instruments are classified as class A, whereas
reagents and kits are classified in their own right.
Due to their interdependence, the performance of the reagent on this instrument will be part of the conformity assessment of the reagent. If the instrument
has an independent measuring function which does not use any additional reagents, it is classified according to the intended purpose of the analysis (including
instruments controls or instrument quality control). e.g. cell counting analysers used in haematology, ion selective electrodes, instruments measuring blood
gases or glucose via its sensors, specific gravity measurements in urine analysis, mass spectrophotometer for bacteria identification, erythrocyte sedimentation
rate analyser etc.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
-

Enzyme immunoassay analyser, PCR thermocycler, sequencer for NGS applications, clinical chemistry analyser.

-

(c) Specimen receptacles
RATIONALE

Specimen receptacles are specimen containers or evacuated or non-evacuated tubes, empty or prefilled with a fixative solution or other general reagent
intended for primary containment, preservation, transport and storage of biological specimens (e.g. cells, tissues specimens, urine, faeces) for the
purpose of in vitro diagnostic examinations. They are classified in class A.

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2020-16 rev.4

In line with their definition in Article 2(3) of the IVDR, specimen receptacles are intended for the primary containment and preservation of specimens, i.e.
they cannot have any integrated testing functions.
Specimen receptacles may be placed on the market as standalone devices, but also as part of a kit intended for specimen collection or as part of a kit
intended for testing.
Kits intended for specimen collection must include at least one IVD (specimen receptacle). The kit may also include devices other than IVDs, such as a
medical device or components which are covered neither by the IVDR nor by the MDR.
The use of specimen receptacles or kits intended for specimen collection may require an action performed by the user to collect the specimen, such as
mouth wash or gargling, or an action on the specimen to ensure specimen integrity and stability, according to the IFU, such as pipetting or buffer addition
(i.e. actions which are not part of the testing procedure).
Kits intended for specimen collection are classified according to the kit’s intended purpose and implementing rule 1.9. Typically these kits are classified as
class A as they contain a specimen receptacle (class A) and other possible IVD components likely to be class A (e.g. buffers).
Specimen receptacles and kits intended for specimen collection may be components of a kit intended for testing. They may be CE-marked and classified
in their own right according to their intended purpose. The whole kit intended for testing is classified according to implementing rules 1.8 and 1.9: the
intended purpose of the kit will determine its classification.
Specimen receptacles and kits intended for specimen collection may be placed on the market separately but intended by the manufacturer to be used in
combination with another IVD. In this case implementing rule 1.2 applies: the specimen receptacle or kit intended for specimen collection and the other
IVD should be classified independently.
Regarding specimen receptacles and kits intended for specimen collection intended to be used by lay persons:
-

Specimen receptacles or kits intended for specimen collection intended for lay persons and placed on the market separately from the testing device
are not considered devices for self-testing.

-

A specimen receptacle or a kit intended for specimen collection may be a component of a kit intended for testing in which the lay person not only
collects the specimen but also performs one or more actions that are part of the testing procedure. In this case, the whole kit intended for testing is
considered a device for self-testing (see Rule 4). As components of the kit intended for testing, the specimen receptacle or specimen collection kit

may be CE-marked and classified in their own right according to their intended purpose and would not themselves be considered devices for selftesting.
As a reminder, according to Article 1(3)(b), invasive sampling products or products which are directly applied to the human body for the purpose of obtaining
a specimen are themselves not IVDs.
EXAMPLES (non-exhaustive)
- A standalone urine collection cup, a stool container, a saliva collection tube or a blood spot collection card (e.g. specimen collection via finger-prick)
intended for subsequent in vitro diagnostic examination are in class A.
- Standalone kits intended for the collection of saliva by the lay person for the purpose of detection of SARS-CoV-2 (by another device placed on the
market separately) are in class A.
- Standalone kits intended for the collection of stool by the lay person for the purpose of faecal occult blood detection in colorectal cancer screening
by a professional laboratory (with another device placed on the market separately), including a paper sheet to collect stool, a plastic stick to collect
samples and a pre-filled tube for conservation and transport are in class A.

RULE 6
Devices not covered by the above-mentioned classification rules are classified as class B
RATIONALE
Rule 6 applies to devices not covered by rules 1-5.
An erroneous result with these devices is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on patient outcome, cause death or severe disability or put the
individual in immediate danger.
Depending on the intended purpose, this rule would likely capture clinical chemistry tests for hormones, vitamins, enzymes, metabolic markers, electrolytes
and substrates as well as the majority of anatomic pathology immunohistochemical assays. It also includes IVDs that detect infectious agents that present a
moderate risk to the individual. In case of changes in the epidemiological context, for example, a new strain of infectious agent listed below, classification
rules 1 or 3 could become applicable and the class of the device revised.

o Class B (Rule 6) where the blood gas analyser directly measures a parameter from a specimen (in the absence of a reagent or disposable sensor
cassette) AND where an erroneous result in a measured parameter WILL NOT LEAD TO a patient management decision resulting in a lifethreatening situation.
o Class A (Rule 5b) where the analyser does not directly measure a parameter from a specimen, rather the specimen is analysed using replaceable
sensor cassette / reagents.

•

Sensor cassette / reagents are classified as either
o Class C (rule 3j) where the blood gas analyser examines a specimen using replaceable sensor cassette / reagents AND where these sensor cassette
/reagents measure at least one parameter where an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in a life threatening
situation.
o Class B (Rule 6) where the blood gas analyser examines a specimen using replaceable sensor cassette / reagents AND where these sensor
cassette/reagents DO NOT measure any parameter where an erroneous result will lead to a patient management decision resulting in a lifethreatening situation.

•

Solution pack is classified as either
o Class C (Rule 3j) where the solution pack possesses critical characteristics and contains reagents which are integral to the measurement of an analyte
AND where an erroneous result for this analyte WILL LEAD to a patient management decision resulting in a life threatening situation.
o Class B (Rule 6) where the solution pack possesses critical characteristics and contains reagents which are integral to the measurement of an analyte
AND where an erroneous result for this analyte WILL NOT LEAD to a patient management decision resulting in a life threatening situation.
o Class A (Rule 5a) where the solution pack is used in conjunction with the analyser and the solution pack does not possess any critical characteristics
and does not contain any reagents which are integral to the measurement of an analyte.

Calibrators are classified in the same class as the device. Calibrators which are used to calibrate the response of the sensor cassette/ reagents are
classified as
o Class B or C depending on the classification of the device (sensor cassette/reagent) being calibrated.
NOTE: Where calibrators are used to calibrate the response of an analyser and where the analyser directly measures the specimen without the use of
any additional disposable sensor cassette/reagent then the calibrator is the same class as the analyser.

•

Controls are classified in the same class as the device they are acting as control for e.g. the sensor cassette/reagent or the analyser.
o Where the control does not have any quantitative or qualitative assigned value it is classified as Class B under rule 7.
NOTE: Where controls are used for the purposes of assessing the response of an analyser and where the analyser directly measures the specimen
without the use of any additional disposable sensor cassette/reagents then the control is in the same class as the analyser.
