1. Introduction
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) establishes
the requirements for notified bodies involved in the conformity assessment of
applicable classes of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs). Manufacturers must
demonstrate that the devices conform to relevant requirements based upon objective
evidence and analysis.
In accordance with these conformity assessment procedures1, in addition to quality
management system and technical documentation assessments, notified bodies are
required to verify product batches of class D IVDs in line with Annexes IX and XI of the
IVDR. Therefore, in order to verify the conformity of class D IVDs, manufacturers
should forward to notified bodies the reports on tests carried out on each manufactured
batch of class D devices 2. Furthermore, the manufacturer should make available
samples of manufactured class D devices or batches of devices to the notified body in
accordance with pre-agreed conditions and detailed arrangements. The notified body
involved in the conformity assessment of class D IVDs should request one of the EU
reference laboratories (EURLs), if designated by the European Commission 3, to carry
out batch testing on those devices. The EURL should, in turn, inform the notified body
about its findings. Following this verification procedure, manufacturers may place class
D IVDs on the market unless the notified body communicates to the manufacturer
within an agreed timeframe, but not later than 30 days after reception of the samples,
any other decision 4. In the absence of a designated EURL for a device, the
requirements relating to EURLs do not have to be applied.

2. Scope
This document aims to provide guidance to notified bodies to clarify their role and
responsibilities in relation to samples of manufactured class D devices or batches of
devices in accordance with Annexes IX and XI of the IVDR.
This guidance also describes best practices for notified bodies in performing conformity
assessment procedures relating to the verification of manufactured class D IVDs. It
also includes guidance on:

the content of the required pre-agreed conditions and detailed arrangements 5
between the notified body and the manufacturer,
guidance on the frequency of samples of devices or batches of devices to be
sent to the EURL 6.

It is understood that the IVDR requirements related to testing every product batch, and
consequently this guidance document, are relevant for devices for which the concept
of batches is applicable. For example, the concept of batches is not applicable for
medical device software. Therefore, the corresponding IVDR batch testing
requirements and this guidance document are not relevant to class D medical device
software.

3. Definitions
3.1. Class D IVDs
The IVDR refers to class D devices in rules 1 and 2 of Annex VIII as follows:
Devices intended to be used for the following purposes are classified as class D:
- detection of the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent in blood, blood
components, cells, tissues or organs, or in any of their derivatives, in order to
assess their suitability for transfusion, transplantation or cell administration;
- detection of the presence of, or exposure to, a transmissible agent that causes a
life-threatening disease with a high or suspected high risk of propagation;
- determining the infectious load of a life-threatening disease where monitoring is
critical in the process of patient management.
[IVDR, Article 47(I) & Annex VIII Section 2 Rule 1]
Devices intended to be used for blood grouping, or to determine foeto-maternal blood
group incompatibility, or for tissue typing to ensure the immunological compatibility of
blood, blood components, cells, tissue or organs that are intended for transfusion or
transplantation or cell administration, are classified as class C, except when intended
to determine any of the following markers:
ABO system [A (ABO1), B (ABO2), AB (ABO3)];
Rhesus system [RH1 (D), RHW1, RH2 (C), RH3 (E), RH4 (c), RH5 (e)];
Kell system [Kel1 (K)];
Kidd system [JK1 (Jka), JK2 (Jkb)];
Duffy system [FY1 (Fya), FY2 (Fyb)]

The verification process
The establishment of a test plan identifying all relevant and critical parameters
which need to be tested for the device, including decision making criteria for
success or failure of the batch
The provision for the reaching of an agreement with the manufacturer concerning
when and where the necessary sample or batch testing has to be performed

-

An agreement on the batch verification arrangements should be in place between the
notified body and the manufacturer of the class D IVD. In addition, provided that a
EURL is designated for this device, the notified body should also make arrangements
with the EURL for the testing of the device.
The notified body should draw up a testing plan for the device to be provided to the
EURL (see also section 4.1.2 below). This plan should be based upon the results of
the notified body's conformity assessment, the performance verification opinion of an
EURL 9, as well as, any other relevant information from the manufacturer and the
EURL. The EURL may propose justified changes based on its scientific expertise. The
testing plan is then agreed between the notified body and the EURL. It should be
included in the agreement between the notified body and the manufacturer, and in the
written contract between the notified body and the EURL. It should be noted that
EURLs are independent scientific and testing bodies designated by the Commission
for the purposes defined in IVDR. Therefore, EURLs should not be considered as
subcontractors to notified bodies in the same sense as other testing laboratories.
4.1. Pre-Agreed Conditions and Detailed Arrangements
The performance of a class D IVD will usually have already been verified by a EURL
for that device 10. The verification of manufactured batches will typically be arranged
with the same EURL. Nevertheless, a different EURL designated with the applicable
scope and equipment may be chosen. In the case of several EURLs available for a
certain device, the notified body should decide (following consultation with the
manufacturer) which EURL is most appropriate to perform the batch verification.
Factors to be considered include, for example, the product range of the manufacturer
(due to other class D devices to be tested), sample logistics as well as language or
other issues which may affect the choice of EURL.
4.1.1. Agreement between the notified body and the manufacturer
The agreement between the notified body and the manufacturer should include at least
the following:
- Test plan, as approved by the EURL
o Relevant and critical parameters to be tested
o Samples to be tested

Testing fees according to the price list of the EURL
Contact information for communication between the notified body and the EURL

The manufacturer may have agreements directly with an EURL for aspects such as
logistics of shipment of instruments and samples or responsibility for the equipment,
under the oversight of the notified body.

5. The provision of samples to the EU reference laboratory
The notified body is required to have procedures detailing criteria to determine which
products will be made available to the EURL and with which frequency.
The frequency of sending samples of batches to the EURL should be based upon the
general principle that the higher impact of device failure, the higher number of batches
has to be tested.
When determining the frequency of sending samples of batches to the EURL
consideration should be given to the relative risk/impact of the device based on the
type of intended use, in accordance with the table below:

-

Transmissible Agents
(in order of decreasing risk)
First-line assays falling under the first indent of rule 1 section 2 Annex VIII:
“detection of the presence of, or
exposure to, a transmissible agent in blood, blood components, cells,
tissues or organs, or in any of their derivatives, in order to assess their
suitability
for
transfusion,
transplantation or cell administration”

-

First-line assays falling under the
second indent of rule 1 section 2

“determining the infectious load of a
life-threatening
disease
where
monitoring is critical in the process of
patient management.”
Table 1: Relative risk of class D IVDs
5.1. Determining the initial number of samples of manufactured class D devices
or batches of devices to be sent to the EURLs
For first-line assays falling under the first indent of rule 1 section 2 Annex VIII every
batch has to be tested.
For other devices, the number of batches to be initially tested should be determined by
the notified body. The notified body will take into account the batch-testing regime
defined by the manufacturer and the views expressed in the scientific opinion of the
EURL, and, where applicable, the views expressed by the experts consulted pursuant
to Article 48(6) following tables 2-3 below. This number should also be pre-agreed with
the EURL. The number may be determined using a risk-based approach based upon
a risk analysis developed by the manufacturer and verified by the notified body. This
analysis may take the following parameters into account (not an exhaustive list):
-

Number of batches produced per year
Batch release data from previous lots
Design and technology of the device
Any changes that may have an effect on the verification of manufactured
batches. This may include changes to manufacturing, equipment, quality
control, transport or storage
Devices with short expiry date (e.g. for blood group tests)
Batch size

Within a batch, the number of samples to be tested also has to be defined and preagreed with the aforementioned three parties.
5.2. Re-assessment of the testing frequency
With a demonstrated history of appropriate performance the notified body, in
collaboration with the EURL, could agree to the frequency of testing being reduced.
Therefore, the notified body should regularly review the manufacturer's risk analysis,
the conclusions of which may lead to a modification of the testing frequency. Any
adaptations to the testing frequency should be appropriately documented and justified
by the notified body taking at least the following into account:
- Batch release data from the manufacturer and EURL
- Manufacturers' quality control release system
- Information related to production process changes
- Post market surveillance data

Note: Calibrators and controls placed on the market separately should follow the
testing frequency of the corresponding device(s)/reagent(s). Device/reagent-specific
controls placed on the market separately and intended for use with IVDs falling in the
first indent of rule 1 in Annex VIII of the IVDR may follow the adjustable testing
frequency set out in the second line of Table 2.

6. Notified body verification of batches of Class D IVDs
Notified bodies are responsible for conducting the verification of batches of
manufactured class D IVDs 13 that is performed following review of the manufacturer's
QC release data and the findings from the EURL.
In relation to the review of the manufacturer's QC test reports from each batch 14, the
minimum aspects to be checked by the notified body are as follows:
- Verification based on relevant raw data (Data output plus indicating
valid/invalid/passed/not passed)
- In case of blind testing, verification that the results provided by manufacturer
are in accordance with expected results
- The decision making criteria for success or failure of the batch
The notified body should clearly document the outcome of its assessment of the
manufacturer's data and EURL’s findings.
The notified body and the manufacturer will have agreed a timeframe (of not later than
30 calendar days after reception of the samples 15) for the communication of the
decision of the notified body or any condition imposed by the notified body. Following
this verification procedure, manufacturers may place class D IVDs on the market
unless the notified body communicates to the manufacturer within this agreed
timeframe of any other decision 16.
