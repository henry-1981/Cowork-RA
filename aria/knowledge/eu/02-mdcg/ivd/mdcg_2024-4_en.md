Introduction

Safety reporting in performance studies of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDs) shall be
performed in line with the requirements of Article 76(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 – In Vitro
Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR):
The sponsor shall report without delay to all Member States in which a performance study is being
conducted all of the following by means of the electronic system referred to in IVDR Article 69:
a) any serious adverse event that has a causal relationship with the device, the comparator
or the study procedure or where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;
b) any device deficiency that might have led to a serious adverse event if appropriate action
had not been taken, intervention had not occurred, or circumstances had been less
fortunate;
c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in points a) and b).
The period for reporting shall take account of the severity of the event. Where necessary to ensure
timely reporting, the sponsor may submit an initial report that is incomplete followed up by a
complete report.
Upon request by any Member State in which the performance study is being conducted, the
sponsor shall provide all information referred to in paragraph 1 of IVDR Article 76(1).
For post-market performance follow-up (PMPF) studies of CE marked devices1 used within the
intended purpose covered by the CE marking, reporting requirements of IVDR Articles 76(5-6)
apply. This means that the vigilance provisions laid down in IVDR Articles 82 to 85 and in the acts
adopted pursuant to IVDR Article 86 apply to PMPF studies. However, this guidance document is
still relevant for PMPF studies as the reporting of serious adverse events (SAEs) where a causal
relationship to the preceding PMPF study has been established follow the reporting procedures
of performance studies as outlined in IVDR Article 76.

Since the electronic system referred to in IVDR Article 69 (Eudamed and its module for clinical
investigations and performance studies) is not yet available and fully functional from the date of
application of the IVDR, this guidance outlines the procedures for safety reporting in
performance studies in the absence of the Eudamed module or when Eudamed is not yet fully
functional (see also sections 5.1 and 5.2 in this guidance).
This document defines SAE reporting modalities and includes a summary tabulation reporting
format.

Scope

2.1 Performance studies of in vitro diagnostic medical devices
The reporting modalities and format set out in this guidance apply to:
• Performance studies covered by IVDR Article 58(1):
• in which surgically invasive sample-taking is done only for the purpose of the
performance study;
• that is an interventional clinical performance study as defined in IVDR Article
2(46);
• where the conduct of the study involves additional invasive procedures or other
risks for the subjects of the studies;
• performance studies covered by IVDR Article 58(2) involving companion diagnostics
(except when only using left-over samples);
• PMPF studies covered by IVDR Article 70(1) that involve procedures additional to those
performed under the normal conditions of use of the IVD and where those additional
procedures are invasive or burdensome, in case a causal relationship between a SAE and
the preceding performance study has been established;
• performance studies covered by IVDR Article 70(2) that are conducted to assess, outside
the scope of its intended purpose, an IVD that already bears the CE marking.2
• combined studies of medicinal products and IVDs. When the study satisfies the definition
of a performance study of an IVD, regardless of whether it is conducted in the context of
a clinical trial of a medicinal product, the requirements of the IVDR and including its safety
reporting obligations apply to the study. This guidance document is then relevant for
compliance with the IVDR regarding safety reporting. MDCG 2022-10 provides further
guidance on the interface between Regulation (EU) 536/2014 on clinical trials for
medicinal products for human use (CTR) and the IVDR.

Reporting method

The template of the Summary Reporting Form4 in the appendix should be used for all studies
from 26 May 2022. The tabular form in the appendix needs to be filled in/updated for each
reportable event or for new findings/updates to already reported events. It shall be transmitted
to all national competent authorities (NCAs) where the PS is being performed. For a new finding
or update, the line of the SAE needs to be updated and the first column set to “m”. Write the
new findings in the free description of event column and highlight the additions. When
applicable, update the others columns as well.
For more details on how to complete the form, see section 11. Reporting form.

5.1 Reportable events in pre-market PS initiated under directives legislation
Any SAE or DD that may (have) lead to a SAE occurring in a PS after 26 May 2022, regardless of
when the PS started, should be reported in accordance with Article 76 of the IVDR.5

5.2 Transition to reporting via Eudamed
Once Eudamed is fully functional, the obligations and requirements that relate to safety reporting
via Eudamed shall apply. Full functionality of Eudamed shall start from six months after the date
of publication of the notice referred to in IVDR Article 34(3) of the MDR.

4

National provisions can apply

5

National requirements may apply to PS that commenced under the IVDD.

MDCG 2024-4

5.2.1 Ongoing events at time of transition to Eudamed
It is acknowledged that at the time of transition to reporting via Eudamed, there will be ongoing
events for which initial reports have been made according to the procedures described in this
document. For these reportable events, follow-up and final reports will be submitted to the NCAs
by the same procedure, but all new reportable events shall be entered in Eudamed.
Whether retrospective uploading of previous event reports to Eudamed will be possible is not
clear at the time this guidance is issued.

5.3 Overview of formats to be used by sponsors when reporting to NCAs
From 26 May 2022 and until
Eudamed is available.
When Eudamed is available
but not yet mandatory and
until the timepoint when
Eudamed
becomes
mandatory.
When
Eudamed
is
mandatory, i.e. from the
date corresponding to six
months after the date of
publication of the notice
referred to in MDR Article
34(3).

The tabular format of this guidance (Appendix- Summary Reporting
Form) should be used.
Either the tabular format of this guidance (Appendix- Summary
Reporting Form) or the Eudamed web form can be used.
Note: Once the shift to Eudamed reporting has been made for a specific
PS, Eudamed should continue to be used for reporting all new events
and updates to those events throughout the remainder of the study.
Web form via Eudamed shall be used for all new events, and updates to
those events.
The tabular format of this guidance (Appendix- Summary Reporting
Form) can be used only to transmit follow-up reports/final reports to
the NCAs on events which were initially reported in this format.

5.4 Collecting reports from investigators
The format in which sponsors wish to receive single event reports from investigators will be up
to the sponsor to design and they may be adapted to an individual PS. When sponsors design
such reporting forms, they should consult this guidance document to ensure all relevant details
are captured in the reports from the investigator, so that the sponsors can fulfil their reporting
obligations.

Reportable events

For the purpose of this guidance and based on the definitions above, the following events
are considered reportable events in accordance with IVDR Article 76(2):
a) any SAE that has a causal relationship with the device6, the comparator7 or the study
procedure or where such causal relationship is reasonably possible;
6
7

Device= device for performance study.
A comparator might be: other CE-marked IVD, reference method, gold standard,…

Page 10 of 23

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-4

b) any DD that might have led to a SAE if appropriate action had not been taken, intervention
had not occurred, or circumstances had been less fortunate;
c) any new findings in relation to any event referred to in points a) and b).
From the definition above, it also follows that SAEs related to a CE marked IVD which is part of a
PS with an IVD for PS (for example a CE marked comparator IVD or a CE marked IVD that is used
during the study procedure) are reportable if there is a causal (or reasonably possible)
relationship to that IVD. The reporting procedures described in this guide should then be
followed by the PS sponsor, in addition to the normal vigilance reporting for CE marked devices
by the manufacturer (double reporting is certainly possible).
All causality assessments should be made using section 10 of this guidance. Only causality level
1 (i.e. “not related”) is excluded from reporting. If either the sponsor or the investigator has
assigned a higher causality level than "not related", the event should be reported.
As not all safety provisions in the IVDR are applicable to all types of IVD PS, the following table
depicts the safety provisions laid out in the IVDR that are applicable per type of IVD PS.

PS with an in-house IVD referred to in IVDR Article 5(5).

No provisions on safety
reporting according to the
IVDR.
However,
safety
reporting may be regulated
by national legislation.

6.1 Exceptions for PMPF studies falling under IVDR Article 70(1)
SAE reporting for PMPF studies falling under Article 70(1) is governed by Articles 76(5) and 76(6).
This means that the provisions on vigilance apply and need to by the manufacturer of the CE
marked device(s). However, when a causal relationship between the SAE and the preceding PS
has been established, reporting procedures for PS should be followed by the PS sponsor.
This means that:
•

•

For the purpose of this guidance (safety reporting in PS), reportable events in PMPF
studies are those SAEs where a causal relationship between the SAE and the preceding
PS has been established. The other relationship categories i.e. ‘not related’, ‘possible’
and ‘probable’ do not need to be reported.
In the context of vigilance, IVDR Articles 82-85 need to be taken into account and this
concerns the serious incidents where a relationship between the incident and the
device is at least reasonably possible.

It is thus possible that events occurring in such PS need to be reported to both the competent
authorities in charge of PS AND to the competent authorities in charge of vigilance.

6.2 Reportable events occurring in other MSs / Third Countries
6.2.1 Reportable events occurring in other MSs (MS)
The sponsor shall report the reportable SAEs per PS. If several PS are conducted (e.g. specimen
collection in multiple sites) with the same device, only those SAEs that happen in PS that have the
same PSP code should be reported for those PS, and only to those MS where a PS with that specific
PSP code is being conducted8.
It is acknowledged that the same PS can be conducted under different versions of the same PSP
code in different MS, e.g. with country specific adaptations, and in those cases the SAE reporting
can normally be combined for all the versions of the PSP for the same PS.
Reportable events occurring before the PS is authorised to start in a MS will be reported to this
MS upon authorization in this MS.

8

“Is being conducted” has to be interpreted as “has been approved or have been notified to the NCA”.

Page 12 of 23

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-4

6.2.2 Reportable events occurring in third countries
Reportable events occurring in third countries9 in which a PS is conducted (e.g. specimen
collection in that country) under the same PSP (see section 6.2.1 for what is meant with same
PSP) have to be reported in accordance with this guidance to the NCA(s) of the European MS(s)
in which the PS is being conducted.
•
•

The NCA will start receiving the reportable events occurring in third countries as soon as
the PS is authorised to start in that MS.
Reportable events occurring in third countries after the participating European sites
have closed, shall continue to be reported to the MSs in which the PS was conducted.

Reportable events occurring before the PS is authorized to start in a MS will be reported to this
MS upon authorization in this MS.

7

Report by whom

Reportable events have to be reported by the sponsor of the PS (or the PS sponsor’s delegate),
which could be the manufacturer, the legal representative or another person10 or entity.

8

Report to whom

Reportable events must be reported at the same time to all NCAs where the PS has
commenced, using the summary table featured in the appendix.
A list of PS contact points within the NCAs is published at the European Commission's webpage.
For the purpose of this guidance, a PS is considered to have commenced in an individual MS when
the sponsor is authorised to start the study in that MS in accordance with the provisions laid
down in the IVDR.
MSs may also require separate reporting to the Ethics Committee(s).

9

Reporting timelines

9.1 Report by sponsor to NCAs.
The sponsor must report to all NCAs where the PS is authorised to start:
•

9

For all reportable events as described in section 6 which indicate an imminent risk of
death, serious injury, or serious illness and that requires prompt remedial action for
other patients/subjects, users or other persons or a new finding to it: immediately, but

Countries other than Switzerland, Turkey and those belonging to the EEA.
Contact person established by the sponsor in line with IVDR Article 58(4) if accepted by MS.

10

Page 13 of 23

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-4

not later than 2 calendar days after awareness by sponsor of a new reportable event
or of new information in relation with an already reported event.
This includes events that are of significant and unexpected nature such that they become
alarming as a potential public health hazard. It also includes the possibility of multiple
deaths occurring at short intervals.
These concerns may be identified by either the NCA or the sponsor.
•

Any other reportable events as described in section 6 or a new finding/update to it:
immediately, but not later than 7 calendar days following the date of awareness
by the sponsor of the new reportable event or of new information in relation with an
already reported event.

In some cases, a different periodicity or different modalities may be agreed between the
participating NCAs and the sponsor according to the study’s design and to the pathology studied
in the PS. This would allow implementation of adequate provision for PS in which SAE frequency
is expected to be high due to the natural progression of the disease (e.g. palliative oncology).

9.2 Report by the investigator to the sponsor
The sponsor must implement and maintain a system to ensure that the reporting of the
reportable events as defined under section 6 will be provided by the investigator to the sponsor
immediately, but not later than 3 calendar days after awareness of the event.

10 Causality assessment
The relationship between the use of the in vitro diagnostic medical device11 (including the study
procedure) and the occurrence of each SAE must be assessed and categorized.
During causality assessment activity, clinical judgement must be used and the relevant
documents, such as the Investigator’s Brochure, the PSP or the Risk Analysis Report must be
consulted, as all the foreseeable SAEs and the potential risks are listed and assessed there12.
The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the natural
history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors must also be considered.
The above considerations also apply to the SAEs occurring in the comparison group.
For the purpose of harmonizing reports, each SAE will be classified according to four different
levels of causality:
1. Not related
2. Possible
3. Probable
11
12

Intended as both device for PS and comparator.
For a comparator device, the instructions for use could be a relevant document.

Page 14 of 23

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-4

4. Causal relationship
The sponsor and the investigators will use the following definitions to assess the relationship
of the SAE to the device for PS, the comparator or the study procedure.
1. Not related: the relationship to the device for PS, the comparator or to study procedures
can be excluded when:
- the event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device for PS, or the
procedures related to use of the device for PS;
- the relationship between the SAE and the device for PS is biologically implausible;
- the discontinuation of device use or the reduction of the level of activation/exposure
- when clinically feasible - and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of
activation/exposure), do not impact on the SAE;
- the event involves a body-site or an organ that cannot be affected by the device for
PS or procedure;
- the SAE can clearly be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent
illness/ clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment or other risk
factors);
- the SAE does not depend on a false result given by the device for PS ;
In order to establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met
at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the SAE.
2. Possible: the relationship with the use of the device for PS or the comparator, or the
relationship with study procedures, is weak but cannot be ruled out completely.
Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical
condition or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment). Cases where
relatedness cannot be assessed, or no information has been obtained, should also be
classified as possible.
3. Probable: the relationship with the use of the device for PS or the comparator, or the
relationship with study procedures, seems relevant and/or the event cannot be
reasonably explained by another cause.
4. Causal relationship: the SAE is associated with the device for PS, comparator or with
study procedures beyond reasonable doubt when:
- the product category the device for PS belongs to or similar IVDs and study
procedures are known to have this event;
-

the event has a temporal relationship with the device for PS or study procedures;

-

other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/ clinical condition
or/and an effect of another device, drug or treatment) have been adequately ruled
out;

-

harm to the subject is due to error in use;

the event depends on a false result given by the device for PS used for diagnosis13,
when applicable;
In order to establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the
same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the SAE.
-

The sponsor and the investigators will distinguish between the SAEs related to the device for PS
and those related to the procedures (any procedure specific to the PSP). Complications caused
by concomitant treatments not imposed by the PSP are considered not related. Similarly, several
routine diagnostic or patient management procedures are applied to subjects regardless of the
PSP. If routine procedures are not imposed by the PSP, complications caused by them are also
considered not related.
The relationship between a SAE and the procedure or the device needs to be assessed separately.
This does however not mean that they are mutually exclusive; a SAE can be related to both the
procedure and the device, or it can be related only to the procedure or only to the device. When
it is unclear whether an event is related to the device or to the procedure, the investigator should:
• set the relationship to device to possible (or higher)
AND
• set the relationship to procedure to possible (or higher)
When the healthcare provider performs the procedures and uses the device(s) for PS, the
causality assessment of this healthcare provider should prevail. In case of self-tests, the
assessment by the sponsor and the one by the user are equally weighted.
In some particular cases the event may not be adequately assessed because information is
insufficient or contradictory and/or the data cannot be verified or supplemented. The sponsor
and the investigators will make the maximum effort to define and categorize the event and avoid
these situations. Where an investigator assessment is not available and/or the sponsor remains
uncertain about classifying the SAE, the sponsor should not exclude the relatedness; the event
should be classified as “possible”, and the reporting is not to be delayed.
Particular attention shall be given to the causality evaluation of unanticipated SAEs. The
occurrence of unanticipated events could suggest that the PS places subjects at increased risk of
harm than was to be expected beforehand.

11 Reporting form
The reporting form template for the summary SAE tabulation is given in the Appendix of this
document.
13

If a device for performance study gives an incorrect diagnosis, the subject might, for example, receive an
unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany that treatment, or might be incorrectly diagnosed
with a serious disease. In other cases, the subject might not receive an effective treatment (thereby missing out on
the benefits that treatment would confer), or might not be diagnosed with the correct disease or condition.

MDCG 2024-4

The reporting form is study specific and covers only a given PS, defined by a distinct PSP. English
is the recommended language for the reporting form. The reporting form can be modified in any
applicable software (not only Microsoft Excel), but the file needs to be compatible with Microsoft
Excel when sent to the participating NCAs. Sponsors who generate the excel report file by
automated processes may implement other technical features in their systems for excel file
generation to ensure the preferred terms listed in metadata are used.
The template form contains inserted filters and functionalities to facilitate the use of preferred
terminology in the reporting. These are important for the analysis and should be maintained.
The table gives a cumulative overview of the reportable events per PS and will be updated and
transmitted to participating NCAs each time a new reportable event or a new finding to an already
reported event is to be reported. If more detailed information has to be provided on request of
an NCA, the individual study specific reporting form should be used.

11.1 Completion guidelines: Form header
11.1.1 EUDAMED/CIV-ID
It will not be possible to generate the Union-wide unique single identification number mentioned
in IVDR Article 66 (1) before Eudamed is fully functional. Until Eudamed is fully functional, PS will
get tracking numbers (CIV-ID) upon registration in the Eudamed2 database which is performed
by the NCA upon receipt of an application. This CIV-ID is provided to the sponsor during the NCA’s
handling of the initial application for the PS and should be entered on the safety reporting form.
