1 Introduction
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices1, hereafter referred to as the MDR, is applicable2 to the groups of products without an intended medical
purpose that are listed in Annex XVI as from the date of application of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/23463, hereinafter referred to as
the common specifications (CS).
Products without an intended medical purpose that are listed in the Annex XVI to MDR and that are included in the scope sections of the CS’ annexes are
covered also by the MDR. Qualification of a product without an intended medial purpose precedes its classification. Only products that qualify as devices4
and that are covered by the CS and the MDR should then be classified according to the rules set out in Annex VIII to MDR and in Commission Implementing
Regulation (EU) 2022/2347 on reclassification5.
Classification rules set out in Annex VIII to MDR apply to those products. Also Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2347 applies for classification
purposes of certain active devices without an intended medical purpose.
The document MDCG 2021-24 on “Guidance on classification of medical devices”6 should be read together with the present guidance document, except for
the elements which are specific to devices with a medical purpose.

2 Scope
This guidance document provides elements useful for the qualification of a product as a product without an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI to
the MDR. It also provides explanations and examples for the application of certain classification rules to products without an intended medical purpose,
hereinafter also referred to as devices.

The examples provided do not imply that the products are a priori qualified as devices. Classification rules apply after the qualification of the product as a
device has been established.
This guidance document should be used in conjunction with the MDCG 2021-24 on classification of medical devices and take into consideration Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2347 on reclassification7.

3 Qualification
The purpose of this chapter is to provide useful elements to support the qualification7 of products as Annex XVI products covered by the CS. The following
elements and explanations are not exhaustive.
Even if mostly related to medical devices, additional relevant elements may be found also in the Manual on borderline and classification for medical devices8
and in MDCG 2022-5, the guidance on borderline between medical devices and medicinal products9.

3.1 General requirements
Article 1(1) of the MDR covers only medical devices and accessories for medical devices, while Article 1(2) of the MDR establishes that the MDR applies also
to the products listed in Annex XVI. While for a “medical device” and an “accessory for a medical device” there are definitions that determine the meaning
of the two terms, for Annex XVI products the Regulation does not provide any definition. Therefore, to determine if a product is covered by the MDR, the
descriptions of the groups of products listed in the Annex XVI must be used. The definitions of “medical device” and “accessory for a medical device” should
not be used.

MDCG 2023-5

The MDR is applicable to Annex XVI products as from the date of application of the CS that cover a product or a group of products. In the absence of CS for a
product or a group of products the MDR does not apply to those products. Other EU legislation could be applicable. Useful information can be found in the
Blue Guide on the implementation of the product rules10.
The qualification of a product as a device should rely on information provided in the Annex XVI list and in the scope sections of the CS. More precisely, the
characteristics mentioned in those provisions, such as the type of product, the technology, the functioning modalities, the target body part, organ or tissue
and the intended purpose of the product should be fulfilled. Examples of products provided in the Annex XVI list and in the scope sections of the CS, should
be considered as additional sources of information for the qualification, even if they are not exhaustively described.
The recital (12)11 of the MDR states that Annex XVI products should be similar to medical devices for functioning and risk profile. This guiding principle is
reflected in Article 1(2) of the MDR to take into account the state of the art, and in particular existing harmonised standards for analogous devices with a
medical purpose, based on similar technology. Similarities with analogous medical devices can therefore also be considered as a guiding principle for the
qualification of the product as a device.

3.2 Accessories
Accessories for Annex XVI products are not defined in Article 2 of the MDR. Nevertheless, such items are covered by the MDR, if they fall within the
descriptions listed in the Annex XVI of the MDR and fall under the scope sections of the CS.
If the item can be used only in combination with an Annex XVI product, it could be placed on the market together with that product and considered as a
piece of the product.
If the item can be used either on its own or in combination with other Annex XVI products, it could be placed on the market either on its own as an Annex
XVI product, or together with the other Annex XVI products with which it is compatible. In the latter case, it could be considered as a piece of those
products.

MDR, recital (12): “Certain groups of products for which a manufacturer claims only an aesthetic or another non-medical purpose but which are similar to medical devices
in terms of functioning and risks profile should be covered by this Regulation. […].”.

MDCG 2023-5

3.3 Dual-purpose devices
If the manufacturer claims both a medical and a non-medical intended purpose, those devices, referred to as dual-purpose devices, must fulfil cumulatively
the requirements applicable to devices with an intended medical purpose and those applicable to devices without an intended medical purpose12.
Certain requirements from the CS and the MDR, such as those for the acceptability of risks, may not be the same. In such cases, the most stringent
requirements should be applied.
If the dual-purpose is never achieved simultaneously in one patient (e.g., the equipment can be used for the medical purpose or for the non-medical one,
but never for both simultaneously), the MDR and the CS requirements could be applied separately with reference to the two intended purposes. However,
certain requirements, such as those on the risk control measures, should be considered also in combination, because the measures taken for one intended
purpose could generate effects on the use according to the other intended purpose. This could be the case for control measures related to the medical
purpose risks, which could generate new risks related to the non-medical purpose and the other way around13.

3.4 Multiple intended purposes
The products described in each of the 6 groups listed in the Annex XVI to the MDR are different in terms of intended purposes and characteristics. Even if a
product could have some characteristics described in more than one group, it is very unlikely that it could achieve the intended purposes of more than one
group. For that reason, in principle, every product should fall only in one of the 6 groups listed in the Annex XVI to the MDR. Nevertheless, if a product
achieves the intended purposes of two or more groups of products and has all the characteristics described in those groups, the requirements set out in the
CS for those groups should apply cumulatively.

12

MDR, Article 1(3).
For example, the limitation of the energy emission to a specific wavelength range for a laser equipment for a medical purpose (e.g., treatment of actinic keratosis) could
damage the skin if the laser equipment is used for a non-medical purpose (e.g., hair removal) which requires that the energy is emitted in a different wavelength range.
Conversely, the limitation of energy for laser equipment for the non-medical purpose could negatively affect the performance of the device when used for the medical
purpose.

MDCG 2023-5

Examples:
•

•

Lipolysis laser equipment: it emits high intensity electromagnetic radiation and removes adipose tissue. If the laser contributes to the removal of the
fat tissue and does not deliver any skin treatment, the product will fall only under group 4. Conversely, if the laser contributes to the removal of the
fat tissue and also delivers skin treatment, such as skin tightening, the product will fall under both groups 4 and 5;
Equipment for radiofrequency radiation assisted liposuction: it emits high intensity electromagnetic radiation and removes adipose tissue. If the
radiofrequency radiation contributes to the removal of the fat tissue and does not deliver any skin treatment, the product will fall only under group
4. Conversely, if the radiofrequency radiation also delivers skin treatment, such as skin tightening, the product will fall under both groups 4 and 5.

3.5 Practical issues of qualification
The descriptions of the groups of products listed in the Annex XVI to the MDR include terms or concepts that are not defined nor explained in detail in the
Regulation itself. The following table provides guidance on how to consider those terms or concepts for qualification purposes.

Group clarification
1
Contact lenses that are coloured or printed to achieve a non-medical purpose and that are also indicated for the purpose of correcting a sight
defect, should be considered a dual-purpose device that reaches simultaneously both the medical and the non-medical purpose. The product can
be considered a medical device (both features having a medical purpose) only if the colour or the print achieves a medical intended purpose.
2
The term fixation should be considered as a firmly and stable coupling of two or more body parts without any possibility for relative movements
between those parts.
3
The intended purpose of the product should be facial or other dermal or mucous membrane filling. Therefore, mesotherapy products are
considered as covered by the CS only if their intended purpose is or includes the filling.
3
The substance, combination of substances or items must be introduced by subcutaneous, submucous or intradermal injection or by other
introduction route of administration. For the purpose of the qualification, the terms should be considered to have the following meaning.
‘Subcutaneous’ means under the skin and typically refers to the fatty tissue below the dermis; ‘submucous’ refers to the connective tissue beneath
the mucosa; ‘intradermal’ means into the dermis, just below the epidermis. The administration method can be an injection or ‘other introduction’.
Prefilled hyaluron pens or prefilled dermarollers are examples of other means of introduction.

Group clarification
5
The term ‘high intensity’ is used to qualify the electromagnetic radiation but it is not defined in Article 2 of the MDR and its meaning is not
explained. The infra-red, visible light and ultraviolet radiations14 are referred to in Section 5 of Annex XVI to the MDR as examples of that
electromagnetic radiation, therefore they should not be considered as sufficient to qualify the term high intensity. For example, radiofrequency15
can be considered another type of electromagnetic radiation.
For the purpose of deciding if the product emits high intensity electromagnetic radiation and, therefore, falls within the group 5 of Annex XVI to
MDR, the electromagnetic radiation should be considered having high intensity if it is able to cause an effect16 on the target tissue that is necessary
to achieve the intended purpose of the product.

3.6 Examples of products that do not qualify as Annex XVI products
The following table provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of products that should not qualify as Annex XVI products and that are not covered by the CS.
The list does not include the products that are excluded directly by the MDR and the CS17.

4 Classification
4.1 General principles
The classification of products without an intended medical purpose covered by the MDR is to be done in accordance with the Rules set out in Annex VIII of
the MDR. In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/234718, laying down rules for the reclassification of groups of certain active products
without an intended medical purpose by means of derogation from the application of Annex VIII to the MDR, will be taken into account if relevant.
The classification of dual-purpose devices should consider both the medical and the non-medical purpose. In case several rules, or several sub-rules within
the same rule, apply to the same device based on the device's intended purposes, the strictest rule and sub-rule resulting in the higher classification should
apply19.

The guidance MDCG 2021-24 on classification should be referred to for the general consideration on the classification rules. This guidance provides
additional elements and examples which may be relevant for Annex XVI products.
This chapter presents the classification elements to be taken into account for each group of products without an intended medical purpose as listed and
described in the Annex XVI of the MDR and covered by the CS. Considering that the description of each group of products contains relevant information on
the product characteristics that could be useful for its classification (see also comments in point 3.1), the product descriptions from the CS are presented.
