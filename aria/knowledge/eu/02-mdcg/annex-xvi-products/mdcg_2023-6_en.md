1 Introduction
The Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices1, hereafter referred to as the MDR (medical device
regulation), provides a possibility to use clinical data related to an equivalent device in the clinical
evaluation required for a device under conformity assessment2.
Whilst carrying out a clinical investigation is the most direct way to generate clinical data concerning
the safety and performance of devices for the purpose of CE marking, clinical data can also be
sourced from data of a device for which the equivalence to the device in question can be
demonstrated3. In such cases, equivalence shall be demonstrated according to the MDR
requirements4.
According to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2346 laying down common
specifications for the groups of products without an intended medical purpose listed in Annex XVI to
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices5, hereinafter referred to as CS, in general it is not
possible to demonstrate equivalence between a medical device and a product without an intended
medical purpose where all available results of clinical investigations relate to medical devices only.
Therefore, clinical investigations should be performed for products without an intended medical
purpose6.
The guidance document MDCG 2020-5 on “Clinical Evaluation – Equivalence”7 also covers the
products without an intended medical purpose listed in the Annex XVI of MDR8. It was issued in April
2020, before the availability of the CS and with the purposes of highlighting the differences between
the MDR and the MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev.49.

2 Scope
This MDCG guidance covers the demonstration of equivalence, based on data pertaining to an
already existing device, for the purpose of CE-marking under the MDR and is applicable to products
without an intended medical purpose listed in the Annex XVI of MDR and covered by the CS. For

dual-purpose devices, which are devices with a medical and a non-medical intended purpose, this
guidance applies only to the non-medical intended purpose.
This guidance document should be used in conjunction with MDCG 2020-5 on equivalence.

3 Demonstration of equivalence
3.1 Product without an intended medical purpose vs product without an intended
medical purpose
When referring to clinical data from an equivalent device, manufacturers should consider that
equivalence between two devices without an intended medical purpose should be demonstrated in
accordance with the criteria established in the MDR10. In particular, the demonstration has to
consider technical, biological and clinical characteristics.
The technical and biological criteria listed in the MDR can be directly considered to compare
characteristics of products without an intended medical purpose. The criterion for the clinical
characteristics should be considered taking into account that some of them are specifically referring
to a medical purpose. The following table clarifies how the characteristics should be considered for
products without an intended medical purpose.

Elements of the Clinical criterion
(MDR, Annex XIV Part A Section 3)
the device is used for the same clinical
condition or purpose,
including similar severity and stage of
disease,
at the same site in the body,
in a similar population, including as regards
age, anatomy and physiology;
has the same kind of user;
has similar relevant critical performance

Clarifications for the application of the Clinical
criterion to products without a medical purpose
only ‘used for the same purpose’ applies
‘similar severity and stage of disease’ is not applicable

‘at the same site in the body' is directly applicable
‘in a similar population’ is directly applicable as well
as the similar ‘age’, ‘anatomy’ and ‘physiology’
‘the same kind of user’ is directly applicable
‘similar relevant critical performance’ is directly
applicable
in view of the expected clinical effect for a the expected ‘clinical’ effect is not applicable.
specific intended purpose
Nevertheless, the products have expected effects for
the specific intended purpose, therefore the
requirement should be considered as ‘in view of the
expected effect for a specific intended purpose’

3.2 Product without an intended medical purpose vs analogous medical device
In general, a comparison is not possible between a medical device and a product without an intended
medical purpose11 because not all the clinical characteristics can be compared. In particular, the

characteristic ‘similar severity and stage of disease’ would be defined and available for the medical
device while it would not be defined and available for the product without an intended medical
purpose12. As a consequence, the demonstration of equivalence cannot be completed and
established between a device without an intended medical purpose and an analogous device with a
medical purpose13.

3.3 Product without an intended medical purpose vs dual-purpose device
Equivalence between a product without an intended medical purpose and a device with both a
medical and a non-medical purpose (dual-purpose device) can be demonstrated comparing the
characteristics related to the non-medical purpose for both the devices. For the dual-purpose device,
only the characteristics related to the non-medical purpose should be considered.
If equivalence is demonstrated, only clinical data of the dual-purpose device related to the general
safety and performance requirements14 applicable for the non-medical purpose should be used for
the clinical evaluation of the product without an intended medical purpose.

12

This further explains the sentence “To duly justify reliance on existing clinical data from an analogous medical
device, the principles of demonstration of equivalence should be applied with the acceptance that the device
under evaluation will only have an aesthetic or another non-medical purpose whereas the analogous device
has a medical purpose” from point 4(f) of MDCG 2020-5.
13
In cases where equivalence cannot be demonstrated, data from similar devices may be useful for a variety of
other purposes (e.g., ensuring that the risk management system is comprehensive; understanding the state of
the art; helping to define the scope of the clinical evaluation) that are listed in point 5 of MDCG 2020-5.
