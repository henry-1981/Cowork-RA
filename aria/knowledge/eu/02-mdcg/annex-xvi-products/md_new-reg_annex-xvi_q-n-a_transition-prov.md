Q&A on transitional provisions for products without an
intended medical purpose covered by Annex XVI of the MDR

Disclaimer: this Q&A document intends to facilitate the application of the transitional provisions set
out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2346 1, as amended by Commission
Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/11942. This document has not been formally endorsed by the
European Commission and is without prejudice to any interpretation of the relevant provisions by the
Court of Justice of the European Union or national courts. The information in this Q&A document is of
a general nature and not intended to address specific circumstances of any particular case; the
document does not intend to provide professional or legal advice. The information is not necessarily
comprehensive nor complete. If needed, this document will be updated in order to address additional
questions that may arise.

Introduction
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR)3, fully applicable from 26 May 2021, covers also
products without an intended medical purpose that are listed in its Annex XVI. Common specifications
addressing the application of risk management to Annex XVI products have been set out in
Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022/2346 (CS), which applies from 22 June 2023.
Transitional provisions set out in the MDR have been extended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607 4 that also
sets out conditions for benefitting from those extended transitional periods. The amended transitional
provisions apply from 20 March 2023.
Considering that transitional provisions for products covered by a certificate issued by a notified body
in accordance with Council Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD)5 are set out both in the amended MDR and in
the CS, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1194 has been adopted to align the
transitional provisions set out in the CS to those set out in the amended MDR. The content of this
document has been drafted considering the requirements applicable from the amended MDR and the
amended CS.

In addition, the CS establish dedicated transitional provisions to cover specific cases for which the 6
fixed months granted by the MDR would not be sufficient to fully implement the new applicable
requirements from the CS and to complete the applicable procedures under the MDR. In detail, such
cases include when a notified body needs to be involved in the conformity assessment procedure,
when the manufacturer considers carrying out a clinical investigation followed by a conformity
assessment procedure that involves a notified body and when the Annex XVI product is covered by an
MDD certificate that is no longer valid pursuant to Article 120(2) of the MDR.
For Annex XVI products covered by a valid MDD certificate pursuant to Article 120(2) of the MDR, the
transitional provisions established in paragraphs 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e of Article 120 of the MDR
apply.

What is the transitional period set out in the CS for products for which a
notified body is involved in the conformity assessment and the
manufacturer decides to carry out a clinical investigation? Are there
conditions to be satisfied?

The period is about 6,5 years. It starts from 22 June 2023 and ends on 31 December 2029.
During the transitional period, various conditions need to be satisfied. Some for the entire period,
while others within certain dates. The following table shows each condition that needs to be fulfilled
to continue to place on the market or to put into service the product during the transitional period.

During the transitional period, additional conditions and requirements need to be satisfied. Some for
the entire period, while others within certain dates.17 The following table shows each condition that
needs to be fulfilled to continue to place on the market or to put into service the product during the

Table 3: applicable conditions for transitional provisions according to Article 2(3) of the CS.

To establish the conditions and the requirements, the CS refers to paragraphs (3c), (3d) and (3e) of
Article 120 of the MDR. The questions and answers document on the MDR transitional provisions15,
as amended by Regulation (EU) 2023/607, provides additional useful information.
It has to be noted that the validity of an MDD certificate that covers products that benefit from the
transitional provisions established by the CS is not extended. Nevertheless, those products can be
placed on the market or put into service also after the expiry date of the MDD certificate until the end
of the transitional period.

Q&A on transitional provisions for products without an
intended medical purpose covered by Annex XVI of the MDR

Before being amended, the CS set out conditions to be fulfilled in order to benefit and to continue to
benefit from the transitional provisions. Those conditions included the need for the product to
continue to comply with the requirements of the MDD, except for the requirement to be covered by
a valid MDD certificate where the certificate expires after 26 May 2021; the need to avoid significant
changes in the design and intended purpose of the product; the need for the manufacturer to sign a
written agreement with a notified body for the appropriate surveillance. Those conditions have been
retained in the CS as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1194. The compatibility of
those conditions ensures a smooth transition to the new regime applicable from 22 June 2023.

What is the transitional period for products incorporating a medicinal
product?

There are no specific transitional provisions for Annex XVI products that incorporate, as an integral
part, a substance which, if used separately, would be considered to be a medicinal product as defined
in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC. In such cases, the timeframe of 210 days 26 for the
consultation of the Competent Authority designated by the Member States in accordance with
Directive 2001/83/EC or EMA has to be considered as part of the transitional period granted by the CS
in case a notified body is involved in the conformity assessment procedure of the product.

10 What are the transitional provisions for a dual-purpose device?
For a dual-purpose device, which has both a medical and a non-medical intended purpose, the
applicable requirements from MDR and CS must be cumulatively fulfilled. With regard to transitional
provisions, in relation to the medical purpose, Article 120 of the MDR is applicable, while in relation
to the non-medical purpose the CS is applicable. Considering that the device must fulfil both the
applicable requirements from the MDR and the CS, in case such requirements differ, for example in
setting the end of the transitional period, the stricter requirement should be taken into consideration
and fulfilled.

11 How can the manufacturers demonstrate that their product benefits from the
transitional period?
The manufacturers should be able to provide a self-declaration confirming that the conditions for
benefiting from the transitional provisions are fulfilled, stating the end date of the transition period.
The self-declaration should be updated as soon as a new condition becomes applicable and is fulfilled.
The self-declaration should clearly identify the products covered and could be based on a harmonised
template.
As soon as the condition to have signed a written agreement for the conformity assessment with a
notified body applies, additional evidence could be provided by a ‘confirmation letter’ issued by the
notified body stating the receipt of the manufacturer’s application for conformity assessment and the

26 MDR, Annex IX, Section 5.2(d).

Q&A on transitional provisions for products without an
intended medical purpose covered by Annex XVI of the MDR

conclusion of a written agreement. Such a confirmation should clearly identify the products covered,
could be based on a harmonised template and be issued, in principle, without extra costs.
If products are covered by MDD certificates, the self-declaration and the confirmation letter should
list the products concerned and the reference to their certificates. Additional information on products
covered by an MDD certificate is provided in the questions and answers document on the
implementation of Regulation (EU) 2023/607 (see question number 7).

12 Is there a deadline to make available products placed on market during the
transitional period?
No, there is not. Products placed on the marked during the transitional period can be further made
available also after the end of the applicable transitional period.

13 Can notified bodies issue certificates for Annex XVI products under the MDR
during the transitional periods?
Yes, they can. Notified bodies can issue certificates for Annex XVI products under the MDR during the
transitional periods starting from 22 June 2023 (the date of application of the CS). Before that date,
the MDR was not applicable to Annex XVI products, consequently notified bodies could not issue any
certificate.
