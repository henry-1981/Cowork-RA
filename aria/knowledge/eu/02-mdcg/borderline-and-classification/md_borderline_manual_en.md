Manual on borderline and classification for medical devices under
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices and
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices
Version 4 – September 2025

The views expressed in this document represent the agreements reached by the competent
authorities of the Member State members of the Borderline and Classification Working Group, a
subgroup of the Medical Device Coordination Group. The views are not legally binding as only
the Court of Justice of the European Union can give an authoritative interpretation of Union law.
This Manual only serves as one of the support tools for case-by-case application of the Union
legislation by the Member States in their respective jurisdictions. It remains for the national
competent authorities and the national courts to reach decisions at national level.
The Manual is not a European Commission document and it cannot be regarded as reflecting the
official position of the European Commission.

Introduction and scope
Determining whether a given product falls under the definition of a medical device and the
application of the classification rules fall within the competence of the authorities of the Member
States where the product is on the market. However, when different interpretations of EU
legislation occur, public health may be put at risk and the internal market distorted. As both are
matters of concern to the Member States and the Commission, it essential to facilitate a dialogue
among regulators. Appropriate participation of various stakeholders should also be ensured.
This document, hereafter called the Manual, records the agreements reached by the Member
State members of the Borderline and Classification Working Group (BCWG)1 following the
exchanges under the Helsinki Procedure under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices
(the MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (the IVDR).
The purpose and operation of the Helsinki procedure is described in the dedicated document
here. The BCWG is chaired by the European Commission and consists of representatives of
competent authorities from all Member States with a number of stakeholder associations as
observers.
The aspects concerning the borderline between medical devices and other types of products,
also known as qualification of a product, are generally governed by Article 4 Regulatory
status of products of the MDR and the corresponding Article 3 of the IVDR. Borderline
cases are those for which it is not clear from the outset whether a given product is a medical
device, or an in vitro diagnostic medical device (IVD), or not. Various paragraphs under
Article 1 Subject matter and scope of both Regulations are also relevant. They exclude
certain types of products from the scope of the Regulations. Where a given product does not
fall within the definition of medical device or is excluded from their scope, other EU or
national legislation may be applicable. This Manual will however not provide indications to
that effect.
The Manual should be read in conjunction with other documents providing guidance on
borderline, such as MDCG 2022-5 Guidance on borderline between medical devices and
medicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices and MDCG 2019-11
Qualification and classification of software - Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Regulation (EU)
2017/746.
Once a product is qualified as a medical device, a certain risk class will be assigned to it, namely
I, IIa, IIb, III. For a product qualified as an IVD, the risk classes are A, B, C and D. The aspects
concerning classification of medical devices are governed by MDR Article 51 Classification of
devices and Annex VIII Classification rules. For IVDR the corresponding references are Article
47 and Annex VIII. In the context of this Manual, classification cases are those for which the
competent authorities of the Member States identify a difficulty in the uniform application of the
classification rules.

The BCWG is a sub-group of the Medical Device Coordination Group set up according to Article 103 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Article 98 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746

5

The Manual should be read in conjunction with other documents providing guidance on classification,
such as MDCG 2021-24 Guidance on classification of medical devices and MDCG 2020-16 Guidance
on classification rules for in vitro diagnostic medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/746.
Other relevant MDCG guidance documents may be published here.
This Manual does not relieve national competent authorities from their duty to issue decisions in
the areas of qualification and classification for individual products taking into account all its
characteristics on a case-by-case basis, while acting under the supervision of the courts.

1. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices

1.1. Qualification of medical devices
The respective sections will be populated when cases are finalised under the Helsinki Procedure.

1.1.1. Borderline between medical devices and IVDs
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR or under the
IVDR, where the conclusion is that the product should be qualified as a medical device.

1.1.2. Borderline between medical devices and medicinal products, including advanced
therapy medicinal products (ATMPs)
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR, or possibly
under Directive 2001/83/EC on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human
use, or under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the
authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and
establishing a European Medicines Agency, or under Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on
advanced therapy medicinal products.
1.1.2.1 Nasal spray with antibodies for COVID-19
Background
The spray contains antibodies that inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus and, as a result, the virus is
no longer able to reproduce and enter mucosal cells. The antibodies, obtained from the colostrum
of infected cows, are sprayed into the human nose where they can attach to the viruses and
inactivate them.
Outcome
According to the information provided by the manufacturer, the principal intended action of the
spray is achieved through antibodies binding to the virus. As a result, the virus is no longer able
to reproduce and enter mucosal cells.
Considering the product’s principal mode of action and that a medical device cannot achieve its
principal intended action by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, the above
mentioned spray should not be qualified as a medical device.

7

1.1.2.2 Graphite crucible
Background
The product is a graphite crucible used in conjunction with the radionuclide Technetium-99m
(Tc-99m) for imaging the airways (lung ventilation scintigraphy). The graphite crucible is made
of pure carbon and is intended for the preparation of the aerosol.
The resulting aerosol is an ultra-fine dispersion of nanosized pure carbon particles encapsulating
Tc-99m (average 30-60 nm). It is produced by heating Tc-99m in the carbon crucible in an oven
for a few seconds at 2,750 °C in the presence of argon gas.
The aerosol is then inhaled by the patient via a mouthpiece, and penetrates to the sub-segmental
areas of the lung.
Once inhaled by a patient suspected of having a pulmonary embolism (PE) or other pulmonary
obstructive pathology, a gamma camera is used to generate the image.
The question is about the qualification of the graphite crucible.
Outcome
According to Article 1 (6) of Directive 2001/83/EC, radiopharmaceutical is: “Any medicinal
product which, when ready for use, contains one or more radionuclides (radioactive isotopes)
included for a medicinal purpose.”
According to Article 1 (8), a kit is: “Any preparation to be reconstituted or combined with
radionuclides in the final radiopharmaceutical, usually prior to its administration.”
The graphite crucible comes under the latter definition. The graphite crucible:
− is made of pure carbon and is intended for the preparation of an aerosol;
− is an inherent component of the aerosol (carbon particles carrying the radionuclide Tc99m).
Consequently, graphite crucible does not fall under the definition of medical device or accessory
and should not be qualified as such.
1.1.2.3 Product for professional removal of dental biofilm
Background
Qualification of a product for professional removal of dental biofilm/plaque, consisting of a
syringe prefilled with TiO2 + polymer (inert) and a vial of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2): The H2O2
shall be mixed with the content of the syringe before use, resulting in a gel that is applied by the
syringe on to the teeth in the gingival area. The product is intended as a “stand alone” device or
together with a motorized brush for professional debridement of teeth and implanted implants,
by dissolving biofilm/killing bacteria and increasing the effectiveness of mechanical removal of
biofilm/plaque, which causes inflammatory situations. Their removal therefore brings advantages
with regard to the following aspects:
− attenuation of degradation of dental enamel;
− attenuation of inflammation/gingivitis;
8

− attenuation of the onset of periodontitis, bone damage and loss of teeth;
− attenuation of the onset of peri-implantitis, when used on implant surface.
During use, the syringe is intended to guarantee a final concentration ranging from 3% to 5% of
H2O2. The gel destroys bacteria and viruses with reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Outcome
The product has a medical intended purpose based on claims regarding attenuation of
inflammation - gingivitis, periodontitis and peri-implantitis. However, the antimicrobial action of
ROS, which is considered as the principal intended action, should be considered
pharmacological, immunological or metabolic mode of action. The decision of ECJ ruling 6
September 2012, case C-308/11, also supports that such antimicrobial actions on the human body
should be considered pharmacological. Consequently, considering the principal mode of action,
this product should not be qualified as a medical device.
In regard to the prefilled syringe it has to be considered that a device which is placed on the
market in such a way that the device and a medicinal product form a single integral product
which is intended exclusively for use in the given combination and which is not reusable, shall
be governed by Directive 2001/83/EC. The relevant essential requirements of Annex I to the
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices shall apply as far as safety and performancerelated device features are concerned.
1.1.2.4 Root canal irrigation solution
Background
Two root canal irrigating solutions intended to be used in endodontic treatment are placed on the
market as medical devices consisting of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 3% aqueous solution for
canal irrigation and another solution with chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) 2% root canal
solution for final irrigation and debridement of root canals.
According to the manufacturer, NaOCl 3% solution is intended to irrigate the root canal of the
tooth as needed for debridement during instrumentation. The CHX 2% solution is intended to be
used for the irrigation and debridement of root canals after instrumentation in endodontic
treatment.
The manufacturer indicates that the aim of the irrigation is to dissolve the tissues and to have a
cleaning effect. For both products, the manufacturer does not claim the disinfection of root
canals but argues that NaOCl and CHX solutions act as “a liquid mechanical file” and considers
that the infection is treated by a mechanical action.
Outcome
Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine (CHX) are substances which have
antimicrobial properties. NaOCl has an antimicrobial action and has the ability to dissolve
biofilm components. CHX is an active ingredient of many approved medicinal products.
Both substances are medicinal substances with known pharmacological effects documented in
the literature. Furthermore, according to the state of art in endodontics, the root canal treatment
9

is a procedure aiming to clean and disinfect the root canals of the tooth by using irrigating
solutions containing sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine.
If the manufacturer can demonstrate that the principal mode of action is the rinsing and the
irrigation so that the solutions remove debris and necrotic tissues (mechanical action), the
irrigating solutions fulfil the definition of medical device.
Moreover, as they contain a substance (NaOCl or CHX) which, if used separately, is considered
to be a medicinal product, and as they have a disinfecting action, these solutions should be
considered as having an antimicrobial action ancillary to that of the device (disinfection of the
root canal before obturation according to the state of art), unless the absence of these effects can
be proven.
Not claiming a disinfectant action is not sufficient to demonstrate that a substance doesn’t have
an action ancillary to that of the device.
As stated in MDCG-2022-5 “The determination of the nature of the substance, i.e. whether it is
“considered to be a medicinal product” is independent of the intention of the manufacturer, of
the quantity of the substance in the device and of the method or route of administration. Also, the
determination of whether the substance “has an action ancillary to that of the device” is
scientifically objective and does not depend on the manufacturer’s intention for the action of that
substance in the device.
Therefore, scientific evidence, and not the claims, is the only aspect relevant for the
determination of pharmacological action. Thus, unless the manufacturer can provide robust
scientific evidence that NaOCl or CHX in the irrigating solution has no antibacterial or antiseptic
action in or on the human body or its constituents, using suitably scientifically rigorous tests,
root canal irrigating solutions containing NaOCl or CHX should be classified as class III per rule
14 of Annex VIII to the MDR.
1.1.2.5 Classification of red blood cell additive solutions containing adenine
Background
Nowadays, there are several medical devices systems for red blood cells (RBCs) processing and
storage. These systems may include different parts, combined or not, such as: filters, empty
transfer bags, anti-coagulant solutions, and, used in a final storage step, a preservation/additive
solution with adenine.
Adenine has been used for over 40 years in RBCs concentrates bags to increase the RBCs shelf
life. Adenine helps maintain ATP production for RBCs metabolism and cell shape maintenance.
This survivability of RBCs is correlated with the level of ATP concentration which inexorably
decreases over time. The RBCs’ ATP concentration decrease is caused by depletion of the
adenine nucleotide pool, mediated by deamination of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to
inosine monophosphate. Adenine reverses this nucleotide depletion by reacting with 5phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate in the presence of adenine phosphoribosyl transferase
(APRTase) to yield additional AMP. During RBCs storage ex vivo, the adenine is also
incorporated into AMP and the concentrations of free adenine decline to minimal levels towards
the end of the storage period.
10

In view of the above, most whole blood collections are separated quickly after collection into
RBCs, platelets, and plasma components. The RBCs are resuspended in an additive solution
containing adenine to allow adequate storage.
The question has arisen as how medical devices that includes additive solutions with adenine
used in RBC's processing are classified.
Outcome
Adenine is a substance, which yields additional AMP in the blood and is used to increase the
shelf life of the red blood cells and thus their conservation. In view of the mechanism of action
of adenine as described by the manufacturer and taking into consideration the note 4 of the
section 1.2.2 in the MDCG 2022-5 rev.1, adenine is involved in a biochemical process inherent
to the proper functioning of the red blood cells intended for infusion. In this context, the mode of
action of adenine meets the definition of metabolic action defined in MDCG 2022-5.
Note also the existence of an CHMP opinion of September 15 2022 which, although mainly
concerns citrate solutions, also mentions adenine and in particular its pharmacological action in
two referenced publications.
Therefore, the mode of action of adenine can be either a metabolic mode of action or a
pharmacological mode of action (or both) as defined in MDCG 2022-5.
According to Rule 14, Annex VIII to the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices, all
devices incorporating, as an integral part, a substance which, if used separately, can be
considered to be a medicinal product, as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC,
including a medicinal product derived from human blood or human plasma, as defined in point
10 of Article 1 of that Directive, and that has an action ancillary to that of the devices, are
classified as class III.
Consequently, adenine used in additive solutions for RBCs processing in such devices has an
ancillary action to the device as medicinal substance. Therefore, the device should be classified
as class III, according to rule 14.
1.1.2.6 Classification of dual action cream with menthol and capsaicin
Background
According to the manufacturer the product is a dual action cream with cooling and warming
effect with menthol, capsaicinoids and some other additional substances. The intended purpose
of the cream is relieving muscle and joint pain through dual action. Menthol cools, relieves pain,
reduces swelling and reduces muscle tension. Capsicum extract warms the treated area.
The mechanism is mediated by the TRP family of ion channels, and the effect is lasting from
half an hour to a few hours. The manufacturer claims that the principal intended action of
menthol in the product is achieved by physiological (activity of ion channels) and by chemical
means. The manufacturer claims that the secondary intended action is achieved by capsaicin
giving a sense of warmth and having a relaxing effect. The manufacturer’s justification is that
the amount of capsaicin in the product is not at the level of capsaicin in medicinal products. The
manufacturer states that the intended action of the product is not achieved by pharmacological,
11

immunological or metabolic means and asks for validation that such a medical device would be
class IIa according to Rule 21 of the MDR.
Outcome
The intended purpose of the cream is to relieve muscle and joint pain. Both substances, menthol
and capsaicin, have a recognized pharmacological action in pain management. Both menthol and
capsaicin act upon receptors to achieve their effect, hence they act by pharmacological means.
As the principal intended action is claimed to be achieved by menthol, the product is outside the
definition of a medical device. Furthermore, in MDCG 2022 – 5 Guidance on borderline
between medical devices and medicinal products under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical
devices, “Products containing peppermint oil or menthol with intended medical purposes such as
the relief of discomfort and pain in muscles and joints, relief of back pain, etc. as their principal
mode of action is pharmacological involving interaction with the cold-sensitive receptors in the
skin.”, are given as examples of medicinal products. The manufacturer bears the burden of proof
for the non-pharmacological, non-immunological or non-metabolic effect of his product. In the
absence of evidence that the main intended action in or on the human body is not achieved by
pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, a product should not be qualified as a
medical device and consequently, the discussion on classification of the product is irrelevant.

1.1.2.7 Lactose tablets for vaginal use
Background
The product is a non-sterile vaginal tablet consisting of 99 % lactose monohydrate, Ph. Eur
grade. The intended purpose, as declared by the manufacturer, is the reduction of unpleasant
vaginal odour and discharge associated with bacterial vaginosis, and relief of vaginal irritation
and soreness. Recommended use is one tablet daily, administered intravaginally.
The mode of action proposed by the manufacturer is that the lactose is a nutrient for the
indigenous flora of lactic acid bacteria, while the organisms causing bacterial vaginosis
(Gardnerella vaginalis and others) do not use lactose for growth. The lactic acid bacteria
produce components with adverse effect on the growth of Gardnerella and similar flora, namely
lactic acid which is the main product of the metabolization of lactose, along with similar natural
growth inhibiting substances.
Outcome
The lactose tablet achieves its principal intended action by metabolic means in or on the human
body, as the consumption of the lactose by the lactic acid bacteria is a metabolic process and the
indigenous lactic bacteria is considered as part of the human body, ref. note 4 in MDCG 2022-5
Guidance on borderline between medical devices and medicinal products under Regulation (EU)
2017/745 on medical devices, section 1.2.2.

12

As the principal intended action of the product is achieved by metabolic means in the human
body the product should not be qualified as a medical device.
1.1.3. Borderline between medical devices and biocides
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR or possibly
under Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of
biocidal products.
1.1.3.1 Substance for textile treatment
Background
The product is a concentrate for water-based treatment of textile materials to impart antifungal,
antimicrobial and antiviral properties in various applications.
The intended purpose is the prevention of human infectious diseases caused by microorganisms
spread through contact with surfaces, especially textile ones. The infectious diseases intended to
be prevented are influenza, COVID-19 and hospital-acquired infections.
Outcome
This product does not act on individual patients, rather, it imparts antifungal, antimicrobial and
antiviral properties onto textiles. Based on the information provided by the manufacturer this
product should not be qualified as a medical device.
1.1.4. Borderline between medical devices and substances of human origin
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under MDR or possibly under
Directive 2004/23/EC on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement,
testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells or Directive
2002/98/EC on blood and blood components.

1.1.5. Borderline between medical devices and cosmetic products
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR or possibly
under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products.

1.1.5.1 Qualification of microabrasion dental stain removers
Background
Dental stain removers which act by microabrasion, used as tooth whiteners, have been qualified
by some manufacturers as medical devices and placed on the market as such.

13

In the case of dental stain removers, to justify the medical purpose, manufacturers state that the
microabrasion technique is based on a combination of mechanical and chemical action, e.g. for
the treatment of fluorosis stains, amelogenesis imperfecta, cleidocranial dysplasia and to remove
residual bonded resin and enamel stains following bracket debonding at the conclusion of
orthodontic treatment.
Outcome
The removal of dental stains to improve the appearance of teeth, which is the intended purpose
defined by the manufacturer, regardless of the method or technique utilized and regardless of the
staining being the result of a disease or treatment, does not represent a medical purpose.
Also, stain removers will not treat amelogenesis imperfecta and cleidocranial dysplasia, the
removal of the dental stain in such cases does not change an aesthetic purpose into a medical
one.
If the manufacturer cannot provide robust and scientific evidence that the dental stain removers
have a role in the prevention, treatment or alleviation of a disease, the products should not
qualify as medical devices.
Thus, products used for improving the appearance of teeth do not comply with the legal
definition of medical device established in the MDR and should not be qualified as medical
devices.

1.1.6. Borderline between medical devices and food
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under MDR on medical
devices or possibly under Regulation (EC) 178/2002 laying down the general principles and
requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down
procedures in matters of food safety.
1.1.7. Borderline between medical devices and personal protective equipment
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR or possibly
under Regulation (EU) 2016/425 on personal protective equipment.

1.1.7.1 Rescue bag for patient transport
Background
The rescue bag is designed for the transportation of patients during rescue operations. According
to the manufacturer, the product is intended to protect the patient mechanically, as well as
thermally, during the salvage. The mechanical protection of the head is ensured by additional
padding in the head area. To stabilize the patient during the transport, as well as to attach safety
equipment during different manoeuvres, side straps are sewed onto the rescue bag. Furthermore,
14

the product aims to avoid repeated unpacking and packing of the patient during changes of the
transportation device, e.g. from the emergency rescue sledge to the ambulance. The general
intended purpose of the rescue bag is the patient´s support and protection.
Outcome
The product in question enables stable and protected transport of patients in order to avoid the
worsening of their state of health. The intended purpose of the product corresponds to the
medical purpose of alleviation of, or compensation for, an injury or disability, according to Art.
2(1) of the MDR. It should be therefore qualified as a medical device. The risk class should be
MDR class I, according to rule 1.
Please note that this entry refers solely to the qualification of the product as a medical device and
that the manufacturer may also have to take into account other existing legislation for products
used in emergency rescue.
1.1.7.2 Plexiglas box for caregiver protection
Background
The product is a safety box intended to prevent caregivers from being exposed to infection (i.e.
COVID-19) by containing droplets expelled by the patient during endotracheal intubation,
tracheotomy or any airway related procedure.
The box is intended to be placed over the patient’s head, covering the upper body from head to
shoulders. It is fixed to the bed or the operating table by straps. There are 2 holes for the
physician’s arms to allow access to the patient, and rectangular holes on the sides for insertion of
ventilation circuits, anaesthesia circuits, infusion tubes. The intubation equipment is placed in the
box. The physician inserts arms into the holes to intubate the patient.
The manufacturer designed two models of boxes, one for tracheotomy and one for intubation.
They are intended by the manufacturer to secure and protect users during medical procedures.
Outcome
A medical device has the aim to provide protection of health and safety of the patient. An
intended medical use may not be defined when the product is primarily intended to protect the
caregiver or health care professional.
A product solely intended to protect a caregiver or health care professional by preventing
exposure during a medical or surgical procedure, should not be qualified as a medical device.

15

1.1.7.3 Qualification of medical examination table covers
Background
Medical examination table covers are placed on the market with the intended purpose of
covering the tables in medical exam room, on which the patients lay, to ensure a good level of
hygiene and prevent the transmission of infectious agents, which can be easily transferred from
patient to patient through contact with a common surface.
Outcome
Medical examination table covers are intended to be used for a specific medical purpose, namely
the prevention of disease, as such they comply with the definition of medical device, according
to point 1 of article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. Note that this qualification is not dependent
on the cover’s composition/chosen materials.
1.1.8. Borderline between medical devices and general consumer products
This section covers the borderline between products that may fall under the MDR or possibly
under Directive 2001/95/EC on general product safety.
1.1.9. Other medical device borderlines
1.1.9.1 Smartphone application for STI prevention strategies
Background
This application is intended by the manufacturer to “prevent sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), by allowing for the exchange of information between different sexual partners.”
It permits the recording of biological analysis results, like STI results, in order to share this
information with other potential sexual partners, within a network. During an encounter, these
results are shared by scanning a potential sexual partner’s QR-code; the user then becomes part
of each other’s networks.
Where the functionality has previously been set up by the user, in case of positive tests for an
STI the application sends automatic anonymised notifications to all those in their sexual network
(two degrees of contact).
In this case, the application lets the user know what to do and helps him/her find the right
services. For example, it encourages users to avoid unprotected sex and advises them on
recommended testing practices based on their most recent data, limiting the spread of an STI
within a sexual network and fostering earlier testing and treatment.

16

According to the manufacturer, this application also allows the evaluation, through “the risk
calculator” function, of the risk of infection with an STI based on sexual habits, the number of
connections, and also levels of infection in the network of sexual partners.
Outcome
The application transmits and exchanges data and information between partners. On this basis
alone, the software would not perform an action on data other than communication, as per in
MDCG 2019-11. The application does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, but rather
facilitates the exchange of information and communication between different users.
The application also contains a particular functionality that assesses the user’s risk of contracting
a STI. The risk calculation is based on the behaviour of this person and their contacts tree. In this
case, the prevention does not rely on specific characteristics of the individual user (physiological
parameters, etc...) but mainly on their sexual habits and behaviour towards their partners, within
a sexual network.
Therefore, the risk calculation is based on indirect criteria and not on physiological parameters.
It appears to be an epidemiologic tool rather than a prevention tool within the meaning of the
medical device definition. As such, the “risk calculation to prevent STI diseases” cannot be
considered as a medical purpose according to the definition of medical device.
The product does not therefore fulfil the definition of medical device, according to Regulation
(EU) 2017/745, and should not be qualified as such.
1.1.9.2 Medical calculators
Background
The intended purpose of a medical calculator is to facilitate one or more (sometimes up to 400)
routine medical calculations at the point of care for multiple clinical disciplines by means of an
app or webpage.
Calculation methods incorporated in the medical calculator are taken from or based on formulas
or tables documented in research publications and (national) guidelines. Often, these calculations
are relatively simple and could be done with a basic electronic calculator or even on paper
(simple search). The healthcare professional enters several patient-specific variables after which
the app calculates outcomes like risk scores, severity indexes, threshold values and other
prognostic outcomes, depending on the specific calculation. The healthcare professional that uses
the medical calculator at the point of care is likely to use the outcome of the calculation in
making decisions about diagnosis or treatment of a patient in a routine setting.
Two examples of such medical calculations offered by this medical calculator are:
− calculation of stroke risk for patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc
Score to determine if patients need antithrombotic therapy (e.g. by prescribing
anticoagulant medicine).
− calculation of the creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation to determine
the status of the kidney function. The calculated score is used to identify kidney failure
and to help decide if dialysis is required.

17

Outcome
Calculation of a score according to a specific formula or an complex algorithm as mentioned in
both examples is an action on data beyond the use of simple search as referenced in qualification
decision step 3 of MDCG 2019-11 (“Decision steps for qualification of software as MDSW”).
Also, the calculation is for the benefit of individual patients, as it does not only provide generic
diagnostic or treatment pathways per decision step 4 of guidance MDCG 2019-11.
The presented device meets the definition of a medical device as it is intended by the
manufacturer to be used for medical purposes in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/745.
Classification rule 11 applies, since it relates to software intended to provide information which
is used to take decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes, and classifies this product as at
least class IIa. A higher classification may apply depending on the significance of the
information provided by the device to support the healthcare professional’s decision in the
context of the patient’s condition, as per guidance MDCG 2019-11 and MDCG 2021-24.
1.1.9.3 Needle Counters
Background
There are on the market products generally called needle counters, intended to allow the
counting and to reconcile the count of suture needles and scalpels, after the procedure and before
suturing the operating cavity. These needle counters are designed to facilitate the control of such
small instruments. Some of the models have a magnetic base with numbered spaces and in other
cases a high-density foam to hold them securely in place. There are also models which combine
these solutions and some include a feature which allows to remove the scalpel from the handle
safety, preventing work accidents, as claimed by the manufacturers.
These types of products are placed on the European market with indications such as:
− to guarantee the safe elimination of scalpel blades and suture needles used in operating
rooms;
− to permit counting of scalpel blades and needles used in the operating room.
Some manufacturers claim that their intended use is the prevention of the severe consequences to
the patient’s health if any of such items were to remain on the human body after suturing.
Outcome
Needle counters, intended to allow the counting and reconciling the count of suture needles and
scalpels, as well as their elimination, after the procedure and before suturing the operating cavity,
do not comply with the legal definition of a medical device, according to Article 2 (1) of the
MDR, since they are not intended for any specific medical purpose, and should not be qualified
as such.

18

1.1.9.4 Temperature sensors embedded in orthopaedic devices for compliance tracking
Background
The product in question is a temperature sensor that is intended to be embedded in orthopaedic
devices, for example scoliosis braces. It then tracks the use of the orthopaedic device, which are
typically not very comfortable but have to be worn daily for long periods of time to be effective.
This is done by regularly measuring their temperature, which rises close to body temperature
during wear. The sensor’s purpose is to log when and especially for how long the orthopaedic
devices have been worn. The patients are informed that compliance is being tracked.
The question arose whether the sensor is an accessory for the orthopaedic medical devices it is
intended to be used with. The orthopaedic devices can be used and be performant without the
sensor, but it is claimed that the sensor increases patient compliance and therefore therapeutic
success of the orthopaedic devices, as well as enables the treating doctors to better assess the
effectiveness of prescribed orthopaedic devices by eliminating a possible lack of patient
compliance as a confounding factor.
Outcome
According to Article 2 (2) of the MDR, ‘accessory for a medical device’ means an article which,
whilst not being itself a medical device, is intended by its manufacturer to be used together with
one or several particular medical device(s) to specifically enable the medical device(s) to be used
in accordance with its/their intended purpose(s) or to specifically and directly assist the medical
functionality of the medical device(s) in terms of its/their intended purpose(s).
Neither increasing patient compliance nor providing information to better assess the performance
of a medical device can be said to specifically and directly aid that device’s medical
functionality. The sensor therefore does not specifically and directly assist the medical
functionality of the orthopaedic medical devices in terms of their intended purpose and should
not be qualified as an accessory for a medical device. Furthermore, the product should not be
qualified as a medical device on its own.
1.1.9.5 System intended to produce sclerosing foam
Background
The system is intended to produce sclerosing foam for varicose veins treatment. It consists of
two products to be used in combination: a sterile single use mixing capsule filled with air or with
a mixture of gases (O2/CO2 equal parts), which has a port for the introduction of the sclerosing
agent (medicinal product) and for the extraction of the newly formed foam. Also, the system
includes a reusable digitally programmable electronic stirrer with a lodging designed to
accommodate the capsule.
In order to produce the foam, first, the capsule with the gas is connected to the stirrer, then, the
sclerosing medicinal product is injected into the capsule with a syringe through the port. Due to
the magnetic stirrer, the sclerosing drug and the air are mixed to form a homogenous foam. After
the foam is formed, it is removed by aspiration from the capsule with a syringe that is not
included in the system, in order to be administered to the patient. Therefore, the system itself is
not intended to administer the foam directly to the human body.
19

Outcome
This system is intended by its manufacturer to just produce, in an on-the-spot manner, the
sclerosing foam, which is considered a medicinal product, and that is going to be introduced
afterwards in the body by a syringe which is not part of the system.
In this case, as neither the system itself nor the capsule or the stirrer administer the foam directly
to the patient, being only intended for the preparation of the medicinal product, it can be
concluded that it does not fulfil the definition of a medical device according to Article 2
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and should not be qualified as such.
If a manufacturer of such a system would include in it a CE marked syringe intended to
administer the foam, which is considered a medicinal product, to the human body, as the syringe
is considered a medical device, the system would meet the definition of a procedure pack
according to Article 2 (10) and as referred to in Article 22 of the MDR as it will consist of a
medical device combined with other products, not considered medical devices, packaged
together and placed on the market with a specific medical purpose.
1.1.9.6 Mobile sterile air system
Background
The mobile sterile air system is a product designed to create a defined sterile zone for performing
minor procedures in an operating theatre or medical practice under sterile conditions. To achieve
sterile conditions, the product removes pathogens from the air through filters and creates a
laminar airflow. This laminar flow of purified air creates a protected zone by displacing nonsterile air. The protected zone is defined by laser lines generated by the product, e.g. at the
surgical site. The purpose of the product is therefore to remove dangerous pathogens from a
defined area to reduce the risk of infection to the patient.
Outcome
The product in question enables an appropriate environment to perform medical interventions
without having a specific medical purpose itself. The product therefore controls the environment
and does not act directly in or on the human body. This leads to the conclusion, that the mobile
sterile air system does not comply with the legal definition of a medical device according to Art.
2 (1) MDR and should not be qualified as such.

1.2.7.1 Dermal filler implantable
Background
Dermal fillers are usually devices intended to be used for aesthetic purposes included in the
annex XVI to the MDR. These devices are injected into the skin with a syringe, at different
depths, to help fill in facial wrinkles and provide facial volume. Most of these wrinkle fillers are
temporary (not permanent) because they are eventually absorbed by the body. Most dermal
fillers today are constituted of hyaluronic acid.
There are also dermal fillers which are qualified as medical devices, as they are intended to
compensate for fat loss, e.g. in HIV infected patients with severe facial lipoatrophy, caused by
the highly active antitretroviral therapy. The result of this injection of dermal fillers is the
modification of the anatomy.
According to Article 2(5) of the MDR:
‘implantable device’ means any device, including those that are partially or wholly absorbed,
which is intended:
− to be totally introduced into the human body, or
− to replace an epithelial surface or the surface of the eye,
by clinical intervention and which is intended to remain in place after the procedure.
Outcome
Dermal fillers which are wholly or mainly absorbed, are covered by rules 7 and 8 of Annex VIII
to the MDR, depending on the intended duration of use.
As they are administered by injection, and this is considered a clinical intervention, they fulfil
the definition of an implantable device, according to Article 2(5) of the MDR.

1.2.8.1 Dermal filler implantable

1.2.8.2 n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate based adhesives
Background
The products are n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (nBCA) based adhesives that close the treated vessel
via an adhesive seal. The products are intended for the permanent and complete endovascular
adhesive closure of the great saphenous vein (GSV) and associated varicosities when treating
venous reflux disease.
Different manufacturers have placed on the market these devices as Class IIb and Class III
medical devices per Rule 8 under MDD. The rationale of manufacturers for different
classifications was based on the time of degradation of nBCA.
Therefore, questions have arisen about whether the time of degradation of the embolizing agent
changes the classification approach to Rule 8 of Annex VIII to the MDR.
Outcome
Third indent of rule 8 of Annex VIII to the MDR states that: “All implantable devices and longterm surgically invasive devices are classified as class IIb unless they […] – have a biological
effect or are wholly or mainly absorbed, in which case they are classified as class III.”
According to MDCG 2021-24 guidance: “The term ‘absorption’ in the context of implantable
devices refers to the degradation of a material within the body and the metabolic elimination of
the resulting degradation products from the body. It does not apply to those substances that are
excreted without modification from the body, e.g. insufflation gases for the abdominal cavity or
laparoscopic and endoscopic procedures”.
Considering that in the third indent of rule 8 8 of Annex VIII to the MDR there is no reference to
the time of absorption, these devices should be classified as class III devices.
1.2.8.3 Custom-made cranial implant
Background
The product is a custom-made cranial implant that functions as a replacement for parts of the
skull. It will be specifically made for a patient to replace parts of the skull in order to protect the
brain from the environment.
The intended use of a custom-made skull implant requires that it is placed on the dura mater. The
dura mater is part of the central nervous system since it is the outer layer of the meninges.
Outcome
In a normal situation when the cranium is anatomically intact, the outer layer of the meninges,
the dura mater, touches the skull. A medical device that acts as a replacement of the skull will
therefore come into contact with the dura mater as well. According to point 2.7 of Annex VIII to
the MDR, the brain, meninges and spinal cord are part of the central nervous system.
It is not required that the cranial implant has an effect on or an interaction with the underlying
tissue in order to be classified as a class III medical device. Medical devices that are intended
specifically for use in direct contact with the central nervous system are classified as class III.
22

A custom-made cranial implant is specifically intended to be used in direct contact with the
central nervous system. Therefore, it should be classified as class III, according to the second
indent of rule 8 of annex VIII to the MDR.
1.2.9. Rule 9
1.2.9.1 Argon coagulation units
Background
These units are used in argon plasma coagulation, a monopolar electrosurgical technique where
the argon plasma takes the role of the application electrode, which makes the intervention using
this technique contactless.
The argon coagulation unit ensures the delivery and controlled flow of argon to the argon
electrode. The unit is intended to be connected to two argon cylinders and an electrosurgical
generator. The unit enables adjustment of the argon flow, checks the argon volume in the
connected cylinders and ensures the selection between the connected cylinders.
Outcome
Due to their intended use, i.e. to enable the argon plasma coagulation and the dependence on an
electrical energy source, argon coagulation units are active therapeutic devices. Argon
coagulation units directly influence the argon plasma coagulation where the electrical energy is
administered to the body tissues by the argon plasma stream, which takes the role of the
application electrode. Taking into account the site of application as well as the nature and the
density of the applied energy, argon coagulation units are considered to be delivering energy in a
potentially hazardous way. Therefore, argon coagulation units should be classified as class IIb
devices according to Rule 9.

1.2.16.1 Ethylene oxide gas cartridges
Background
Ethylene oxide (EtO) gas is a sterilant. The product in question is a single-use cartridge
containing 100% EtO. The intended use for these cartridges is to sterilise and disinfect medical
devices.
An EtO gas sterilisation cycle consists of five steps preconditioning and humidification, gas
introduction, exposure, evacuation and air washes. The EtO gas cartridges are used as the source
of EtO. EtO gas cartridges cannot perform the sterilization process by themselves; however, the
sterilization cycle cannot occur, without these cartridges.
Therefore, the question has arisen, as whether EtO gas cartridges should be considered at least as
Class IIa medical devices, since they enable and participate to the sterilization cycle.
Outcome
Rule 16 of the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 states that “[…] All devices intended specifically to be
used for disinfecting or sterilising medical devices are classified as class IIa, unless they are
disinfecting solutions or washer-disinfectors intended specifically to be used for disinfecting
invasive devices, as the end point of processing, in which case they are classified as class IIb.
[…]”
In this case, these products specifically intended to be used for sterilization of medical devices in
healthcare institution are covered by Rule 16 of Annex VIII to the MDR and should be classified
at least as class IIa medical devices.

2.1 Qualification of IVDs
The respective sections will be populated when cases are finalised under the Helsinki Procedure.

2.1.1. Borderline between IVDs and medical devices
This section covers the demarcation between products that may fall under the IVDR or under the
MDR, where the conclusion is that the product should be qualified as an IVD.
2.1.1.1 FeNO measuring device
Background
The product is intended by its manufacturer to be used for the measuring of fractional exhaled
Nitric Oxide (FeNO). NO is a gas produced by cells involved in the inflammation associated
with allergic or eosinophilic asthma. The NO is exhaled, meaning that the NO level, which is
related to the occurrence of some diseases, may be measured in the breath. The patient is
instructed by the healthcare professional to inhale through the filter of the breathing handle and
then to exhale slowly back through the filter.
The product is composed of different parts, where the instruments and breathing handle are
regarded as in vitro diagnostic medical devices, but the disposable filter (viral and bacterial) that
has to be changed for each new measurement session and for each patient is CE marked
according to the Regulation (EU) 2017/745 in class I.
Outcome
The exhaled air is no longer part of the human body and therefore the exhaled air is considered
to be a gaseous specimen derived from the human body, which is subsequently analysed by a
device outside of the body. The device provides information for a medical purpose concerning a
physiological or pathological state, which would qualify this product as an in vitro diagnostic
medical device according to the Regulation (EU) 2017/746.
Since the principal intended purpose of the product is to be used for the examination of
specimens derived from the human body for the purposes of providing information, according to
the definition in Article 2(2) of the Regulation (EU) 2017/746, it is qualified as an in vitro
diagnostic medical device.
