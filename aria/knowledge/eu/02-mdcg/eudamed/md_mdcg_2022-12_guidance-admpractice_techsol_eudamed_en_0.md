Guidance on harmonised administrative practices and alternative

(EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices)
July 2022

This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) established by Article 103 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is composed of representatives of all Member States and it is chaired by a representative of the
European Commission.

INTRODUCTION
Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices1 (MDR) and Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical
devices (IVDR)2 requires the Commission to set up a European database on medical devices (‘Eudamed’). According to paragraph 2 of those
Articles, Eudamed will be composed of six different electronic systems (so called ‘modules’), which facilitate the collation and processing of
information under the MDR and IVDR regarding the registration of relevant economic operators (actor registration), devices and systems and
procedure packs (UDI), notified bodies & certificates, certain aspects of conformity assessment, clinical investigations, performance studies,
vigilance and market surveillance as well as post-market surveillance.
On 30 October 2019, the Commission published a notice3 by which it concluded that the full functionality of Eudamed requires the availability
and full operation of all six modules, both individually and jointly.
Article 113(3)(f) of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) addresses the possibility that Eudamed is not fully
functional on the date of application of the IVDR (26 May 2022). Accordingly, the obligations and requirements in the IVDR that relate to
Eudamed shall apply from the date corresponding to six months after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 34(3) MDR –
notice of full functionality of Eudamed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the IVDR stipulates that the corresponding provisions of Directive
98/79/EC4 shall continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions of Article 113(3)(f) IVDR regarding the
exchange of information.
In addition, Article 113(3)(a) IVDR clarifies that Article 26(3) IVDR on the registration of devices, and Article 51(5) IVDR on the registration of
certificates, start to apply 24 months after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 34(3) MDR.

SCOPE
This document provides guidance to Member States and other relevant parties on the application of certain IVDR provisions during the absence
of Eudamed. To that end, this guidance intends to describe harmonised administrative practices and alternative technical solutions for the
exchange of information until Eudamed becomes fully functional.
The proposed practices and solutions aim to enable Member States and other relevant parties to meet their obligations under the IVDR
effectively while minimising any potential additional burden on the parties concerned. This guidance addresses in particular cases where the
exchange of information would be difficult, or even not possible, to achieve based on the corresponding provisions of Directive 98/79/EC. The
proposed practices and solutions set out in this document do not affect the general obligations of the parties to comply with the applicable
requirements under the IVDR.
Whenever this guidance makes reference to CircaBC5 as alternative solution, the Commission and other relevant parties should endeavour to
make use of already existing CircaBC directories to the extent that this is possible and appropriate.
Parties should also take note of the MDCG Position Paper on the use of the Eudamed actor registration module and of the Single Registration Number
(SRN) in the Member States.6
