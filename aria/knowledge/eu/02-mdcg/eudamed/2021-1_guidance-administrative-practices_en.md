Sentence deleted: “Parties should also note that, in principle and unless otherwise concluded by the MDCG, the reporting

obligations with regard to EUDAMED apply to all information generated and collected under the MDR from its date of
application (e.g. UDI, certificates) and therefore must be carried out as soon as EUDAMED becomes fully functional”

INTRODUCTION
Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices 1 (MDR) requires the Commission to set up a European database on
medical devices (‘EUDAMED’). According to Article 33(2) of the MDR, Eudamed will be composed of six different electronic
systems (so called ‘modules’), which facilitate the collation and processing of information under the MDR regarding the registration
of relevant economic operators (actor registration), devices and systems and procedure packs (UDI), notified bodies & certificates,
certain aspects of conformity assessment, clinical investigations, vigilance and market surveillance as well as post-market
surveillance.
On 30 October 2019, the Commission published a notice2 by which it concluded that the full functionality of EUDAMED requires the
availability and full operation of all six modules, both individually and jointly. The notice foresees the launch of EUDAMED for May
2022, which correlates with the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices 3 (IVDR). In

this regard, it is important to note that the official launch of EUDAMED in May 2022 does not affect the date of application of the
MDR on 26 May 2021.
Article 123(3)(d) MDR addresses the possibility that EUDAMED is not fully functional on the date of application of the MDR (26 May
2021). Accordingly, the obligations and requirements in the MDR that relate to EUDAMED shall apply from the date corresponding
to six months after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 34(3) – notice of full functionality of Eudamed. Until
EUDAMED is fully functional, the MDR stipulates that the corresponding provisions of Directives 90/385/EEC 4 and 93/42/EEC5 shall
continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions of Article 123(3)(d) regarding the exchange
of information.
In addition, Article 123(3)(e) MDR clarifies that Article 29(4) MDR on the registration of devices, and Article 56(5) MDR on the
registration of certificates, start to apply 24 months after the date of publication of the notice referred to in Article 34(3) MDR.
Article 122 is outside scope of this guidance.
SCOPE
This document provides guidance to Member States and other relevant parties on the application of certain MDR provisions during
the absence of EUDAMED. To that end, this guidance intends to describe harmonised administrative practices and alternative
technical solutions for the exchange of information until EUDAMED becomes fully functional.
The proposed practices and solutions aim to enable Member States and other relevant parties to meet their obligations under the
MDR effectively while minimising any potential additional burden on the parties concerned. This guidance addresses in particular
cases where the exchange of information would be difficult, or even not possible, to achieve based on the corresponding provisions
of Directives 90/385/EEC and 93/42/EEC. In doing so, this guidance takes into account the decision of the Medical Device
Coordination Group in its meeting of 12 March 2020 where the group agreed that the Commission makes available to Member
4

Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices, OJ L 189, 20.7.1990,
p. 17–36.

Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices, OJ L 169, 12.7.1993, p. 1–43.

States each EUDAMED module as soon as it is operational. This approach also has an impact on the means by which relevant
information collected under the MDR will be made available to the public, which shall take place on a gradual basis.
The proposed practices and solutions set out in this document do not affect the general obligations of the parties to comply with the
requirements under the MDR, including those contained in the provisions referred to in Article 123(3) letters (d) and (e) MDR.
Whenever this guidance makes reference to CircaBC6 as alternative solution, the Commission and other relevant parties should
endeavour to make use of already existing CircaBC directories to the extent that this is possible and appropriate.
Parties should also take note of the MDCG Position Paper on the use of the EUDAMED actor registration module and of the Single
Registration Number (SRN) in the Member States.7

Manufacturers should note that the obligation of
UDI assignment (Basic UDI and UDI-DI) to a
device applies from 26 May 2021 (Art. 27(3)
MDR). Labelling requirements apply gradually,
starting from 26 May 2021 (Art. 123(3)(f) MDR).

3. For devices that are the subject of a
conformity assessment as referred to in Article
52(3) and in the second and third
subparagraphs of Article 52(4), the

before the manufacturer applies to a notified
body for that assessment. For the devices
referred to in the first subparagraph, the
notified body shall include a reference to the
Basic UDI-DI on the certificate issued in
accordance with point (a) of Section 4 of
Chapter I of Annex XII and confirm in
Eudamed that the information referred to in
Section 2.2 of Part A of Annex VI is correct.
After the issuing of the relevant certificate and
before placing the device on the market, the
manufacturer shall provide the Basic UDI-DI to
the UDI database together with the other core
data elements referred to in Part B of Annex
VI related to that device.
