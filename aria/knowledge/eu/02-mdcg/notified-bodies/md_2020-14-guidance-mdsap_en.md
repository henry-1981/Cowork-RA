Guidance for notified bodies on the use of MDSAP audit
reports in the context of surveillance audits carried out under
the Medical Devices Regulation (MDR)/In Vitro Diagnostic
medical devices Regulation (IVDR)
Background
In fulfilling the EU’s commitment to encourage notified bodies to make use of audit reports from the
Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) in a manner that is compatible with EU legislative
requirements, the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) endorsed this guidance which has
been developed by a group of experts comprised of interested Member State representatives, notified
body associations and stakeholders.

Scope
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to notified bodies on how to take into account
MDSAP Medical Device Regulatory Audit Reports1 (from hereafter “MDSAP audit reports”) issued
by MDSAP auditing organisations2 when performing surveillance audits under Regulation (EU)
2017/745 – Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746 – In Vitro Diagnostic
medical devices Regulation (IVDR). This is of particular use when a manufacturer has undergone an
MDSAP audit and wishes to present this audit report (including the associated attachments) in context
of the regular surveillance audits performed in accordance to the MDR or IVDR.

General regulatory considerations
Under the MDR/IVDR, most conformity assessment procedures consist of both the quality
management system audit and the assessment of a device’s safety and performance. Notified body’s
conformity assessment activities, which are a prerequisite for the manufacturer’s declaration of
conformity, when concluded successfully result in a conformity assessment certificate, a pre-market
requirement for most classes of medical devices and IVDs. In that regard, notified bodies designated
under the MDR/IVDR fulfil roles, which correspond to combined functions of both MDSAP auditing
organisations and MDSAP participating regulatory authorities.3 Therefore, the roles performed by
notified bodies and MDSAP auditing organisations differ as the latter solely perform quality
management system audits which are then utilised by regulatory authorities in their evaluation of a
product’s safety and performance for the purpose of issuing a marketing authorisation.

1

MDSAP audits are recorded using the Medical Device Regulatory Audit Report form (MDSAP AU F0019.1). Final
MDSAP audit reports are signed in section 18 of the form.
2 Auditing Organization: An organization that audits a medical device manufacturer for conformity with quality management
system requirements and other medical device regulatory requirements. Auditing Organizations may be an independent
organization or a Regulatory Authority which perform regulatory audits. (IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 FINAL:2016)
3 Regulatory Authority: A government body or other entity that exercises a legal right to control the use or sale of medical
devices within its jurisdiction, and that may take enforcement action to ensure that medical products marketed within its
jurisdiction comply with legal requirements. (GHTF/SG1/N78:2012, cited from IMDRF/MDSAP WG/N3 FINAL:2016)

Requirements of the MDR/IVDR
The MDR/IVDR clearly state that all manufacturers need to have a quality management system in
place so as to ensure that devices manufactured in series are in conformity with the requirements of the
respective regulation and that experience from the use of devices is taken into account in the
production process (MDR Recital 32/IVDR Recital 31). This becomes an explicit requirement for
manufacturers to establish, document, maintain, keep up to date and continually improve quality
management systems so that to ensure compliance with the Regulations (MDR Article 10 (9)/IVDR
Article 10(8)).
Notified bodies are charged with the assessment of quality management systems of devices in
accordance with MDR Article 52 and IVDR Article 48. Specifically, notified bodies are responsible
for auditing and certifying manufacturers’ quality management systems (MDR/IVDR Annexes IX and
XI and Annex VII section 4.5 ), following up with appropriate surveillance audits (MDR/IVDR Annex
IX section 3 and Annex VII section 4.5.1, 4.10) as well as conducting unannounced audits
(MDR/IVDR Annex VII section 4.5.1). Notified bodies are also responsible for the development of
their appropriate procedures for conformity assessments according to the MDR /IVDR.
The MDR/IVDR specifically state that notified bodies’ audit programmes should clearly identify the
number and sequence of activities required to demonstrate complete coverage of a manufacturer’s
quality management system (MDR/IVDR Annex VII 4.5.2) and that surveillance audits need to be
carried out on at least an annual basis (MDR/IVDR Annex VII section 4.10 and Annex IX section
3.3). For each surveillance audit identified in the audit programme, the objectives, criteria and scope of
the surveillance audit are defined in an audit plan which adequately addresses and takes into account
specific requirements for the devices, technologies and processes involved (MDR/IVDR Annex VII
section 4.5.2(a) – third bullet point). Surveillance audits are expected to gather sufficient information
to verify the proper implementation of the quality management system and ensure that it continues to
comply with the requirements of the MDR/IVDR.

When and how to take MDSAP audit reports into account
It is important to stress that the MDR/IVDR remain applicable in their entirety. The use of MDSAP
audit reports within the EU legislative framework is possible only where the MDSAP audit covers
similar or equivalent MDR/IVDR requirements. Designated notified bodies maintain the full authority
over their judgement, conclusion and final decision about the conformity of quality management
systems to the relevant provisions of the MDR/IVDR and the safety and performance of medical
devices and IVDs intended to be placed on the market in the EU.
Given that surveillance audits, their periodicity and EU auditors’ competencies are mandated by law,
yearly surveillance audits need to be maintained. However, it could be possible to take into account
the scope and outputs of manufacturers’ recent MDSAP audit reports as an input for developing
surveillance audit programmes. The taking into account of MDSAP audit reports could define in a
more precise manner the activities to be performed during a surveillance audit. For example, the
positive quality management system conformity appraisal through MDSAP might lead to a reduction
3

of the focus on aspects already covered by MDSAP audit reports. The notified body may then focus
their surveillance audit on specific MDR/IVDR requirements which are either not covered or only
partially covered by the MDSAP audit report. Non-exhaustive list of examples (alphabetical order):
- clinical evaluation/performance evaluation process (including post-market
clinical/performance follow-up),
- EU authorised representative contractual provisions,
- EU UDI assignments within the quality management system,
- manufacturer financial coverage in respect of potential liability,
- person responsible for regulatory compliance qualification and role,
- records control,
- system for risk management,
- vigilance and post market surveillance activities, including the associated corrective actions
and preventive actions.
Similarly, non-conformities identified in recent MDSAP audit reports can trigger the notified body to
pay particular attention to those aspects in the MDR/IVDR planned surveillance audit.
It is important to highlight the following details:
-

-

-

The taking into account of MDSAP audit reports is not applicable to initial quality
management system audits required for the issuing of EU QMS certificates. Notified bodies
designated under the MDR/IVDR would always need to conduct these audits in their entirety.
The taking into account of MDSAP audit reports is not applicable to MDR/IVDR
unannounced audits.
Reports of MDSAP unannounced audits or special audits should not be taken into account in
the narrowing of focus in MDR/IVDR surveillance audits.
Regular surveillance audits would still take place on a yearly basis. However, the positive
QMS conformity appraisal through an MDSAP audit may lead to a limitation of the
surveillance focus from aspects already covered by the MDSAP audit reports.
When MDSAP audit reports are considered as input to the planning of an MDR/IVDR
surveillance audit, these reports should be taken into account in their complete form, including
all associated attachments. Both positive and negative statements about the conformity of the
manufacturer should be incorporated in the planning of the MDR/IVDR audit.

If there is concern about the functioning of the quality management system, for instance due to
information gathered through the assessment of vigilance cases or post market activities, previous
surveillance audits or technical documentation assessments, a complete surveillance audit should be
carried out.
Notified bodies may wish to determine and establish additional guidance in order to support their
procedures for evaluating MDSAP audit reports. Such guidance could for example specify the content
details of MDSAP audit reports considered acceptable (i.e. may be taken into consideration) in the
notified body assessment programme and what modifications may be done to the notified body
assessment programme after the taking into consideration of the MDSAP audit report (to ensure that
4

any specific assessment items that are not covered in the MDSAP audit reports are performed by the
notified body).
The notified body shall remain fully responsible for its decision, to whether or not, and to what extent,
an MDSAP audit report can be taken into account.
The Annex to this guidance identifies and analyses aspects within MDSAP audit reports that are
relevant in relation to the EU requirements. Part I focuses on providing an explanation of where to find
relevant information in MDSAP audit reports that could be used to a greater or lesser extent as
supporting evidence for MDR/IVDR quality management system requirements. Part II provides
examples on how correlations between MDR requirements to sections of MDSAP audit reports may
be established in the notified bodies’ additional guidance or procedures. Although the examples in Part
II focus on MDR requirements, the same methodology could be applied for the IVDR.

Section 3 – Certification Schemes, Scopes
& Criteria, Audit Types

Certification schemes with scope of certification, audit type and audit criteria.
In some cases, a list of medical devices covered in the scope is attached to the audit report.
The “CE marking” scheme may be referenced, but this is not mandatory.
For unannounced audits, it is important to understand that they are commonly performed to verify
effectiveness of corrective actions on non-conformities, and their content is not the same as that of
unannounced audits under MDR/IVDR.

Part II – Examples on how correlations between MDR requirements to sections of MDSAP audit reports may be established
The following examples of established correlations between MDR quality management system requirements and the MDSAP Audit Model show how certain
overlapping requirements may be covered in MDSAP audit reports, and what specific MDR requirements are not covered. The references direct to MDSAP audit
processes and tasks that overlap with MDR requirements and are linked to same or similar ISO 13485 requirements.
It is recommended that notified bodies develop more detailed guidance for determining the extent in which MDR/IVDR quality management system requirements
correlate to those covered in MDSAP audit reports. Any such fully developed correlation should be revised in the event of a publication of changes to any basic
criteria document including EN ISO 13485, MDSAP Audit Model and MDR/IVDR, or any document utilised to establish correlation, such as CEN/TR 172236.
The examples provided in the below table cover only the following three blocks of MDR requirements: Clinical evaluation, Supplier controls, and Post-market
surveillance.
