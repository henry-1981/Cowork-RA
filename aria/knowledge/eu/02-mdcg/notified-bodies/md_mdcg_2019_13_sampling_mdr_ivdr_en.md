1 Introduction
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) and Regulation (EU) 2017/746
on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) establish the requirements for sampling
of Class IIa / Class IIb and Class B / Class C devices for the assessment of the
technical documentation.
Article 52(4) and (6) of the MDR and Article 48(7) and (9) of the IVDR establish the
need to assess the technical documentation of at least one representative device per
generic device group (for Class IIb and Class C) and for each category of devices
(for Class IIa and Class B) prior to issuing the certificate.
Section 2.3 and 3.4 of Annex IX of both Regulations (and section 10 of Annex XI of
the MDR) defines that the quality management system assessment has to be
accompanied by the assessment of technical documentation for devices selected on
a representative basis.
Section 4.5.2(a) of Annex VII of both Regulations1 requires the notified body to draw
up and keep up to date, a sampling plan for the assessment of technical
documentation as referred to in Annexes II and III prior to the audit.
Section 4.5.2(b) of Annex VII requires the notified body to assess the technical
documentation as preparation for the audit(s). This assessment is expected to be
finalised in due time of such audit(s).

2 Scope
This guidance is intended to define the requirements of sampling for Class IIa and
Class IIb devices under the MDR and Class B and Class C devices under the IVDR
for the purpose of assessing the technical documentation.
This guidance defines and further elaborates on the sampling criteria and use of such
criteria for drawing up and maintaining a sampling plan.
In addition, this guidance clarifies the tasks to be performed by the notified body
including the applicability of Chapter II of Annex IX of both Regulations and the
extent of the technical documentation assessment.
See Section 5.3 for exemptions for specific types of devices.

3 Definitions
The Regulations do not contain definitions of certain terms applicable to sampling,
and in some instances certain definitions given cannot be used on an operational
level. Therefore, only for the purpose of this guidance the following definitions
apply:

3.1. Category of devices: category of devices should be understood as the
relevant MDA/MDN codes (MDR) or IVR codes (IVDR) according to
Regulation (EU) 2017/2185 on the codes for the designation of notified
bodies.
3.2. Generic device group2: is to be understood:
• in respect of the MDR3,4 as the 4th level of the European Nomenclature
on Medical Devices (EMDN) 5, 6 (i.e. combination of one letter plus 6
digits), and

• in respect of the IVDR as the 3rd level of the EMDN (i.e. combination of
one letter plus 4 digits respectively) in combination with the most
appropriate IVP code.

3.3. Device range: device range is to be understood as all “device categories" for
Class IIa and Class B devices and all “generic device groups” for Class IIb
and Class C devices covered in a certificate.

3.4. Device: device should be understood as the device(s) associated with one
Basic UDI-DI7.
3.5. QMS certificates: QMS certificates are EU quality management system
certificates (MDR and IVDR), EU quality assurance certificates (MDR) and
EU production quality assurance certificates (IVDR) issued by notified bodies
as a result of conformity assessments.

"A set of devices having the same or similar intended purposes or a commonality of technology allowing them
to be classified in a generic manner not reflecting specific characteristics" (Art. 2 (7) MDR and Art. 2(8) IVDR).
3
In cases, where the 4th level for the MDR does not exist the notified body should use the next higher level.
4
If the notified body considers that for a particular device level 4 for the MDR/level 3 for the IVDR is not
sufficiently specific to define a generic device group, it can use the next lower level if available.

6
In case where more than one EMDN code applies to one device, only the most appropriate one of these
EMDN codes will be assigned for sampling purposes. The technical documentation related to that particular
device will be assessed in its entirety.

4 Sampling criteria
The Regulations establish minimum requirements for sampling prior to issuing the
certificate and during its validity.
The notified body will ensure that these
requirements will be complied with when drawing up a sampling plan. In addition,
other considerations have to be observed in order to ensure an adequate coverage
of devices on a representative basis.
4.1. Quantitative Sampling Criteria
4.1.1. Sampling prior to issuing a QMS certificate
The Regulations establish the need for the notified body to assess technical
documentation for a number of devices prior to issuing the QMS certificate:
- For Class IIb and Class C the technical documentation of at least one
representative device per generic device group (as per Article 52(4) of the
MDR and Article 48(7) of the IVDR). This means that the notified body should
assess how many generic device groups as per 3.2 are covered in the
application (how many nomenclature's 4th levels for MDR / 3rd levels in
combination with applicable IVP codes for the IVDR8), select per group at least
one representative device covered by a Basic UDI-DI and assess the technical
documentation for the device(s) selected.
- For Class IIa and Class B the technical documentation of at least one
representative device per category of devices (as per Article 52(6) of the MDR
and Article 48(9) of the IVDR). This means that the notified body should asses
how many categories of devices as per section 3.1, (how many MDA/MDN or
IVR codes), are covered by the manufacturer’s application, select per category
at least one representative device covered by a Basic UDI-DI (MDA/MDN or
IVR code) and assess the technical documentation for the device(s) selected.
The outcome of these assessments is an essential input for the final review
according to Annex VII section 4.7 of the Regulations prior to issuing of the
certificate.
4.1.2. Sampling during surveillance
After issuing the certificate, the notified body will continue to assess technical
documentation in line with the sampling plan. Section 3.5 of Annex IX of both
Regulations indicates that surveillance assessment shall also include an assessment
8

Generic device groups for Class C devices will consist on an EMDN + an IVP code. Therefore, when different
products are covered under the same EMDN but corresponds to different IVP codes, the notified body will
assign the most appropriate IVDP code to each device.

of the technical documentation9 which means that at least one technical
documentation must be reviewed each year.
In addition, notified bodies will ensure that the entire device range is covered during
the period of validity of the certificates as required by Section 4.5.2 (a) of Annex VII.
This means that at least one device per each category, in case of Class IIa and Class
B devices, and at least one device per each generic device group, in case of Class
IIb and Class C devices, should be sampled and the relevant technical
documentation assessed between the issue of a certificate and its expiry date.
Furthermore, in addition to the above-mentioned criteria, the number of samples to
be assessed need to be selected on a representative basis (as per Annex VII 4.5.1
9th indent MDR, Annex IX 2.3 3rd paragraph MDR / IVDR, and Annex VII 4.5.1 8th
indent IVDR). Therefore, in developing the sampling plan (see section 6), the notified
body should also ensure that the number of devices sampled is proportionate to the
total number of devices contained in the certificate. For this purpose, it is expected
that 15%10 of devices from each category and from each generic device group
covered in the certificate will be sampled during its validity – taking into account the
maximum validity of 5 years.
In cases where the certificate contains very few devices and the technical
documentations of these have been already reviewed, it is expected that during
surveillance audits the notified body will focus on the review of the technical
documentation related to post-market surveillance in accordance with Annex III.
Normally, the devices to be sampled after the certificate has been issued would be
spread evenly during the validity of the certificate. However, the notified body might
decide to perform different numbers of reviews in a given year for different reasons
(e.g. workload, vigilance concern) as long as throughout the surveillance period all
initially determined assessments are performed. Such an approach is acceptable as
long as the minimum requirements mentioned in the first paragraph of this section
are complied with.
4.2. Qualitative Sampling Criteria
Section 2.3 of Annex IX of both Regulations establishes qualitative criteria to be used
when drawing up sampling plans. While some of these criteria such as similarities in
design, technology and manufacturing and sterilisation methods may be covered
already by the fact that devices belong to the same category or generic device group,

9

The follow-up of change notifications according to Section 4.9 of Annex VII (e.g. “the device range covered” in
Annex IX section 2.4), and other surveillance activities as laid down in Section 4.10 of Annex VII are to be
carried out in addition to sampling during surveillance.
10
The 15% may be decreased to a minimum of 5% until the overall ongoing revision of this guidance document
will be published.

all the criteria defined in Section 2.3 of Annex IX including novelty of the technology
intended purpose or the results of any previous relevant assessments such as with
regard to physical, chemical, biological or clinical properties must be individually
considered when prioritising the review of one device over another. This prioritisation
should take into account the inherent risk of the different devices included in the
relevant category of devices / generic device group which means that, for instance,
novel devices, will usually be prioritised over well-known technologies (unless there
are specific concerns over the latter). Additional criteria may be also taken into
consideration by the notified body11. As required by the Regulation, the notified body
must document its rationale for the samples taken, in particular, mentioning what
specific criteria have been taken into account.
It should be noted, that as long as there are devices that have not been sampled,
each device should only be sampled once during the period of validity of the
certificate unless vigilance cases or other information which have been brought to the
notified body’s attention will require it.

5 Assessment of the technical documentation
5.1. Depth of the assessment
The depth and extent of the technical documentation assessment of Class IIa / IIb
and Class B / Class C devices will be the same as the depth of assessment carried
out for Class III and Class IIb implantable and Class D devices.
This means that the technical documentation of a device shall be assessed against
all General Safety and Performance Requirements (Annex I) and requirements of
Annex II and III. Records of the assessment shall be prepared which allow a third
party to understand the functionality of the device and all aspects of the assessment
including judgements made by the assessor.
It should be taken into account that every device (i.e. Basic UDI-DI) might include
different variants, models or sizes. In that case, the review of the technical
documentation will also include the assessment of how the differences among these
have been addressed in the technical documentation and whether all of them are in
line with the relevant requirements.
5.2. Applicability of Chapter II, Section 4 of Annex IX

11

For instance, where controls or calibrators are specifically intended to be used in conjunction with a specific
IVD device, these controls or calibrators will preferably be assessed alongside that device

Taking into account the wording of articles 52(4) and 52(6) of the MDR and Article
48(7) and 48(9) of the IVDR, as combined with annexes VII and IX, the tasks to be
carried out by the notified body as part of the conformity assessment activities
described in Chapter II, Section 4 of Annex IX comprise the complete review of the
technical documentation in accordance with Annexes II and III.
In addition, the manufacturer will grant access to the technical documentation as
referred to in Section 2.2 of Annex IX and the notified body will provide the
manufacturer with a report on the technical documentation assessment. For Class IIa
/ IIb and Class B / Class C the notified body will neither require an application nor
issue an EU technical documentation assessment certificate (see 5.3 for exceptions).
5.3. Additional requirements for specific types of devices under the MDR
and the IVDR
For class IIb implantable devices12, Article 52(4) second subparagraph of the MDR
establishes the need to review the technical documentation in accordance with the
complete Section 4 of Annex IX for every device, therefore an application as well as
the issuance of an EU technical documentation assessment certificate are required.
They are exempt from sampling.
According to Article 54, Class IIb active devices intended to administer and/or
remove a medicinal product falling into rule 12 of Annex VIII are subject to the clinical
evaluation consultation procedure prior to issuing of the certificate. These devices
can be subject to sampling but according to Articles 54(3) and 55 the notified body
must ensure that at least the clinical evaluation assessment report (CEAR) for each
device is uploaded in Eudamed prior to issuing the QMS certificate. This means that
the sampling will not apply to the clinical evaluation as it has to be assessed for every
device.
Article 48 (7, 8 and 9) and Section 5 of Annex IX of the IVDR establish that class B
and C devices for self-testing, near-patient testing and companion diagnostics are
exempt from sampling. The manufacturer will lodge an application as per sections 5.1
(a) and 5.2 (a) of Annex IX of the IVDR, and, as described in section 5.1 (c-e) and 5.2
(a-e), the notified body will review the technical documentation of all the devices
covered in the certificate and will issue an EU technical documentation assessment
certificate.
5.4. Reporting
The technical documentation assessment of Class IIa / IIb and Class B / Class C
devices and its reporting should follow the principles established in Annex VII and the
12

Except for sutures, dental fillings, dental braces, tooth crowns, screws, wedges, plates, wires, pins, clips and
connectors, which are subject to sampling

applicable provisions of the conformity assessment annexes and should use or be
similar to those procedures and checklists developed by the notified body for the
assessment of Class III / IIb implantable devices and Class D devices.
In order to fulfil the legal requirements, the reporting requirements established in
Section 4.6. of Annex VII will apply.

6 Drawing up and keeping up to date a sampling plan
According to Section 4.5.2(a) of Annex VII the notified body shall draw up and keep
up to date a sampling plan. This plan should contain at least the devices covered by
the certificate, their Basic UDI-DI, the generic device group (in case of Class IIb), the
generic device group plus the IVP code (in case of Class C devices) or the category
of devices (in case of Class IIa / Class B devices), the identifier of the respective
technical documentation, the (planned) assessment dates and the status of such
assessments.
The notified body should update the sampling plan whenever needed on the basis of
the criteria defined in this guidance as well as on the basis of its post-certification
activities laid down in Section 4.10 of Annex VII. In particular, the outcome of the
screening of relevant sources of scientific and clinical data and post-market
information relating to the scope of their designation, or the review of vigilance data
should be taken into account.
If the manufacturer makes a change in the product range during the period of validity
of the certificate, the notified body should review the sampling plan accordingly.
When adding new devices to the scope of the certificate which do not fall into the
already covered generic device groups / categories of devices, the initial sampling
criteria (section 4.1) apply.
If the manufacturer applies for re-certification, the notified body should update the
sampling plan with the samples to be assessed during the upcoming certification
period according to the principles laid down under section 4.1.2 Sampling during
surveillance and keep the sampling plan up to date as described above.
