MDCG 2018-8

In the meeting of 30 November 2018, MDCG endorsed the below positions. These
positions will be part of a more comprehensive guideline related to notified bodies,
currently under development.

Content of the certificate under MDR / IVDR Annex XII, Chapter II, section 10
Certificates do not need to include reference to relevant common specifications or
harmonised standards as long as such information on all examinations and tests
performed is traceable and available from e.g. report(s) which are mentioned in the
certificate.

Voluntary certificate transfer under MDR Article 58 / IVDR Article 53
While MDR Article 58(1) / IVDR Article 53(1) sets out the requirements for a transfer
agreement, it does not specify the conformity assessment activities to be performed
by the incoming NB. The incoming NB may decide not to carry out full conformity
assessment activities according to Article 52 MDR / Article 48 IVDR, as long as it
does have sufficient information in respect to the conformity activities performed by
the outgoing NB.
For quality management system certificates, the incoming NB needs to perform
appropriate on-site audit(s) and assessments to ensure that the manufacturer in
question applies the approved QMS and the post-market surveillance plan prior to
the issue of any certificate. In respect to the assessment of technical documentations
on a sampling basis, the oncoming NB shall review the previous assessment results
together with a sample of a technical documentation and draw up or amend a
sampling plan. For product certificates (Annex IX Chapter II/Annex X), new
certificates without a comprehensive (initial) review may be issued as long as the
documentation received does not identify ongoing existing or other concerns.
The incoming NB assumes full responsibility for the new certificates issued following
the transfer.
