MDCG 2023-2
List of standard fees

January 2023

This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG)
established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is composed of
representatives of all Member States and it is chaired by a representative of the
European Commission.
The document is not a European Commission document and it cannot be regarded as
reflecting the official position of the European Commission. Any views expressed in this
document are not legally binding and only the Court of Justice of the European Union
can give binding interpretations of Union law.

Introduction
Article 50 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on Medical Devices (MDR) and Article 46 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR) establish the
requirement for notified bodies to make their standard fees publicly available: “Notified
bodies shall establish lists of their standard fees for the conformity assessment
activities that they carry out and shall make those lists publicly available“. Neither the
MDR nor the IVDR do provide any definition of “standard fees” itself.
When setting their fees, Notified Bodies also need to consider Annex VII 1.2.8 of the
MDR and IVDR about their terms and conditions being fair and reasonable and taking
into account the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises as defined in
Recommendation 2003/361/EC.

Publication of “Lists of Standard Fees”
MDCG clarified the meaning of “publicly available”, which “implies that a member of the
public can access this information at any point in time, without the need for additional
steps.” (MDCG guidance 2019-6 section V.2.). This implies the list of fees of each
notified body should be directly and easily accessible on the website of the notified body
without any additional steps, e.g. without the need to register as a user of the website or
provide contact data. This website should be the website registered for the notified body
on NANDO and not a different website of another organization. The format of the
standard fee table could be any that is accessible on a common website browser.
The currency shown should be relevant to the country where the notified body has its
registered place of business (in line with the information provided in NANDO). If there
are regional differences in fees charged depending on the location of manufacturer, this
should also be indicated.
Language
The list of standard fees should be written in the same language as the website of the
notified body. In case of multiple language formats, the list should be also available in
the same languages1.

See also MDR / IVDR Annex VII section 2.2 “Where documents are used in various languages, the notified body
shall ensure and control that they have the same content.”

Scope and explanation for “List of Standard Fee” items
The templates for “List of Standard Fees” provided in this guidance document are
intended to assist notified bodies defining their list of fees for publication in accordance
with MDR Article 50 and IVDR Article 46. Notified bodies can decide the way how they
charge for their services and should have documented procedures relating to fees
charged for conformity assessment activities. The fee setting should be transparent,
items should be clearly indicated in the published list of standard fees. The list of fees
may include but is not limited to the items listed below. The published list needs to cover
all activities corresponding to the scope of the notified body’s designation and the
conformity assessment activities which are regularly offered.
Fees can be charged as
-

“flat fees”, i.e. fixed fees that do not depend on the time and resources needed
but which should adequately be based on actually incurred costs

-

“time-based fees”, i.e. fee items based on the time allocated for the activity.

Notified bodies should indicate the type of fee for each fee item, i.e. if it is fixed or time
based. In addition to such fees, duly justified external costs should be claimed as
expenditure (e.g. travel expenses, costs for external testing).
In case fees depend on factors other than time, those should be clearly stated. It is
possible to express the expected fees as a range (minimum to maximum value for each
fee item), indicating the factors that influence the fee to be paid. Overall, for each item
shown, these factors should allow for a rough estimation of the overall cost for the
respective conformity assessment activity.
Notified bodies should also indicate how the interests of small and medium-sized
enterprises as defined in Recommendation 2003/361/EC are taken into account.
The quotation and fees actually charged, including individual items for an individual
project, can be different for individual devices due to factors not considered in a list of
standard fees. In case of substantial difference between the quotation and the final fee
charged, notified bodies should notify manufacturers about the discrepancy and duly
justify this adjustment.
