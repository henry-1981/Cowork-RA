1 INTRODUCTION
This guidance document is intended for conformity assessment bodies (CABs), notified
bodies (NBs), designating authorities (DAs), and Joint Assessment Teams (JATs) involved
in Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (hereafter MDR) and Regulation (EU)
2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (hereafter IVDR). It should be read in
conjunction with the guidance document MDCG 2022-13 “Designation, re-assessment and
notification of conformity assessment bodies and notified bodies”1.
This document aims to provide guidance for:
−

−

−

NBs2 when establishing the corrective and preventive action (CAPA) plan to address
the non-compliances (NCs) resulting from joint assessments according to Article
39(5) of the MDR or Article 35(5) of the IVDR,
authorities responsible for notified bodies (hereafter, the DAs) when conducting
reviews of and providing opinions on CAPA plans of notified bodies according to
Article 39(7) of the MDR or Article 35(7) of the IVDR and
JATs when considering the CAPA plan and the DA’s opinion thereon according to
Article 39(7) of the MDR or Article 35(7) of the IVDR.

The use of the templates in Annex I (hereafter CAPA template) and Annex II (hereafter JAT
review template) to this guidance is not mandatory. However, using them according to this
guidance to structure CAPA plans and conduct their reviews will facilitate an efficient,
consistent and timely CAPA review process for NBs, DAs and JATs.
The formal list of non-compliances from the on-site assessment provided by the DA serves
as the input to the CAPA process. When completing the CAPA template, the wording, legal
references, and classification of the NC(s) should be restated without modification. This
includes the official DG SANTE translation of the NC, if applicable and provided3.
Clear and traceable communication throughout the CAPA process is crucial to ensure an
efficient review by the JAT of CAPA plans confirmed by the DA, as well as the DA's opinion
regarding those CAPA plans, ultimately facilitating the JAT’s final opinion.

2 SCOPE
This document provides guidance for CABs, NBs, DAs and JATs on using the templates in
Annex I and Annex II during assessments of NBs and CABs under the MDR and the IVDR.
These templates are primarily designed for re-assessments of NBs. However, they can also
be applied during assessments of CABs applying for designation as an NB, assessments
relating to extensions of an NB’s scope of designation, and assessments relating to
challenges to an NB’s competence under Article 47 MDR or Article 43 IVDR. While this

Reference to NBs throughout this document may also be considered relevant to CABs.

MDCG 2022-13 describes the official DG SANTE translations of the NCs in the last paragraph of section 2.2.5.

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
guidance document provides comprehensive information, it's important to note that specific
guidance may not be applicable in every context. For example, the requirement for
containment actions may not be relevant during designation assessments (see Section 4.1).
The CAPA template is not designed to be used by DAs to document the NCs raised during
assessments as DAs may have their own template for this purpose. However, if it suits their
needs, DAs may use it for this purpose too.

3 TIMELINES OF THE PROCESS
The timelines for the process are described in MDCG 2022-13. Stakeholders should
familiarise themselves with that guidance and aim to implement the timelines described.

4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE NB
If the DA has not already done so, the NB should transfer all NCs from the DA’s assessment
report/list into the CAPA template. This should be done exactly as stated and including legal
references, classification and the official DG SANTE translations of the NCs, if applicable
and provided.
It is recommended that the NB completes the relevant sections of the CAPA template in as
much detail as possible, focusing on providing clear, comprehensive and appropriate
information to enable the DA and JAT to effectively review and make an informed
assessment of the information provided. The NB may also consider providing supporting
evidence (e.g. updated procedures, new templates, …) together with the completed CAPA
template, if deemed helpful for the understanding and assessment of the information
provided by the NB in the CAPA template.
The NB should assign a person responsible for implementing corrections, corrective and
preventive actions and actions to verify their effectiveness. This should be documented in
the template along with the target date(s) for the implementation.
The completed CAPA plan and, where appropriate, supporting evidence should be sent to
the DA by the timeframe communicated by the DA4.
If the DA has classified a finding as an observation5 and communicated specific
expectations, the NB is encouraged to meet these expectations as part of ensuring effective
CAPA management. Additionally, the NB may consider taking steps to address any
observation which could involve improving the current situation or implementing preventive
measures to avoid similar issues in the future.

4.1 Corrections
In this section of the CAPA template, the NB should provide a detailed description of all
corrections, whether they are containment actions or not.

4
5

Language considerations for CAPA plans are addressed in sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of MDCG 2022-13.
An observation (MDCG 2022-13, section 2.2.4) is a finding requiring attention from the NB but does not breach a legal
requirement. MDR/IVDR and MDCG 2022-13 are silent on specific actions for observations.

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
A ‘correction’ is an action to correct or eliminate a detected NC in whole or in part.6
An ‘containment action’ (also called a ‘’immediate correction’) is a correction that the NB
should take without any unjustified delay to address an identified risk or safety issue, aiming
to control the situation and prevent further (potential) harm7. Examples which may require a
containment action include cases when the DA or JAT detected failure of the NB to
adequately assess the validation of the sterilisation process, a certificate which the NB
issued having overlooked an open major non-conformity impacting the device safety or
performance, or a certificate issued out of the scope of designation (and competence).
Containment actions may include for example immediate restriction of the scope of a
certificate or suspension of a certificate.
Upon identification of an NC, the NB’s first step is to consider and, where appropriate,
implement one or more containment actions. Additional corrections may be deemed
necessary following the full investigation of the NC.
The NB should also provide evidence (documents or adequate information) of the
implementation of these corrections, where appropriate: particularly for containment actions
and corrections deemed necessary by the DA.
The NB should consider the potential impact of each correction on its quality management
system (QMS) as a whole. This includes:
•

•

•

6
7

The impact on other documents, processes or procedures.
For example, if the revision of a deficient procedure has an impact on other
procedures/processes, all these procedures/processes should be reviewed,
assessed and revised as appropriate.
The impact on other conformity assessment projects and existing certificates.
For example, if a deficient sterilisation checklist has had a critical impact on how the
NB has assessed ‘sterilisation’ in its conformity assessment projects, not only the
project in which the finding was raised as an NC, but all those projects affected by
the same deficient checklist should be reviewed, assessed and corrected as
appropriate.
The identification of similar shortcomings. The NB should identify issues in other
parts of the QMS, even before the root cause is determined.
For example, if a deficient checklist for assessing the validation of the sterilisation
process is identified, the NB should also consider whether checklists used for the
assessment of other sterilisation methods have the same or a similar weakness. If
so, potentially affected projects using those checklists might also require review and
correction.

ISO 9000:2015 Clause 3.12.3, modified.
While ‘containment action’ and ‘immediate correction’ are common terms in quality engineering, they are not explicitly defined
in the MDR, regulatory guidance or relevant ISO standards. For example, the 8D method, a well-known quality problemsolving approach, describes these concepts.

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
4.2 Root cause(s)
The core issues that caused the NC should be identified through a comprehensive root
cause analysis. The NB should use a set of analysis and problem-solving techniques aimed
at investigating in detail the NC, considering both the severity (e.g. major or minor) and the
extent of the NC (e.g. single occurrence, reoccurrence, systemic issue). The root cause
analysis should identify the actual root causes or the reasons that caused the NC and not
just how to eliminate the symptoms of the issue8. It should be noted that there may be more
than one (root) cause for an NC.

Some tips for root cause analysis
It may be helpful to first identify the direct cause, i.e., the cause that directly resulted in
the NC, followed by the underlying and contributing causes, i.e., causes that
contributed to the NC but would not have directly caused it on their own. Finally,
identify the root cause, i.e. the initiating cause of the causal chain that led to that
specific NC and which, once removed, would prevent the recurrence of the NC.
The root cause may not only apply to the individual NC but may have implications for a
wider range of possible NCs. It is the most fundamental aspect of the cause that can
logically be identified and corrected.
It may be useful for the NB to consider including at least the following areas for review
(not exhaustive):

8

The European standard EN 62740:2015 describes a structured approach for root cause analysis (RCA), selecting appropriate
techniques, and understanding their strengths and weaknesses. While not specific to medical devices nor notified bodies, it
offers valuable principles for RCA within quality management systems.

Management-related Issues
➢
➢
➢
➢
➢

Inadequate control?
Poor work organisation/planning?
Inadequate supervision?

The NB should:
1. Identify the problem: For instance, if a staff member follows a flawed procedure
and this leads to an NC, the primary issue is the defective procedure itself
rather than the staff member’s actions. However, if the staff member had
received training for the task and was expected to identify the flaw in the
procedure, then there may also be a personnel issue.
2. Identify the causes: Determine the conditions or actions immediately preceding
and surrounding the problem (i.e., the reasons why the problem occurred).
3. Identify the root cause(s): Trace back to the fundamental reasons why the
causes in the preceding step existed. The root cause is the fundamental reason
that, if corrected, will prevent its recurrence and the occurrence of similar noncompliances. This root cause is the stopping point in the assessment of causal
factors. It is the place where, with appropriate corrective action, the problem will
be eliminated and will not recur.

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
IMPORTANT
Focus on Systems, Not Individuals: Identifying a staff member as being at fault is rarely
the true root cause of non-compliance. Instead, focus on uncovering systemic issues
that contribute to these situations. This approach leads to more effective corrective
actions and prevents future occurrences.
Beyond Restatement: Simply repeating or rewriting the non-compliance or explaining it
is not acceptable as a description of the root causes. Effective root cause analysis
delves deeper.

4.3 Corrective and preventive actions
This section in the CAPA template focuses on corrective and preventive actions. As defined
in Article 2 (67) MDR and Article 2 (70) IVDR, a corrective action is ‘any action taken to
eliminate the cause of a potential or actual non-conformity or other undesirable situation’. In
case of an actual NC, CAPAs aim to prevent recurrence. The NB should select CAPAs that
are appropriate to the classification and severity of the NC. These CAPAs should be
comprehensive, outlining the actions identified to address the root causes and should
describe any related preventive actions. For major NCs, the NB should also demonstrate
evidence of implementation for both corrective and preventive actions.
CAPAs consist of improvements to the NB’s processes to eliminate the causes of NCs, to
correct and eliminate recurring NCs and to prevent a potential NC from occurring. The
corrective actions identified to eliminate the causes of the NC should be clearly linked and
consistent with the causes identified in the root cause analysis section. Corrective actions
should address systemic issues. For example, simply changing a procedure and providing
training to personnel on the revised procedure may not be appropriate or sufficient to
address systemic issues that may have contributed to the NC.
When identifying root causes and corrective actions, the NB should also consider whether
potential NCs have not (yet) been identified and take preventive actions to avoid them. For
example, if one of the causes was a lack of in-depth knowledge of a sterilisation method by
the author of the sterilisation procedure, the NB should review other sterilisation procedures
written by the same author and act (if appropriate), even if no NC was raised regarding these
other procedures during the joint assessment. This approach ensures a comprehensive
review of potential issues.
In general, root cause analysis, corrections, corrective and preventive actions should
address the actual NC and associated potential NCs throughout the NB’s QMS (e.g. sitespecific procedures; amended SOP in one language which was not translated, leading to
discrepancy between the same SOP in different languages).

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
Some tips on corrective actions
Firstly, the NB should identify the corrective action(s) for each (root) cause and then
ensure that they are feasible. For this reason, it may be useful to consider the
following:
-

Will the corrective action prevent recurrence?
Is the corrective action feasible?
Do the corrective actions address all the causes?
Will training be required as part of the implementation?
In what time frame can the corrective actions be implemented?
What resources are required to successfully develop the corrective actions?
What resources are required for successful implementation and continued
effectiveness of the corrective actions?
Is the implementation of the corrective actions measurable? (For example,
“Ensure that the sequence of actions, properly detailed in the work instruction,
is correctly performed in the future.” is not measurable.)

If the corrective action is not feasible, re-evaluate it and identify other or additional
actions that may be needed.
As a result, document a list of action items in the corrective actions section in the
CAPA template. This may include for example:
−
−
−
−
−

a detailed description of the implementation of regulatory requirements,
roles and responsibilities for conducting the action items,
identification of the resources required,
verification and/or validation protocols of the action(s) with acceptance criteria,
implementation plan, including deadlines.

Distinguishing between correction, corrective action, and preventive action can be
challenging, depending on the root cause. This document serves as a guide, not a rigid set
of rules. When unsure about categorising an action when completing the CAPA template, it
is suggested to primarily focus on its effectiveness in enhancing the system and include the
action only once in the section in the CAPA template where the NB thinks it fits the best. In
the above-mentioned example of a deficient checklist for assessing the validation of the
sterilisation process: some of the actions can be considered a corrective action and/or a
preventive action instead of a correction, depending on the root cause.

4.4 Actions for verification of effectiveness
In this section of the CAPA template, the NB should detail the planned actions, including
responsibilities and timelines, to verify the effectiveness of the implemented corrective
actions and, where appropriate, preventive actions. The NB should define SMART criteria
(Specific - targeting the identified root cause(s), Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timebound) to determine if the NC has been effectively addressed. The NB should establish
appropriate timeframes for scheduling effectiveness checks, considering the classification of
the NC, the complexity of the implemented corrective actions and, where appropriate, the
complexity of the implemented preventive actions. The timeframe should allow sufficient time

Page 9 of 11

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
for the implemented actions to take effect, typically ranging from several months to a year.
Progress may be assessed during scheduled internal audits.
The NB should verify and demonstrate that:
−
−
−
−

the cause has not recurred,
the NC has not recurred,
a similar NC has not occurred and
the corrective action remains effective and continues to be implemented.

The NB should document the results of its verification of effectiveness in a clear and
accessible manner for the DA.
While the actions planned and the criteria which will be used for the verification of
effectiveness are part of and should be documented in the CAPA plan, the verification of
effectiveness itself falls outside the scope of the joint assessment and will be followed-up
under the DA’s monitoring activities.

5 CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE DA
It is important that the DA completes the relevant assessment section of the CAPA template
in sufficient detail to ensure their assessment and opinion on the CAPA plan are clear and
can be fully understood by the JAT, minimising the need for further requests for clarification.
The process outlined in Section 2.3.2 of MDCG 2022-13 should be followed for the DA’s
assessment of the CAPA plan.
If a finding was classified by the DA as an observation, the DA should clearly communicate
their expectations on how the NB should address the observation.
After confirming the corrective and preventive action plan, if necessary following further
successive requests for clarification or modifications from the NB, the DA should forward it to
the JAT, together with its opinion thereon9.
After receiving the JAT's subsequent review, documented in the appropriate template
(Annex II), the DA should carefully consider the JAT's input, finalise their overall assessment
of the CAPA plan, and provide feedback to the NB on JAT's review and any follow-up steps.
If the JAT has requested further modifications, the DA may request a further update of the
CAPA plan from the NB, as appropriate, and update its assessment in the CAPA template.
An iterative process may result from this. The NB may update the CAPA plan (if applicable)
and the DA may revise its assessment of this CAPA plan. This may result in a further
request for clarification and/or modifications from the JAT. This process continues until both
parties, DA and JAT, reach agreement on the CAPA plan which should ideally be reached
early in the process. The assessment of its implementation can subsequently follow,
possibly involving further iteration, before reaching agreement on the consideration of the
NCs being satisfactorily addressed.

MDR Article 39 (7) / IVDR Article 35 (7)

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2024-12

applicable for  MDR  IVDR
For actions in the CAPA plan requiring implementation prior to the DA’s final report, the DA
should document the verification (including identification of evidence, review and
conclusions) in the CAPA template. This includes identifying the evidence reviewed by the
DA and confirming that the actions were successfully implemented by the NB. Based on
experience, providing relevant documentation from the NB demonstrating the implemented
actions, along with DA’s assessment, to the JAT during the CAPA assessment phase can
help avoid a negative JAT final opinion to the MDCG. Alternatively, if providing such
documentation is impractical or not considered necessary, a more detailed description of the
DA’s assessment of the implementation should be included in the template. This should
include an accurate description of the actions, sufficient for the JAT to consider if it
concludes with the DA’s assessment, e.g., that all the major NCs are resolved.

6 CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE JAT
The JAT completes the JAT review template after receipt of each update of the CAPA plan,
so that the JAT’s appraisal of the CAPA plan and of the DA’s opinion thereon is clear and
can be fully understood by the DA. This includes any explicit request for further clarifications
and modifications of the CAPA plan.
For each NC, the JAT should indicate whether it:
−

−

−

accepts the CAPA plan, including the root cause(s), the correction(s) and
corrective action(s), in line with the requirements of the Regulation and agrees
with the DA's assessment of it, or
requests further clarification on the CAPA plan (e.g. the CAPA plan describes that
a specific procedure will be updated, however detailed information on the
planned changes in this procedure is missing), and/or
requests for modifications of the CAPA plan when it considers any corrections,
root causes, corrective actions or other aspects to be unacceptable, insufficient or
inadequate. These requests will be clearly documented and motivated in the JAT
review template.

The JAT will not review any of the NB's actions related to observations, nor any of the DA's
opinions on them, as observations themselves do not breach a legal requirement.
