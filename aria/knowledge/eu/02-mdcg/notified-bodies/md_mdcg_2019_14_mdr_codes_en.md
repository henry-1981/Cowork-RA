Explanatory note on MDR codes
1 Introduction
Commission Implementing Regulation 2017/2185 establishes the codes for the designation of notified
bodies in medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and in vitro diagnostic medical devices
under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. These codes are primarily used by designating authorities to define
the notified body scope of designation but they are also used by the notified body to:
1) describe the individual qualification of the NBs staff members
2) describe the qualification required for assessing a device
These codes may be very broad and, furthermore, unequivocal authorisation of personnel to codes
and the assignment of codes to a device is not always straightforward. However, the notified body’s
system needs to ensure, in all cases, that the authorisation of personnel and team allocation for the
conformity assessment of a device ensures adequate knowledge and expertise.

2 Scope
The lists of codes and corresponding types of devices established by the above mentioned
Regulation takes into account various device types which can be characterised by design and
intended purpose, manufacturing processes and technologies used, such as sterilisation and the use
of nanomaterials.
These lists of codes should be used in a way that provides for a multi-dimensional application to all
typology of devices. This will ensure that notified bodies as well as the staff assigned to conformity
assessment are fully competent for the devices they are required to assess.
This guidance is intended to explain the different level of codes and how they should be used,
including the use of conditions with a view to ensure a harmonised use of the codes especially for the
allocation of resources to conformity assessment activities.

3 Assignment of codes to devices within the conformity
assessment procedure
When a manufacturer lodges an application with a notified body, the type of devices and technologies
subject to conformity assessment activities are to be indicated. Usually, at the application review
stage (as defined in section 4.3 of Annex VII MDR), notified bodies will verify the assignment of codes
provided by the manufacturer or will assign these codes to the devices themselves. This verification is
carried out in order to ensure that the notified body is able to assess the application based on its
designation, and that it has available resources to carry out the relevant conformity assessment
activities (feasibility evaluation). Thefinal assignment is made by the NB.
After this application review, and signing of the contract, the notified body will allocate appropriately
qualified and authorised personnel to carry out audit activities or product reviews.
The following table presents an overview of the different types of codes and a summary of the main
characteristics of each of them for the assignment to specific devices and the allocation of resources.

3.1

MDN / MDA-codes

MDA / MDN-codes reflect the design and intended purpose of the device and hence are mostly
relevant for the allocation of personnel involved in the review of technical documentation. In some
specific cases, the NB may assign product reviewers to assess product performance and safety
aspects during an audit. This means that if there are product related issues to be audited and the
auditors do not possess the required qualification, product reviewers who are qualified for the device
in question should be part of the audit team.
The NB needs to ensure that the personnel allocated to the project are competent to assess for the
devices and technologies under assessment. Special attention should be paid in situations such as
the one described in example 4 of this section.

3

The MDA / MDN codes may either specify a field of medical application (e.g. MDA 0309 Active nonimplantable ophthalmologic devices) or the physical or technological principle of the device (e.g. MDA
0302 Active non-implantable devices utilising non-ionizing radiation or MDA 0315 Software).
Therefore, there are cases where more than one specific code might apply to a device (e.g. surgical
laser for refractive surgery of the eye). Also, where there is a broad intended purpose, several codes
may apply.
Having these issues in mind, when drafting the Regulation 2017/2185, the codes were put in order
such that the MDA/MDN codes that require very specific technological knowledge and experience are
highest in the code lists. Therefore, in cases where more than one MDA/MDN code apply, the code
highest in the list is to be selected. This approach ensures consistent assignment of codes (and
therefore consistent assignment of suitably qualified staff) to devices.
Example 1: A surgical laser for refractive surgery of the eye is assigned to MDA 0302 Active
non-implantable devices utilising non-ionizing radiation and not to MDA 0309 Active nonimplantable ophthalmologic devices because, even though both codes are specific for the
device, since MDA 0302 is higher in the list.
Example 2: A screw for orthopaedic surgery is assigned to MDN 1102 Non-active osteo- and
orthopaedic implants and not to 1104 Non-active soft tissue and other implants, because
MDN 1102 is higher in the list.
Devices may be composed of different “components” which, if they were products on their own, would
belong to different MDA/MDN codes(1). In such cases, the intended purpose or the main physical or
technological principle of the device should be considered (Example 3). Nonetheless, the notified
body needs to ensure that the assigned staff is qualified to assess all components of the device.
Example 3: A medical devices is composed of a suture anchor (a bone screw attached to a
surgical suture to reattach ruptured tendons) as well as a single use deployment instrument
and a single use bone drill. The components are provided sterile in a blister, are covered by
the same technical documentation and are not available individually (e.g. are not medical
devices on their own). This product is assigned to MDN 1102 Non-active osteo- and
orthopaedic implants and not to MDN 1208 Non-active non-implantable instruments because
the implanted component of the device is associated with the intended purpose rather than
the deployment instrument and the drill.
Note that, given the complexity and the diversity of medical devices, in exceptional cases deviations
from the guidance given above may be necessary when assigning codes to devices in order to ensure
suitably qualified staff in the conformity assessment. In such cases, a brief rationale shall be
documented (see Example 4).
Example 4: A heater-cooler unit (HCU) for cardiac surgery is a device through which blood
circulates, and which changes the circulating blood’s temperature in order to achieve hypo- or
hyperthermia. Both the codes MDA 0303 Active non-implantable devices utilising
hyperthermia/hypothermia and MDA 0306 Active non-implantable devices for extra-corporal
circulation, administration or removal of substances and haemapheresis are specific to the
device. Since MDA 0303 Active non-implantable devices utilising hyperthermia/hypothermia is
a code that describes physical or technological characteristics higher in the list, according to
the rule explained above MDA 0303 should be chosen. Nonetheless, the notified body
assigns the device to the code MDA 0306 Active non-implantable devices for extra-corporal
circulation, administration or removal of substances and haemapheresis and documents that
the risks associated with the HCU are such that the staff having experience in this code is
more suitable to assess the device.
It is important to note that Stand-alone software (i.e. software that is not part of a physical medical
device) should be assigned to MDA 0315 since assessment of software requires very specific
knowledge (see annex VII 3.2.2 5th indent MDR) and also that non-implantable cardiovascular

1 This description does NOT refer to procedure packs or systems according to MDR Article 2 (10) and (11) since those are

combinations of individual CE-marked products that have been subjected to separate conformity assessments.

4

catheters, guidewires, introducers, filters and related tools shall fall under MDN 1203 (instead of MDN
1201 or MDN 1202).

3.2

MDS codes

MDS codes are horizontal codes that are applicable to devices with specific characteristics. All codes
that are applicable need to be assigned to a device in order to ensure that the review team possesses
the full set of qualifications necessary for the conformity assessment. The MDS-codes are mainly
relevant for the allocation of personnel involved in the review of technical documentation. This is
because, generally, the auditing aspects linked to MDS codes have their corresponding MDT code for
the relevant technology (e.g. MDS 1001 Devices incorporating medicinal substances vs MDT 2007
Devices which require knowledge regarding the production of pharmaceuticals). However, MDS
codes may also be applicable to staff performing audits concerning certain special processes (for
example MDS 1005 for staff auditing ethylene oxide sterilization processes).
Example 1: A partially resorbable, sterile surgical implant that contains an antibiotic to prevent
post-surgical infection will need to be assigned to the following MDS codes:
1) MDS 1005 - Devices in sterile condition: because it is provided sterile,
2) MDS 1008 - Devices utilising [...] being wholly or mainly absorbed or locally dispersed
in the human body […]: because it is absorbed, and
3) MDS 1001 - Devices incorporating medicinal substances: because it contains an
antibiotic.
Example 2: An infusion pump should be assigned to MDS 1009 - Devices incorporating
software/utilising software/controlled by software […] because the infusion pump is controlled
by software.

3.3

MDT codes

MDT codes relate to the technologies and processes that are used in the manufacturing and making
available of the devices. MDT codes are relevant for the allocation of site auditors.
Assignment of MDT codes should be done taking into consideration production of the device itself as
well as for critical upstream production steps. This means that, even though many codes could be
applicable when taking into consideration the processes involved in the entire supply chain of a
medical device, these should not be considered for the use of MDT codes (e.g. for an electronic
medical thermometer, at one point, metal processing, plastic processing, non-metal mineral
processing, chemical processing, manufacture in clean rooms, manufacturing using electronic
components, labelling and packaging are necessary to assemble the device from raw materials).
Example 1: An electronic medical thermometer for layman’s use should be assigned to the
following MDT codes:
1) MDT 2010 Devices manufactured using electronic components including
communication devices because the product is assembled from electronic
components and
2) MDT 2011 Devices which require packaging, including labelling because the device is
packed and labelled.
Example 2: A sterile animal derived bone graft substitute is manufactured using several steps.
In the first step, the raw animal bone undergoes a sequence of chemical treatments to
remove organic components. In a second step, the remaining mineral bone component is
subjected to a heat treatment, then ground and sieved to obtain particles of defined sizes.
The material is packed, labelled and sterilized. Therefore the following MDT codes should be
assigned:

5

1) MDT 2008 Devices manufactured in clean rooms and associated controlled
environments, because the manufacturing of the implant after the heat treatment is
conducted in clean rooms,
2) MDT 2009 Devices manufactured using processing of materials of human, animal, or
microbial origin because the implant is made from animal bone
3) MDT 2011 Devices which require packaging, including labelling because the implant
is packed and labelled.
Note: MDT 2006 Devices manufactured using chemical processing and MDT 2003
Devices manufactured using non-metal mineral processing (e.g. glass, ceramics)
were not applied since the chemical treatment and (bone) mineral processing are
already considered within the scope of processing of animal materials.
Example 3: A calcium phosphate bone cement is provided as a sterile powder composed of a
mixture of calcium salts and a vial with sterile saline. The following MDT codes should be
assigned:
1) MDT 2008 Devices manufactured in clean rooms and associated controlled
environments, because the manufacturing of the implant is in a controlled
environment,
2) MDT 2006 Devices manufactured using chemical processing, because the main risks
in manufacturing are related to the testing and mixing of the components,
3) MDT 2011 Devices which require packaging, including labelling because the implant
is packed and labelled.
Example 4: A manufacturer of cross-linked hyaluronic acid implants has no in-house
manufacturing. The finished, labelled implant is bought from a supplier. The implant raw
material (hyaluronic acid) is produced by fermentation using bacteria. The following MDT
codes should be assigned:
1) MDT 2008 Devices manufactured in clean rooms and associated controlled
environments, because the manufacturing of the implant is in a controlled
environment,
2) MDT 2005 Devices manufactured using biotechnology, because the main risks in
manufacturing are related to the production and cross-linking of the hyaluronic acid.
3) MDT 2011 Devices which require packaging, including labelling because the implant
is packed and labelled.
Note that, despite the fact that the manufacturer itself does not physically manufacture the
device, the MDT codes concerning the manufacturing steps are assigned to the device since
they are relevant when auditing suppliers / subcontractors.

4 Competence description: conditions (including limitations)
Conditions should be established by the notified body for individual codes in cases where the
qualification of the staff authorised to a certain code is not sufficient to cover the entire spectrum of
the devices within this code. The designating authority could also apply conditions to the notified
body's designation where the notified body does not have sufficient competence to cover a given
code or could seek designation for conformity assessment of only certain devices within a code.
Conditions, including limitations, should be formulated in an unambiguous way (see example 1).
Furthermore, since the technical codes basically mirror the competence system of the notified body,
the conditions and limitations should concern device characteristics (see example 2).
Example 1: “MDN 1101 Non-active cardiovascular, vascular and neurovascular implants.
Condition: heart valves”. This condition is unsuitable since it is not clear whether the notified
body is restricted to assessment of heart valves or whether those products are excluded from

6

the scope of designation. Therefore, the condition should be “excluding heart valves” or
“including only heart valves”.
Example 2: “MDN 1102 Non-active osteo- and orthopaedic implants. Condition: excluding
class III devices”. The scope of designation is intimately linked to the qualification of the staff
that the notified body needs to have available. Conditions serve to exclude the devices for
which the notified body does not have competent staff and/or suitable procedures; therefore,
they need to be expressed in a way that they relate to knowledge and experience of staff
and/or procedures. The condition “excluding class III devices” does not allow this and
therefore it is unsuitable. In this case, the designating authority has to determine, based on
the qualification of the notified body’s staff, which devices are included in the scope. This
might result, for example, in the following condition: “including only orthopaedic plates and
screws; excluding implants that are applied in or on the spine”.
Further examples of conditions are illustrated in the final column of the table below. Considerations of
the conditions should be based on the demonstrated competence of the applicant body.
