1 Introduction
Commission Implementing Regulation 2017/2185 establishes the codes for the designation of notified
bodies in medical devices under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and in vitro diagnostic medical devices
under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. These codes are primarily used by designating authorities to define
the notified body (NB) scope of designation but they are also used by the NB to:
1) describe the individual qualification of the NB’s staff members
2) describe the qualification required for assessing a device.
It is acknowledged that these codes may be broad, furthermore, unequivocal authorisation of
personnel to codes and the assignment of codes to a device may not always be straightforward.
However, the NB’s system needs to ensure, in all cases, that the authorisation of personnel and
allocation of teams for the conformity assessment of a device ensures adequate knowledge and
expertise.

2 Scope
The lists of codes and corresponding types of in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVD) established by
the above mentioned Regulation, namely, in its Annex II, takes into account various device types
which can be characterised by design and intended purpose including companion diagnostics
devices, devices for self-testing or for near patient testing, as well as by manufacturing processes and
technologies used, such as sterilisation.
These lists of codes should be used in a way which allows a multi-dimensional application to all
typology of devices. This will ensure that NB as well as the personnel assigned to conformity
assessment are fully competent for the devices they are required to assess.
This guidance is intended to explain the different levels of codes and how they should be used,
including the use of conditions to ensure a harmonised use of the codes especially for the allocation
of resources to conformity assessment activities.

3 Assignment of codes to IVDs within the conformity assessment
procedure
When a manufacturer lodges an application with a NB, the type of devices and technologies subject
to conformity assessment activities are to be indicated. Usually, at the application review stage (as
defined in section 4.3 of Annex VII IVDR), NB will verify the assignment of codes provided by the
manufacturer or will assign these codes to the devices themselves. This verification is carried out in
order to ensure that the NB is able to assess the application based on its designation, and that it has

Medical Devices

available resources to carry out the relevant conformity assessment activities (feasibility evaluation).
The final assignment is made by the NB.
After this application review, and signing of the contract, the NB will allocate appropriately qualified
1
and authorised personnel to carry out audit activities or product reviews.
The following table presents an overview of the different types of codes and a summary of the main
characteristics of each of them for the assignment to specific devices and the allocation of resources.

MDCG 2021-14

IVR codes

IVR codes reflect the design and intended purpose of the device and hence are mostly relevant for
the allocation of personnel involved in the review of technical documentation. In some specific cases,
the NB may assign product reviewers to assess device performance and safety aspects during an
audit. This means that if there are device related issues to be audited and the auditors do not possess
the required qualification, product reviewers who are qualified for the device in question should be
part of the audit team.
The NB needs to ensure that the personnel allocated to the project are competent to assess for the
devices and technologies under assessment.
The IVR codes may specify a field of in vitro diagnostic medical application (e.g. IVR 0401 Devices
intended to be used in screening/confirmation of congenital/inherited disorders). There are cases
where more than one specific code might apply to a device. In addition, where there is a broad
intended purpose, several codes may apply. Having these issues in mind, the codes were put in order
such that the first applicable code in the list is the one to be selected. For example, when codes IVR
0201 and IVR 0202 both apply, the IVR 0201 code should be used. This approach ensures consistent
assignment of codes (and therefore consistent assignment of suitably qualified staff) to devices.
Note that, given the complexity and the diversity of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, in exceptional
cases deviations from the guidance given above may be necessary when assigning codes to devices
in order to ensure suitably qualified staff in the conformity assessment. In such cases, a brief rationale
shall be documented (see Example 1).
It is relatively common for IVD devices to be ‘multiplexed’. Such devices are composed of different
“components”. In the case of multiplexed devices, it may not be possible to define a main intended
purpose or main technological principle. In many cases, such equally important components of
multiplexed assays will still fall under the same code. Nevertheless, in some cases, the components
of multiplexed assays would not fall under the same IVR code, if they were devices on their own. As
the components may be considered equally important, a single code, selected from the first applicable
code, cannot be assigned. In such an exceptional case, assignment of several IVR codes can be
considered, if the properties and risks of the device cannot appropriately be covered with one IVR
code alone, even in conjunction with the relevant IVS, IVT and IVD codes (see Example 2).
Therefore, the NB needs to ensure that the assigned staff is qualified to assess all components of the
device.
Example 1: BRCA1 device intended for the detection of deletions or duplications in the human
BRCA1 gene in order to confirm a potential cause and clinical diagnosis for hereditary breast
and ovarian cancer and for molecular genetic testing of at-risk family members. According to
the order mentioned above, this IVD falls into IVR 0300 codes. Nevertheless, additional
competence regarding genetic testing would still be necessary (IVR 0400 codes). All relevant
aspects may not be covered by one IVR code in conjunction with the relevant IVS, IVT, IVP
and IVD codes.
Example 2: Multiplexed assay for gastrointestinal diseases/symptoms, combining assays for
gastrointestinal pathogens with assays for digestive enzymes, immunochemical markers of
food intolerances/sensitivities, markers of inflammation, or markers of gastric or colon
cancers. This IVD may fall into IVR 0300, IVR 0500 and IVR 0600 codes. Use of several IVR
codes is necessary to cover all aspects.

3.2

IVS codes

IVS codes are horizontal codes that are applicable to devices with specific characteristics. All codes
that are applicable need to be assigned to a device in order to ensure that the review team possesses
the full set of qualifications necessary for the conformity assessment. The IVS codes are primarily
relevant for the allocation of personnel involved in the review of technical documentation. For some of
the IVS codes the auditing aspects have their corresponding IVT code for the relevant technology
(e.g. IVS 1004 Devices manufactured utilising tissues or cells of human origin, or their derivatives vs
IVT 2009 In vitro diagnostic devices manufactured using processing of materials of human, animal
and microbial origin). However, IVS codes may also be applicable to staff performing audits

Medical Devices
MDCG 2021-14

Medical Device Coordination Group Document

concerning certain special processes (for example IVS 1005 for staff auditing ethylene oxide
sterilisation processes).
2

Medical device software which are devices in their own right including software apps, software for
data analysis, and for defining or monitoring therapeutic measures should be assigned to code IVS
1009 in addition to the applicable IVR code which itself is dependent on the intended use or the field
of application of the software. In case software is incorporated in a device, used by the device or
controls the device the code IVS 1010 is relevant. The IVDR requires the definition of specific
qualification criteria for personnel allocated to the assessment of software (see IVDR Annex VII,
Section 3.2.2, 6th indent).
The same principle applies to control materials with quantitative or qualitative assigned values
intended for one specific analyte or multiple analytes where the code IVS 1007 should be attributed in
addition to the applicable IVR code which itself is dependent on the intended use of the device. Note:
The codes IVR 0701 and 0702 are only appropriate for controls without a quantitative or qualitative
assigned value, i.e. no other IVR code higher in the list of IVR codes can be selected.
Code IVS 1008 (instruments, equipment, systems or apparatus) should be used if the IVD contains, is
part of or is integrated into instruments, equipment, systems or apparatus. Note: The code IVR 0802
only applies in case of separate sterile instruments of class A intended by the manufacturer
specifically to be used for in vitro diagnostic procedures.
Example: A blood glucose meter: An apparatus used for self-patient testing that contains an
incorporated software to measure the glucose levels in the bloodstream will need to be
assigned to the following IVS codes:
1) IVS 1002 - Devices intended to be used for self-testing, because it is to be used directly by
the end user,
2) IVS 1008 - Instruments, equipment, systems or apparatus, because it is an apparatus in
itself,
3) IVS 1010 - Devices incorporating software/utilising software/controlled by software,
because it contains software.

3.3

IVT codes

IVT codes relate to the technologies that are used in the manufacturing and making available of the
devices. IVT codes are most relevant for the allocation of site auditors.
Assignment of IVT codes should be done taking into consideration the production of the device itself,
in addition to critical upstream production steps. This means that, even though many codes could be
applicable when taking into consideration the technologies/processes involved in the entire supply
chain, related to manufacture, of a medical device, only those for the critical technologies/production
steps should be considered.
Example: An Immunoassay where the manufacturing involves antibody production,
purification and immobilisation in a clean room/controlled environment should be assigned to
at least the following IVT codes:
1) IVT 2005 - In vitro diagnostic devices manufactured using biotechnology and
2) IVT 2008 - In vitro diagnostic devices manufactured in clean rooms and associated
controlled environments.
Note that, despite the fact that the manufacturer itself may not physically manufacture all parts of the
device, the IVT codes concerning the manufacturing steps are assigned to the device since they are
relevant when auditing suppliers / subcontractors.

IVP codes

IVP codes relate to the knowledge in examination procedures for the purpose of product verification.
IVP codes are primarily used for the allocation of product reviewers.
Example 1: Microorganism identification using latex agglutination beads to detect specific
microorganism antigens. IVP 3001: In vitro diagnostic devices which require knowledge
regarding agglutination tests
Example 2: Immune cell phenotyping (e.g. to determine acute myeloid leukaemia) by flow
cytometry. IVP 3006: In vitro diagnostic devices which require knowledge regarding flow
cytometry
Example 3: Electrolyte quantification using ion-selective electrodes. IVP 3012: In vitro
diagnostic devices which require knowledge regarding physical chemistry including
electrochemistry
Example 4: Microorganism identification using mass spectrometry IVP 3012: In vitro
diagnostic devices which require knowledge regarding physical chemistry including
electrochemistry
Example 5: Colorimetric assay for the quantification of creatinine.
1) IVP 3002: In vitro diagnostic devices which require knowledge regarding biochemistry
and

2) IVP 3013: In vitro diagnostic devices which require knowledge regarding spectroscopy
3.5

IVD codes

IVD codes relate to the knowledge in laboratory and clinical disciplines for the purpose of the product
verification. IVD codes are relevant for the allocation of product reviewers.
The IVD codes listed in Commission Implementing Regulation 2017/2185 (IVD 4001 to 4012) refer to
laboratory and clinical disciplines like bacteriology, clinical chemistry/biochemistry or immunology
which specifically deal with or use the IVD in question. In addition, it may be necessary to involve
experts of other clinical disciplines not listed in Commission Implementing Regulation 2017/2185 in
which a disease or disorder to be detected with the IVD in question is treated (clinical specialists, see
also e.g. IVDR Annex IX, 4.4). This may be the case, for example, when a marker for a disease is
newly established by a manufacturer and the relevance of this marker for the underlying disease has
to be assessed. Examples of these clinical disciplines may be cardiology or oncology.

4 Competence description: conditions (including limitations)
Conditions should be established by the NB for individual codes in cases where the qualification of
the staff authorised to a certain code is not sufficient to cover the entire spectrum of the devices within
this code. The designating authority could also apply conditions to the NB's designation where the
NB does not have sufficient competence to cover a given code or could seek designation for
conformity assessment of only certain devices within a code.
Conditions, including limitations, should be formulated in an unambiguous way. Furthermore, since
the technical codes mirror the competence system of the NB, the conditions and limitations should
concern device characteristics. The experience and competence of the NB may for example be
limited due to the range of devices assessed under the IVDD. The limitations are applicable to all
types of codes. Here, the focus is on examples of IVR codes as they serve as the basis of the
technical documentation assessment.
Example 1: IVR 0301: Devices intended to be used in screening, diagnosis, staging or
monitoring of cancer. In cases where the experience is solely based on assessing devices for
PSA, an appropriate condition could be including only PSA.

Example 2: IVR 0401: Devices intended to be used in screening/confirmation of
congenital/inherited disorders. In cases where the experience is solely based on assessing
devices for T21 risk, an appropriate condition could be including only devices for T21 risk.
Example 3: IVR 0505: Devices intended to be used to grow/isolate/identify and handle
infectious agents. In cases where the full code cannot be covered due to lack of experience
in, for example, growing and isolating viruses, a suitable condition could be either to:


limit the scope to devices intended to identify infectious agents



exclusion of devices intended for growing and isolating viruses.

Further examples of conditions are illustrated in the final column of the table below. Considerations of
the conditions should be based on the demonstrated competence of the applicant body.
