Guidance on the Information Required for Conformity
assessment bodies’ Personnel Involved in Conformity
Assessment Activities
This document has been endorsed by the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) established by Article
103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The MDCG is composed of representatives of all Member States and it is
chaired by a representative of the European Commission.
The document is not a European Commission document and it cannot be regarded as reflecting the official
position of the European Commission. Any views expressed in this document are not legally binding and only
the Court of Justice of the European Union can give binding interpretations of Union law.

1.

Introduction

The Regulations (Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (hereafter MDR) and
Regulation (EU) 2017/746on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (hereafter IVDR)) require
that conformity assessment bodies (CABs) have the necessary personnel and have access
to all competence needed to perform properly the technical, scientific and administrative
tasks entailed in the conformity assessment activities and for the type of devices in relation
to which they are designated.
To ensure consistency and transparency, the CAB will have a procedure(s) in place to
ensure that the selection, training and authorisation of personnel are fully documented. The
documentation of qualification, training and authorisation of personnel will allow the CAB to
demonstrate that knowledge and experience of each person is sufficient to fulfil the
qualification criteria and enable them to address the relevant regulatory requirements
concerning safety and performance of medical devices (associated with their design,
production and use).
The information on the person's background education, work experience, training and/or
professional development will demonstrate the person’s knowledge and experience on each
type of device for which they are authorised, with particular reference to processes,
technologies or areas (e.g. biological safety or clinical assessment) related to the scope of
their activities (roles for specific codes). To this end, this information should form a coherent
and consistent personnel file1 that readily relates to the role and to the tasks the person is
authorised.
The personnel's competence will be maintained and reviewed at pre-defined regular
intervals and their authorisation updated accordingly in order to ensure that the supporting
evidence underpinning staff's competence and authorisation is kept up to date. The CAB
should carry out a yearly review of its full competence in order to verify that it can fulfil its
scope of designation based on the internal and external expertise. Ideally each person’s
competence should be reviewed at least once every three years for its full scope of activities.

1

This personnel file should contain all of the available supporting evidence underpinning internal and external competence and
authorisation for each CAB's personnel. It should be available for the relevant designating authority upon request and also for the joint
assessment team during the on-site joint assessment.

Scope

This document gives guidance for CABs on the knowledge, experience and training that their
personnel should have and on the preparation of the supporting documentation they are
required to hold for each of its medical device personnel to demonstrate the satisfaction of
qualification criteria2.

3.

Definitions

3.1. Qualification: education, full set of knowledge and experience which makes staff
suitable to carry out specific tasks or roles.

3.2. Authorisation: approval of personnel to certain conformity assessment activities and
types of devices with associated NANDO codes or areas of expertise based on
established qualification criteria.

3.3. Allocation: assignment of staff to specific conformity assessment tasks in the context
of an individual conformity assessment application.

3.4. Education: formal academic studies carried out on the context of national education
programmes (e.g. technical diploma or bachelor degree).

3.5. Knowledge: understanding of a given subject that is acquired by training or experience
which can be measured in an objective and reproducible manner.

3.6. Experience: skills usually acquired in a working environment that are related to the
specific tasks and responsibilities exerted by the person.

3.7. Function: set of tasks within the conformity assessment process such as auditing,
product evaluation or testing, technical documentation review, final review and
decision-making. Different functions might be covered under one role (e.g. auditing
and testing).

3.8. Training: set of activities aimed to acquire and maintain certain level of skills which are
needed to carry out a given task.

3.9. Role: position that a person has been assigned to within the CAB, for which a set of
responsibilities and functions have been defined.

4.

Supporting Documentation

This supporting documentation should refer to knowledge, experience and training, and
should be used for the authorisation of personnel to their tasks. It is expected that
documentation to justify the authorisation of staff should be specially prepared for this
purpose. The suggested format is NBOG F 2017-7 and NBOG F 2017-8 on “Qualification
and authorisation of Personnel”.
This NBOG form should be completed for each individual participating or planning to
participate in conformity assessment activities, according to the roles defined in section 4 of
this guidance. The CAB should ensure that only verified information is included in this form
(i.e. information provided in the CV for which supporting documentation has been provided).
2

In exceptional cases where the fulfilment of the qualification criteria cannot be fully demonstrated, the CAB will justify the authorisation
of these members of the personnel to carry out specific assessment activities.

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 2 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

The different sections of the form should show a clear trail between the relevant entries
(related to knowledge, experience and training) and the subsequent assessment concerning
the fulfilment of the relevant qualification criteria for the personnel role and type of devices or
areas for which they will be authorised.
Where there is additional information that demonstrates specific expertise or links between
academic and other knowledge (e.g. public reports or journal articles etc.) this should be a
part of the information. The published documents or reports of evaluations, studies or test
activities where the person had a direct involvement should be listed, or if extensive
summarised with the key titles listed.
Data related to consultancy activities may also be provided as part of the supporting
documentation. This data should be taken into account in the allocation of personnel to
specific projects but, depending on the CAB’s authorisation system, it may also be important
in the authorisation of personnel to specific codes and areas of expertise.

5.

Roles

The CAB will establish qualification criteria at least for each of the following roles in
accordance with Annex VII of the Regulations. The functions related to each role are
specified below. If the CAB wishes to establish a different terminology for these roles (or
split/merge them in different –roles), cross-reference and matching to the roles defined in
this section should always be available.

5.1. Site auditor
Internal or external personnel responsible to carry out audits of the manufacturer's quality
management system (QMS) and of its suppliers and/or subcontractors when appropriate and
to draw up records and reports on the corresponding audits.
These personnel should have expertise in auditing 3 of healthcare products and therefore
their authorisation as site auditors should always be based on technology codes MDT or
IVT.

5.2. Product reviewer
Internal or external personnel that is responsible for carrying out product related reviews and
drawing up records and reports about the corresponding assessment. In particular they
should be responsible for one or several of the following tasks:


Review of the manufacturer's technical documentation for the entire documentation
or for specific aspects of this documentation such as biological safety, clinical
evaluation, software or sterilisation validation.



Carry out conformity assessment activities related to type examination, including
establishment of test plans.



Carry out conformity assessment activities related to the product verification,
including establishment of test plans.

3

Work experience in medical devices industry or closely related industries (e.g. pharmaceutical industry) such as manufacturing or quality
management or in other institutions carrying out inspections or audits in the field of medical devices or other healthcare products,
including notified bodies.

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 3 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide


2017-2

Advise the audit team, and in particular the audit team leader, on aspects of the
manufacturer’s design or production processes which could be of particular
relevance for the on-site audit.

In order to accomplish any of the tasks listed above, these personnel should always be
authorised to specific MDR or IVR codes or horizontal MDS and/or IVS/IVP/IVD.

5.3. Project leader
As established in 4.4 of Annex VII, a Project leader is an individual responsible for ensuring
that the assessment of an individual application is conducted properly, observing the CAB's
procedures (in accordance with the relevant legislation, guidance documents, CS and/or
harmonised standards). This person will ensure that the appropriate resources are utilised
for each of the tasks of the assessment.
The CAB should define specific criteria for project leaders. Criteria for these personnel are
not covered in this guidance.

5.4. Personnel with relevant clinical expertise (hereafter internal clinician)
Internal staff (where possible) that are responsible for the oversight of the clinical
assessment of the technical documentation and fully integrated in the CAB's assessment
and decision-making process. Specific tasks are defined in section 3.2.4 of Annex VII to the
Regulations.
It is expected that the internal clinician will review and scientifically challenge the clinical data
contained in the clinical evaluation and any associated clinical investigations provided within
the technical documentation. This person could delegate – according to the internal
procedures of the CAB – the review of part or all the clinical aspects to external experts (i.e.
clinical specialists), in which case he/she will make a clinical judgment of the opinion
provided by these experts. Such delegation will take place when clinical expertise on the
clinical field related to the device in question or the clinical condition in which it is utilised is
required and the internal clinician does not have this expertise. For instance, clinical
specialist's input should be sought when the product is innovative (in terms of application
and/or technology) and/or of high risk (implantable devices or class III under the MDR and
class C and D devices under the IVDR).
In addition, the internal clinician may in certain circumstances identify other appropriately
qualified experts as delegates including product reviewers. The internal clinician will oversee
their work, this particular case is further described in section 7.1.2.
The internal clinician will also be responsible for drawing up records and reports on the
corresponding clinical assessments, including the justification for the delegation of tasks. In
this case, a recommendation to the CAB's decision maker should also be included.

5.5. Clinical specialist
External personnel (usually) that is responsible for the review of part or of all the clinical
aspects of the technical documentation as required by the internal clinician in accordance
with the CAB’s procedures. They should also document the outcome of the clinical
assessments, according to the CAB's procedures.
These experts with relevant clinical expertise in specific areas should be authorised by the
CAB to specific MDR/IVR codes and specific medical areas and trained by the internal
clinical as described in 3.2.4 Annex VII.

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

2017-2

5.6. Final reviewer
Internal staff that is responsible for ensuring that all of the assessments have been
conducted in accordance with the CAB's procedures (in accordance with the relevant
legislation, guidance documents, CS and/or harmonised standards). In addition, they should
ensure that reports and supporting documentation (including quality management system
and technical documentation provided by the manufacturer) are complete and sufficient
according to section 4.7 of Annex VII. The final reviewer will also be responsible for drawing
up records and reports on the final reviews/he has carried out.
Final reviewers should be authorised for the specific MDR/IVR or horizontal MDS/MDT
and/or IVS/IVT/IVP/IVD codes as final reviewers and taking into account that their
knowledge and expertise should cover a broader base. Therefore, qualification criteria for
final reviewers should take into account that knowledge on the device technologies, the
device industry and the design and manufacture of devices is not expected to be as specific
as knowledge required for other roles such as product reviewers. For instance, final
reviewers could be authorised for the review of active devices.
They final review might be performed individually or as a group. In the former case, the
individual should be authorised to every code identified in the specific project. In the latter
case, the authorisation of the group should cover all the codes involved. The internal
clinician should always act as final reviewer with regard to clinical aspects according to
section 3.2.4 of Annex VII.

5.7. Decision maker
Internal staff that are responsible for making the decisions on issuing, suspending,
restricting, re-instating or withdrawing of certificates and for defining the period of
certification. This staff should base their decision on the final review report and supporting
documentation according to Section 4.8 of Annex VII. The final decision should be
documented.
These personnel should be authorised for specific MDR/IVR or horizontal MDS/MDT and/or
IVS/IVT/IVP/IVD as decision makers and taking into account that their knowledge and
expertise should cover a broader base. Therefore, qualification criteria for decision makers
should take into account that knowledge on the device technologies, the device industry and
the design and manufacture of devices is not expected to be as specific as knowledge
required for other roles such as product reviewers.

5.8. Internal personnel responsible for establishing qualification criteria and for
authorising other personnel to perform specific conformity assessment
activities (hereafter authorising personnel)
These internal personnel are not expected to be authorised for this role to specific codes.
They should normally carry out the following tasks:


establish qualification criteria



selection of the personnel to be authorised to carry out conformity assessment
activities within the organisation,



verification of the knowledge and experience of this personnel,



authorisation of the personnel to their tasks,

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 5 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

In addition, this person may also conduct the verification of the performance of the personnel
and the definition and the verification of their initial and ongoing training.
These personnel will draw up records and reports documenting the tasks carried out.

6.

Qualification criteria per role

The CAB will establish qualification criteria for all of the roles described in the previous
section and for any other role it may establish. These criteria should be clear and objective in
order to allow transparency and reproducibility and should take account of the following
aspects:








Background education: in general, personnel involved in conformity assessment
activities will have completed a university or a technical college degree or equivalent
qualification in relevant sciences, for example medicine, pharmacy, engineering,
biology, microbiology, chemistry, materials science, veterinary medicine, physiology,
toxicology or physics.
Work experience: Personnel involved in conformity assessment activities will have
sufficient work experience (i.e. at least four years) in the field of healthcare products4
in order to justify their selection and authorisation to their roles.
Training: the Regulations establish certain areas of knowledge that the CAB's
personnel should have prior to be authorised to different roles. The CAB will provide
its personnel with initial and on-going training according to its system for training and
education programme. All training activities should be documented, and all training
materials and plans should be available to the designating authority and the joint
assessment team upon request. Effectiveness or training activities should be
assessed and documented. Any training activities that are used for personnel’s
authorisation should be either provided in-house or verified by the CAB.
On the job training: the CAB should make sure that every person that is selected is
aware and understand CAB’s procedures and has an adequate knowledge of the
relevant requirements before the authorisation is granted and / or updated and
subsequently introduced in the qualification matrix. To this end, appropriate on-thejob training criteria should be established for certain roles in relation to type of
devices or areas. This type of training should also be systematic and continuous
throughout the professional life and may be linked to the criteria for maintaining
competence (see section 8).

The CAB will ensure that its personnel's knowledge is directly related to their roles (in
accordance with sections 3.2.3 to 3.2.7 of Annex VII to the regulations) and to the scope of
their activities. Therefore, the requirements established in this section will be applied
depending on the specific roles and tasks to be performed and will usually be linked to the
specific codes pertaining to the individual's scope of activities. They will provide a sufficient
level of detail for the required qualification within the subdivisions of the specific scope
descriptions.

4

In general terms, work experience in the field of healthcare products or related activities will be understood as:
work in medical devices industry or closely related industries (e.g. pharmaceutical industry) such as research and development,
manufacturing, quality management, regulatory affairs;
• work in health services, universities, foundations or other institutions carrying out inspections, audits, clinical evaluations,
experimental and/or clinical research, including notified bodies.
• work in the application of device technology and its use in health care services and with patients;
• testing devices for compliance with the relevant national or international standards;
• conducting performance testing, evaluation studies or clinical trials of devices.

6.1. Site auditors
6.1.1. Background education
The site auditor's background education should be held in a relevant technology or
equivalent in relation to which they wish to be authorised (MDT/IVT), such as pharmacy,
engineering or other relevant sciences.
6.1.2. Work experience
Each site auditor will demonstrate:
-

four years' professional experience in the field of healthcare products or related
activities; and
two out of these four years will be in the area of quality management
when their authorisation is related to specific production technologies it is expected
that they will have experience related to the specific code (MDT and/or IVT).

6.1.3. Training
Site auditors will have knowledge on EU devices legislation, CS, harmonised standards and
relevant guidance documents including knowledge on the general safety and performance
requirements (set out in Annex I of the Regulations). This knowledge will usually be acquired
by means of training. The CAB should provide its auditors with at least, an initial training on
the relevant legislation and guidance documents. This training should normally cover general
aspects of the legislation and consist of 40 hours. This training programme may be adjusted
if auditors are able to provide evidence of the required knowledge based on previous training
or experience.
The CAB should provide its auditors with an initial training on its procedures, covering
conformity assessment audits laid down in Annexes IX and XI. These training activities
should also include the forms in order to ensure that auditors are able to draw up appropriate
records and reports
In addition, taking into account previous experience and the role of the individual, more
specific trainings may be envisaged. In particular, the CAB should provide its auditors with
an initial training on auditing techniques and quality management systems. These trainings
should usually last 40 hours (e.g. EN-ISO13485 lead auditor). Other necessary trainings will
cover risk management and related device standards.
The CAB will update and build on the knowledge on this matter as part of its system of
exchange of experience. Regular updates will also take place as on-going training.
6.1.4. On the job training
The CAB should establish a minimum number of witness audits or audits for training
purposes that each person to be authorised to this role should perform before their
authorisation (this should be applicable also in case that the auditor provides evidence of
authorisation to in other CABs, although the number of audits could be revised). All on-thejob training activities should be documented, and a system for its assessment should be
developed and followed.

6.2.

Product reviewers

6.2.1. Background education
The background education of product reviewers will be held in a relevant product or medical
area (e.g. medicine, pharmacy, engineering or other relevant sciences) that will be

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

considered as a strong basis for the authorisation of codes for which they wish to be
authorised (MDR/IVR and horizontal areas MDS and/or IVS/IVP/IVD).
6.2.2. Work experience
Their authorisation will link each code (MDR/IVR and horizontal areas MDS and/or IVS/
IVP/IVD) to specific devices and scientific aspects to be assessed for which the individual
can prove to have sufficient work experience. Each product reviewer will demonstrate:
-

four years' professional experience in the field of healthcare products or related
activities, such as in manufacturing, auditing or research; and
two out of these four years will be in the design, manufacture, testing or use of the
device or technology to be assessed or related 5 to the scientific aspects to be
assessed.

6.2.3. Training
Product reviewers will have knowledge on EU devices legislation, CS, harmonised standards
and relevant guidance documents including knowledge on the general safety and
performance requirements (set out in Annex I of the Regulations). This knowledge will
usually be acquired by means of training. The CAB should provide its product reviewers with
at least, an initial training on the relevant legislation and guidance documents. This training
should normally cover general aspects of the legislation and usually consist of 40 hours. This
training programme may be adjusted if auditors are able to provide evidence of the required
knowledge based on previous training or experience.
The CAB should provide product reviewers with an initial training on its procedures, in
relation to conformity laid down in Annexes IX to XI, in particular of technical documentation
assessment and other relevant aspects (e.g. testing). These training activities should also
include the forms in order to ensure that product reviewers are able to draw up appropriate
records and reports.
In addition, taking into account previous experience and the role of the individual, more
specific trainings may be envisaged. In particular, the CAB should provide product reviewers
with risk management and related device standards training, in order to ensure that product
reviewers have appropriate knowledge of the devices which they are assessing, including
clinical evaluation in case they fulfil the criteria for carrying out this task (see 7.1.2).
The CAB will update and build on the knowledge on this matter as part of its system of
exchange of experience. Regular updates will also take place as on-going training.
6.2.4. On the job training
Product reviewers will need training related to the review of technical documentation, such
as mirror reviews or reviews under supervision. The CAB should establish a minimum
number of reviews per type of devices or areas to be performed before the final
authorisation. All on-the-job training activities should be documented, and a system for its
assessment should be developed and followed.

6.3.

Internal clinicians

6.3.1. Background education
They will normally be qualified physicians.
5

Experience related to the specific aspects to be assessed should include, but not be limited to, extensive
experience in conformity assessment activities in a specific type of device or technology gained within a CAB.
For instance, experience on the review of design aspects of an intrauterine device could be performed by a
product reviewer with extensive and traceable experience on this sub-type of devices.
NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 8 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

6.3.2. Work experience
They will have several years' work experience (at least two) with the assessment of clinical
data for medical devices (closely related products like pharmaceuticals could also be
considered), in order to demonstrate:
-

a sound knowledge of the fundamental principles of the assessment of clinical data
for medical devices and medical statistics; and
direct work experience in patient care and/
clinical research, or related experience, in particular in conducting or assessing
preclinical or clinical trials or clinical data.

In case the internal clinician is authorised for the review of the clinical aspects of the
technical documentation, ideally his/her authorisation will be linked to MDR/IVR codes
related to the clinical areas in which the clinician can prove to have sufficient clinical
experience.
6.3.3. Training
Internal clinicians will have knowledge on EU devices legislation and relevant guidance
documents including knowledge on the general safety and performance requirements (set
out in Annex I of the Regulations). This knowledge will usually be acquired by means of
training. The CAB should provide its personnel with at least, an initial training on the relevant
legislation and guidance documents. This training should normally cover general aspects of
the legislation and consist of 40 hours. This training programme may be adjusted if internal
clinicians are able to provide evidence of the required knowledge based on previous training
or experience.
The CAB should provide the internal clinician with an initial training on its procedures, in
relation to conformity laid down in Annexes IX to XI, in particular of clinical evaluation
assessment. These training activities should also include the forms in order to ensure that
product reviewers are able to draw up appropriate records and reports.
In addition, taking into account previous experience and the role of the individual, more
specific trainings may be envisaged. The CAB will update and build on the knowledge on
this matter as part of its system of exchange of experience. Regular updates will also take
place as on-going training.

6.4.

Clinical specialists

6.4.1. Background education
They are normally medical specialists (or alternative holders such as a degree in dentistry)
with certified specialisation in a medical field that is relevant for the MDR/IVR codes to which
the individual is to be authorised.
6.4.2. Work experience for clinical specialists
They should be medical practitioners (currently registered and having clinical experience in
using the device or similar devices, the pathology of the condition being treated, the usual
treatment and other medical alternatives. The authorisation of these clinicians will be linked
to the MDR/IVR codes or medical areas for which they can prove sufficient experience. For
instance, it is expected that the clinical evaluation and data of a vaginal mesh will be
assessed by a gynaecologist/urologist or that a breast implant will be assessed by an
aesthetic or cosmetic surgeon.
6.4.3. Training

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 9 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

Clinical specialists will have basic knowledge on EU devices legislation and relevant
guidance documents including knowledge on the general safety and performance
requirements (set out in Annex I of the Regulations). This knowledge will usually be acquired
by means of training. The internal clinician will provide these staff with specific and regular
training. These training activities should also include the forms in order to ensure that
product reviewers are able to draw up appropriate records and reports.
In addition, taking into account previous experience and the role of the individual, more
specific trainings may be envisaged. The CAB will update and build on the knowledge on
this matter as part of its system of exchange of experience. Regular updates will also take
place as on-going training.

6.5.

Authorising personnel, final reviewers and decision makers

6.5.1. Background education
It is preferable that their education is related to the healthcare products field as it will ensure
they are in a better position to understand all of the conformity assessment activities carried
out.
6.5.2. Work experience
Authorising personnel will have adequate experience in conformity assessments on medical
devices under the Regulations or previously applicable law that should have been acquired
by working in a CAB.
Work experience for final reviewers and decision makers will be related to the healthcare
products field. These personnel should preferably have been working as site auditor and/or
product reviewer for a minimum of two years (in a CAB) in order to ensure their knowledge
of applicable legal requirements and CAB's procedures is sufficiently broad.
6.5.3. Training
Authorising personnel, final reviewers and decision makers will have knowledge on EU
devices legislation, CS and relevant guidance documents including knowledge on the
general safety and performance requirements (set out in Annex I of the Regulations). This
knowledge will usually be acquired by means of training. The CAB should provide its
personnel with at least, an initial training on the relevant legislation and guidance
documents. This training should normally cover general aspects of the legislation and
consist of 40 hours. This training programme may be adjusted if authorising personnel are
able to provide evidence of the required knowledge based on previous training or
experience.
The CAB should provide these personnel with an initial training on its procedures, in relation
to conformity laid down in Annexes IX to XI and qualification criteria, as appropriate. These
training activities should also include the forms in order to ensure that staff is able to draw up
appropriate records and reports.
In addition, taking into account previous experience and the role of the individual, more
specific trainings may be envisaged. In particular, the CAB should provide its personnel with
risk management and related device standards training, in order to ensure that this staff
have broad base of knowledge of device technologies and the design and manufacture of
devices.
The CAB will update and build on the knowledge on this matter as part of its system of
exchange of experience. Regular updates will also take place as on-going training
6.5.4. On the job training

NBOG BPG 2017-2 rev 1

Page 10 of 18

NBOG’s Best Practice Guide

2017-2

Final reviewers and decision makers will need training related to the review of
documentations on conformity assessment procedures, such as mirror reviews or reviews
under supervision. The CAB should establish a minimum number of reviews per type of
devices or areas to be performed before the final authorisation.
Other on the job training criteria could also be developed for authorising personnel and
decision makers.
All on-the-job training activities should be documented, and a system for its assessment
should be developed and followed.

7.

Maintaining of competence and professional development

7.1. Maintaining of competence
The CAB should establish criteria for maintaining competence linked to the specific roles and
tasks to be performed and type of devices or areas for which they will be authorised. These
criteria should be linked to the monitoring of staff competence and performance and should
be objective (e.g. minimum number of audits or product reviews per code in a certain period
of time or successful review under supervision per code every three years).
CABs should build a tailored-made program after the periodic review of individual
competence in relation to each individual's qualification in order to ensure that their
knowledge is adequate already at an early stage and remains current subsequently. The
training should be provided when the review of the competence reveals gaps in the
individual's knowledge (e.g. the medical device expertise was gained more than 5 years
before the authorisation and there is no evidence proving that it has been kept up to date)
prior to the authorisation (or renewal of the authorisation) of the individual.
In addition, the CAB should organise activities for exchanging of experience intended to
harmonise staff practices and to raise awareness in relation to guidance, legislation or
standardisation.

7.2. Professional development
Any relevant courses attended that have further developed the persons expertise should be
identified, indicating the organisation responsible, objectives and length (number of hours). If
the course was organised by the CAB, it should be linked to verification of effectiveness, for
example an examination. This should be stated in the CAB’s criteria and documented.
Self-study of guidance document and standards could be considered as an additional
method of professional development, especially in those areas where external training is not
available. If the CAB wishes to accept this type of training to fulfil the satisfaction of a
qualification criterion, a system for assessing knowledge acquired (including measurable and
consistent specifications) and for verifying the effectiveness of this training should be in
place.

7.3. Extension of competence
When the individual wishes to add a code or role to his/her scope of activities (e.g. when
work experience background in a different but closely related sector could serve as a basis
for the authorisation of an individual for an extra MDR/IVDR code but the assessment of
knowledge shows gaps to be filled in with training).

Specific qualification criteria

The regulations establish the need for defining special qualification criteria for a number of
areas. Some of these areas are already covered by specific designation codes. The criteria
defined in this section contain general principles and therefore no reference is made to the
specific roles.

8.1.

Specific criteria defined in Annex VII of the MDR

8.1.1. Pre-clinical evaluation
The CAB will define criteria applicable to different type devices and areas in which aspects
related to pre-clinical evaluation should be included. The assessment of the preclinical
evaluation is expected to be performed by product reviewers, but it could be carried out by
specific experts if the CAB wishes to define horizontal pre-clinical evaluation criteria.
Pre-clinical evaluation, within the scope of the qualification system, addresses aspects of the
device such as biological safety, physical, chemical and microbiological characterization,
electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility, software verification and validation,
stability, shelf life, performance and safety. Pre-clinical evaluation should take into account
pre-clinical testing, and literature search.

Relevant educational background such as biology, toxicology, medicine, veterinary
medicine, pharmacy, engineering and materials or biomaterials science;
- A sound knowledge of the fundamental principles of the assessment of pre-clinical
evaluation for medical devices;
- A sound knowledge/training in the current common specifications, harmonised
standards (e.g. EN/ISO 10993 series) and guidance documents;
- Practical experience in conducting pre-clinical testing or assessing preclinical data.
It is anticipated that the competencies above should have been gained from at least two
years’ work experience with the assessment of pre-clinical data for medical devices (closely
related areas like pharmaceuticals pre-clinical data assessment may also be considered).

8.1.2. Clinical evaluation
The clinical evaluation criteria are detailed under the internal clinician / clinical specialist
roles (see sections 5.3 and 5.4) as the assessment of the clinical evaluation will normally be
performed by either the internal clinician or clinical specialists. Nevertheless, the CAB could
define horizontal clinical evaluation criteria to authorise product reviewers with specific
clinical expertise whose assessment will be directed and overseen by the internal clinician.
In this case, the criteria and supporting documentation for experts with clinical expertise
should include all of the following:
-

Relevant educational background such as medicine doctorate, nursing degree or
degree on dentistry.
A sound knowledge of the fundamental principles of the assessment of clinical data
for medical devices;
