Introduction
This document presents questions and answers on requirements relating to notified
bodies under Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices (MDR) and Regulation
(EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (IVDR). The issues covered by
this document have been identified in the context of joint assessments, and the
document may be updated from time to time as new issues are identified.
I.

ORGANISATIONAL AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
I.1.

Are CABs obliged to follow guidance endorsed by the Medical
Devices Coordination Group (MDCG)?

Guidance documents are by definition not compulsory. However, all guidance
documents endorsed by the MDCG reflect the interpretation of the EU law jointly
agreed by the authorities which are in charge of interpreting and applying the EU law.
Hence notified bodies should be encouraged to apply these guidance documents
(also taking into consideration Section 1.6.2 of Annex VII to the MDR/IVDR1).
Furthermore, it is to be noticed that the European Court of Justice often refers to
guidance documents when developing its rulings. Hence Notified Bodies have an
interest, also in terms of liability risk, to follow that guidance.

1.6.2. The notified body shall take into consideration guidance and best practice documents.

I.2.

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

What is the meaning of “legal personality” under Section 1.1.1
of Annex VII2?

The CAB needs to have legal personality, meaning that it has to exist as a legal
entity. To that end, it must be registered as legal entity, also called "legal person".
The wording of the MDR/IVDR does not exclude that only a part of a legal entity
undertakes conformity assessment activities in the field of medical devices. In this
case, where the CAB is part of a wider legal entity, the documentation provided
should be clear as to where the CAB sits within that legal entity. In case the entire
legal entity is the CAB, the documentation to be provided refers to the legal entity as
such. It is always this legal entity as such which is designated (and not its
organisational part).
I.3.

What is the meaning of “organisation” as described in 1.1.2 of
Annex VII?

The term of "organisation" as described in 1.1.2 refers to the whole organisation (e.g.
corporate group) to which the CAB belongs including the CAB's legal entity. The
concept of "organisation" should be based not only on ownership rights (e.g. shares),
but also functional/hierarchical links, such as voting/management/other control rights.
One typical example of organisation is a holding company owning different
companies (i.e. separate legal entities), one of them being or containing the CAB.
I.4.

Does the term “organisational structure” as per 1.1.5 refer only
to hierarchical relationships?

If a notified body is part of a larger organisation, both hierarchical (i.e. mother and
daughter companies of the CAB) and horizontal relationships (e.g. sister companies
where there is a common mother company) between the notified body and other
entities belonging to that organisation are covered by the term "organisational
structure".
The organisational structure of the CAB will vary depending on the complexity of the
legal entity and the organisation to which it belongs. For instance, in the case of
holding companies, the CAB could provide a matricial organisational chart with dual
reporting relationships (i.e. functional and managerial). In this case, hierarchical and
reporting lines should be clear and should match the information provided in job
descriptions for the activities related to the MDR/ IVDR certification.
I.5.
I.5.1.

Is a 3-year competitor clause for consultants covered in the
MDR / IVDR requirements?

The MDR/IVDR does no longer define the timelines for clearance of consultants that
were defined in Section 1.3b of Annex I to the Implementing Regulation (EU)
920/2013, except in case that the person worked for the same company or the group
(Section 1.2.4 of Annex VII). However, the requirements under the Implementing
Regulation (EU) 920/2013 on the management of impartiality for consultants are
2

Unless specified otherwise, a reference to Annex VII means a reference to both Annex VII of the MDR and Annex VII of the
IVDR.

included in sections 1.2.2, and 1.2.3 (c), (d) and (e) of Annex VII. Therefore, it is
expected that CABs will have similar measures in place under both regimes. It is
essential that competitors, authorised representatives and suppliers are also included
in the identification, analysis and resolution of potential conflicts of interests.
I.5.2.

How long does personnel carrying out conformity
assessment tasks need to be “banned” from a specific
client when they were formerly employed by that specific
client or a company belonging to the same group (holding)
of the client?

The Regulations require personnel responsible for carrying out the conformity
assessment tasks to have e.g., at least 2-years professional experience in the
design, manufacture, testing or use of the device or technology. Therefore, notified
bodies should usually hire staff who previously worked in those areas.
For this reason, in case personnel was previously involved in activities such as
design, manufacture etc. listed in Annex VII Section 1.2.3, the requirement set out in
Annex VII Section 1.2.4 establishing a 3-years-ban-period before conformity
assessment tasks may be carried out for a former employer or the organisation to
which it belongs should be applied as a general rule. However, according to Annex
VII Section 1.2.3, conformity assessment tasks for devices in which notified body
personnel was directly involved in their design or manufacture are not allowed.
Additional guidance is provided in Q&A I.9.
I.6.
I.6.1.

What is and what is not considered consultancy?

According to MDR/IVDR Annex VII, section 1.2.9, the independence and impartiality
requirements do not preclude exchanges of technical information and regulatory
guidance between a notified body and a manufacturer applying for conformity
assessment activities. However, any activities consisting in providing advice to
manufacturers, their authorised representatives, or suppliers regarding solutions on
how to fulfil regulatory requirements, (e.g., advice as regards the design,
construction, marketing or maintenance of devices or processes, i.e., on “how to
comply”) falls under the definition of consultancy and is prohibited according to Annex
VII Section 1.2.3 (d) MDR/IVDR. This includes any involvement in activities (e.g.
design, risk management, manufacturing processes) related with the devices or
quality management systems for manufacturers, their suppliers or subcontractors,
except third-party conformity assessment activities. Also, other activities not
specifically linked with the devices will be regarded as consultancy (e.g. internal
audits to manufacturers or client specific training).
However, general training activities that are not client-specific and that relate to
regulation of devices or to related standards, are allowed. Trainings by the notified
body, or a related body, are not considered client-specific if they are open to the
public, content and materials are not customized, and attendance is not limited to
one manufacturer or a manufacturer's suppliers/subcontractors. The above includes
remote real-time training that is open to the public via online access. Training
activities may not take place at the manufacturer’s premises, at the premises of a
Page 4 of 21

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

manufacturer's supplier or subcontractor, or in locations rented or organized by them.
Notified bodies’ attendance to conferences and other open events are also allowed,
even if organised by a notified body’s client. Similarly, dissemination of informative
material, such as blog posts, guidance documents or informative presentations
published by the notified body is allowed as long as the contents comply with the
principles outlined before.
I.6.2.

Why is a notified body only allowed to perform conformity
assessment activities after an application has been
lodged?

To be able to comply with the independence and impartiality requirements in
Annex VII of the MDR/IVDR, notified bodies are not allowed to engage in any
activity that may conflict with their independence of judgement or integrity in
relation to conformity assessment activities for which they are designated. This is
why pre-application3 and post-application activities must be distinguished.
Before an application is lodged by the manufacturer, activities that are part of or
could fall under the definition of conformity assessment activities like the review of
clinical data or the (partial) assessment of the quality management system 4 are not
allowed as they would be regarded as consultancy (e.g., gap analysis, check of
MDR/IVDR readiness, use of mock-up files produced instead of “real” technical
documentation assessments). A preliminary verification by the notified body that
the product or which parts of a product are covered by the Regulations, the correct
classification, whether it could qualify as an orphan device5, and the correct
identification of the MD/IVD codes6 prior to issuing any quotation to the
manufacturer are however legal requirements to be performed as pre-application
activities.7 These topics are expected to be discussed in the context of the
structured dialogue before an application is lodged (see Q&A I.6.3) and will require
exchange of the relevant information between the manufacturer and the notified
body.
Every activity carried out once an application has been submitted will be
considered part of the conformity assessment activities and therefore if the
manufacturer withdraws its application after this process has started, the notified
body has to inform the other notified bodies through EUDAMED according to
Article 53(2) MDR / 49(2) IVDR.
The notified body has to reflect in its policy and/or implement in its procedures how
it prevents that any of its activities become consultancy activities.
I.6.3.

What is considered “structured dialogue”?

According to MDCG 2022-14, action item 15, notified bodies and manufacturers
are encouraged to organise structured dialogues before and during the conformity

See MDR/IVDR Annex VII, section 4.2.
See e.g., MDR/IVDR Annex IX, section 2. However, voluntary third-party activities carried out e.g. in the
framework of certifications based on regulatory standards, including ISO 13485, are allowed.

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

assessment process aimed at exchanges on regulatory procedures, i.e.,
exchanges of technical information and regulatory guidance8 between the notified
body and the manufacturer. In general, all structured dialogue should be focused
on “what needs to be fulfilled” rather than “how to fulfill”. Questions I.6.1 and I.6.2
further elaborate the context.
As part of the structured dialogue the notified body, taking into account Q&As I.6.1
and I.6.2, should provide to the manufacturer a comprehensive overview of the
certification process, including pre-application and application processes. This
would include but is not limited to information related to the contractual
relationship, forms to be used, documentation that needs to be provided by the
manufacturer and at which stages during the assessment procedure, possible
options, special procedures, which languages are acceptable, timelines to be
respected, fees charged for specific conformity assessment activities, and any
other financial conditions.
Structured dialogues are expected to be performed before (i.e. pre-application) as
well as during the conformity assessment process (i.e. post-application9). Costs
related to structured dialogues should not entail extra fees but be integrated in fees
related to pre-application and conformity assessment activities. Their aim is to
enhance the efficiency and predictability of the conformity assessment process,
without jeopardising independence, objectivity and impartiality requirements.
Manufacturer and notified body can discuss about the possibility to leverage
evidence stemming from previous assessments (e.g., previously conducted under
the MDR/IVDR, as relevant, or conducted with regard to requirements under the
Directives or legislation under other jurisdictions) with a view to enhance the
efficiency of the conformity assessment procedure under the Regulations (see
Q&As IV.13).
Moreover, during a structured dialogue in the post-application phase, manufacturer
and notified body may exchange views on the sufficiency of clinical data on which
the clinical evaluation is based, including possible applicability of Article 61(10) of
MDR, equivalence of the device under assessment with another device as well as
the appropriateness of the post-market clinical follow-up plan. Such kind of
structured dialogue in the early phase after submission of the application can
significantly increase the predictability of the conformity assessment process
without jeopardising the notified body’s independence or impartiality.
In the context of the structured dialogue, questions by the manufacturer should
respect the notified body’s independence, objectivity and impartiality requirements,
i.e., they should not be open-ended and need to avoid expecting solutions on “how
to comply” thus ensuring that no consultancy services are taking place (see also
Q&A I.6.1). The responsibility to meet the regulatory requirements remains with the
manufacturer.
The notified body should establish documented procedures ensuring that the main
topics exchanged on within structured dialogues are documented10.

The post-application phase starts when the notified body has received the application, irrespective if it is
complete or not.

I.7.

Can the CAB accept applications prior to being notified?

No, applications under the MDR / IVDR cannot be accepted before the designation of
the CAB became valid, i.e. the day after the notification is published in NANDO.
I.8.

How are the conditions on remuneration to be assessed within
the meaning of 1.2.5 of Annex VII?

The MDR/IVDR establishes that remuneration cannot depend on the results of the
assessments. Both direct and indirect correlations between results of the
assessments and remuneration are prohibited. Hence an individual examination is
needed. Special care has to be applied with regard to bonuses. Bonuses on the
basis of general objectives, even when not directly linked to the result of the
individual conformity assessments, might still be problematic if they indirectly
correlate to the average result of assessments. In the context of a joint-assessment,
sampling of contracts or agreements covering remuneration (sheets) should take
place. The sampling should cover different grades of influence, e.g. project handlers,
final reviewers/decision makers, or head of the CAB / medical devices' certification.
I.9. Are declarations of absence of conflict of interests sufficient to
ensure compliance with legal requirements for impartiality?
No, declarations are not sufficient in isolation to ensure compliance. CABs should
define their own system to comply with the legal requirements for independence and
impartiality (see Q&As I.5.1.- I.6.3), but a system based on analysis of risk and
control measures should be generally in place. This system will usually include a
comprehensive risk analysis of the CAB's activities, its staff (including top-level
management) and the activities of its organisation or related bodies. Risks posed to
impartiality from each individual should be assessed with regard to past employment,
consultancy services and financial interests. For instance, shares in companies
certified by the notified body or in competitors of these companies (investment funds
can be seen differently) as well as relatives of the person under analysis. Also, the
risks linked to subcontractors/suppliers (1.2.1) of the manufacturer need to be
assessed.
Section 2.4 of Annex VII also requires, as part of this system, a “multi-level”
statement. Firstly, a general one, listing any existing or prior association with clients
or devices or processes under assessment. This general one needs to be renewed
from time to time (e.g. annually). In addition, there is a need for a written statement
and verification by the notified body within each conformity assessment project.
I.10. Does a CAB that is part of a larger organisation need individual
liability insurance?
The CAB is responsible for taking out liability insurance and therefore there must be
evidence that the legal entity is covered by a liability insurance that fulfils the legal
Page 9 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

requirements. The contract with the insurance company can be signed by other legal
entity of a larger organisation (i.e. mother company) provided that the contract gives
the CAB the individual right to be protected against liability claims. The notified body
must be able to invoke that right directly towards the insurance company, and not
only indirectly via the company which has signed the contract (this is important e.g. in
case of insolvency of the signing company or in case of unwillingness or inability of
the signing company to effectively invoke the insurance contract towards the
insurance company). Furthermore, the signing legal entity must involve the notified
body in any change of insurance conditions affecting the medical devices conformity
assessment activities of the CAB so that the notified body has the possibility to react
if it considers that the coverage is insufficient.
Any change on the liability insurance which may affect the compliance of the notified
body with the requirements set out in Annex VII should be communicated by the body
to the authority responsible for notified bodies in accordance with articles 44 (1) of
the MDR / 40(1) of the IVDR.

II.

QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

III.

RESOURCES REQUIREMENTS
III.1.

Is a complete re-authorization of existing personnel necessary
to document satisfaction of the new qualification criteria under
section 3 of Annex VII?

Yes, all personnel that will be used to perform conformity assessment tasks under
the MDR/IVDR shall be authorized under the new criteria. For the satisfaction of the
work experience criteria, the CAB can accept previous experience in a notified body
but it cannot automatically grandfather authorisations (i.e. transfer authorisations)
granted by other notified body or by the same notified body under the Directives.
However, the experience in a notified body needs to be extensive and traceable and
always specific to the tasks to be carried out and the specific technology or product
(specific codes) in order to satisfy the MDR/IVDR qualification criteria. In addition,
comprehensive and objective evidence of such previous experience in a notified
body in the relevant scope shall be part of the personnel files.
III.2.

What is the meaning of “permanent availability of sufficient
personnel” within Section 3.1.1 of Annex VII?

In respect to the availability of personnel, MDR / IVDR Annex VII Section 3.1.1 do not
establish the number of auditors / reviewers per code to ensure permanent
availability of sufficient personnel. As a very minimum, it is considered that notified
body should have one person available and authorised per applied-for scope code
and role as per Section 3.2 of Annex VII at the time of the joint assessment.
Nevertheless, it is recommended that the notified body has two product
reviewers/auditors authorised per code to ensure a sufficient capacity to allow
fulfilment of other related requirements such as rotation of personnel. When this is
Page 10 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

not the case, an observation may be raised at the joint assessment in order to flag
that for certain codes the available resources are limited.
The notified body is expected to have 2 auditors / reviewers available and authorised
per applied-for scope in order to fulfil the legal requirements under Section 3.1.1 of
Annex VII at the moment of its re-assessment joint assessment.
III.3.

What is the meaning of “possess or have access to all
equipment and facilities” needed to perform its tasks within
the meaning of Section 3.1.1 of Annex VII of the MDR?

This question refers to the requirements in relation to possessing or having access to
sufficient equipment and facilities to properly perform the conformity assessment
activities within the CAB's applied-for scope. It is expected that the CAB would have
internal testing facilities or access to testing subcontractor(s) (e.g. by a framework
agreement) for device tests in support of the codes for which it seeks designation
under Annex X and Annex XI(B).
In order to be designated under Annex X and XI(B), the CAB's personnel needs to
have the technical knowledge to identify and select all the tests needed; the CAB
must have implemented detailed procedures ensuring the identification of the
relevant tests; and have access to at least some of the tests to be performed within
the scope of designation. In particular, for each MDA or MDN code for which the CAB
applies under Annex X or XIB it should identify at least the basic tests to be
performed and the corresponding testing facilities (internal or subcontracted). The
CAB should be able to demonstrate how the facilities available are linked to the
codes the CAB applies for.
Nevertheless, the CAB is not expected to have testing equipment and facilities (either
in house or a framework agreement) covering all possible tests within a code under
Annex X or XI(B) or as part of surveillance or unannounced audits as some of the
tests are very specific or rarely used. For these purposes, the CAB should have
procedures in place in order to find additional subcontractors whenever needed or to
define under which circumstances the CAB will perform witness testing (i.e. when the
test equipment needed is very specialised)
III.4.

What is the meaning of "two years' professional experience" in
cases where the experience has been gained within a CAB
under section 3.2.5 of Annex VII?

According to MDR/IVDR Annex VII 3.2.5 product reviewers have to demonstrate two
years’ professional experience in the design, manufacture, testing or use of the
device or technology to be assessed or related to the scientific aspects to be
assessed. Experience related to the scientific aspects to be assessed could include,
but not be limited to, extensive experience in conformity assessment activities in a
specific type of device or technology gained within a CAB12 .

12 As defined in section 6.2.2. of NBOG BPG 2017-2

Page 11 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

In such case, when professional experience – based on a relevant background
education – is to be proven by activities only within a CAB, this experience should
have been gained during at least two years. As a guideline if one individual has
carried out at least five full technical documentation assessments of devices in the
relevant code (or aspects to be assessed) or under the equivalent code under the
Directives, during at least 2 years, this can be accepted as a valid work experience
within the meaning of 3.2.5 of Annex VII. Nevertheless, based on the assessment of
the educational background and specific work experience of the individual, the CAB
has always to analyse if additional assessments must be performed (i.e. under
supervision).
In addition, in situations where the objective evidence for the experience gained
during technical file reviews is insufficient (e.g. if the staff was authorised for the code
in a different CAB without detailed supporting evidence), as a guideline, the technical
documentation assessments on the code (or aspects to be assessed) to which the
individual wishes to be authorised have to be carried out under close supervision of
an experienced product reviewer (e.g. mirror review13). At least five of these
assessments should be related to a full assessment. In addition to technical
documentation assessments or product tests, product-related audit activities can be
considered as work experience as long as they are not used solely and they are
adequately documented and assessed by the authorising personnel of [or within] the
CAB.
In all of the cases above, the CAB has to analyse individual training needs (e.g. on
relevant standards) especially when the work experience was gained a few years ago
in the past or when the individual has experience related to a very similar technology.
Before authorisation, the authorising personnel needs to ensure that all the
qualification criteria under 3.2.5 of Annex VII are fulfilled and their satisfaction fully
documented (including an adequate justification in the exceptional cases where the
criteria cannot be fully demonstrated as established in 3.3.1 of Annex VII) and that
the knowledge is state-of-the-art.
For codes (MDR/IVDR) comprising a broad range of devices, the CAB has to ensure
that the individual has carried out technical documentation assessments in different
devices covered by the code or the authorisation to the code is to be granted with
appropriate limitations.
III.5.

Does the CAB need to define qualification criteria for
monitoring and maintenance of competences in accordance
with Section 3.5 of Annex VII?

Yes. The CAB’s personnel competence needs to be maintained and therefore
reviewed at regular intervals. For this purpose, the authorising personnel14 (as per
3.2.3 of Annex VII) needs to define qualification criteria for monitoring and
maintenance of competence of its entire staff (internal and external, as well as
subcontractors), involved in conformity assessment activities. Such "re-qualification"
13 Mirror review is to be understood as a review carried out simultaneously by two product reviewers of the notified body, one
being on training and the other one being an experienced product reviewer on that code. Once the review is finalised from the
two reviewers, the most experienced will assess and document the quality of the review carried out by the person in training.
14
Short term used in NBOG BPG 2017-2 to refer to "personnel responsible for establishing qualification criteria and for
authorising other personnel to perform specific conformity assessment activities" according to Section 3.2.3 of Annex VII.

Page 12 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

or "maintenance" criteria will be used as a basis for re-authorisation of personnel to
codes and roles.
In respect of monitoring of competence, such criteria should be defined for personnel
involved in conformity assessment activities, at least for personnel with relevant
clinical expertise, product reviewers, site auditors and final reviewer / decision-maker,
and authorising personnel.
III.6.

What is the meaning of the term “employed” in MDR Article
36(1) / IVDR Article 32(1)?

The personnel referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 36(1) MDR / Article
32(1) IVDR, read in conjunction with Sections 3.2.3 and 3.2.7 of Annex VII MDR /
IVDR, perform key functions within the notified body. In particular, section 3.2.3 refers
to personnel responsible for establishing qualification criteria and for authorising
other personnel to perform specific conformity assessment activities and Section
3.2.7 refers to personnel with overall responsibility for final reviews and decisionmaking on certifications. Therefore, both Regulations expressly require that these
personnel are employed by the notified body itself and not external experts or
subcontractors/subcontracted. This requirement is estimated to be complied with
when the contractual relationship between the notified body and the individual meets
at the minimum the following criteria:
•
•
•

employment contract between the notified body and the employee setting out
the rights and obligations of both parties in accordance with the applicable
employment and labour legislation15 ;
control and supervision over the activities of the employee by the notified
body; and
direct reporting obligations of the employee towards the notified body.

Contracts between the notified body and another legal entity providing for an
assignment of staff employed by that other legal entity to the notified body (often
called ‘secondary contracts’) should not be considered as fulfilling the requirement of
‘employed by the notified body itself’.
Moreover, Section 4.1 of Annex VII to MDR / IVDR lists the following processes to be
fulfilled as part of the internal activities of notified bodies and that are not to be
subcontracted:
•
•
•
•

application review and contract (Section 4.3);
allocation of resources (Section 4.4);
final review (Section 4.7);
decisions and certifications (Section 4.8).

15

The law applicable to individual employment contracts is determined in accordance with Regulation (EC) No
593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual
obligations (Rome I), in particular its Articles 3 and 8.

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

Any reference to “internal activities” shall be intended as activities being carried out
by personnel employed by the notified body.
III.7.

What is the meaning of “permanent availability of personnel
with relevant clinical expertise” in accordance with sections
3.2.4 and 3.1.1 of Annex VII?

With regard to “personnel with relevant clinical expertise”, in order to fulfil the tasks
covered in Section 3.2.4 of Annex VII it is expected that the CAB has at least one
"internal clinician" who, where possible, has to be employed by the CAB. This does
not preclude the possibility to subcontract such a role, provided that the notified body
produces a justification as to why it is not possible to employ the person(s). In any
case, when the CAB does not have the possibility of employing that person(s), it
should at least ensure that she/he is fully integrated throughout the conformity
assessment and the decision-making process, which means that the person is
involved in the CABs assessment and decision-making process in the same way as
an employed staff. However, it should be noted that when the internal clinician is a
subcontractor even if this person will support the final review and decision making
process as indicated in 3.2.4 (e.g. in case an external clinical expert has been
involved making a recommendation to the final reviewer or decision maker) they
cannot be authorised as final reviewer or decision maker as these personnel should
be employed by the notified body itself as required in Art. 36 of the MDR and Art. 32
of the IVDR.
Accordingly, all “internal clinicians” are integrated, whereas some internal clinicians
are not employed. Given that the term "internal clinician" is widely spread, and it has
been used to defined personnel carrying out tasks established in Section 3.2.4 of
Annex VII it is assumed that when the term "internal clinician" is used, it could refer
either to an employee of the CAB or not.

IV.

PROCESS REQUIREMENTS
IV.1.

Do devices certified under the Directives need to be subject to a
full conformity assessment under the new Regulations if the
manufacturer applies for certification under the MDR / IVDR?

The conformity assessment activities described under Article 52 / Article 48 apply to
any certificate issued under the new regulations. As no exceptions were established
under the regulations for the migration or transfer of MDD/AIMDD/IVDD certificates to
the MDR / IVDR the general provisions should apply. Therefore, all devices to be
certified under the MDR / IVDR should be subject to an initial certification according
to the applicable annex. The notified body should ensure that all requirements under
the MDR / IVDR are fulfilled. It may not restrict its procedures to gap audits or gap file
reviews. However, when possible, the notified body should make use of leveraging
evidence (see Q&A IV.13).

Page 14 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

It should be noted that MDD/AIMDD/IVDD certificates shall be considered to be valid
as long as conditions laid down in Article 120(3) of the MDR and 110 (3) of the IVDR
are complied with16.
IV.2.

What should be the criteria for auditing suppliers and
subcontractors?

The MDR/IVDR established that the audit of the manufacturer premises must include
an audit on the premises of subcontractors and/or suppliers if appropriate. Therefore,
the notified body should have criteria for auditing these actors on the basis of their
criticality. At the very least, the criteria defined in Section 4.5.2(b) of Annex VII should
be applied (i.e. the control over the supplier/subcontractor and its influence on the
conformity of the device is essential whereas the sole existence of a certificate
against ISO 13485 is not sufficient).
IV.3.

What is the meaning of "examinations and tests" to be
included in a certificate in accordance with Section 10 of
Annex XII of the MDR / IVDR?17

Certificates do not need to include reference to relevant common specifications or
harmonised standards as long as such information on all examinations and tests
performed is traceable and available from e.g. report(s) which are mentioned in the
certificate.
IV.4.

What are the applicable requirements for voluntary certificate
transfer under MDR Article 58 / IVDR Article 53?

While MDR Article 58(1) / IVDR Article 53(1) sets out the requirements for a transfer
agreement, it does not specify the conformity assessment activities to be performed
by the incoming NB.
The incoming NB may decide not to carry out full conformity assessment activities
according to Article 52 MDR / Article 48 IVDR, as long as it does have sufficient
information in respect to the conformity activities performed by the outgoing NB.
For quality management system certificates, the incoming NB needs to perform
appropriate on-site audit(s) and assessments to ensure that the manufacturer in
question applies the approved QMS and the post-market surveillance plan prior to
the issue of any certificate. In respect to the assessment of technical documentations
on a sampling basis, the incoming NB shall review the previous assessment results
together with a sample of a technical documentation and draw up or amend a
sampling plan.

16

2023/607 amending Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746 as regards the transitional provisions for
certain medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices as well as Q&A on practical aspects related to
the implementation of the extended transitional period provided for in the IVDR, as amended by Regulation
(EU) 2024/1860 of 13 June 2024.

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

For product certificates (Annex IX Chapter II/Annex X), new certificates without a
comprehensive (initial) review may be issued as long as the documentation received
does not identify ongoing existing or other concerns.
The incoming NB assumes full responsibility for the new certificates issued following
the transfer.
IV.5.

What are the applicable requirements for OBL manufacturers?

The MDR / IVDR does not distinguish between OBL18 and other manufacturers.
There are just "manufacturers" and therefore OBL manufacturers must comply with
the legal requirements, as any other manufacturer19.
IV.6.

What is the role of the internal or integrated clinician in the
notified body´s assessment and decision-making process?

The internal or otherwise integrated clinician is responsible to identify when specialist
input is required for the assessment of the clinical evaluation as defined in Section
3.2.4 of Annex VII of the MDR and IVDR. This decision will be made by the internal
or integrated clinician on a case-by-case basis, based on the products covered by the
applications lodged by the manufacturer and the clinical expertise available. The
internal clinician or integrated clinician will be responsible for this process in all cases
where the conformity of the device to the requirements of annex I is achieved also by
clinical data. In cases where demonstration of conformity to requirements of Annex I
based on clinical data is not deemed appropriate (in accordance with Article 61(10))
the internal or integrated clinician will also examine the justification provided in order
to assess its adequacy. The internal or otherwise integrated clinicians will decide if
the review of clinical evaluation is to be carried out by themselves, to be delegated to
other qualified staff or if it necessitates the input of external clinical experts. This
process is also defined in Section 4.3 of Annex IX of the MDR and Section 5.4 of
NBOG’s best practice guide 2017-2 as endorsed by the MDCG.
Section 3.2.4 of Annex VII defines that there must be a clinician who is either internal
(= employee) or otherwise integrated into the CAB's assessment and decisionmaking process. To be regarded as integrated, a clinician (who is not an employee)
must have access to all the information, required to perform its activities, circulating
in the CAB and must be involved in the internal processes in the same way as an
employee, the only difference to an employee being that there is no employment
contract, but a service contract and therefore this person should not be considered
final reviewer or decision-maker as per 3.2.7 of Annex VII.
In addition to this, the internal or otherwise integrated clinician will clinically judge the
opinion provided by any external expert (including verification of comparability and
consistency of the assessments of clinical evaluations conducted by clinical experts)
and will be responsible to make a recommendation to the decision maker on the
adequacy of the clinical evaluation.
18 OBL” (own brand label manufacturer) is a term used in the field that describes manufacturer that are supplied with the finished medical

device by their supplier, who often is called “OEM” (original equipment manufacturer). Neither of both are defined in the MDR (or ever
were defined in the Directives).
19 Including but not limited to having: full and permanent access to the technical documentation; (ability for) post-market surveillance
including post market clinical follow-up; sufficient technical competence; and control of the quality system (control of the design,
manufacture and/or final verification and testing of the devices).

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

What is the meaning of allocation of resources under Section
4.4 of Annex VII?

Allocation of resources is to be understood as the allocation of appropriately
authorised and qualified personnel and means (including equipment and facilities) for
a given project (application), as stated in second paragraph of Section 4.4 of Annex
VII "appropriate resources including personnel". Section 4.4 of Annex VII describes
the assignment of tasks within a project to “individuals”, starting with the individual
responsible for ensuring that the assessment of that application is conducted in
accordance with the relevant procedures and for ensuring that the appropriate
resources including personnel are utilised for each of the tasks of the assessment
(often referred to as project leader20) and following with the identification of individual
personnel that will carry out each task of a given project.
The assessment of the resources needed for each application is a key function that
has to be fulfilled as part of the internal activities of the CAB as indicated in Section
4.1 of Annex VII and any changes on such allocation should be documented.
The notified body may assign the tasks of allocating resources, documenting of any
change on such allocation and/or ensuring that the assessment of that application is
conducted in accordance with the relevant procedures to different functions
(individuals). In this case, the notified body needs to specify and document clearly the
roles and responsibilities. For every project, the notified body needs to identify clearly
which individual is taking care of a specified task. Any of the tasks specified in
Section 4.4. need to be fulfilled as internal activity.
IV.8.

How can a CAB ensure that information on "examinations and
tests" in accordance with Section 10 of Annex XII of the MDR /
IVDR is available to all interested parties (as referred to in
Section IV.3 of this document)?

According to Annex XII information on tests and examinations performed as part of
the conformity assessment activities need to be included on the certificates issued by
notified bodies. This information might be of interest for competent authorities and
third parties.
If the certificates do not include explicitly references to relevant common
specifications, harmonised standards or other standards or referential but include a
reference to the relevant report(s), the CAB should ensure that competent authorities
and interested parties can have access this information on request. For example, the
certificate may include a sentence like "information on examinations and tests as per
Annex XII, section 10 is available on request" and possibly provide a contact (e.g. email).
IV.9.

Which changes need prior approval by the CAB?

The Regulations - in Annex VII and in the specific conformity assessment annexes
(i.e. Annex IX, X and XI) -establish the need for the manufacturer to notify certain

20

The term “project leader” is not mentioned in the regulations, but frequently used.

Page 17 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

planned changes. Section 4.9 of Annex VII contains general requirements for
notified bodies in respect to changes.
For manufacturers, the specific conformity assessment annexes (i.e. Annex IX, X and
XI) detail such requirements e.g. asking for plans for “any” changes (e.g. MDR Annex
IX, 5.2 f), 5.3.1 d) or Annex X 5.2), for changes could affect the safety and
performance of the device or the conditions prescribed for use of the device (e.g.
MDR Annex IX 4.10) or for “substantial” changes only (e.g. MDR / IVDR Annex IX
2.4). With regard to the latter, the CAB needs to make clear in its communication to
the manufacturer (e.g. in the terms and conditions) what it considers as “substantial
changes” to the quality management system, or the device-range covered.
In order to fully comply with all the relevant requirements, the CAB must have
documented procedures defining how different changes need to be notified and
assessed prior to their implementation and how the assessment will be documented.
In particular, the CAB will define in its procedures when the approval of such changes
will take the form of a supplement of the previously issued certificate.
IV.10.

What is the frequency of surveillance audits according to the
Regulations?

Surveillance audits according to the Regulations can take place only after a MDR or
IVDR certificate has been issued. According to the Regulations, surveillance audits
have to be carried out on at least annual basis (Section 4.10 of Annex VII
MDR/IVDR), further specified in Section 3.3 of Annex IX MDR/IVDR and Section 7 of
Annex XI MDR/Section 4 of Annex XI IVDR as at least every 12 months. The first
surveillance audit should be scheduled 12 months after the certification decision
date. This is the so called “due date” (e.g. December) which defines the target dates
for all upcoming regular surveillance audits (e.g. each December).
In order to take in consideration, the necessity for contingent scheduling adjustments,
surveillance audits can be conducted within a limited window of +/- three months
from the due date without particular concern. However, if the surveillance audits are
conducted outside this time window (earlier or later) this should be exceptional and
must be justified and documented in consideration of the possible impact on the
certificate's validity. A cumulation of deviations over the years, e.g. changing the due
date is not allowed.
IV.11.

What is the meaning of the last sentence in Section 4.5.1 of
Annex VII with regard to the need for notified bodies to take
into consideration standards and guidance even if the
manufacturer does not claim compliance?

CABs need to consider all the available guidance, common specifications and
harmonised standards to carry out its assessments. This means, that CABs will have
to consider this documentation when developing its own procedures and processes
(including checklists and report templates) and when assessing the manufacturers
QMS (e.g. by taking into consideration EN ISO 13485) and technical documentation.
For instance, in order to assess if the solutions adopted by the manufacturer are
state of the art and in line with expectations, the CAB need to use the available
Page 18 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

guidance documents and standards. It should be noted that non-conformities will not
be raised against standards or guidance but need to be phrased against legal
requirements. For instance, Annex I Chapter I Section 1 of the Regulation which
states that “devices shall be safe and effective […] taking into account the generally
acknowledged state of the art” can be used when the technical documentation does
not follow standards or guidance.
IV.12.

What are the applicable requirements for re-certification?

Based on an application by the manufacturer and according to Article 56(2) of the
MDR / Article 51(2) of the IVDR and Section 4.11 of Annex VII of the Regulations,
notified bodies can extend the validity of QMS certificates (EU quality management
system or EU quality assurance certificates) as well as product certificates (EU
technical documentation assessment or EU type-examination certificates) for further
periods of maximum five years (re-certification).
Re-certifications are not repetitions of initial certifications.
Notified bodies should have documented procedures and appropriate forms for recertifications of
•

product certificates requiring the manufacturer to submit a summary of
changes and scientific findings as outlined in Section 4.11 of Annex VII, to
perform a targeted assessment of this information and to pay particular
attention to clinical data from post-market surveillance and PMCF activities
undertaken since the previous certification or re-certification, including
appropriate updates to manufacturers' clinical evaluation reports.

•

QMS certificates ensuring that all relevant Regulation requirements for
conducting audits (i.e. those covered in Section 4.5.2 of Annex VII, and
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of Annex IX) are assessed in their entirety at least once
after issuing the certificate and before their expiry date. They should foresee
the notified body to review the results of all surveillance activities carried out,
announced or unannounced, in accordance with Section 4.10 of Annex VII
during the certification cycle, especially on-site audits of the manufacturer, its
subcontractors / suppliers, and product tests carried out, as well as the
outcome of technical documentation assessments on sampling basis to verify
whether the approved quality management system still conforms to the
relevant provisions of the Regulation. In addition, they should contain an
obligatory check whether the audit programme and the sampling plan drawn
up according to Section 4.5.2 (a) of Annex VII are still up to date or need to be
adjusted.

In both cases, the procedures should foresee that the notified body, before renewing
a certificate, ensures:
•

that all nonconformities identified are either closed or followed up by an
adequate and accepted Corrective Actions and Preventive Actions (CAPA)
plan with appropriate timelines,

Page 19 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

•

if the scope of the certificate needs to be adjusted, especially restricted,

•

when the certification was subject to specific conditions or limitations to verify
whether those are still valid or obsolete or need to be changed,

•

or if new conditions need to be imposed.

According to Annex VII Section 4.11, for the decision on re-certification the notified
body shall use the same methods and principles as for the initial certification
decision, meaning a final review and decision shall be made in accordance with
Sections 4.7 and 4.8 of Annex VII.
IV.13.

What is considered “leveraging evidence”?

According to MDCG 2022-14, action item 2, notified bodies should avoid
unnecessary duplication of work when performing their conformity assessment
activities. In this respect, a differentiation between evidence provided by the
manufacturer and assessment of such evidence already performed by notified bodies
needs to be made.
As part of the structured dialogue (see Q&A I.6.3), for (a) specific device(s),
manufacturers and notified bodies should discuss and agree in the pre-application
phase if / which evidence provided with previous applications by the manufacturer
can be referred to. In principle, this is possible as long as the evidence provided still
meets the “state of the art”.
To facilitate such an approach, manufacturers should clearly indicate which parts of a
technical documentation have changed compared to previous ones.
Notified bodies should make (partial) use of the assessments previously performed
on such evidence. This is generally recommended as long as
•

the applicable assessment requirements (including harmonised standards and
common specifications used to prove compliance with the requirements) didn’t
change,

•

the assessments were performed by personnel demonstrably meeting the
qualification requirements of the Regulations,

•

the applicable reporting requirements in Section 4.6 of Annex VII of the
Regulations are met and traceability is ensured.

In these cases, the report should identify what part of the technical documentation
assessment has been performed by leveraging evidence from previous assessments
and ensure traceability.

V.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS

Page 20 of 21

Medical Devices
Medical Device Coordination Group Document
V.1.

MDCG 2019-6-Rev.5

Are activities described under articles 16 and 17 of the
Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) and Article 16 of the In-vitro
Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) will be covered during joint
assessments?

Conformity assessment bodies (CABs) can issue certificates following the process
described in articles 16 and 17 of the MDR and Article 16 of the IVDR but these are
not considered conformity assessment activities covered by Chapter IV and Annex
VII of the Regulations and therefore will not be part of joint assessments.
V.2.

What is the meaning of “publicly available” in regard to
information provided by notified bodies?

Whenever the Regulations require certain information to be made “publicly available”,
that implies that a member of the public can access this information at any point in
time, without the need for additional steps. In view of the public functions carried out
by notified bodies, this requirement supports transparency of their activities.
Article 37 (3) MDR / Art. 33 (3) IVDR as well as Annex VII sections 1.2.5 and 4.2
MDR/IVDR make reference to the term “publicly available” in regard to certain
information the notified body needs to provide. Article 50 MDR / Article 46 IVDR refer
to a list of standard fees notified bodies have to make “publicly available”. It is worth
noting that Article 111 MDR / Article 104 IVDR refer to different type of fees (i.e. fees
levied by Member States) and use different wording. They cannot therefore be used
to support the interpretation of Article 50 MDR / Article 46 IVDR. Moreover, public
availability of fees levied by Member States will usually result from the official
publication of national laws setting out such fees (therefore, there will be no need to
request information on such fees).
To assist notified bodies defining their list of standard fees for publication in
accordance with MDR Article 50 and IVDR Article 46, MDCG has issued the
document MDCG 2023-2 “List of standard fees”.
