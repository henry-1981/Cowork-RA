1. Introduction
In the context of the current COVID-19 global outbreak as well as the rapid spread of
the virus across various regions of the globe, the resulting travel and quarantine
restrictions have significantly affected the ability of notified bodies to conduct
mandatory on-site audits under the medical devices legislation. Therefore, in the
interest of public health, this document has been developed to outline temporary
extraordinary measures for notified bodies to follow in this interim period in order to
allow continued availability of safe medical devices to the market and assist in the
prevention of the risk of medical device shortages. In this context, it is considered
that alternative solutions to carrying out on-site audits by notified bodies under the
medical devices Directives1 should be allowed under specific circumstances,
including the possibility to perform remote audits under certain conditions.
This guidance takes immediate effect and is valid for the whole period of duration of
the pandemic COVID-19 as declared by the World Health Organisation.
2. Scope
This guidance is intended to cover the following audits notified bodies are requested
to carry out as part of medical devices conformity assessments:


surveillance audits under the medical devices Directives,



audits conducted for re-certification purposes under the medical devices
Directives,



in cases where a manufacturer submits a change notification to a notified body
that would typically require on-site audit or verification,



in cases where a manufacturer terminates (voluntarily or involuntarily) its
contract with a notified body and enters into a contract with another notified
body in respect of the conformity assessment of the same device(s).

Although this guidance applies to the medical device Directives only, for Regulations
(EU) 2017/745 (MDR) and 2017/746 (IVDR) in the event that the availability of
devices is affected by COVID-19 restrictions the principles in this guidance may
apply.

The temporary extraordinary measures proposed in this guidance should not apply to
unannounced audits, or, to special audits which require on-site assessment (such as
the verification of implementation of specific corrective actions which can only be
assesed on-site). This does not prevent the use of the alternative measures for these
types of audits in cases where doubt has been raised on the conformity / safety of a
device and it is not in the interest of public safety to wait until the end of the
restrictions put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In general, initial certification audits or audits to extend the scope of certification
under the Directives should not be performed using these temporary extraordinary
measures. However, notified bodies may apply these extraordinary measures on a
case-by-case basis for such audits in cases where devices are considered relevant to
ensure medical care, especially if clinically necessary during the period of COVID-19
restrictions.
3. Proposed
temporary

arrangements to on-site audits

extraordinary

measures

and

Notified bodies may introduce temporary alternative extraordinary measures in place
of on-site conformity assessment audits that have been impacted by COVID-19
restrictions and that are within the scope of section 2 above.
Notified bodies should have documented procedures detailing the alternative
temporary measures to be utilised and should define the criteria for implementing
such measures (e.g. procedure for “force majeure”). The relevant procedures should
also take into account the technologies to be used during such audits and also
address the impact of the alternative measures on the audit duration.
These temporary alternative extraordinary measures may include the following
principles and arrangements:


Postponement of on-site surveillance audits under the Directives in line with
documented procedures of the notified body for force majeure.



On-site audits may be replaced by remote audits using the most advanced
available Information and Communication Technologies as appropriate in
accordance with legislation on information security and data protection.



Assessment of all relevant and required documents/records off-site by the
notified body.



To take into account existing recent results from MDSAP audits (or other
appropriate audits) in lieu of Directive audits, where available



To consider published international guidance such as those issued by the
International Accreditation Forum (IAF) e.g. on how to use information and

communication technologies2 and for alternative auditing methods in
extraordinary circumstances3.
4. Eligibility criteria and procedural aspects
To be eligible for these temporary alternative extraordinary measures the audits must
be covered within the scope of section 2 above.
The possibility to make use of temporary alternative extraordinary measures to onsite audits should be carefully assessed and documented by notified bodies on a
case-by-case basis and performed using a risk-based approach. In particular, when
determining the possibility to use these alternative measures, the risk assessment
should take into account the experience gained with a manufacturer. For example,
manufacturers who have a history of a high number and/or critical non-compliances
related to production/operational control may have an impact on the appropriateness
to conduct such temporary measures. However, in these cases an alternative
measure could be performed as a temporary measure to assess the progress of the
manufacturer and should be be supplemented by an on-site audit once travel
restrictions are lifted.
In order to assess which alternative extraordinary measure (as outlined in section 3
above) is most appropriate, the notified body should review their files relating to the
status and operations of the manufacturer related to the audit in question, for
example the activities conducted at the site to be audited, its quality management
system, and its level of compliance from previous audits. Following this review, a risk
analysis should be made as to whether or not the audit could be performed with
alternative measures. Where a postponement cannot be justified, the notified body
should assess which alternative extraordinary measure should be performed (e.g.
remote audit; off-site document review; conference calls with relevant personnel of
the manufacturer).
For remote audits, both the notified body and the manufacturer must have the
required information and communication technologies or tools available and
established (e.g. web conferences with document sharing, use of web cams for
audits of production lines). Confidentiality of intellectual property aspects shall be
safeguarded. Notified bodies should clearly document and communicate any such
requirements for their audits with their auditees, along with the required
documentation to be shared before and within such audits, including the necessary
data protection and cybersecurity measures. The technological capability of the
manufacturer to ensure that such an audit can be accomplished should be verified by
the notified body in advance of the audit.

integrity of the audit/assessment process may be found in International Accreditation Forum document IAF MD

Auditing/Assessment Purposes).

Designating Authorities may request to observe/witness such remote audits via
information and communication technologies or tools available and established.
When establishing the audit plan, the notified body should adjust the duration for
review of the areas on the audit plan, along with the overall duration of the audit, in
coordination with the manufacturer in order to make effective use of these alternative
extraordinary measures. The audit plan should also clearly indicate which alternative
extraordinary measures will be used and what will be conducted remotely. When
issuing their audit reports the notified body should also clearly indicate that the audit
was conducted remotely and the method(s) used for such audits should also be
specified.
Remote surveillance audits should cover all of the surveillance tasks that can be
verified remotely, including an off-site review of all documents that would normally be
assessed on-site.
Following such an alternative extraordinary measure the notified body should review
and adjust the audit programme for each manufacturer to ensure that all required
elements are assessed during the certification cycle.
5. Decisions taken on certification
Remote audits undertaken for re-certification purposes should cover all of the
mandatory re-certification tasks that can be verified remotely. Subsequent to a
succcessful remote audit a notified body may re-issue the certification with the
condition that such audits should be followed up by an on-site verification audit at the
next available opportunity to verify the elements that could not be assessed remotely
(the timeline for the on-site verification audit should be justified by the notified body).
At the request of the notified body, the manufacturer may provide the notified body
with records (e.g. product release documentation) on an ongoing or regular basis,. If
the re-certification remote audit is unsuccessful, the certification should be
suspended or should expire as appropriate.
Remote audits conducted by the incoming notified body in the context of cases
where a manufacturer terminates its contract with a notified body and enters into a
contract with another notified body in respect of the conformity assessment of the
same device(s), should also cover all of the tasks that can be verified remotely to
allow the incoming notified body to ensure a proper assessment of the conformity of
the device. If the remote audit is unsuccessful (as per the notified body’s procedures
for unsuccessful audits), the incoming notified body should not issue the certification.
In the exceptional circumstance of the issuance of an initial or extended scope
certificate under these alternative extraordinary measures (as per section 2 Scope
above), the notified body should consider the clinical risk / benefit of their decision
and should clearly document their rationale for these decisions. At the request of the
designating authority the notified body should inform the national authority of any
such decisions and provide any supporting documentation.
