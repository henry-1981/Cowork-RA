1. EU legislation on medical devices within the “New Approach” and the
“New Legislative Framework”
The EU legislative framework on medical devices currently consists of two Regulations1,
adopted and entered into force in 2017:
•

Regulation (EU) 2017/745 on medical devices2 (MDR), applicable from 26 May 2021,
replacing the previous Directives 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices3
(AIMDD) and 93/42/EEC on medical devices4 (MDD), through specific transition
provisions, as amended;

•

Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices5 (IVDR), applicable
from 26 May 2022, replacing the previous Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic
medical devices6 (IVDD), through specific transition provisions, as amended.

These legislative acts are part of the EU harmonisation legislation on health, safety and
performance of products in the internal market, based on the principles of the “New Approach”
and the “New Legislative Framework”7 policies. In this kind of legislation, the role of the
harmonised European standards (hENs) is key: actually, for product characteristics, the
content of legislation is limited to establishing essential requirements that products intended to
be placed on the EU market must meet. The technical details and solutions supporting those
essential requirements are laid down in harmonised European standards specifically developed

by designated European standardisation organisations on the basis of specific standardisation
requests (formerly known as “mandates”) issued by the Commission.
The term “harmonised standard” is defined in Articles 2(70) MDR and 2(73) IVDR as “a
European standard as defined in point (1)(c) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012”,
i.e. “a European standard adopted on the basis of a request made by the Commission for the
application of Union harmonisation legislation”. However, Articles 8 MDR and IVDR state
that “References in this Regulation to harmonised standards shall be understood as meaning
harmonised standards the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of
the European Union”. This guidance uses the term “harmonised standard” as defined in
Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 and whenever needed adds the clause “the references of which
is published in the OJEU” (see also point 3.1).
Products designed and manufactured according to applicable harmonised European standards
the references of which are published in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU)
benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant legal requirements. In other
words, the use of hENs cited in the OJEU confers presumption of conformity of the product
with the legal requirements the standard aims to cover. This particular legal status of hENs
cited in the OJEU generally allows manufacturers and the other sectorial actors (including
notified bodies and national competent authorities) to make easier, quicker and less
burdensome the processes related to conformity assessment procedures, affixing of the CE
marking and placing on the market, market surveillance, etc.8. However, as a general principle,
the use of such harmonised standards is voluntary (see point 2.2.).

2. The general framework for harmonised European standards
2.1. Main references
The principles of the “New Approach” and the “New Legislative Framework” concerning
standardisation are implemented through a specific legal and guidance framework for
European standardisation and harmonised European standards in support of EU
harmonisation legislation. The main references are:

2.2. Voluntary use of standards

As for the generality of the EU harmonisation legislation on products in the internal market
based on the principles of the “New Approach” and the “New Legislative Framework” policies,
the use of standards (either harmonised European standards the reference of which is published
in the Official Journal of European Union or any other standard) in the medical devices sector
is and remains voluntary. This is clearly stated in the Standardisation Regulation (EU)
1025/2012 ruling the whole system, starting with the Recitals which explain the background,
and then in the enacting part (Articles) of the act:
•

Recital (1): “The primary objective of standardisation is the definition of voluntary
technical or quality specifications with which current or future products, production
processes or services may comply.”

•

Recital (2): “European standardisation is organised by and for the stakeholders concerned
based on national representation (the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and
the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec)) and direct
participation (the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)), and is
founded on the principles recognised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the field
of standardisation, namely coherence, transparency, openness, consensus, voluntary

application, independence from special interests and efficiency (‘the founding
principles’).”
•

Article 2(1): “‘standard’ means a technical specification, adopted by a recognised
standardisation body, for repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not
compulsory, and which is one of the following: (a) ‘international standard’ means a
standard adopted by an international standardisation body; (b) ‘European standard’
means a standard adopted by a European standardisation organisation; (c) ‘harmonised
standard’ means a European standard adopted on the basis of a request made by the
Commission for the application of Union harmonisation legislation; (d) ‘national
standard’ means a standard adopted by a national standardisation body”.

These provisions are fully applicable also to the EU legislation on medical devices, which
contains direct and indirect references to the voluntary use of standards, both in their recitals
and enacting terms19. At the same time, it is worth noting that for medical devices there are
“exceptions that proves the rule” when standards can be regarded as mandatory: it is the case
for symbols and identification colours that “shall conform to the harmonised standards”20
when harmonised standards the reference of which is published in the OJEU containing
indications on symbols or colour coding are available21.
On the other hand, Article 5(5)(c) IVDR contains a reference to standard EN ISO 1518922
which has a different role. It defines a condition which needs to be met by health institutions
when making use of exceptions, i.e. “the laboratory of the health institution is compliant with
standard EN ISO 15189 or where applicable national provisions, including national provisions
regarding accreditation”. In the absence of national provisions, the health institution needs to
be compliant with this standard to fall under the exception rule; here the standard is related to
the scope and applicability of IVDR requirements under specified conditions, but not to any
presumption of conformity.
In the case of the references to “the international standard ISO 14155:2011 on good clinical
practice for clinical investigations of medical devices for human subjects” included in Recital
64 MDR and to “the international standard ISO 20916 on clinical performance studies using

19

Recitals and Articles 8(1) MDR and IVDR.

20

MDR, Annex I, point 23.1 h); IVDR, Annex I, point 20.1 h).

21

For instance, the harmonised European standards EN ISO 15223-1:2021 Medical devices - Symbols to be
used with medical device labels, labelling and information to be supplied - Part 1: General requirements
(ISO 15223-1:2021), currently cited in the OJEU under the MDR and the IVDR, and EN ISO
5359:2014+A1:2017 Anaesthetic and respiratory equipment - Low-pressure hose assemblies for use with
medical gases, listed in the current standardisation request as existing harmonised standard to be revised
under the MDR.

22

The standard EN ISO 15189:2022 Medical laboratories - Requirements for quality and competence (ISO
15189:2022) with its amendment A11:2023 is currently harmonised and cited in the OJEU under the
horizontal Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on accreditation.

specimens from human subjects” in Recital 66 IVDR, they must be considered as non-binding
examples only.
The voluntary character of the use of standards means in practice that the manufacturer may
always choose to apply the technical solutions provided by harmonised European standards
whether the reference to is cited or not cited in the OJEU, or by non-harmonised European
standards, or by any other international or national standards, or even to develop its own
technical solutions, provided that it is able to demonstrate that these different or alternative
non-harmonised means are adequate to comply with the legal requirements applicable to the
product. Such a demonstration can be given by the manufacturer through a more in-depth risk
assessment, gap analysis, etc., to be reflected in the related technical documents and reports
within the prescribed conformity assessment procedures on the product. Only in case of
harmonised standards the references of which have been published in the OJEU, presumption
of conformity can be claimed for the requirements of the Regulations which are listed as
“covered” in the respective informative Annexes Z of such standards (see point 2.3).
Therefore, also in the medical devices field in the EU, choosing to use a standard or not
belongs to the manufacturer, within its overall and ultimate responsibility on compliance.
With the possible exceptions referred to above, it is not possible to impose the use of any
specific standard, on the basis for instance of its status of harmonised European standard
whether referenced in the OJEU or not, or of “state-of-the-art” standard, neither by national
authorities in their market surveillance or vigilance activities, nor by notified bodies in the
conformity assessment procedures they participate in. However, notified bodies performing
conformity assessment activities must check whether the concerned device complies with the
requirements of the Regulations on medical devices, and in this sense they must “where
relevant, take into consideration available CS, guidance and best practice documents and
harmonised standards, even if the manufacturer does not claim to be in compliance” (Sections
4.5.1 of Annexes VII to the MDR and the IVDR) (see also point 3.5), being necessary to
understand “harmonised standard” when used in the MDR and IVDR as “harmonised standard
the reference of which has been published in the OJEU” (see point 1).
Actually, to be lawfully placed on the EU market, medical devices must comply with the health,
safety and performance requirements of the applicable legislation, and not necessarily with the
clauses of a standard. Conversely, compliance of a device must be assessed against the legal
requirements that apply to it, and this may be made through compliance with the clauses of a
standard (regardless of whether the standard is a harmonised standard cited in the OJEU or
not), but not necessarily, unless the manufacturer would claim compliance with the legal
requirements by using a harmonised European standard cited in the OJEU thus conferring
presumption of conformity.

2.3. The relationship between harmonised European standards and EU legislation:
the “Annex Z”
The relationship between the clauses of a harmonised European standard drafted on the basis
of a Commission’s mandate or a standardisation request in support of specific EU legislation,
and the requirements of such EU legislation that the standard aims to cover, is made explicit in
the foreword of that standard and especially in a separate informative annex, called “Annex
Z”. When a harmonised standard intends to cover more than one EU legislative act, it must
include several Annexes Z (usually designated as “ZA”, “ZB”… “ZZ”), each of them
indicating the relevant legal requirements aimed to be covered by the normative contents of the
standard before any reference of it may be published in the OJEU.
The format of the Annex Z is determined by specific agreements between the Commission and
the European standardisation organisations, to ensure that clear, precise and accurate
information is provided to the users of harmonised European standards the references of which
have been published in the OJEU. It includes one or more tables listing the clauses of the
standards, their correspondence with the legal requirements, and any other indications and
comments necessary for the correct use of the standard (for instance, if some legal requirements
are not covered or partially covered by the standard). In this sense, the role of Annexes Z is
especially important for the purpose of legal clarity and certainty, being the necessary tool
addressed to users of harmonised European standards the references of which have been
published in the OJEU to clearly identify the contents of the standard that are appropriate
to cover the requirements of the EU legislation and to confer the presumption of
conformity with them, when the reference of the standard is cited in the OJEU. Annex Z also
refers to legal requirements not covered or partially covered, allowing the manufacturer to
identify them and to implement additional action in order to comply with these legal
requirements. Without an adequate Annex Z, a harmonised standard lacks the necessary
element of legal clarity and cannot be referenced in the OJEU, therefore its voluntary use
cannot confer any presumption of conformity23.

3. Harmonised European standards in support of the EU legislation on
medical devices
3.1. Legal references, European standardisation organisations and standardisation
mandates or requests
EU legislation on medical devices contains specific provisions on harmonised standards and
the presumption of conformity conferred by its voluntary use when their references are

23

It is important to remind that the requisite of having an Annex Z is not a new one for harmonised standards.
In fact, CEN and CENELEC’s Technical Committees formally decided in 1994 to introduce an informative
Annex Z for harmonised standards, following extensive discussions with the Commission and with the
Member States on how to ensure transparency on the correspondence between the clauses of harmonised
standards and the legislative requirements covered.

published in the OJEU: they can be found in the respective Articles 8(1) of the current
Regulations MDR and IVDR. It is worth noting that these Regulations define the term
“harmonised standard” making reference to point (1)(c) of Article 2 of the Standardisation
Regulation (EU) 1025/2012, as “a European standard adopted on the basis of a request made
by the Commission for the application of Union harmonisation legislation”, while at the same
time, the abovementioned Articles 8(1) specify that “References in this Regulation to
harmonised standards shall be understood as meaning harmonised standards the references of
which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union”, thus including the
direct link to the presumption of conformity conferred by harmonised European standards cited
in the OJEU. For the sake of clarity, this guidance uses these terms as Regulation (EU) No
1025/2012 (see point 1).
Harmonised European standards in the field of healthcare engineering, including medical
devices, are developed by the two relevant European standardisation organisations (ESOs): the
European Committee for Standardization (CEN) for most of the types of medical devices,
and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC)24
especially for medical electrical equipment.
According to Article 10 of the Standardisation Regulation (EU) 1025/2012, the Commission
may request one or several European standardisation organisations to draft European standards
or European standardisation deliverables according to specific requirements. This is the
necessary legal basis for the development of harmonised European standards in support of the
requirements of EU legislation, and to allow the publication in the OJEU of references to such
standards to confer presumption of conformity. The essential legal relationship between
harmonised European standards the references of which have been published in the OJEU and
the standardisation requests (mandates) on which they are based has been confirmed by the
jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union25.
For the previous Directives AIMDD, MDD and IVDD, such requests had the format of
standardisation mandates, as letters addressed by the Commission to CEN and CENELEC.
Several mandates have been issued between 1989 and 2010, some of them covering the whole
scope of the Directives, and some others specific aspects only. The validity of those old
standardisation mandates expired in parallel to the Directives themselves, as explicitly
indicated in the standardisation request in support of the Regulations (see below).
For the current Regulations MDR and IVDR, a standardisation request has the improved
format of a Commission Implementing Decision (pursuant to the entry into force of the
Standardisation Regulation), structured in recitals (reasons, objectives and contents of the act),
articles (requested activities, requirements and timelines) and annexes (lists of existing
standards to be revised and of new standards to be developed under the MDR and the IVDR,

and specific requirements). Before adopting the standardisation request, the Commission must
seek the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 22 of the Standardisation Regulation (EU)
1025/2012.
Once adopted in the three working languages of European standardisation (English, French and
German), a “Commission Implementing Decision on a standardisation request to the European
Committee for Standardization and the European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization as regards medical devices in support of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the
European Parliament and of the Council and in vitro diagnostic medical devices in support of
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council” is published in the
Commission’s database on standardisation requests26 and addressed to CEN and CENELEC.
When accepted, it becomes applicable for the development of harmonised European standards
in the field of medical devices and, later on, for the publication in the OJEU of their references
to confer presumption of conformity with the legal requirements the standards aim to cover.
Specifically, the MDR/IVDR standardisation request was adopted by the Commission on 14
April 2021 (labelled as M/57527) and, after having been accepted by CEN and CENELEC,
became applicable in May 2021. It is intended to be regularly revised and updated when
deemed necessary, in particular with respect to the lists of standards in the Annexes, to ensure
its continuous adaptation to the evolution of the standardisation work at European and
international level, as well as innovation in the field of medical devices. To date, a first
amendment to the MDR/IVDR standardisation request, to add and to remove some items in its
Annexes I and II, was adopted by the Commission on 31 January 2023 (labelled as M/575 Amd
128) and accepted by CEN and CENELEC on 28 February 2023. A second amendment, to
extend the validity of the MDR/IVDR standardisation request and the deadlines for the
adoption of certain standards, as well as to add and remove some items in Annexes I and II and
to clarify some requirements in Annex III, was adopted by the Commission on 27 May 2024
(labelled as M/575 Amd 229) and accepted by CEN and CENELEC on 25 June 2024.

3.2. Development of harmonised European standards for medical devices and
assessment by the HAS consultants
On the basis of the relevant MDR/IVDR standardisation request, CEN and CENELEC
develop harmonised European standards in the field of medical devices through their
specific Technical Committees (TCs). The process includes several phases, following the
internal rules of the European standardisation organisations, aimed to ensure the highest quality
of the standards produced, with the adequate participation of national and international experts,
stakeholders and interested parties30.
During the standardisation process, specific assessment of the draft harmonised standards
under development is carried out by the “Harmonised Standards (HAS) consultants”, as
technical experts supporting the Commission services, to ensure the compliance of the draft
harmonised standards with the relevant EU legislative framework and with the relevant
MDR/IVDR standardisation request. This assessment of draft harmonised standards is an
obligation that the Commission, together with the European Standardisation organisations, has
pursuant to Article 10(5) of the Standardisation Regulation, and the HAS consultants
complement the Commission’s expertise and resources needed for this task. Their activities are
based on the rules on European standardisation and on specific procedures, guidance
documents and templates, to carry out the necessary technical and legal assessments and to
provide reports to the Commission at three specific phases of the standardisation development
process (the so-called milestones: First Committee Draft, Enquiry and Formal Vote). As such,
the HAS consultants work under the instructions of the Commission, managed by an
independent contractor, and must keep their full independence from the European
standardisation organisations and their TCs. The smooth management, coordination and follow
up of such activities include periodical initiatives by the Commission for exchange of
information and feedback at horizontal and vertical level (training sessions, webinars,
alignment and sectorial meetings, etc.) to guarantee a common approach and the effectiveness
of the work.
In the field of “Healthcare Engineering”, there are currently up to seven HAS consultants for
harmonised standards in support of the EU legislation on medical devices, administratively
managed by an external entity according to a specific contract stipulated with the Commission
for a number of sectors31.

3.3. Publication in the OJEU of references to harmonised European standards to
confer presumption of conformity
Once CEN and CENELEC complete their standardisation work by publishing new or revised
harmonised European standards in the field of medical devices, they propose to the
Commission the publication of the references of such standards in the OJEU, to make them
conferring the presumption of conformity with the legal requirements the standards aim to
cover. The Commission carry out the final assessment on compliance of these proposed
standards with the requirements of the legislation as well as of the relevant MDR/IVDR
standardisation request, taking into account the assessment reports by the HAS consultants
(which are however not binding on the Commission), as well as additional information and
clarification that may be provided by CEN and CENELEC and their relevant Technical
Committees when necessary, to decide to publish, not to publish or publish with restrictions
the references in the OJEU. In case of not publication or publication with restrictions, the
Commission inform the European standardisation organisations accordingly.
Since December 2018, the publications in the OJEU of lists of references to harmonised
European standards in support of legislation on medical devices must have the format of
Commission Implementing Decisions32 in the “L” series. These acts with an improved and
more robust legal format replace the previous publications as Commission Communications in
the “C” series and are structured in recitals, articles and annexes that contain the lists of
references: those to standards conferring presumption of conformity (both already published
and those published for the first time, usually presented as a consolidate list) and those to
standards withdrawn for being superseded by new standards, or for becoming obsolete.
The change of publication system was announced by the Commission in its Communication
on harmonised standards of 22.11.201833 and is a logical consequence of the jurisprudence of
the Court of Justice of the European Union34.
3.4. International aspects of standardisation
In the medical devices sector, most of the European standards are developed by CEN and
CENELEC in parallel to international standardisation developed by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO)35 and the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC)36, on the basis of the Vienna Agreement (1991) and the Dresden

Agreement (1996) reconfirmed by the Frankfurt Agreement (2016) respectively37. Within such
agreements, the normative texts of the respective standards are substantially the same, while
harmonised European standards the references of which are intended to be published in the
OJEU must also contain a “European foreword” and the Annex(es) Z necessary to link the
clauses of the standard with the requirements of the EU legislation(s) the standard aims to
cover. This is especially important to clearly identify in each standard which clauses are
suitable to confer presumption of conformity with the legal requirements and those not, in view
of the publication in the OJEU of the reference of that standard. It is the responsibility of CEN
and CENELEC to prepare and add the European foreword and the Annex(es) Z to the ISO/IEC
standards when they adopt them as EN ISO or EN IEC standards intended to be harmonised in
support of EU legislation on medical devices.
Some useful guidance on the development of standards in support of legislation can be taken
from the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF)38. The IMDRF is a
voluntary group of medical device regulators from around the world to promote international
and regional regulatory harmonisation, convergence and recognition in the field of medical
devices, by providing guidance on strategies, polices and operational directions. Its
management committee is currently integrated by Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, European
Union, Japan, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom and United States of America;
the European Commission held the Chair and Secretariat in 202339.
Especially, the specific IMDRF Standards Working Group developed different initiatives and
documents, such as “IMDRF recognised standards”40, “Standards Improving the quality of
international medical device standards for regulatory use”41, “Optimizing standards for
regulatory use”42 and “GHTF/SG1/N044:2008 Role of Standards in the Assessment of Medical
Devices”43 of the Global Harmonisation Task Force (GHTF). These documents provide useful
indications for the development of international standards in the field of medical devices and
their recognition and implementation at regional and national level, which is especially
important for harmonised European standards the references of which are intended to be
published in the OJEU in support of MDR and IVDR.

3.5. The concept of “state of the art”, European standardisation and conformity
assessment for medical devices
As in other sectors based on the principles of the “New Approach” and the “New Legislative
Framework”44 policies, the EU legislation on medical devices contains a number of references
to the need to “take into account the generally acknowledged state of the art”45 to comply
with the health, safety and performance requirements. However, it is important to underline
that “taking into account” is different from “compliance”, due to the fact that “state of the art”
is not a legally defined concept and it involves several dynamic and complex aspects, difficult
to be expressed in a single and clear definition. Actually, there are different sources providing
references, definitions and practical examples on the “state of the art”, all of them nonlegally binding but still useful to consider. It is the case of horizontal and vertical guidance
documents, agreements of working parties, European and international standards, sectorial
papers etc., as the following ones, among others:
•

“The concept of essential requirements is based on the assumption that the harmonised
standards reflect generally acknowledgeable state of the art and the ESO review standards
regularly in accordance with the relevant standardisation request” (“The ‘Blue Guide’ on
the implementation of EU product rules 2022”46, section 4.1.2.4., p. 53).

•

“The most recent editions of standards published by the standardisers should be considered
as reflecting state-of-the-art, regardless of the OJ referencing” (COM statement, Minutes
of the meeting of the MDCG Subgroup on Standards held on 20 May 201947, item 3, p. 1).

•

“The current knowledge/ state of the art in the corresponding medical field, such as
applicable standards and guidance documents, information relating to the medical
condition managed with the device and its natural course, benchmark devices, other
devices and medical alternatives available to the target population” (MEDDEV 2.7/1
revision 4 - Clinical evaluation: a guide for manufacturers and notified bodies under
Directives 93/42/EEC and 90/385/EEC48, section 7., p. 16).

44

Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the
requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing
Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 30), and Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products, and

“‘State of the art’: IMDRF/GRRP WG/N47 provides the following definition: Developed

products, processes and patient management, based on the relevant consolidated findings
of science, technology and experience. Note: The state-of-the-art embodies what is

The stateof-the-art described here is sometimes referred to as the ‘generally acknowledged state-ofthe-art’” (MDCG 2020-6 - Regulation (EU) 2017/745: Clinical evidence needed for
medical devices previously CE marked under Directives 93/42/EEC or 90/385/EEC. A
guide for manufacturers and notified bodies50, section 1.2., pp. 5-6).

“State of the art: developed stage of technical capability at a given time as regards
products, processes and services, based on the relevant consolidated findings of science,
technology and experience. Note: The state of the art embodies what is currently and
generally accepted as good practice in technology and medicine. The state of the art does
not necessarily imply the most technologically advanced solution. The state of the art

In order to have a clear reference especially with respect to the practical implementation of the
concept, it is commonly considered that the most recent versions of standards with the
technical solutions they contain reflect the “state of the art”. However, the mere
compliance with the most recent version of a standard the reference of which has not been
published in the OJEU does not automatically imply compliance with the requirements
of the applicable EU legislation, if no further evidences are provided in the technical

documentation of the product. Actually, “state-of-the-art” standards as such do not confer any
presumption of conformity if their references are not cited in the OJEU, as harmonised
European standards developed by the ESOs on the basis of a standardisation mandate or request
issued by the Commission.
Therefore, recalling that in the EU harmonisation legislation for health and safety of products
in the internal market – including also medical devices legislation – the use of standards is and
remains voluntary (with the exceptions referred to in point 2.2. above), it is not possible to
impose the use of a specific standard in the conformity assessment of a product, not even
on the basis of “compliance with the state of the art”: the “state of the art” expressed by
standards must be taken into account but it does not mean “compliance” that must be granted
with respect to the legal requirements and not to standards. In particular, for conformity
assessment procedures requiring its intervention, the notified body must check whether the
concerned device complies with the requirements of the Regulations on medical devices, and
in this sense it must “take into consideration available CS, guidance and best practice
documents and harmonised standards, even if the manufacturer does not claim to be in
compliance” (Sections 4.5.1 of Annexes VII to the MDR and the IVDR). However, “taking
into consideration” is different from making any standard “mandatory”: choosing to use a
standard or not, as appropriate and applicable, belongs to the manufacturer, within its overall
and ultimate responsibility on the legal compliance of products intended to be placed on the
EU market.
3.6. The rulings of the Court of Justice of the European Union on standardisation
The Court of Justice of the European Union52 (European Court of Justice, ECJ) ruled on a
number of cases related to specific aspects of European standardisation, with important
consequences in the operation of the whole system, including for the medical devices sector.
The “James Elliott” case
On 27 October 2016, the ECJ pronounced a ground-breaking judgment with regard to
standardisation, in the “James Elliott” case53. With this judgment, the Court clarified the role
and the legal quality of voluntary harmonised European standards adopted on the basis of
standardisation requests issued by the European Commission to support Union harmonisation
legislation. Notably,
(i)

a harmonised European standard the reference of which is published in the OJEU forms
part of the EU law;

(ii) the citation of harmonised European standards, as defined in Article 2(1)(c) of Regulation
(EU) No 1025/2012, in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), has a legal

effect and, as a consequence, is subject to the Court’s jurisdiction under Article 267
TFEU;
(iii) the development of standards is entrusted to organisations governed by private law;
(iv) the Commission has specific obligations and responsibilities to pursue the development
process of harmonised European standards supporting European harmonisation legislation
thoroughly, in particular while assessing them with regard to their compliance with the
requirements set out in their respective legal acts and related standardisation requests, and
the publication of their references in the OJEU.
Following the “James Elliot” case, the Commission adapted its internal procedures to improve
legal certainty and transparency on harmonised European standards, and, as of December 2018,
the Commission publishes their references as implementing acts in the “L series” (Legislation)
of the OJEU, instead of communications in the “C series” (Information and Notices)54.
The “Global Garden Products” case
In a judgment of 26 January 2017 on the “Global Garden Products” case55, the General Court
ruled, among others, that as long as the publication of a reference of a harmonised standard
according to the old Directive 98/37/EC on machinery has not been explicitly repealed, the
manufacturer of machinery conforming to this standard may continue to benefit from a
presumption of conformity with the relevant essential health and safety requirements of Article
7 of the new Directive 2006/42/EC on machinery covered by this harmonised standard. This
applies even if a new standard replaces the original harmonised standard.
Following the “Global Garden Products” case, the Commission systematically inserts, in the
acts publishing in the OJEU references of harmonised standards in support of new EU
legislation replacing old EU legislation, specific provisions on repeal of standards harmonised
under that previous EU legislation.
The “Anstar Oy” case
In a judgement of 14 December 2017 on the “Anstar Oy” case56, the General Court ruled,
among others, that (i) the scope of a harmonised standard cannot be interpreted more broadly
than that of the mandate [standardisation request] on which it is based; and (ii) if a harmonised
standard does not indicate expressly that it is intended to replace another harmonised standard
or one or more European technical assessments, those harmonised technical specifications
remain in force and constitute special derogating rules.

The “Public Resource/Right to Know” case
On 14 July 2021, in its judgement on the “Public Resource/Right to Know case”57, the General
Court confirmed the legal standing of harmonised European standards the references of which
have been published in the OJEU as “part of the EU law” as recognised by the “James Elliott”
judgement, but clarified that such harmonised European standards are not EU legislation as
such. With respect to availability of such harmonised European standards and specific aspects
of the copyright on them, the European standardisation organisations (ESOs) are private, nonprofit making organisations; it has not been established that there cannot be copyright on
standards. Accordingly, at the time being, the ESOs can continue to claim a fee, i.e. selling
those standards.
However, on 5 March 2024, the Court of Justice, in the appeal case58, set aside the previous
judgement and considered that “the European harmonised technical standards on the safety of
toys should be accessible to EU citizens”, annulling the Commission’s decision refusing access
to those standards.
The ” Stichting Rookpreventie Jeugd” case
On 22 February 2022, on the “Stichting Rookpreventie Jeugd” case59, the ECJ concluded that
a provision in EU law making an ISO standard mandatory without publication of that standard
in the OJEU, does not infringe EU primary law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights,
nor the principle of legal certainty. In summary, the Court ruled with regard to the use of
mandatory standards in EU legislation the following:
-

the European legislator, while adopting legal acts, has wide margin of manoeuvre in the
choice on the means to define the content of these acts which, however, must be precisely
defined and understandable. Within this margin of manoeuvre, the European legislator is
entitled to make use of mandatory standards within a legal act;

-

an act of the Union cannot be enforced against individuals in a Member State before they
have the opportunity to make themselves acquainted with it by its publication in the OJEU.
In the absence of publication of a mandatory standard, the general public is not able to
know its contents applicable to certain products;

-

however, provided that companies have access to the official and authentic text of the
standard made mandatory in the Union act, via the system established by ISO and its
members whereby access to standards is ensured through the ISO national members, i.e.

the respective national standardisation organisations, those ISO standards can be enforced
against such companies.
The “Orona” case
On 13 September 2023, on the “Orona” case60, the Court confirmed that a manufacturer is
allowed to choose equivalent alternative solutions to those prescribed by harmonised standards
the references of which are published in the OJEU. Actually, if only the implementation of
safety measures identical to those provided for by such harmonised standards is considered to
ensure compliance with the essential requirements laid down by EU legislation, this would
have the consequence of preventing all alternative measures, however effective and safe as
they are, and would hinder any technical innovation which is not in strict compliance with such
harmonised standards. Furthermore, such harmonised standards represent the “state of the art”
but are not necessarily to be taken into account unequivocally as “state of the art”, as it would
depend on their contents and clarity with regard to compliance with the essential requirements.
3.7. European Pharmacopoeia
The provisions on “Use of harmonised standards” laid down in Articles 8 MDR / IVDR
mention, in paragraph 2, “the monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia adopted in
accordance with the Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia, in
particular on surgical sutures and on interaction between medicinal products and materials
used in devices containing such medicinal products”, as included in the references in the
Regulations to harmonised standards, “provided that references to those monographs have
been published in the Official Journal of the European Union”. These provisions are similar to
those in the previous AIMDD and MDD.
The monographs of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.)61 are produced by the European
Pharmacopoeia Commission of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &
HealthCare of the Council of Europe (which is not an institution of the European Union), on
the basis of the “Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia”. They are
intended to provide official quality standards for medicines and their ingredients in Europe, as
a scientific basis for the quality control of a product throughout its life cycle, supporting the
pharmaceutical industry and healthcare systems. Ph. Eur. standards are not standards as defined
in the EU legislation, however they may assume a legal value in conferring presumption of
conformity in a similar way as for harmonised standards when their references are published
in the OJEU.

In December 1997 the Commission published in the OJEU a list of references to these
monographs under the MDD62. This publication concerned four monographs on sterile catgut,
sterile non-absorbable sutures, sterile synthetic absorbable monofilament sutures and sterile
synthetic absorbable braided sutures.
No similar publications took place under the current Regulations so far.
3.8. Common specifications
The Regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices contain different
references to “common specifications”, defined as “a set of technical and/or clinical
requirements, other than a standard, that provides a means of complying with the legal
obligations applicable to a device, process or system” (Article 2(71) MDR, Article 2(74)
IVDR). In some cases, the adoption by the Commission via implementing acts of common
specifications with specific characteristics and requirements is a legal mandate: it is the case of
common specifications for the groups of products without an intended medical purpose listed
in Annex XVI MDR (Article 1(2) MDR), and of reprocessing of single-use devices (Article
17(3)(b) and (5) MDR). However, according to Articles 9 MDR / IVDR, common
specifications may be also adopted by the Commission “where no harmonised standards exist
or where relevant harmonised standards are not sufficient, or where there is a need to address
public health concerns, […] in respect of the general safety and performance requirements set
out in Annex I, the technical documentation set out in Annexes II and III, […]”.
The possibility for the Commission to adopt common (technical) specifications replacing
harmonised standards the references of which are published in the OJEU is provided in
different pieces of EU legislation63, as a safety net – the so-called “fallback option” – in very
specific cases where there can be the need to compensate for the non-availability of harmonised
standards, under certain conditions. While this option was never used so far by the Commission
under the regimes where it is empowered to do so, it has been introduced in the medical devices
area by way of exception to the general principles first under Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro
diagnostic medical devices (IVDD)64. There, the concept “that manufacturers shall as a general
rule be required to comply with the common technical specifications” has been established 65.
Only “for duly justified reasons” when “manufacturers do not comply with those specifications
they must adopt solutions of a level at least equivalent thereto”.

In addition to the Regulations on medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices, it is the case of
Regulation (EU) 2019/1009 on fertilising products, Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the
websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 on machinery,
Regulation (EU) 2023/1542 concerning batteries and waste batteries, the Artificial Intelligence act, and
others.

In the development of the IVDR this concept has been kept and also included in the MDR.
Where the common specifications under the IVDR66 are mainly a continuation of the common
technical specifications for high-risk in vitro diagnostics under the IVDD67, common
specifications under the MDR cover also other specific needs, in particular for Annex XVI
products and for reprocessing of single-use devices, according to the relevant legal mandates.
In addition, it is always possible to identify other cases where the need for common
specifications may arise in the medical devices sector, according to the specific characteristics
of the concerned devices and/or processes, also on the basis of the inputs from Member States
and stakeholders.

4. Governance structure for standards in the medical devices sector
4.1. The MDCG Subgroup on Standards (Working Group 2)
Within the governance structure of the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG)
established by Article 103 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and its 13 specific Subgroups, the
MDCG Subgroup on Standards (Working Group 2) is devoted to standardisation issues. It
aims to provide technical expertise for the positions of the MDCG and opinions of the
Committee on Standards related to the sector, including standardisation requests, publication
of references in the Official Journal of the European Union, formal objections to harmonised
standards, and so on.
The MDCG Subgroup on Standards is chaired by the Commission and integrated by the
national competent authorities of the EU Member States (as members) and of other countries
where the EU legislation is applicable, as well as by stakeholders’ organisations fulfilling
certain criteria (as observers) after selection via public calls for applications. The list of
members and observers, the key documents for its operation (Rules of Procedure, Terms of
Reference, calls for applications) and the documents related to its meetings and other activities
(Agendas, Minutes, others) are publicly available in the specific space of the “Medical Device
Coordination Group (X03565)” in the “Register of Commission expert groups and other
similar entities”68.
The activities of the MDCG Subgroup on Standards are supported by two CIRCABC interest
groups, for circulation of information and exchange of documents: the “MDCG - Standards

(Stks)”70 for stakeholders’ organisations as observers.
4.2. The CEN-CENELEC - Sector Forum on Healthcare Standards (SFHS)
The Sector Forum on Healthcare Standards (SFHS)71, former Advisory Board on
Healthcare Standards (ABHS), is the CEN and CENELEC sector forum for medical devices,
established in 2005 to bring together European stakeholders interested in or impacted by
standardisation in the healthcare field. It is integrated by experts in medical devices
standardisation, mainly from national standardisation organisations, Technical Committees,
European federations and societal stakeholders; the European Commission participates as
observer. The SFHS usually meets once or twice per year, to present and discuss relevant issues
related to standardisation in support of EU legislation on medical devices, cooperation with the
European Commission and with the international standardisation organisations, agreements on
common positions and guidance documents or “white papers”, etc.
