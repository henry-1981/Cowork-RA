Foreword 
These guidance notes do not aim to be a definitive interpretation of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 on medical devices (MDR) and are intended for 
guidance purposes only.  
 
Introduction 
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to manufacturers of Class I medical devices (other 
than custom made devices) who place on the Union market medical devices (from now on referred to as 
devices) under their name or trade mark, to help them meet the provisions of the MDR.  This guidance 
should also be applicable for situations when an importer, distributor or any other legal person assumes 
the obligations incumbent on manufacturers, as per Article 16 (1), while not covering the exception 
indicated by Article 16 (2). 
The MDR has changed the scope of the medical device legislation and it now extends its application to 
all economic operators in the supply chain (manufacturer, authorised representative, importer and 
distributor) as well as a broadened range of products such as those specifically intended for the cleaning, 
disinfection or sterilization of devices (Article 2 (1)) and products without an intended medical purpose 
(such as certain aesthetic products, as indicated in Annex XVI of the MDR). In addition, more emphasis 
is placed on a life-cycle approach to safety, backed up by clinical data and new requirements such as 
transparency and traceability1. 
Before placing a device on the market, the manufacturer will affix the CE mark in accordance with 
Annex V and draw up the EU declaration of conformity, including all the information required by 
Annex IV. Prior to that, the manufacturer will demonstrate conformity with the MDR and compliance 
with the applicable general safety and performance requirements laid out in Annex I. 
In order to accomplish the abovementioned tasks, the manufacturer will carry out the following:   
 
Put in place a quality management system and a system for risk management according to Article 
10(2) and 10(9). 
 
Conduct a clinical evaluation in accordance with Article 61, as established in Article 10(3) and 
Annex XV.   
 
Conduct a conformity assessment according to Article 52(7). In specific cases (sterile devices, 
devices with measuring function, reusable surgical instruments) defined in the referred Article, 
the manufacturer will request the involvement of a Notified Body (NB).    
 
Draw up and keep up-to-date technical documentation related to devices as set out in Annexes II 
and III, in accordance with Article 10(4). 
 
Draw up an EU declaration of conformity in accordance with Article 19. 
 
Submit the required information to the electronic system for registration of economic operators 
(Eudamed) and comply with the registration obligation. The manufacturer will use the Single 
Registration Number (SRN) when applying to a NB for conformity assessment, if applicable and 
for further accessing Eudamed2 in order to fulfil its obligations related to registration of the 
devices. 
 
Register the device in Eudamed assigning the Basic UDI-DI to the device, as defined in Part C of 
Annex VI, and provide this to the UDI database together with the other core data elements 
referred in Part B of Annex VI related to that device.  
 
Assign to the device and, if applicable, to all higher levels of packaging, a UDI which will allow 
identification and traceability.

 
Ensure that the device is accompanied by the information needed to identify it and its 
manufacturer, and any safety and performance information relevant to the user, or any other 
person, as appropriate (Article 10(11)). This information, set out according to Section 23 of 
Annex I, must be provided in an official Union language(s) determined by the Member State in 
which the device is made available to the user or patient. The particulars on the label will be 
indelible, easily legible and clearly comprehensible to the intended user or patient.   
 
Implement a post-market surveillance system in accordance with Article 83 (Article 10(10)) 
proportional to the risk class and appropriate for the type of device, this includes additional 
aspects to be taken into account in case of devices placed on the market in sterile condition, with 
a measuring function or that are reusable surgical instruments. This system will be an integral 
part of the manufacturer's quality management system based on a post-market surveillance plan 
(Article 84), which will be part of the technical documentation specified in Annex III. 
 
Implement a system for recording and reporting incidents and field safety corrective actions as 
described in Articles 87 and 88 (Article 10(13)). 
 
Put measures in place to provide sufficient financial coverage in respect of their potential liability 
under Directive 85/374/EEC3, without prejudice to more protective measures under national law. 
These measures will be proportional to the risk class, type of device and the size of the enterprise 
(Article 10(16)). 
Further detail on the aforementioned list of obligations is provided in the chapter “Placing Class I 
medical devices on the market ”.  
For devices placed on the market in a sterile condition, with a measuring function or which are reusable 
surgical instruments, the manufacturer will apply the procedures set out in Chapters I and III of Annex 
IX, or in Part A of Annex XI which require a NB assessment, limited to critical aspects such as those 
concerning sterile condition, metrological requirements and the reuse of the device, as relevant, 
according with Article 52 (7 a, b and c).

without NB involvement.  
For big and medium size enterprises, the manufacturer will have available within their organization at 
least one person responsible for regulatory compliance4, as established by Article 15. Micro and small 
enterprises5 are required to have such person permanently and continuously at their disposal.  
A manufacturer with a registered place of business outside the Union will designate a sole authorised 
representative, at least per each generic device group, according to a written mandate. Such a mandate 
will establish the tasks to be performed by the authorised representative. To enable the fulfilment of 
these tasks, the manufacturer ensures that the authorised representative has the necessary documentation 
permanently available and up-to date. The mandate will require the authorised representative to perform 
at least the tasks described in Article 11(3), however the manufacturer cannot delegate its obligations 
laid down in Article 10(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (9), (10), (11) and (12). In case of the change of 
authorised representative, Article 12 establishes the minimum content of agreement to be addressed 
between the manufacturer, where practicable the outgoing authorised representative, and the incoming 
authorised representative.  
Upon request, the manufacturer will provide all the information and documentation necessary to 
demonstrate conformity of the device to competent authorities and cooperate with them on any 
corrective action. If the manufacturer does not cooperate or does not provide the requested information 
or documentation, the competent authority (CA) can adopt restrictive measures. 
The manufacturer should periodically verify whether implementing and delegated acts, common 
specifications, technical standards and guidelines might be available on the European Commission 
website6. Such documents might for example cover specific parts of legislation (e.g. classification of

medical devices, clinical evaluation) or specific requirements regarding certain medical device 
technologies (e.g. software, 3D printing) that can also be applicable for Class I devices. 
During the transitional period, manufacturers might be tempted to refer to guidance documents 
developed under the Directive 93/42/EC. However, the old guidance documents, unless otherwise 
updated in line with the MDR, may have only some limited indicative value under the MDR. For the 
purpose of the MDR, only the text of the Regulation is valid in law and sets out requirements not 
reflected in the old guidance. Hence, the MDR alone can be relied upon as a legal basis. 
Definitions

Placing Class I medical devices on the market: 
The necessary steps 
Manufacturers that intend to place Class I medical devices on the market must guarantee compliance 
with all the requirements below. Please note that some of the described requirements are inter-dependent 
and can be performed in a different order than the one presented. 
For Class I devices already placed on the market in accordance with the MDD, the manufacturer will 
conduct a gap analysis in order to guarantee that all the necessary requirements outlined below are fully 
completed at the date of the application of MDR. 
0) Integrate MDR in the Quality Management System (QMS). 
The applicable provisions of the MDR will be integrated into the QMS of the manufacturer. This will 
allow the correct assessment/decision to be made and the proper documented evidence to be created, 
ensuring compliance with the following requirements. 
1) Confirm product as a medical device 
Confirm that the product qualifies as a medical device as defined in Article 2(1) in accordance with its 
intended purpose and principal mode of action. If the manufacturer assigns several different intended 
purposes to their product, not all of which fall under the scope of the MDR, such a product qualifies as a 
medical device only with respect to those intended medical purposes which are covered by Article 2(1). 
This is applicable, for instance, for the case of examination gloves that are intended by the manufacturer 
to be used to protect the patient (medical purpose - MD) and also to protect the healthcare professional 
(protection purpose– PPE9). In that case the relevant requirements of both legislations will be applicable.  
In the case of accessories to medical devices, despite not being medical devices per se, they are covered 
by MDR provisions and fall under the term “device” in the meaning of the MDR. However, accessories 
to devices covered by the MDR by virtue of its Annex XVI are not covered by the MDR. 
For borderline products where such a determination could be difficult, please consult primarily the 
information10 available on the European Commission website. Your CA may be able to provide 
guidance on where to find published information and regulatory requirements. 
2) Confirm product as a Class I medical device 
Consult Annex VIII of the MDR to confirm that the product is correctly classified as Class I. It should be 
noted that some Class I devices according to MDD will be reclassified under the MDR considering the 
new classification rules of that annex, this is the case for most software (rule 11) and devices that are 
composed of substances or of combination of substances (rule 21). 
For devices that were reclassified from Class I to higher risk classes by application of the MDR, the 
present guideline cannot be applied.   
The application of the classification rules will be governed by the intended purpose of the device and

their inherent risks linked to the duration of use, part of the body, whether it is active or not, whether it is 
invasive or non-invasive. 
If more than one rule according to Annex VIII applies to the intended purposes of the device, the highest 
classification applies to the device, i.e. it must be classified on the basis of the most critical specified 
use. 
For classification issues, please primarily consult the information11 available on the European 
Commission website. Your CA may be able to provide guidance on where to find published information 
and regulatory requirements.  
3) Procedures before placing on the market 
a) Meet the general safety and performance requirements 
The devices will meet the general safety and performance requirements set out in Annex I of the MDR 
which apply to them, taking into account the purposes intended by their manufacturers.  
Particular attention will be given to devices that are also machinery, within the meaning of Article 2(2), 
point (a), Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC12, where the relevant requirements of that directive will also 
be covered given their specificity (according to Article 1(12)). 
The manufacturer will establish and implement a risk management system, which will allow for the 
identification and analysis of the hazards associated with each device, estimation and evaluation of the 
associated risks, elimination or control of residual risks and evaluation of the adopted measures based on 
the information collected from the post-market surveillance system. 
The risk management will be understood as a continuous iterative process throughout the entire lifecycle 
of a device, requiring regular systematic updating. To carry out this process the manufacturer can find 
solutions in common specifications, or in harmonised standards, published in the Official Journal of the 
European Union, or in other referential materials. Where a harmonised standard exists but the 
manufacturer is following other referential, the application of that referential should guarantee at least 
the same level of safety and performance. Conformity with the relevant harmonized standards will 
provide presumption of conformity with the requirements of the MDR covered by those standards or 
parts thereof.  Where common specifications are available the manufacturer is obliged to follow them 
unless they can duly justify that they have adopted a solution at least with the same level of safety and 
performance. 
The risk management, clinical evaluation processes and PMS will be inter-dependent and will be 
periodically updated. 
b) Conduct clinical evaluation 
All devices, regardless of risk classification, require a clinical evaluation as part of the technical 
documentation requirements of the MDR13. 
The manufacturer will specify and justify the level of clinical evidence necessary to demonstrate

conformity with the relevant general safety and performance requirements described in Annex I. That 
level of clinical evidence will be appropriate in view of the characteristics of the device and its intended 
purpose. In order to do that, manufacturers will plan, conduct and document a clinical evaluation in 
accordance with Article 61 and Part A of Annex XIV.  
Guidance on the process of conducting clinical evaluation is also available on the Commission website.14  
Conformity to Annex I requirements can only be assumed when the following items are aligned with each 
other: 
 
Risk management; 
 
The information materials supplied by the manufacturer, including: 
o labelling,  
o instructions for use (where required),   
o available promotional materials,  
o any accompanying documents foreseen by the manufacturer; 
 
The clinical evaluation (the device description used for the clinical evaluation, other contents of the 
clinical evaluation report); 
 
The available clinical data (such as results of clinical investigations, publications, Post Market 
Surveillance studies, clinical registries, etc.). 
The MDR reinforces the need to consider the following aspects when carrying out a clinical evaluation: 
• 
Consideration of available alternative treatment options is required as part of clinical 
evaluation for the MDR15. Whilst the existence of better alternative treatment options does not 
influence the compliance of the device with the MDR, the manufacturer needs to be able to 
justify the clinical benefit of using their device if alternatives are available.  
• 
The incorporation of clinical data obtained throughout the life cycle of the device from the 
manufacturers post-market clinical follow-up plan and post-market surveillance plan to update 
the clinical evaluation and documentation16. 
• 
The acceptability of the benefit-risk ratio must be based upon sufficient clinical data and  
will be continuously monitored and reassessed from clinical data collected through the post-
market surveillance phase. The post-market surveillance plan should incorporate suitable 
indicators and threshold values to be used in this reassessment 17. 
If available clinical data are not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the MDR, further clinical 
data will be obtained or generated by clinical investigations.  
For devices which are currently certified with respect to the Directive 93/42/EC, and for which the 
available clinical data are not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with MDR, additional clinical data 
may be obtained by post-market clinical follow-up studies of the device. Sometimes, even data from the 
general post-market follow-up might suffice to close the gap18. 
Note: if a clinical investigation is required, then the Member State requires advance notification of the 
proposal and the provisions of Article 62 and Annex XV will be applicable.

In duly justified and substantiated cases, some Class I devices manufacturers may exceptionally 
demonstrate that the conformity with general safety and performance requirements based on clinical data 
is not deemed appropriate. Such a justification by the manufacturer must be based upon an evaluation of 
evidence in accordance with Article 61(10).  
The clinical evaluation, risk management processes and PMS will be inter-dependent and will be 
periodically updated. 
c) Prepare technical documentation 
The manufacturer will draw up and keep up to date the technical documentation that demonstrates the 
conformity of their devices with the technical requirements of the MDR. This technical documentation 
must be prepared according to Annex II and III and prior to drawing up the EU declaration of 
conformity. 
The technical documentation and, if applicable, its summary, will be drawn up and presented by the 
manufacturer in a clear, organised, readily searchable and unambiguous manner. 
The manufacturer must make the technical documentation available to the CA, the authorised 
representative (when applicable) and NB (when applicable). 
The technical documentation will be prepared following review of the general safety and performance 
requirements and relevant technical provisions of the MDR and, if applicable, of the Machinery 
Directive19 and will cover all the relevant aspects from Annex II and III, such as: 
- 
Rationale for the qualification as a medical device and the risk class attributed. 
- 
Description and specification - A general description of the device, including its intended 
purpose and intended users/patient population and, if applicable, accessories and variants of the 
product (for example trade names, model numbers, references, sizes). In addition, the Basic 
UDI-DI as per Part C of Annex VI will be provided.  
- 
Technical Specifications of the device - Specifications including details of raw materials, 
drawings of components and/or master patterns and any quality control procedures. 
- 
Information to be supplied by the manufacturer - Labels on the device and packaging, such as 
single unit packaging, sales packaging, transport packaging in case of specific management 
conditions and instruction for use (if applicable), in the languages determined by the Member 
States where the device is envisaged to be sold. 
- 
Reference to previous generations of the device and to similar devices - Provide an overview of 
previous generation(s) of the device and similar devices available on the market as applicable 
- 
Design and manufacturing information – Information that allows the understanding of the 
design and manufacturing of a device, including the results of qualifications tests and design 
calculations relevant to the intended use of the product, including connections to other devices 
in order for it to operate as intended. If the manufacturer can provide information showing that 
a safe design has been established for a number of years and that product has been performing 
as intended during that time such information is likely to be sufficient to cover this 
                                                     
19  According to Article 1 (12) 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
15 
 
requirement. The identification of all sites, suppliers and sub-contractors, where design and 
manufacturing activities are performed will also be included. 
- 
General safety and performance requirements – information for the demonstration of 
conformity with the general safety and performance requirements, set out in Annex I. In order 
to do this, the manufacturer will refer to all the methods and solutions used for conformity 
demonstration with each safety and performance requirement, including harmonised standards 
and/or common specifications (CS). The same applies for the requirements contained in the 
Machinery Directive.  
- 
Demonstration of conformity with the requirements set out in Annex I should typically be 
presented in the form of a checklist. This should list all requirements referred to in Annex I and 
specify:  
(1) the applicability of each requirement to the device,  
(2) the solution adopted by the manufacturer to comply with each applicable requirement, 
(3) the reference to any possible CS or harmonized standards applied in full or in part and 
(4) the reference to where to find evidence of the solution adopted in the technical 
documentation.  
Manufacturers will list the relevant harmonised standards (concerning for example sterilisation, 
labelling and information to be supplied with the device, biocompatibility, specific groups of 
products) which have been applied in full or in part. If harmonised standards have not been 
applied in full, additional data will be required and provided detailing remaining solutions 
adopted to meet the concerned requirements. 
Information on standards harmonised under the MDR will be made available in the Official 
Journal of the European Union. 
Changes on the harmonised standards used to demonstrate the conformity of device will be 
adequately taken into account in a timely manner. 
Please note that no standard harmonized under the Directive 93/42/EC, has ever covered all the 
requirements of the Annex I to that Directive. Hence, it is not likely that any one standard 
harmonized under the MDR will cover all the requirements of the Annex I to the MDR. The 
scope of coverage is indicated in the so-called Annex Z to the European “EN” standard. The 
scope of coverage is never to be found in the ISO or IEC standard text. 
- 
Benefit-risk analysis (sections 1 and 8 of Annex I) and Risk management (section 3 of Annex I).  
- 
Pre-clinical and Clinical evaluation data – Information to be provided on the results from pre-
clinical and clinical evaluation.  
- 
The post-market surveillance system - The technical documentation on post-market surveillance 
to be drawn up by the manufacturer in accordance with Articles 83 to 85 will be presented in a 
clear, organized, readily searchable and unambiguous manner. It shall address and cover the 
elements of point 1.1 of Annex III. The plan will cover the post-market clinical follow up plan as 
referred to in part B of Annex XIV or a justification as to why it is not applicable. The PMS 
report of article 85 shall be part of the technical documentation on post-market surveillance. 
 
 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
16 
 
- 
Records - Manufacturers will keep the technical documentation, the EU declaration of 
conformity and, if applicable, a copy of any relevant certificate, including any amendments and 
supplements, issued in accordance with Article 56, available for the competent authorities for a 
period of at least 10 years after the last device covered by the EU declaration of conformity has 
been placed on the market (Article 10(8)).  
Availability of documentation – In case of request by the CA, the manufacturer will provide the required 
technical documentation in an official Union language determined by the Member State concerned 
(Article 10(14)). 
d)  Request Notified Body involvement 
In the case of devices placed on the market in sterile condition, having a measuring function or being 
reusable surgical instruments, the manufacturer will apply the procedures set out in Chapters I and III of 
Annex IX, or in Part A of Annex XI of MDR. This requires the involvement of a NB. In all other cases 
the intervention of a NB is not required for Class I devices. If involvement of the NB is needed it is 
limited: 
- 
In the case of devices placed on the market in sterile condition, to the aspects of manufacture 
concerned with securing and maintaining sterile conditions; 
- 
In the case of devices with a measuring function, to the aspects of manufacture concerned with 
the conformity of the devices with the metrological requirements; 
- 
In the case of reusable surgical instruments20,  to the aspects relating to the reuse of the device, in 
particular cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, maintenance and functional testing and the related 
instructions for use. 
Manufacturers can choose any NB designated according to the MDR for the relevant codes and 
corresponding types of devices as established by Regulation (EU) 2017/2185 (code MDS 1005 for 
“Devices in sterile condition”, code MDS 1006 for “Reusable surgical instruments” and code MDS 1010 
for “Devices with a measuring function”). The list of designated NBs is available in the NANDO 
database at the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/nando/ 
Please note that notification under the Directive 93/42/EC, becomes void after the application of the MDR 
on the 26 May 2021.  Hence, it is necessary to consult the NANDO database for the MDR. 
e) Prepare Instructions for Use and Labelling 
Each device must be accompanied by any safety and performance information needed to use it safely 
and to identify the device as well as the manufacturer and/or the authorised representative, taking 
account of the training and knowledge of the potential users. This information comprises the label, 
device packaging and the data in the instructions for use. By way of derogation to the general principles, 
no instructions for use are required for Class I devices if they can be used properly and safely without 
such instruction. An exception is most likely posed for Class Ir devices as reprocessing (cleaning and 
sterilization) will require an instruction.  
The requirements regarding the information to be supplied with the device will be found in Annex I, 
Chapter III (23). In the labelling and instructions for use as well as in promotional materials of the 
device, the manufacturer may not (Article 7): 
                                                     
20  Please also note that involvement of a Notified Body in the case of reusable surgical instruments is a new requirement under the MDR, which 
did not exist under the MDD. Manufacturers of such products are advised to take this into consideration for their plans to meet the provisions 
of the MDR before its application on the 26 May 2021. 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
17 
 
- 
Ascribe functions and properties to the device which the device does not have; 
- 
Create a false impression regarding treatment or diagnosis, functions or properties which the 
device does not have; 
- 
Fail to inform the user or the patient of a likely risk associated with the use of the device in line 
with its intended purpose; 
- 
Suggest uses for the device other than those stated to form part of the intended purpose for 
which the conformity assessment was carried out. 
National language requirements must be taken into account in relation to the labelling and instructions 
for use. Versions of labelling and IFU (in each of the relevant national languages) will be included in the 
technical documentation. 
Note: According to Article 16(2), a distributor or importer may provide a translation of the information 
provided according to Section 23 of Annex I. The manufacturer will be informed about the intended 
translation and receive a copy 28 days prior to the date of making the device available in the respective 
country. It is advisable to perform a review of the translation, as a wrong or misleading translation can 
cause harm to patients or others, leading to possible liability of the manufacturer. 
Where appropriate, the information supplied by the manufacturer will take the form of internationally 
recognised symbols. Any symbol or identification colour used will conform to harmonised standards or 
common specifications (CS). In areas for which no harmonised standards or CS exist, the symbols and 
colours will be described in the documentation supplied with the device. 
The label should have the indication that the product is a “medical device”.  
4) Check compliance with general obligations for manufacturers 
Before placing a device on the market, the manufacturer will make sure to comply with the general 
obligations for manufacturers as established in Article 10.  
Special attention will be given to the establishment of an appropriate QMS that will ensure compliance 
with the MDR in the most effective manner, for example by means of an internal audit. The QMS will 
be documented, implemented, maintained, kept up to date and continually improved and will cover at 
least the following aspects: 
a) a strategy for regulatory compliance; 
b) identification of applicable general safety and performance requirements and exploration of 
options to address those requirements;  
c) responsibility of the management;  
d) resource management, including selection and control of suppliers and sub-contractors;  
e) risk management;  
f) clinical evaluation, including post market clinical follow-up (PMCF);  
g) product realisation, including planning, design, development, production and service provision;  
h) verification of the UDI assignments;  
i) setting-up, implementation and maintenance of a post-market surveillance system;  
j) handling communication with competent authorities, notified bodies, other economic operators, 
customers and/or other stakeholders;  
k) processes for reporting of serious incidents and field safety corrective actions in the context of 
vigilance;  
l) management of corrective and preventive actions and verification of their effectiveness;  
m) processes for monitoring and measurement of output, data analysis and product improvement. 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
18 
 
The QMS will be established at least in parallel, if not prior to chapter 3 a) and 3 b) as described in this 
guidance note.  
Natural or legal persons may claim compensation for damage caused by a defective device in 
accordance with applicable Union and national law. Therefore, manufacturers shall, in a manner that is 
proportionate to the risk class, type of device and size of the enterprise, have measures in place to 
provide sufficient financial coverage in respect of their potential liability under Directive 85/374/EEC, 
without prejudice to more protective measures under national law. 
5)  Draw-up the EU Declaration of Conformity 
The EU declaration of conformity, referred to in Article 19, is the procedure whereby the manufacturer, 
who fulfils the obligations imposed by Article 52(7), declares that the devices concerned fulfil the 
requirements of the MDR which apply to them. The declaration of conformity will contain as a 
minimum all information referred to in Annex IV and will be available to the CA. 
The manufacturer will continuously update the EU declaration of conformity and will translate it into an 
official union language or languages required by Member States in which the device is made available. 
If, in addition to the MDR, a device is covered by other Union legislation which also requires an EU 
declaration of conformity, the manufacturers will elaborate a single EU declaration of conformity where 
all the Union legislation applied to the product are referred to.  
By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity the manufacturer assumes the responsibility for the 
regulatory compliance of the device with all Union legislation applicable to it.  
Before affixing a CE mark, for class Ir, Im and Is devices, the manufacturer will have an EC certificate 
issued by NB according to the Annex IX, Chapter I and III, or to Annex XI, Part A.  
6)  Affix the CE marking 
All Class I medical devices placed on the market will bear the CE marking of conformity, which will be 
affixed in a visible, legible and indelible form on the device or on its sterile packaging. Where such 
affixing is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the device, the CE marking shall be 
affixed to the packaging. The CE marking shall also appear  on the instructions for use, as well as on any 
sales packaging. 
In the case of Class I medical devices placed on the market in a sterile condition and/or devices with 
measuring function and/or reusable surgical instruments, the CE marking will be accompanied by the 
identification number of the relevant NB. 
It is prohibited to affix marks which are likely to mislead third parties with regard to the meaning of the 
CE marking. Other additional marks may be affixed to the device, to the packaging or the instructions 
for use, but must not impair the visibility or legibility of the CE marking. 
The CE marking format will be in compliance with Annex V. Where the device is very small the 
minimum dimensions of the CE mark may be waived.

7) Registration of devices and manufacturers in Eudamed 
Before placing a device on the market, the manufacturer of a Class I medical device will register the 
device in Eudamed.  
In order to register the device, the manufacturer will submit to the electronic system referred to in 
Article 30 the information referred to in Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI, provided that they have not 
already been registered in accordance with Article 31. In cases where the conformity assessment 
procedure requires the involvement of a NB pursuant to Article 52, the information referred to in 
Section 1 of Part A of Annex VI will be provided to that electronic system before applying to the NB. 
After having verified the data about the manufacturer, the CA will validate it in Eudamed and the 
manufacturer will obtain a SRN from said electronic system. 
The manufacturer will use the SRN when applying to a NB for conformity assessment and for accessing 
Eudamed in order to fulfil its obligations under Article 29. 
Note: Authorised representatives and importers are also required to register to get an SRN in order to 
access Eudamed and provide data, as appropriate 
The registration of a device in Eudamed by the manufacturer includes: 
 
Assignment of a UDI-DI (with a Basic UDI-DI) as defined in Part C of Annex VI to the device 
(in accordance with the rules of the issuing entity referred to in Article 27(2) and introduction of 
the UDI-DI (with a Basic UDI-DI) to the UDI database together with the other core data elements 
referred to in Part B of Annex VI related to that device. 
 
Entering, or if already provided, verifying in Eudamed the information referred to in Section 2 of 
Part A of Annex VI, with the exception of Section 2.2 thereof, and thereafter keeping the 
information updated. 
If the manufacturer has its devices designed or manufactured by another legal or natural person, the 
information on the identity of that person will be part of the information (Section 2.13 of Part A of 
Annex VI) to be submitted to Eudamed before the registration of the device. 
Note 1 – The Unique Device Identification system will allow the identification and facilitate the 
traceability of devices (as referred on Article 27). [Special attention will be given to point 11 of Article 
27]. 
Note 2 – The Basic UDI-DI as defined in Part C of Annex VI is the primary identifier of a device model. 
It is the main key for records in the UDI database and is referenced in relevant certificates and EU 
declarations of conformity21. 
Note 3 – For Class I devices placed on the market according to MDD, after the date of application of 
MDR manufacturers will have in consideration the guidance documents applicable to legacy devices 
timelines22 and registration in Eudamed23.

Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
21 
 
All devices including legacy devices of the manufacturer portfolio which are placed on the market or put 
into service will have to be registered in Eudamed. However, until Eudamed is fully functional the 
manufacturer of a Class I medical device, or, where the manufacturer has no place of business in the EU, 
its authorised representative must inform the CA of the country in which they have their registered place 
of business and provide a description of the device that is sufficient to identify it. The manufacturer or 
its authorised representative will contact their relevant CA for the required procedures and forms 
required for such notifications. A fee might be applicable. 
8) Post Market Surveillance (PMS)  
After placing the Class I device on the market, the manufacturer will follow the next PMS steps: 
a) Review experience gained from Post-Market Surveillance 
The manufacturer will put in place the required post market surveillance (PMS) system and actively 
keep this PMS up to date in accordance with Article 83 of MDR. This includes actively and regularly 
collecting the user experience from devices on the market, reviewing these and ensuring timely 
implementation of any necessary corrective action, taking account of the nature and risks in relation to 
the product. In addition, there should be an evaluation of whether the intended benefits are achieved and 
whether the benefit-risk profile stays positive. The manufacturer will involve the distributors of the 
device and where applicable, the authorised representative and importers of the device in this system, in 
order to obtain the relevant information from the market. 
This system will be part of the QMS, and be supported by the manufacturer’s PMS plan, which must 
address a range of information (Annex III), such as information from the vigilance context, information 
from trending and trend reporting, information and data on any undesirable side-effects, information 
from reports, complaints and incidents, provided by users and economic operators, related to the device. 
Moreover, the manufacturer will gather and assess the relevant information such as technical literature, 
databases, registers review and public information for the device itself as well as for similar devices 
already present on the market.  
A PMS report will be prepared according to Article 85, summarizing the results and conclusions of the 
analysis of all of the data from the market. This report will be updated when necessary, for example  the 
intended benefits are not achieved or there is a change in the benefit-risk balance. The report can be 
requested by the CA at any time.  
Data gathered from PMS system must be used to actively update the clinical evaluation, benefit-risk 
determination, improve risk management, as well as other technical documentation on a regular basis. 
b) Vigilance  
The manufacturer is responsible for reporting all serious incidents and field safety corrective actions 
(FSCA) to the relevant CAs, according to Article 87 (1) of the MDR. After serious incident notification, 
the manufacturer is obliged to make investigations, according to Article 89, which will include a risk 
assessment of the incident. If needed, a FSCA will be implemented in order to reduce the risk associated 
with the use of the device.  
The manufacturer will involve the distributors of the device and, where applicable, the authorised 
representative and importers in the system, in order to obtain the information needed from the market, 
especially for FSCA and issued field safety notices (FSN) to ensure that required actions are followed 
and completed in a timely manner. 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
22 
 
When Eudamed is available, serious incidents and FSCAs will be submitted via this electronic system 
only.  
Manufacturers will report any serious incident immediately after they have established the causal 
relationship between that incident and their device or that such a causal relationship is reasonably 
possible. 
The timeframe to report serious incidents must not exceed the following upper limits: 
 
In the event of a serious public health threat, a report will be submitted not later than 2 days 
after becoming aware of the threat. (Article 87 (4)) 
 
In the event of death or an unanticipated deterioration in a person’s state of health a report will 
be submitted not later than 10 days after becoming aware of the serious incident. (Article 87 
(5)) 
 
In all other cases not later than 15 days after becoming aware of the serious incident (Article 87 
(3)) 
Where necessary to ensure timely reporting of serious incidents, the manufacturer may submit an initial 
report that is incomplete followed up by a complete report. If, after becoming aware of a potentially 
reportable incident, the manufacturer is uncertain about whether the incident is reportable, it shall 
nevertheless submit a report. Serious incidents will be reported only to the competent authority of the 
country in which the serious incident occurred via Eudamed. 
The manufacturer will provide a final report to that competent authority via Eudamed setting out its 
findings from the investigation. The report will set out conclusions and - where relevant - indicate 
corrective actions to be taken. 
When the competent authority notifies a manufacturer of a suspected serious incident, communicated to 
the competent authority by a healthcare professional, patient or user, the manufacturer is obliged to: 
 
submit a report of this serious incident to the notifying competent authority via Eudamed within 
the timeframes described above; 
 
submit an explanatory statement, to the competent authority, if the manufacturer believes the 
suspected serious incident does not fulfil the reporting criteria. 
In case the competent authority disagrees with the explanatory statement provided by the manufacturer a 
report of the serious incident may be required to be provided to the competent authority that does not 
agree via Eudamed by the manufacturer. 
If a FSCA is undertaken, manufacturers will without unnecessary delay report the field safety corrective 
action via Eudamed in advance of the carrying out of the FSCA unless urgency demands the 
manufacturer to undertake the actions immediately. 
Manufacturers will ensure that the information related to the FSCA is brought without delay to the 
attention of users of the device in question by means of a FSN. Except in cases of urgency, the content 
of the draft FSN will be submitted to the evaluating competent authority or to the coordinating 
competent authority to allow it to make comments. Unless duly justified by the situation of the 
individual Member State, the content of the field safety notice will be consistent in all Member States. 
Manufacturers will also report the FSN(s) to Eudamed. 
 
 


Class I Guidance MDCG MSWG - MDCG  2019-15 rev1 
 
23 
 
The FSN will allow the correct identification of the manufacturer (by including the, if issued, SRN), the 
device or devices affected (by including the relevant UDIs) and the FSN will explain, in a clear manner, 
without understating the level of risk, the reasons for the FSCA. This includes a clear reference to the 
device deficiency and the associated risks for patients, users or other persons and will clearly indicate all 
action to be taken by the users.  
Manufacturers will report by the means of a trend report to Eudamed any statistically significant 
increase in the frequency or severity of incidents that are not serious incidents or that are expected 
undesirable side-effects, when it could have a significant impact on the benefit-risk analysis and which 
have led or may lead to risks to the health or safety of patients, users or other persons that are 
unacceptable when weighed against the intended benefits. 
Manufacturers will, if they exist, follow national provisions in the field of vigilance specifically in but 
not limited to the case of field safety corrective actions: 
 
The allowed languages used to communicate with users by means of the Field Safety Notice. 
Manufacturers are asked to check if templates exist (on European Commission website) on any of the 
reportable forms and make sure that all the necessary information according to these templates is 
provided. This will be only applicable until Eudamed is available. 
Manufacturers should keep concerned economic operators informed of reported serious incidents and 
FSCA activities. 
c) Non-conforming products 
If a manufacturer has reasons to believe that a device which they have placed on the market or put into 
service is not in conformity with the MDR they will immediately take the necessary corrective action to 
bring that device into conformity, to withdraw it or to recall it, as appropriate. The manufacturer will 
inform the distributors of the device in question and, if applicable, the authorised representative and 
importers. If the device presents a serious risk, the manufacturer will immediately inform the competent 
authorities of the Member States in which the manufacturer made the device available and, where 
applicable, the notified body that issued a certificate for the device, in particular, of the non-compliance 
and of any corrective action taken.
