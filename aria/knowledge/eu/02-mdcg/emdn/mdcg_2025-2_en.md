| INSERT | P09080408 – HIP PROSTHESIS ADAPTERS | a new code and term for the EMDN date base (P09080408 – HIP PROSTHESIS ADAPTERS). Any kind of adapters in femoral hip arthroplasty could be currently just listed under P9088004 – HIP PROSTHESIS ADAPTERS. However this code is listed under P90880 - HIP PROTHESIS - ACCESSORIES. The affected device however is a class III implantable, surgically invasive medical device intended for longterm- use according to rule 8, indent 8 of Annex VIII of the MDR. Therefore it cannot be classified as accessory and would need an own EMDN code please. | The inclusion of new levels is planned to include types of devices not present in the current version of the EMDN (refer to P9088004 – HIP PROSTHESIS ADAPTERS). |
| INSERT | P9006 - Cranial resinous compounds | Intended purpose: intended for the repair of cranial defects. Description: a two-component (powder and liquid) radiopaque, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) acrylic resin. The resin components are designed for mixing together at the point of use to form a cement which can be manually molded to fill a cranial defect providing brain protection. Sterile and single use. | The inclusion of new levels is planned to include types of devices not present in the current version of the EMDN (refer to P9004 STRUCTURES FILLING, REPLACEMENT AND RECONSTRUCTION DEVICES and related bottom levels). |
| INSERT | P9005 - CUSTOM MADE CRANIAL IMPLANTS | Intended purpose: designed individually for each patient to correct trauma and/or defects in cranial bones. Description: made of cured PMMA resin or PMMA with the addition of gentamicin or PMMA with the addition gentamicin and vancomycin The shape of the device is designed each time, patient for patient, on the basis of the request of the surgeon that supplies to “Manufacturer Name" a digital image (CT scan) of the cranial defect. Each custom-made "Device Name" is provided in duplicate: one copy is for implant and the other is a backup copy in case the first one is damaged or looses sterility. These devices are supplied sterile and for single use. | Based on the documentation provided by the user (statement according to Annex XIII and QMS certificate) the device is a custom made device (CMD). CMDs are not required to be registered in the UDI-DI module in EUDAMED. Therefore, an EMDN code is not necessary. |

| UPDATE | Q010507 - ENDODONTIC INSTRUMENTS (CANAL ENLARGERS, FILES, RASPS, ETC.) | Not all endodontic instruments on the market are single-use. It would be better if the code Q010507 did not indicate the number of uses. | Refer to L15 ODONTOSTOMATOLOGY INSTRUMENTS, REUSABLE and related bottom levels. |

| INSERT | Z120298 - ENDOSCOPE - OTHER | There are endoscopes that can be used for different applications. The choice is made by the surgeon. These products cannot yet be assigned an EMDN code, as several EMDN codes are applicable for one device. For example, there are endoscopes that can be used for both laparoscopy and thorascopy due to their design. For this reason, a generic EMDN code for endoscopes should be added. | The inclusion of new levels is planned to include types of devices not present in the current version of the EMDN. If relevant, multiple codes can be assigned to the same UDI- DI. |
| MOVING | Z120306 - VITAL SIGNS TELEMETRY INSTRUMENTS (ECG, NIPB, EtCO2, SpO2, RESPIRATION,...) | Move "Z120306 - VITAL SIGNS TELEMETRY INSTRUMENTS (ECG, NIPB, EtCO2, SpO2, RESPIRATION,...)" and its underlying levels below "Z120302 - Vital Signs Monitoring Instruments"“ "Z120306 - VITAL SIGNS TELEMETRY INSTRUMENTS (ECG, NIPB, EtCO2, SpO2, RESPIRATION,...)" creates a group for telemetry devices. However, through the current hierarchy it is not connected with the code group "Z120302 - Vital Signs Monitoring Instruments" which includes products related to vital signs monitoring (such as bedside or portable patient monitors which share a very similar intended purpose to vital signs telemetry devices). | The request is not aimed to correct an improper place of an existing level and related bottom levels. The current version of EMDN provides the codes necessary to register different kinds of devices intended to monitor vital signs. |
