Procedures for the updates of the European Medical Device
Nomenclature
The European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN), as established by Article 26 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/745 – Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and Article 23 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/746 - In Vitro Diagnostic medical devices Regulation (IVDR),
will be annually reviewed and updated based on the practical use of the EMDN and
feedback from its users.
This document lays out the procedures for the annual revision as well as the procedure
for ad-hoc requests requiring an expedited review.

A) Actors involved
MDCG Nomenclature working group
The Nomenclature working group (“NOM WG”) is an expert group established under
the Medical Device Coordination Group (“MDCG”) per Article 103(7) of the MDR
responsible for managing, maintaining and monitoring the use of the EMDN.
The NOM WG provides assistance and advice to the Medical Device Coordination
Group (MDCG) on all implementation issues related to the EMDN with the aim of
supporting the functioning of the future European database on medical devices
(EUDAMED).
In particular, the NOM WG provides relevant advice in matters related to the update
and maintenance of the EU nomenclature, which is made available by the Commission,
in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 and Article 23 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/746.
The NOM WG is composed of representatives of Member States' competent
authorities who are experts in the particular policy area. The group also includes
economic operators, healthcare professionals, notified bodies, hospitals, laboratories,
patients and consumers at Union level which are appointed as observers to the working
group, as a result of a public call for applications.
EMDN-TT
The European Medical Device Nomenclature Technical Team (EMDN-TT) is a smaller
technical group established under the Nomenclature WG which is composed of
technical experts appointed by
the Italian Consortium1 instituted for the
implementation of project “Supporting the Maintenance of the European Medical
Device Nomenclature” with the purpose to assess and review proposals, or to provide
draft amendments, which include the definition of new and revisions of existing codes
of the EMDN for the MDCG Nomenclature WG’s consideration.
1 Italian Consortium set up for the implementation of SMEMDN project, (HS – g- 22 – 19.02) is composed of the

Ministry of Health (MOH) and by Friuli Venezia – Giulia Region (FVG – REG)

Users
Users of the EMDN include but are not limited to competent authorities, notified bodies,
manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers, distributors, and persons
referred to in Art. 22(1,3), trade associations, professional bodies, healthcare
professionals, hospitals, laboratories, patients, consumers and the World Health
Organization (WHO).

B) Procedure for the annual revision of the EMDN
The annual revisions of the EMDN will proceed by means of four phases. During each
phase, different tasks and objectives are undertaken by different actors.
Phase I – Collection of requests (January)
Phase I of the procedure involves the collection of requests from users through the
platform for EMDN requests2. The platform for requests will be available year-long.
However, the deadline for submitting requests for processing in that same calendar
year is 31 January 20XX.
Phase II – Evaluation of the requests and analysis of the practical use (February –
July)
Phase II of the procedure involves a technical evaluation by the EMDN-TT of the:
- requests submitted during Phase I,
- requests by the NOM WG,
- EMDN usage in EUDAMED (e.g. review of devices registered with multiple
codes, review of devices registered with code extension “99”).
Following the technical evaluation, a first draft proposal for the update of the EMDN is
prepared. This proposal and the list of rejected requests are submitted to the NOM WG
for review.
Phase III – Validation and endorsement (August – October)
Under Phase III of the procedure, the NOM WG reviews the proposal submitted at the
end of Phase II and provides feedback on the proposed changes to the EMDN-TT, as
necessary. Following the processing of feedback, a final draft is then endorsed by the
NOM WG.
Phase IV – MDCG endorsement and publication (November – December)
Phase IV of the procedure is the final part of the annual cycle and involves the
endorsement of the final draft by the MDCG and publication of the officially endorsed
update in EUDAMED and the EMDN browser. After MDCG endorsement, translations
are elaborated in all EU languages and are validated by the NOM WG.

Note: the above-described timetable for annual updates may be subject to revision
depending on the number of requests received.

C) Pilot procedure for the ad-hoc updates of the EMDN requiring an
expedited review
The general rule remains that all requests must proceed through the annual procedure.
For reasons related to established need, only requests submitted by competent
authorities and notified bodies qualify under the ad-hoc procedure.
Under the ad-hoc update procedure, only new code requests may be submitted. If the
new code request results in the need to render obsolete or split other codes, then the
request will be redirected to the annual procedure pathway.
Information to be submitted by applicants
A form must be filled out by the applicant which can be found on the Commission’s
website under ‘Guidance - MDCG endorsed documents and other guidance’. This form
will require the following non-exhaustive information:
1

Name of NCA1 / NB 2

2

Indication if the request
is needed for the
registration in the UDIDI module of
EUDAMED

3

cannot be utilized

5

applicable)

6

12 Reference to other

13 Additional information

nomenclature, if any)

Processing of the ad-hoc requests
Requests should be submitted to SANTE-EMDN@ec.europa.eu . Following receipt of
the completed form, the Commission will circulate the information provided by the
applicant to the EMDN-TT for a written consultation. Following assessment of the
request, the EMDN-TT will provide feedback to the Commission who in turn will inform
the applicant whether the application is eligible for the ad-hoc procedure.
If the request is considered ineligible, the user will be informed and their submission
will be deferred for an assessment under the annual update procedure.
If the request is considered eligible for the ad-hoc procedure, it is further analysed by
EMDN-TT and a technical proposal is elaborated and circulated with the NOM-WG for
review and endorsement. Following the NOM-WG’s endorsement, the MDCG
endorses the final version of the technical proposal.
During the annual review procedure, ad-hoc updates will be reflected in the annual
EMDN updated version.
