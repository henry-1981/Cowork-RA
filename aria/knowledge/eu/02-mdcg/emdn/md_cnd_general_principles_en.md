The purpose of this document is to provide information regarding the basic principles and the 
structure of the Italian “Classificazione Nazionale Dispositivi medici” (CND). In March 2019, and 
according to the criteria set out by the Medical Device Coordination Group1 (MDCG), the CND 
was selected as the basis for the future European Medical Device Nomenclature (EMDN). The 
EMDN will support the functioning of EUDAMED as stated by the MDCG and in accordance with 
Articles 23 of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 – MDR and Regulation (EU) 2017/746.

Background and General Principles
2
 
In 2005, the Italian Ministry of Health set out that the CND would be the official Italian medical 
device classification and nomenclature. Since then, the CND has been implemented not only in Italy, 
but also in Portugal and Greece. 
About 15.000 manufacturers
3 
from various countries have used the CND for the registration of 
medical devices and 
in vitro
 diagnostic medical devices in the Italian database. The distribution of 
manufacturers of medical devices and 
in vitro
 diagnostic medical devices per country is reported 
below in Figure 1.

The CND nomenclature is one of the tools used in the governance of the medical device sector and 
is characterised by its refined and hierarchical structure. It aims to support the improvement of 
patient safety and the quality of health systems by enabling information to be communicated in a 
standardised manner. 
 
Updates and maintenance of CND:

 The principles and rules presented thereafter are the ones historically established/followed when building the CND nomenclature up 
to the last update in 2018. This is without prejudice to the new rules that will govern the EMDN which will be established by the 
MDCG.

The construction of the CND, its subsequent updates and maintenance have been based on three 
fundamental principles.  
A) Participative approach:  
For the update and maintenance of a qualitative nomenclature, highly differentiated and 
qualified expertise is required. As the medical device sector is acknowledged for its 
heterogeneity and complexity, a broad participation of all stakeholders (economic operators and 
healthcare professional from NHS - at all levels of its organisation) is essential.  
 
B) Qualified validation of proposals:  
Nomenclature and Classification proposals are technically validated based on assessments of 
actual need. Factors taken into consideration are: 
 other existing nomenclature and classification systems available at international level 
 consumption and expense information 
 assessment with sector experts from the different disciplines 
 
C)  Formal adoption and free public availability:  
The CND system, which represents the basis of the whole information system on medical 
devices is formally approved and thus constitutes an official reference, freely available to all 
stakeholders.  
 
More information on previous updates of the CND up to 2018 can be found in Annex I of this 
document.  
 
The following products are currently not included in the CND: 
 Medicinal products  
 Cosmetics products  
 Human blood and its derivatives; 
 Organs, tissues and cells of human origin, products including human tissues and cells and 
products derived therefrom. 
 Organs, tissues and cells of animal origin except medical devices manufactured using 
animal devitalized tissues or devitalized products derived from animal tissue. 
 Individual Protection Devices

he CND structure   

| The CND is characterised by its alphanumeric structure that is established in a multi-level |  |
| --- | --- |
| hierarchical tree. It clusters medical devices in three main levels: |  |
|  |  Category: the first hierarchical level |
|  |  Group: the second hierarchical level |
|  |  Type: the third hierarchical level (which if necessary, expands into several levels of detail |
|  | (1°, 2°, 3°, 4° e 5°)) |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  |  |
| Each medical device is classified by an alphanumeric code consisting of a letter referring to the |  |
| “Category”, a couple of numbers referring to the “Group” and a series of other couples of numbers |  |
| referring to the “Type” (whose amount depends on the level of detail) up to a maximum of 7 levels. |  |
|  |  |

Each
 
level
 
is identified by:
•
 an alphanumeric code (max 13 digits)

Categories: the first hierarchical level 
The first hierarchical level of the CND is defined as a “Category”. There are 22 categories, each 
identified by a letter of the alphabet: 
 
Each “Category” includes devices regulated under Directive 93/42/EEC, 90/385/EEC or 98/79/EC 
or following a dedicated prescription from reimbursement rules in Italy. These “categories” are used 
for the same specific apparatus, anatomical district or organ or as a replacement of them 
(anatomical categories), or devices characterised by similar use, intended use or clinical method 
(functional categories).  
Considering these criteria and the ramified tree structure with different detail level, the following 
Anatomic (8), Functional (9) and Special (5) Categories have been defined:

Groups: the second hierarchical level 
The second hierarchical levels are called “Groups”. There are 146 anatomical/functional Medical 
Devices Groups 4, which represent the various differentiations that distinguish devices contained in 
the Categories. They are identified by two-digit numbers from 01 to 99 for each Category. 
Number “90” identifies the groups of devices having various characteristics that are not related to 
existing groups. Number “99” “Altri – Others” is reserved to medical devices that are not included 
in already existing Groups and will be categorised in later updates. 
Type: the third hierarchical level (expands into several levels of detail (1°, 2°, 3°, 
4° and 5°)) 
The “Type” represents the third hierarchical level. If necessary, it expands into several levels of 
detail (1°, 2°, 3°, 4° and 5°). The group of every type includes medical devices characterised by a 
high affinity of use, intended use or similar clinical method. In case of doubt, the peculiar 
characteristics of the medical device under examination should be considered for a proper 
collocation or search process (i.e. the anatomic-functional characteristics and/or the intended use 
declared by the manufacturer). 
As explained, the term “others” marked with the code “99”on the first detail level is suitable for 
devices not included in existing types. The “99” types will be submitted for later updates. The code 
reserved to the generic term “others” must be used by users only if it is not possible to classify the 
medical device in existing typologies.  This type is subject to continuous checks and monitoring. 
Regarding accessories, every accessory follows the CND classification code of the medical device 
that it is associated with, according to the intended use given by the manufacturer. If an accessory 
can be used with multiple medical devices belonging to several groups, it must be placed in the 
prevalent type.

Annex I – CND updates up to 2018  
The periodical updating process of the CND was schematically subdivided into four main phases: 
 

|  Phase 1: Collection of proposals | This phase is open to all stakeholders who submit proposals for the definition of new classifications or for the revision of existing ones. |
| --- | --- |
|  Phase 2: Preliminary technical evaluation and elaboration of the proposal. | The MoH MD Technical Team (MDTT) analyses the collected proposals, the existing systems and the contents of the medical devices database to identify elements useful for classification. |
|  Phase 3: “Widespread validation” of the proposal. | The proposal is formally evaluated in three steps: A) the regional levels of the NHS involving clinical professionals in technical sessions B) Technical Health Committee - medical devices section of the Ministry of Health C) State - Regions Conference |
|  Phase 4: Formal adoption of the proposal | Finally, the proposal is approved by formal MoH act and published on the Italian Official journal as well as the website of the Italian MoH |

 

| Most of the inputs adopted for updating purposes are listed below: |  |
| --- | --- |
|  The analysis of the terminal typologies "90" and "99": |  |
|  | Implemented and consolidated, it originates from the analysis of information within the Italian |
|  | databank and considers data from all the medical devices registered and classified in the CND |
|  | terminal types with code "90" (- various) and "99" (- other) of specific categories or groups |
|  | identified. In fact, the classification system had already foreseen ab origine that medical devices |
|  | that are not placed in a specific “typology” are classified in the generic typologies indicated |
|  | with the codes 90 and 99. |
|  Manufacturer requests: |  |
|  | When a manufacturer is unable to classify a medical device in an appropriate way inside the |
|  | CND terminal level, a specific request for the introduction of a new CND class is required, with |
|  | a communication to the MoH of a rationale and the technical characteristics and / or intended |
|  | use that differentiate the device from the specific terminal classes already represented in the |
|  | CND. |
|  The analysis of CND coming from vigilance system: |  |

Market surveillance and the vigilance system are part of the institutional activities of the MOH. 
The lack of classificatory level can emerge in order to identify products that need particular 
attention for public health.

 The analysis of consumption by the NHS: 
The revision of the CND made through the processing of the consumption data of the 
Monitoring Database is based on identification of medical devices with great economic 
relevance or price variability.  
 The analysis coming from HTA Reports: 
Health Technology Assessment documents are periodically published by the Ministry of Health. 
These reports are considered when evaluating the revision of the CND. 
The following principles were considered in the revision of the CND:  
 the number of levels in the CND structure can be increased up to a maximum of seven, by 
coherently applying the homogeneity of the classification rules and of the coding system 
defined for the first CND structure. 
 for the definition of a new CND branch the number of manufacturers manufacturing the medical 
devices that will be placed in the new typology of the CND should be more than 1; 
 significant characteristics of medical devices detected by NHS professionals should be 
evaluated  
 the proposal of relocation of medical devices placed in class 90 or 99 should be consistent. 
 for the definition of a new CND branch significant differences of price between similar medical 
devices could be considered if necessary: 
 for the definition of a new CND branch an assessments related to the use of medical devices is 
considered (quantity and number of users in NHS); 
 
For each update proposal of the CND, the information associated to the devices registered in the 
Italian database were analysed and, if necessary, the information detected by the “Consumption 
Monitoring Database” were processed.

Annex II – CND VERSIONS 

| Art. No. 57 of the Italian Law n° 289 of the 27 December 2002 stated the requirement of the |  |
| --- | --- |
| establishment of a Commission on Medical Devices (CUD) as a technical advisory board to the |  |
| Ministry of Health. The CUD has the task of defining and updating the repertoire of medical |  |
| devices and classifying all medical devices in specific classes and sub-classes. |  |
| The CUD defined the first version of the Classificazione Nazionale dei Dispositivi Medici (CND) |  |
| on July 2005 (Italian Ministerial Decree of 22 Sept .2005). In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices |  |
| (regulated by European Directive No. 98/79 EEC and Italian Legislative Decree No. 332/2000) |  |
| were not included in the first version of the Classification, although they belong to a class of |  |
| Medical Devices. |  |
| The Italian Financial Law of 2006 (Law No. 266 of the year 2005, art. 1, par. 409) established that |  |
| the CND has to be approved by a decree of the Minister of Health in agreement with the State- |  |
| Regions Conference. |  |
| The CUD considered it appropriate to review and update the CND with the inclusion of in vitro |  |
| diagnostic medical devices before proceeding with the State-Regions Conference. Therefore, on 20 |  |
| February 2007, and after a revision of the classification, the Health Minister decreed the approval of |  |
| the Classificazione Nazionale dei Dispositivi Medici (CND) drawn up by the CUD. The |  |
| classification refers to the medical devices regulated by Italian legislative decrees N°. 507/92, N°. |  |
| 46/97, N°. 332/2000 and subsequent amendments. |  |
| In 28 March2013, the Italian D.P.R. n.44, replaced the Commission on Medical Devices (CUD) |  |
| with the Technical Committee section F on medical devices. |  |
| The Classification represented the first step towards the establishment of the Italian Repertoire of |  |
| the Medical Devices. |  |
| According to the art. N° 2 of The Italian Financial Law No. 266, the Technical Committee section F |  |
| (previously CUD), review the CND and make the necessary changes and updates. Every update is |  |
| approved by a Ministerial Decree: |  |
