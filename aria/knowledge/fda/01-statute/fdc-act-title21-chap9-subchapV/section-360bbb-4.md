   A person may submit data and information in a master file to the Secretary with the intent to reference, or to authorize, in writing, another person to reference, such data or information to support a medical countermeasure submission (including a supplement or amendment to any such submission), without requiring the master file holder to disclose the data and information to any such persons authorized to reference the master file.

   In the case that data or information within a medical countermeasure master file is used only to support the conditional approval of an application filed under section 360ccc of this title, such master file may be relied upon to support the effectiveness of a product that is the subject of a subsequent medical countermeasure submission only if such application is supplemented by additional data or information to support review and approval in a manner consistent with the standards applicable to such review and approval for such countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product.

 ## (b) Medical countermeasure master file content

 ### (1) In general

 ## (c) Sponsor reference

 ### (1) In general

   Each incorporation of data or information within a medical countermeasure master file shall describe the incorporated material in a manner in which the Secretary determines appropriate and that permits the review of such information within such master file without necessitating resubmission of such data or information.

 ### (3) Reference by an authorized person

   A person submitting an application for review may, where the Secretary determines appropriate, incorporate by reference all or part of the contents of a medical countermeasure master file, if the master file holder authorizes the incorporation in writing.

 ## (d) Acknowledgment of and reliance upon a master file by the Secretary

 ### (1) In general

   The Secretary shall provide the master file holder with a written notification indicating that the Secretary has reviewed and relied upon specified data or information within a master file and the purposes for which such data or information was incorporated by reference if the Secretary has reviewed and relied upon such specified data or information to support the approval, classification, conditional approval, clearance, licensure, or authorization of a security countermeasure, qualified countermeasure, or qualified pandemic or epidemic product. The Secretary may rely upon the data and information within the medical countermeasure master file for which such written notification was provided in additional applications, as applicable and appropriate and upon the request of the master file holder so notified in writing or by an authorized person of such holder.

 ### (2) Certain applications
