    ### **Editorial Notes**

   ### References in Text

   The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, referred to in subsec. (b)(11), (16), is Pub. L. 115–52, Aug. 18, 2017, 131 Stat. 1005. Section 504 of the Act amended this section and section 355c of this title. For complete classification of this Act to the Code, see Short Title of 2017 Amendment note set out under section 301 of this title and Tables.

   Section 505C–1 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, referred to in subsec. (b)(12), probably means section 505(c) of Pub. L. 115–52, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, which is set out as a note under section 355a of this title. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not contain a section 505C–1, and section 505(c) of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 relates to the development and implementation of a plan for earlier submission of pediatric studies under sections 355a and 355c of this title and section 262(m) of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare.
