 ## (c) Limitations

 Subsection (a) does not apply to the approval of—

   (1) a supplement to an application under section 355(b) of this title for any qualified infectious disease product for which an extension described in subsection (a) is in effect or has expired;

   (2) a subsequent application filed with respect to a product approved under section 355 of this title for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength;

   (3) a product that does not meet the definition of a qualified infectious disease product under subsection (g) based upon its approved uses; or

   (4) an application pursuant to section 262(a) of title 42.

 ## (d) Designation

 ### (1) In general

   The manufacturer or sponsor of a drug may request the Secretary to designate a drug as a qualified infectious disease product at any time before the submission of an application under section 355(b) of this title or section 262(a) of title 42 for such drug. The Secretary shall, not later than 60 days after the submission of such a request, determine whether the drug is a qualified infectious disease product.

 ### (2) Limitation

   Except as provided in paragraph (3), a designation under this subsection shall not be withdrawn for any reason, including modifications to the list of qualifying pathogens under subsection (f)(2)(C).

 ### (3) Revocation of designation

   The Secretary may revoke a designation of a drug as a qualified infectious disease product if the Secretary finds that the request for such designation contained an untrue statement of material fact.

 ## (e) Regulations

 ### (1) In general

   Not later than 2 years after July 9, 2012, the Secretary shall adopt final regulations implementing this section, including developing the list of qualifying pathogens described in subsection (f).

 ### (2) Procedure

   In promulgating a regulation implementing this section, the Secretary shall—

     (A) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that includes the proposed regulation;

     (B) provide a period of not less than 60 days for comments on the proposed regulation; and

     (C) publish the final regulation not less than 30 days before the effective date of the regulation.

 ### (3) Restrictions

   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations implementing this section only as described in paragraph (2), except that the Secretary may issue interim guidance for sponsors seeking designation under subsection (d) prior to the promulgation of such regulations.

 ### (4) Designation prior to regulations

   The Secretary shall designate drugs as qualified infectious disease products under subsection (d) prior to the promulgation of regulations under this subsection, if such drugs meet the definition of a qualified infectious disease product described in subsection (g).

 ## (f) Qualifying pathogen

 ### (1) Definition

   In this section, the term "qualifying pathogen" means a pathogen identified and listed by the Secretary under paragraph (2) that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health, such as—

     (A) resistant gram positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus;

     (B) multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, including Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and E. coli species;

     (C) multi-drug resistant tuberculosis; and

     (D) Clostridium difficile.

 ### (2) List of qualifying pathogens

 ## (A) In general

     The Secretary shall establish and maintain a list of qualifying pathogens, and shall make public the methodology for developing such list.

 ## (B) Considerations

     In establishing and maintaining the list of pathogens described under this section, the Secretary shall—

       (i) consider—

         (I) the impact on the public health due to drug-resistant organisms in humans;

         (II) the rate of growth of drug-resistant organisms in humans;

         (III) the increase in resistance rates in humans; and

         (IV) the morbidity and mortality in humans; and


       (ii) consult with experts in infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, medical professionals, and the clinical research community.

 ## (C) Review

     Every 5 years, or more often as needed, the Secretary shall review, provide modifications to, and publish the list of qualifying pathogens under subparagraph (A) and shall by regulation revise the list as necessary, in accordance with subsection (e).

 ## (g) Qualified infectious disease product

 The term "qualified infectious disease product" means a drug (including a biological product), including an antibacterial or antifungal drug, for human use that—

   (1) acts on bacteria or fungi or on substances produced by such bacteria or fungi; and
