You must be able to produce records and information required by this regulation that are in the possession of others under contract with you to conduct the postmarket surveillance. Those who have signed agreements or are under contract with you must also produce the records and information upon our request. This information must be produced within 72 hours of the initiation of the inspection. We generally will redact information pertaining to individual subjects prior to

                        copying those records, unless there are extenuating circumstances.

### § 822.37 Under what circumstances would you inspect records identifying subjects?

We can inspect and copy records identifying subjects under the same circumstances that we can inspect any records relating to postmarket surveillance. We are likely to be interested in such records if we have reason to believe that required reports have not been submitted, or are incomplete, inaccurate, false, or misleading.

### § 822.38 What reports must I submit to you?

You must submit interim and final reports as specified in your approved postmarket surveillance plan. In addition, we may ask you to submit additional information when we believe that the information is necessary for the protection of the public health and implementation of the act. We will also state the reason or purpose for the request and how we will use the information.
