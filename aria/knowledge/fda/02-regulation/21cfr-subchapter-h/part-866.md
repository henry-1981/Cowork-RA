## Subpart A—General Provisions

### § 866.1 Scope.

(a) This part sets forth the classification of immunology and microbiology devices intended for human use that are in commercial distribution.

(b) The indentification of a device in a regulation in this part is not a precise description of every device that is, or will be, subject to the regulation. A manufacturer who submits a premarket notification submission for a device under part 807 may not show merely that the device is accurately described by the section title and identification provisions of a regulation in this part, but shall state why the device is substantially equivalent to other devices, as required by § 807.87.

(c) To avoid duplicative listings, an immunology and microbiology device that has two or more types of uses (e.g., used both as a diagnostic device and as a microbiology device) is listed only in one subpart.

(d) References in this part to regulatory sections of the Code of Federal Regulations are to chapter I of title 21, unless otherwise noted.

(e) Guidance documents referenced in this part are available on the Internet at
                        *http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/default.htm.*

> Citation: [52 FR 17733, May 11, 1987, as amended at 68 FR 5827, Feb. 5, 2003; 79 FR 50552, Aug. 25, 2014]

### § 866.3 Effective dates of requirement for premarket approval.

A device included in this part that is classified into class III (Premarket approval) shall not be commercially distributed after the date shown in the

                        regulation classifying the device unless the manufacturer has an approval under section 515 of the act (unless an exemption has been granted under section 520(g)(2) of the act). An approval under section 515 of the act consists of FDA's issuance of an order approving an application for premarket approval (PMA) for the device or declaring completed a product development protocol (PDP) for the device.

(a) Before FDA requires that a device commercially distributed before the enactment date of the amendments, or a device that has been found substantially equivalent to such a device, has an approval under section 515 of the act FDA must promulgate a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring such approval, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Such a regulation under section 515(b) of the act shall not be effective during the grace period ending on the 90th day after its promulgation or on the last day of the 30th full calendar month after the regulation that classifies the device into class III is effective, whichever is later. See section 501(f)(2)(B) of the act. Accordingly, unless an effective date of the requirement for premarket approval is shown in the regulation for a device classified into class III in this part, the device may be commercially distributed without FDA's issuance of an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device. If FDA promulgates a regulation under section 515(b) of the act requiring premarket approval for a device, section 501(f)(1)(A) of the act applies to the device.

(b) Any new, not substantially equivalent, device introduced into commercial distribution on or after May 28, 1976, including a device formerly marketed that has been substantially altered, is classified by statute (section 513(f) of the act) into class III without any grace period and FDA must have issued an order approving a PMA or declaring completed a PDP for the device before the device is commercially distributed unless it is reclassified. If FDA knows that a device being commercially distributed may be a “new” device as defined in this section because of any new intended use or other reasons, FDA may codify the statutory classification of the device into class III for such new use. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

(c) A device identified in a regulation in this part that is classified into class III and that is subject to the transitional provisions of section 520(l) of the act is automatically classified by statute into class III and must have an approval under section 515 of the act before being commercially distributed. Accordingly, the regulation for such a class III transitional device states that as of the enactment date of the amendments, May 28, 1976, the device must have an approval under section 515 of the act before commercial distribution.

### § 866.9 Limitations of exemptions from section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).

The exemption from the requirement of premarket notification (section 510(k) of the act) for a generic type of class I or II device is only to the extent that the device has existing or reasonably foreseeable characteristics of commercially distributed devices within that generic type or, in the case of in vitro diagnostic devices, only to the extent that misdiagnosis as a result of using the device would not be associated with high morbidity or mortality. Accordingly, manufacturers of any commercially distributed class I or II device for which FDA has granted an exemption from the requirement of premarket notification must still submit a premarket notification to FDA before introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution the device when:

(a) The device is intended for a use different from the intended use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., the device is intended for a different medical purpose, or the device is intended for lay use where the former intended use was by health care professionals only;

(b) The modified device operates using a different fundamental scientific technology than a legally marketed device in that generic type of device; e.g., a surgical instrument cuts tissue with a laser beam rather than with a sharpened metal blade, or an in vitro diagnostic device detects or identifies infectious agents by using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probe or nucleic acid hybridization technology rather than culture or immunoassay technology; or

(c) The device is an in vitro device that is intended:

(1) For use in the diagnosis, monitoring, or screening of neoplastic diseases with the exception of immunohistochemical devices;

(2) For use in screening or diagnosis of familial or acquired genetic disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism;

(3) For measuring an analyte that serves as a surrogate marker for screening, diagnosis, or monitoring life-threatening diseases such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), chronic or active hepatitis, tuberculosis, or myocardial infarction or to monitor therapy;

(4) For assessing the risk of cardiovascular diseases;

(5) For use in diabetes management;

(6) For identifying or inferring the identity of a microorganism directly from clinical material;

(7) For detection of antibodies to microorganisms other than immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG assays when the results are not qualitative, or are used to determine immunity, or the assay is intended for use in matrices other than serum or plasma;

(8) For noninvasive testing as defined in § 812.3(k) of this chapter; and

(9) For near patient testing (point of care).

                         An influenza virus antigen detection test system is a device intended for the qualitative detection of influenza viral antigens directly from clinical specimens in patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection. The test aids in the diagnosis of influenza infection and provides epidemiological information on influenza. Due to the propensity of the virus to mutate, new strains emerge over time which may potentially affect the performance of these devices. Because influenza is highly contagious and may lead to an acute respiratory tract infection causing severe illness and even death, the accuracy of these devices has serious public health implications.

(b)
                        *Classification.*
                         Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:

(1) The device's sensitivity and specificity performance characteristics or positive percent agreement and negative percent agreement, for each specimen type claimed in the intended use of the device, must meet one of the following two minimum clinical performance criteria:

(i) For devices evaluated as compared to an FDA-cleared nucleic acid based-test or other currently appropriate and FDA accepted comparator method other than correctly performed viral culture method:

(A) The positive percent agreement estimate for the device when testing for influenza A and influenza B must be at the point estimate of at least 80 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 70 percent.

(B) The negative percent agreement estimate for the device when testing for influenza A and influenza B must be at the point estimate of at least 95 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 90 percent.

(ii) For devices evaluated as compared to correctly performed viral culture method as the comparator method:

(A) The sensitivity estimate for the device when testing for influenza A must be at the point estimate of at least 90 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 80 percent. The sensitivity estimate for the device when testing for influenza B must be at the point estimate of at least 80 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 70 percent.

(B) The specificity estimate for the device when testing for influenza A and influenza B must be at the point estimate of at least 95 percent with a lower bound of the 95 percent confidence interval that is greater than or equal to 90 percent.

(2) When performing testing to demonstrate the device meets the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a currently appropriate and FDA accepted comparator method must be used to establish assay performance in clinical studies.

(3) Annual analytical reactivity testing of the device must be performed with contemporary influenza strains. This annual analytical reactivity testing must meet the following criteria:

(i) The appropriate strains to be tested will be identified by FDA in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and sourced from CDC or an FDA-designated source. If the annual strains are not available from CDC, FDA will identify an alternative source for obtaining the requisite strains.

(ii) The testing must be conducted according to a standardized protocol considered and determined by FDA to be acceptable and appropriate.

(iii) By July 31 of each calendar year, the results of the last 3 years of annual analytical reactivity testing must be included as part of the device's labeling. If a device has not been on the market long enough for 3 years of annual analytical reactivity testing to have been conducted since the device received marketing authorization from FDA, then the results of every annual analytical reactivity testing since the device received marketing authorization from FDA must be included. The

                        results must be presented as part of the device's labeling in a tabular format, which includes the detailed information for each virus tested as described in the certificate of authentication, either by:

(A) Placing the results directly in the device's § 809.10(b) of this chapter compliant labeling that physically accompanies the device in a separate section of the labeling where the analytical reactivity testing data can be found; or

(B) In the device's label or in other labeling that physically accompanies the device, prominently providing a hyperlink to the manufacturer's public Web site where the analytical reactivity testing data can be found. The manufacturer's home page, as well as the primary part of the manufacturer's Web site that discusses the device, must provide a prominently placed hyperlink to the Web page containing this information and must allow unrestricted viewing access.

(4) If one of the actions listed at section 564(b)(1)(A)-(D) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act occurs with respect to an influenza viral strain, or if the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) determines, under section 319(a) of the Public Health Service Act, that a disease or disorder presents a public health emergency, or that a public health emergency otherwise exists, with respect to an influenza viral strain:

(i) Within 30 days from the date that FDA notifies manufacturers that characterized viral samples are available for test evaluation, the manufacturer must have testing performed on the device with those viral samples in accordance with a standardized protocol considered and determined by FDA to be acceptable and appropriate. The procedure and location of testing may depend on the nature of the emerging virus.

(ii) Within 60 days from the date that FDA notifies manufacturers that characterized viral samples are available for test evaluation and continuing until 3 years from that date, the results of the influenza emergency analytical reactivity testing, including the detailed information for the virus tested as described in the certificate of authentication, must be included as part of the device's labeling in a tabular format, either by:

(A) Placing the results directly in the device's § 809.10(b) of this chapter compliant labeling that physically accompanies the device in a separate section of the labeling where analytical reactivity testing data can be found, but separate from the annual analytical reactivity testing results; or

(B) In a section of the device's label or in other labeling that physically accompanies the device, prominently providing a hyperlink to the manufacturer's public Web site where the analytical reactivity testing data can be found. The manufacturer's home page, as well as the primary part of the manufacturer's Web site that discusses the device, must provide a prominently placed hyperlink to the Web page containing this information and must allow unrestricted viewing access.

(C) Clinical Studies. Clinical performance of the device must be established by conducting prospective clinical studies that include subjects with culture confirmed active tuberculosis. Studies must attempt to enroll subjects at risk for antibiotic-resistant MTB-complex; however, it may be necessary to include supplemental antibiotic resistant retrospective and contrived samples. Clinical studies must compare device results to both phenotypic drug susceptibility testing

                        and genotypic reference methods. The genotypic reference method must be a polymerase chain reaction based method that uses primers different from those in the experimental device and confirmed by bidirectional sequencing.

Contrived specimens that have been generated from pooling of multiple samples or spiking of purified analyte to cover the measuring range may be used, but the contrived samples must be prepared to mimic clinical specimens as closely as possible. This testing must evaluate repeatability and reproducibility using a protocol from an FDA-recognized standard.

(ii) Device performance data must be demonstrated through a clinical study and must include the following:

(A) Data demonstrating clinical validity including the clinical sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of the test in the intended use population of patients with suspected mild traumatic brain injury (
                        *i.e.,*
                         Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 13-15), or equivalent standard of care for determination of severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

(B) Study must be performed using the operators and in settings that are representative of the types of operators and settings for which the device is intended to be used.

(C) All eligible subjects must meet the well-defined study inclusion and exclusion criteria that define the intended use population. The prevalence of diseased or injured subjects in the study population must reflect the prevalence of the device's intended use population, or alternatively, statistical measures must be used to account for any bias due to enrichment of subpopulations of the intended use population.

(D) All eligible subjects must have undergone a head computerized tomography (CT) scan or other appropriate clinical diagnostic standard used to determine the presence of an intracranial lesion as part of standard of care and must also be evaluated by the subject device. All clinical diagnostic standards used in the clinical study must follow standard clinical practice in the United States.

(E) Relevant demographic variables and baseline characteristics including medical history and neurological history. In addition, head injury characteristics, neurological assessments, and physical evidence of trauma must be provided for each subject. This information includes but is not limited to the following: Time since head injury, time from head injury to CT scan, time from head injury to blood draw, GCS score or equivalent, experience of loss of consciousness, presence of confusion, episodes of vomiting, post-traumatic amnesia characteristics, presence of post-traumatic seizures, drug or alcohol intoxication, mechanism of injury, acute intracranial lesion type, neurosurgical lesion, and cranial fracture.

(F) Each CT scan or other imaging result must be independently evaluated in a blinded manner by at least two board-certified radiologists to determine whether it is positive or negative as defined by the presence or absence of acute intracranial lesions. This independent review must be conducted without access to test results of the device. Prior to conducting the review, the criteria and procedures to be followed for scoring the images must be established, including the mechanism for determining consensus.

(G) All the clinical samples must be tested with the subject device blinded to the TBI status and the neurological-lesion-status of the subject.

(H) Details on how missing values in data are handled must be provided.

(I) For banked clinical samples, details on storage conditions and storage period must be provided. In addition, a specimen stability study must be conducted for the duration of storage to demonstrate integrity of archived clinical samples. The samples evaluated in the assay test development must not be used to establish the clinical validity of the assays.

(iii) Performance testing of device analytical specificity must include the most commonly reported concomitant medications present in specimens from the intended use population. Additionally, potential cross-reacting endogenous analytes must be evaluated at the highest concentration reported in specimens from the intended use population.

(iv) Expected/reference values generated by testing a statistically appropriate number of samples from apparently healthy normal individuals.

(2) The 21 CFR 809.10(a) and (b) compliant labeling must include the following limitations:

(i) A limiting statement that this device is not intended to be used a stand-alone device but as an adjunct to other clinical information to aid in the evaluation of patients who are being considered for standard of care neuroimaging.

(ii) A limiting statement that reads “A negative result is generally associated with the absence of acute intracranial lesions. An appropriate neuroimaging method is required for diagnosis of acute intracranial lesions.”

(iii) As applicable, a limiting statement that reads “This device is for use by laboratory professionals in a clinical laboratory setting.”

(I) Specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.

(ii) Information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the device, including:

(A) Accuracy (method comparison) of study results for each claimed specimen type.

(
                        *1*
                        ) Accuracy of the device shall be evaluated with fresh clinical specimens collected and processed in a manner consistent with the device's instructions for use. If this is impractical, fresh clinical samples may be substituted or supplemented with archived clinical samples. Archived samples shall have been collected previously in accordance with the device's instructions for use, stored appropriately, and randomly selected. In some instances, use of contrived samples or human cell line samples may also be appropriate; the contrived or human cell line samples shall mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible and provide an unbiased evaluation of the device's accuracy.

(
                        *2*
                        ) Accuracy must be evaluated as compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA. Performance criteria for both the comparator method and device must be predefined and appropriate to the test's intended use. Detailed appropriate study protocols must be provided.

(
                        *3*
                        ) Information provided shall include the number and type of specimens, broken down by clinically relevant variants, that were compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA. The accuracy, defined as positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA), must be measured; accuracy point estimates must be greater than 99 percent (both per reported variant and overall) and uncertainty of the point estimate must be presented using the 95 percent confidence interval. Clinical specimens must include both homozygous wild type and heterozygous genotypes. The number of clinical specimens for each variant reported that must be included in the accuracy study must be based on the variant prevalence. Common variants (greater than 0.1 percent allele frequency in ethnically relevant population) must have at least 20 unique heterozygous clinical specimens tested.

                        Rare variants (less than or equal to 0.1 percent allele frequency in ethnically relevant population) shall have at least three unique mutant heterozygous specimens tested. Any no calls (
                        *i.e.,*
                         absence of a result) or invalid calls (
                        *e.g.,*
                         failed quality control) in the study must be included in accuracy study results and reported separately. Variants that have a point estimate for PPA or NPA of less than 99 percent (incorrect test results as compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA) must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. Accuracy measures generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. Results must be summarized and presented in tabular format, by sample and by genotype. Point estimate of PPA should be calculated as the number of positive results divided by the number of specimens known to harbor variants (mutations) without “no calls” or invalid calls. The point estimate of NPA should be calculated as the number of negative results divided by the number of wild type specimens tested without “no calls” or invalid calls, for each variant that is being reported. Point estimates should be calculated along with 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals.

(
                        *4*
                        ) Information shall be reported on the clinical positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for carrier status (and where possible, for each variant) in each population. Specifically, to calculate PPV and NPV, estimate test coverage (TC) and the percent of persons with variant(s) included in the device among all carriers: PPV = (PPA * TC * π)/(PPA * TC * π + (1 − NPA) * (1 − π)) and NPV = (NPA * (1 − π))/(NPA *(1 − π) + (1 − PPA*TC) * π) where PPA and NPA described either in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A)(
                        *4*
                        )(
                        *i*
                        ) or in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A)(
                        *4*
                        )(
                        *ii*
                        ) of this section and π is prevalence of carriers in the population (pre-test risk to be a carrier for the disease).

(
                        *i*
                        ) For the point estimates of PPA and NPA less than 100 percent, use the calculated estimates in the PPV and NPV calculations.

(
                        *ii*
                        ) Point estimates of 100 percent may have high uncertainty. If these variants are measured using highly multiplexed technology, calculate the random error rate for the overall device and incorporate that rate in the estimation of the PPA and NPA as calculated previously. Then use these calculated estimates in the PPV and NPV calculations. This type of accuracy study is helpful in determining that there is no systematic error in such devices.

(B) Precision (reproducibility): Precision data must be generated using multiple instruments and multiple operators, on multiple non-consecutive days, and using multiple reagent lots. The sample panel must include specimens with claimed sample type (
                        *e.g.*
                         saliva samples) representing different genotypes (
                        *i.e.,*
                         wild type, heterozygous). Performance criteria must be predefined. A detailed study protocol must be created in advance of the study and then followed. The “failed quality control” rate must be indicated. It must be clearly documented whether results were generated from clinical specimens, contrived samples, or cell lines. The study results shall state, in a tabular format, the variants tested in the study and the number of replicates for each variant, and what testing conditions were studied (
                        *i.e.,*
                         number of runs, days, instruments, reagent lots, operators, specimens/type, etc). The study must include all nucleic acid extraction steps from the claimed specimen type or matrix, unless a separate extraction study for the claimed sample type is performed. If the device is to be used at more than one laboratory, different laboratories must be included in the precision study (and reproducibility must be evaluated). The percentage of “no calls” or invalid calls, if any, in the study must be provided as a part of the precision (reproducibility) study results.

(C) Analytical specificity data: Data must be generated evaluating the effect on test performance of potential endogenous and exogenous interfering substances relevant to the specimen type, evaluation of cross-reactivity of known cross-reactive alleles and

                        pseudogenes, and assessment of cross-contamination.

(D) Analytical sensitivity data: Data must be generated demonstrating the minimum amount of DNA that will enable the test to perform accurately in 95 percent of runs.

(E) Device stability data: The manufacturer must establish upper and lower limits of input nucleic acid and sample stability that will achieve the claimed accuracy and reproducibility. Data supporting such claims must be described.

(F) Specimen type and matrix comparison data: Specimen type and matrix comparison data must be generated if more than one specimen type or anticoagulant can be tested with the device, including failure rates for the different specimen types.

(iii) If the device is offered over-the-counter, including cases in which the test results are provided direct-to-consumer, the manufacturer must conduct a study that assesses user comprehension of the device's labeling and test process and provide a concise summary of the results of the study. The following items must be included in the user study:

(ii) A statement accurately disclosing the genetic coverage of the test in lay terms, including, as applicable, information on variants not queried by the test, and the proportion of incident disease that is not related to the gene(s) tested. For example, where applicable, the statement would have to include a warning that the test does not or may not detect all genetic variants related to the genetic disease, and that the absence of a variant tested does not rule out the presence of other genetic variants that may be disease-related. Or, where applicable, the statement would have to include a warning that the basis for the disease for which the genetic carrier status is being tested is unknown or believed to be non-heritable in a substantial number of people who have the disease, and that a negative test result cannot rule out the possibility that any offspring may be affected with the disease. The statement would have to include any other warnings needed to accurately convey to consumers the degree to which the test is informative for carrier status.

(iii) For prescription use tests, the following warnings that read:

(A) “The results of this test are intended to be interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or equivalent and should be used in conjunction with other available laboratory and clinical information.”

(B) “This device is not intended for disease diagnosis, prenatal testing of fetuses, risk assessment, prognosis or pre-symptomatic testing, susceptibility testing, or newborn screening.”

(iv) For over-the-counter tests, a statement that reads “This test is not intended to diagnose a disease, or tell you anything about your risk for developing a disease in the future.

### § 866.5950 Genetic health risk assessment system.

(a)
                        *Identification.*
                         A genetic health risk assessment system is a qualitative in vitro molecular diagnostic system used for detecting variants in genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from human specimens that will provide information to users about their genetic risk of developing a disease to inform lifestyle choices and/or conversations with a health care professional. This assessment system is for over-the-counter use. This device does not determine the person's overall risk of developing a disease.

(b)
                        *Classification.*
                         Class II (special controls). The genetic health risk assessment system device, when it has previously received a first-time FDA marketing authorization (
                        *e.g.,*
                         510(k) clearance) for the genetic health risk assessment system (a “one-time FDA reviewed genetic health risk assessment system”), is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in part 807, subpart E, of this chapter subject to the limitations in § 866.9. The device must comply with the following special controls:

(1) The 21 CFR 809.10 compliant labeling and any prepurchase page and test report generated, unless otherwise specified, must include:

(i) A section addressed to users with the following information:

(A) The limiting statement explaining that this test provides genetic risk information based on assessment of specific genetic variants but does not report on a user's entire genetic profile. This test [does not/may not, as appropriate] detect all genetic variants related to a given disease, and the absence of a variant tested does not rule out the presence of other genetic variants that may be related to the disease.

(B) The limiting statement explaining that other companies offering a genetic risk test may be detecting different genetic variants for the same disease, so the user may get different results using a test from a different company.

(C) The limiting statement explaining that other factors such as environmental and lifestyle risk factors may affect the risk of developing a given disease.

(D) The limiting statement explaining that some people may feel anxious about getting genetic test health results. This is normal. If the potential user feels very anxious, such user should speak to his or her doctor or other health care professional prior to collection of a sample for testing. This test is not a substitute for visits to a doctor or other health care professional. Users should consult with their doctor or other health care professional if they have any questions or concerns about the results of their test or their current state of health.

(E) Information about how to obtain access to a genetic counselor, board-certified clinical molecular geneticist, or equivalent health care professional about the results of a user's test.

(F) The limiting statement explaining that this test is not intended to diagnose a disease, tell you anything about your current state of health, or be used to make medical decisions, including whether or not you should take a medication or how much of a medication you should take.

(G) A limiting statement explaining that the laboratory may not be able to process a sample, and a description of the next steps to be taken by the manufacturer and/or the customer, as applicable.

(ii) A section in your 21 CFR 809.10 labeling and any test report generated that is for health care professionals who may receive the test results from

                        their patients with the following information:

(A) The limiting statement explaining that this test is not intended to diagnose a disease, determine medical treatment, or tell the user anything about their current state of health.

(B) The limiting statement explaining that this test is intended to provide users with their genetic information to inform lifestyle decisions and conversations with their doctor or other health care professional.

(C) The limiting statement explaining that any diagnostic or treatment decisions should be based on testing and/or other information that you determine to be appropriate for your patient.

(2) The genetic test must use a sample collection device that is FDA-cleared, -approved, or -classified as 510(k) exempt, with an indication for in vitro diagnostic use in over-the-counter DNA testing.

(3) The device's labeling must include a hyperlink to the manufacturer's public Web site where the manufacturer shall make the information identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section publicly available. The manufacturer's home page, as well as the primary part of the manufacturer's Web site that discusses the device, must provide a hyperlink to the Web page containing this information and must allow unrestricted viewing access. If the device can be purchased from the Web site or testing using the device can be ordered from the Web site, the same information must be found on the Web page for ordering the device or provided in a publicly accessible hyperlink on the Web page for ordering the device. Any changes to the device that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness would require new data or information in support of such changes, which would also have to be posted on the manufacturer's Web site. The information must include:

(i) An index of the material being provided to meet the requirements in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and its location.

(ii) A section that highlights summary information that allows the user to understand how the test works and how to interpret the results of the test. This section must, at a minimum, be written in plain language understandable to a lay user and include:

(A) Consistent explanations of the risk of disease associated with all variants included in the test. If there are different categories of risk, the manufacturer must provide literature references that support the different risk categories. If there will be multiple test reports and multiple variants, the risk categories must be defined similarly among them. For example, “increased risk” must be defined similarly between different test reports and different variant combinations.

(B) Clear context for the user to understand the context in which the cited clinical performance data support the risk reported. This includes, but is not limited to, any risks that are influenced by ethnicity, age, gender, environment, and lifestyle choices.

(C) Materials that explain the main concepts and terminology used in the test that include:

                        *e.g.,*
                         test does not detect all variants related to the disease) and any precautionary information about the test the user should be aware of before purchase. When the test reports the risk of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition for which there are few or no options to prevent, treat, or cure the disease, a user opt-in section must be provided. This opt-in page must be provided for each disease that falls into this category and must provide specific information relevant to each test result. The opt-in page must include:

(
                        *i*

(
                        *ii*
                        ) If professional guidelines are not available, provide a statement that the professional guidelines are not available for these specific gene(s) and variant(s).

(C) The specimen type (
                        *e.g.,*

                        *i.e.,*
                         low sample volume, low DNA concentration, etc.), how users will be notified of a test failure, and the nature of followup actions on a failed test to be taken by the user and the manufacturer.

(I) Specification of the criteria for test result interpretation and reporting.

(J) Information that demonstrates the performance characteristics of the test, including:

(
                        *1*
                        ) Accuracy of study results for each claimed specimen type.

(
                        *i*
                        ) Accuracy of the test shall be evaluated with fresh clinical specimens collected and processed in a manner consistent with the test's instructions for use. If this is impractical, fresh clinical samples may be substituted or supplemented with archived clinical samples. Archived samples shall have been collected previously in accordance with the instructions for use, stored appropriately, and randomly selected. In some limited circumstances, use of contrived samples or human cell line samples may also be appropriate and used as an acceptable alternative. The contrived or human cell line samples shall mimic clinical specimens as much as is feasible and provide an unbiased evaluation of the device accuracy.

(
                        *ii*
                        ) Accuracy must be evaluated by comparison to bidirectional Sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA. Performance criteria for both the comparator method and the device must be predefined and appropriate to the device's intended use. Detailed study protocols must be provided.

(
                        *iii*
                        ) Test specimens must include all genotypes that will be included in the tests and reports. The number of samples tested in the accuracy study for each variant reported must be based on the variant frequency using either the minimum numbers of samples identified in this paragraph or, when determined appropriate and identified by FDA, a minimum number of samples determined using an alternative method. When appropriate, the same samples may be used in testing to demonstrate the accuracy of testing for multiple genotypes by generating sequence information at multiple relevant genetic locations. At least 20 unique samples representing the wild-type genotype must be tested. To test samples that are heterozygous for the reported variant(s), common variants (>0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. Rare variants (≤0.1 percent variant frequency in the relevant population) must be tested with at least three unique samples. To test samples that are homozygous for the reported variant(s), variants with ≥2 percent variant frequency in a relevant population must be tested with at least 20 unique samples. Variants with a frequency in the relevant population <2 percent and ≥0.5 percent must be tested with at least 10 unique samples. Variants with a frequency in the relevant population <0.5 percent must be tested with at least three unique samples. If variants with a frequency of <0.5 percent are not found within the relevant population and homozygous samples are not tested, then the test results for this homozygous rare variant must not be reported to the user.

(
                        *iv*
                        ) Information about the accuracy study shall include the number and type of samples that were compared to bidirectional Sanger sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA. This information must either be reported in tabular format and arranged by clinically relevant variants or reported using another method identified as appropriate by FDA. As an example, for samples with different genotypes DD, Dd, and dd, the following table represents data from the accuracy study presented in tabular format:

(
                        *v*
                        ) The accuracy represents the degrees of agreement between the device results and the comparator results. The accuracy must be evaluated by measuring different percent agreements (PA) of device results with the comparator results and percent of `no calls' or `invalid calls.' Calculate the rate of `no calls' and `invalid calls' for each comparator output as %Inv(DD) = A
                        4
                        /N
                        DD,
                         %Inv(Dd) = B
                        4
                        /N
                        Dd
                        , %Inv(dd) = C
                        4
                        /N
                        dd
                        . If `no calls' or `invalid calls' are required to be retested according to the device instructions for use, the percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be provided. In the table presenting the results of the accuracy study, use only the final results (
                        *i.e.,*
                         after retesting the initial `no calls' or `invalid calls', if required according to the instructions for use). Samples that resulted in a `no call' or `invalid call' after retesting must not be included in the final calculations of agreement. If the percentages of `no calls' or `invalid calls' for each comparator output are similar, combine these estimates as (A
                        4
                         + B
                        4
                         + C
                        4
                        )/(N
                        DD
                         + N
                        Dd
                         + N
                        dd
                        ) and provide a 95 percent two-sided confidence interval. The percent of final `no calls' or `invalid calls' must be clinically acceptable.

(
                        *vi*
                        ) Point estimates of percent agreement for each genotype must be calculated as the number of correct calls for that genotype divided by the number of samples known to contain that genotype excluding `no calls' or `invalid calls'. The calculations must be performed as follows:

(
                        *vii*
                        ) For percent agreements for DD, Dd and dd (PA(DD|DD), PA(Dd|Dd) and PA(dd|dd)) as described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J)(
                        *1*
                        )(
                        *vi*
                        ) of this section, the 95 percent two-sided confidence intervals must be provided. The accuracy point estimates for percent agreements for DD, Dd and dd must be ≥99 percent per reported variant and overall. Any variants that have a point estimate for either PA(DD|DD), PA(Dd|Dd), or PA(dd|dd) of <99 percent compared to bidirectional sequencing or other methods identified as appropriate by FDA must not be incorporated into test claims and reports. Accuracy results generated from clinical specimens versus contrived samples or cell lines must be presented separately. Results must be summarized and presented in tabular format by sample type and by genotype or must be reported using another method identified as appropriate by FDA (see paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J)(
                        *1*
                        )(
                        *iv*
                        ) of this section).

(
                        *viii*
                        ) Information must be reported on the Technical Positive Predictive Value (TPPV) related to the analytical (technical) performance of the device for genotypes in each relevant subpopulation (
                        *e.g.,*
                         ethnicity, gender, age, geographical location, etc.). TPPV is the percentage of individuals with the genotype truly present among individuals whose test reports indicate that this genotype is present. The TPPV depends on the accuracy measures of percent agreements and on the frequency of the genotypes in the subpopulation being studied. The f(DD) is the frequency of DD and f(Dd) is the frequency of Dd in the subpopulation being studied; TPPV must be calculated as described in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(J)(
                        *1*
                        )(
                        *ix*
                        ) through (
                        *xi*
                        ) of this section.

(
                        *ix*
                        ) For variants where the point estimates of PA(DD|DD), PA(Dd|Dd) and PA(dd|dd) are less than 100 percent, use these point estimates in TPPV calculations.

(
                        *x*
                        ) Point estimates of 100 percent in the accuracy study may have high uncertainty about performance of the test in the population. If these variants are measured using highly multiplexed technology, calculate the random error rate for the overall device. The accuracy study described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J) of this section in those cases is more to determine that there is no systematic error in such devices. In those cases, incorporate that rate in the estimation of the percent agreements as calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(J)(
                        *1*
                        )(
                        *vi*
                        ) of this section and include it in TPPV calculations.

(
                        *xi*
                        ) The TPPV for subpopulations with genotype frequencies of f(dd), f(Dd) and f(DD) = 1−f(dd)−f(Dd) in the subpopulation is calculated as:

(
                        *2*
                        ) Precision and reproducibility data must be provided using multiple instruments and multiple operators, on multiple non-consecutive days, and using multiple reagent lots. The sample panel must either include specimens from the claimed sample type (
                        *e.g.,*
                         saliva) representing all genotypes for each variant (
                        *e.g.,*
                         wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous) or, if an alternative panel composition of specimens is identified by FDA as appropriate, a panel composed of those specimens FDA identified as appropriate. A detailed study protocol must be created in advance of the study and must include predetermined acceptance criteria for performance results. The percentage of samples that failed quality control must be indicated (
                        *i.e.,*
                         the total number of sample replicates for which a sequence variant cannot be called (no calls) or that fail sequencing quality control criteria divided by the total number of replicates tested). It must be clearly documented whether results were generated from clinical specimens, contrived samples, or cell lines. The study results shall report the variants tested in the study and the number of replicates for each variant, and what conditions were tested (
                        *i.e.,*
                         number of runs, days, instruments, reagent lots, operators, specimens/type, etc.). Results must be evaluated and presented in tabular format and stratified by study parameter (
                        *e.g.,*
                         by site, instrument(s), reagent lot, operator, and sample variant). The study must include all extraction steps from the claimed specimen type or matrix, unless a separate extraction reproducibility study for the claimed sample type is performed. If the device is to be used at more than one laboratory, different laboratories must be included in the reproducibility study and reproducibility across sites must be evaluated. Any no calls or invalid calls in the study must be listed as a part of the precision and reproducibility study results.

(
                        *3*
                        )
                        *Analytical specificity data:*
                         Data must be provided that evaluates the effect of potential endogenous and exogenous interferents on test performance, including specimen extraction and variant detection.

                        *2*
                        ) Manufacturers must organize information by the specific variant combination as appropriate (
                        *e.g.,*
                         wild type, heterozygous, homozygous, compound heterozygous, hemizygous genotypes). For each variant combination, information must be provided in the clinical performance section to support clinical performance for the risk category (
                        *e.g.,*
                         not at risk, increased risk). For each variant combination, a summary of key results must be provided in tabular format or using another method identified as appropriate by FDA to include the appropriate information regarding variant type, data source, definition of the target condition (
                        *e.g.,*
                         disease), clinical criteria for determining whether the target disease is present or absent, description of subjects with the target disease present and target disease absent (exclusion or inclusion criteria), and technical method for genotyping. When available, information on the effect of the variant on risk must be provided as the risk of a disease (lifetime risk or lifetime incidences) for an individual compared with the general population risk.

When these values are not directly available in published literature, likelihood ratios can be separately calculated along with the 95 percent confidence interval with references to the source data. Note that a minimum requirement for the presence of the variant's effect on the risk is that a corresponding LR is statistically higher than 1 (a lower bound of 95 percent two-sided confidence interval is larger than 1). It means that the post-test risk is statistically higher than the pretest risk (an observed value of the difference between the post-test and pretest risks).
