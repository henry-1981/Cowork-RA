### § 807.28 Updating device listing information.

(a) Updating of device listing information is required if an additional establishment begins to engage in any of the activities described in § 807.3(d) with respect to a listed device, such as manufacturing, developing specifications, repackaging, relabeling, or otherwise processing the device. Updating of the listing is also required if an establishment begins performing another activity on or to the device, or ceases to perform an activity on or to the device that had previously been identified on the device listing.

(b) An owner or operator shall create a new device listing using the FDA electronic device registration and listing system:

(1) If introducing into commercial distribution an exempt device identified with a product code that is not currently listed by the owner or operator; or

(2) If introducing into commercial distribution a non-exempt device with an FDA premarket submission number that is not currently listed by the owner or operator.

(c) All device listings for foreign establishments must be submitted before the device may be imported or offered for import into the United States.

(d) An owner or operator who discontinues commercial distribution of a device shall discontinue the device listing using the FDA electronic device registration and listing system. A device listing is considered discontinued if:

(1) All devices under an exempt product code have been discontinued or

(2) All devices associated with an FDA premarket submission number have been discontinued.

(e) If commercial distribution of a discontinued device is resumed, the owner or operator must reactivate the previously-discontinued listing using the electronic device registration and listing system. Any changes to the listing information for the product that is the subject of the listing such as a new establishment, new activity, or new proprietary name must be made using the electronic device registration and listing system at the time the listing is reactivated.

(f) FDA will assign one listing number for all devices exempt from premarket notification requirements under a single product code. For products not exempt from premarket notification requirements, a single listing number will be assigned by FDA for each FDA premarket submission number.

### § 807.34 Summary of requirements for owners or operators granted a waiver from submitting required information electronically.

(a) For initial registration and listing, owners or operators who have been granted a waiver from electronic filing using the procedures set forth in § 807.21(b) must send a letter containing all of the registration and listing information described in §§ 807.22, 807.25 (and § 807.26 when such information is requested by FDA), at the times described in § 807.22, to: The Imports and Registration and Listing Team, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, Office of Regulatory Programs, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, Rm. 1432, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.

(b) As specified in § 807.22(b)(1) and (b)(3), all owners or operators shall update their establishment registration and device listings annually during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on December 31 of each fiscal year.

(c) Failure to submit any of the required information on time, as specified in § 807.22(a) and (b), will put the establishment in a “failed to register” or “failed to list” status as applicable.

The establishment will not be considered active and the establishment registration and device listing information may not appear on the FDA Web site until the required information is submitted to and processed by FDA.

### § 807.35 Notification of registrant.

(a) The Food and Drug Administration will assign each device establishment a registration number after verifying the initial establishment registration information that has been submitted. The owner or operator of the establishment will also be assigned an identifying number. Both numbers will be sent to the official correspondent by email, or by postal mail if the owner or operator has been granted a waiver from the requirement to file registration and listing information electronically.

(b) Owners or operators of device establishments who also manufacture or process biological products (including devices licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) or drug products at the same establishment must also register and list those products under part 607 or part 207 of this chapter, as appropriate. Registration and listing for human blood and blood products, devices licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, and licensed biological products used in the manufacture of a device licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, are subject to part 607 of this chapter; registration and listing for all other drug products (including other biological products that are also regulated as drug products) are subject to part 207 of this chapter.

(c) Although establishment registration and device listing are required to

                        engage in the device activities described in § 807.20, validation of registration and the assignment of a device listing number in itself does not establish that the holder of the registration is legally qualified to deal in such devices and does not represent a determination by the Food and Drug Administration as to the status of any device.

> Citation: [69 FR 11312, Mar. 10, 2004, as amended at 77 FR 45943, Aug. 2, 2012]

### § 807.37 Public availability of establishment registration and device listing information.

(a) Establishment registration and device listing information is available for public inspection in accordance with section 510(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and will be posted on the FDA website, with the exception of the information identified in paragraph (b) of this section. Requests for information by persons who do not have access to the internet should be directed to the Imports and Registration and Listing Team, Division of Regulatory Programs 2, Office of Regulatory Programs, Office of Product Evaluation and Quality, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, Rm.1432, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002. In addition, there will be available for inspection at each of the Food and Drug Administration district offices the same information for firms within the geographical area of such district offices. Upon request, verification of a registration number or location of a registered establishment will be provided.

(b) The following listing information will not be available for public inspection or posted on the FDA Web site:

(1) For contract manufacturers, contract sterilizers, and private label manufacturers, the proprietary or brand name(s) under which a device is marketed and the FDA-assigned premarket submission number, if this information would reveal a confidential business relationship;

(2) FDA-assigned listing numbers.

### § 807.39 Misbranding by reference to establishment registration or to registration number.

Registration of a device establishment or assignment of a registration number does not in any way denote approval of the establishment or its products. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval because of registration or possession of a registration number is misleading and constitutes misbranding.

## Subpart C—Procedures for Foreign Device Establishments

### § 807.40 Establishment registration and device listing for foreign establishments importing or offering for import devices into the United States.

### § 807.92 Content and format of a 510(k) summary.

(a) A 510(k) summary shall be in sufficient detail to provide an understanding of the basis for a determination of substantial equivalence. FDA will accept summaries as well as amendments thereto until such time as FDA issues a determination of substantial equivalence. All 510(k) summaries shall contain the following information:

(1) The submitter's name, address, telephone number, a contact person, and the date the summary was prepared;

(2) The name of the device, including the trade or proprietary name if applicable, the common or usual name, and the classification name, if known;

(3) An identification of the legally marketed device to which the submitter claims equivalence. A legally marketed device to which a new device may be compared for a determination regarding substantial equivalence is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, or a device which has been reclassified from class III to class II or I (the predicate), or a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) premarket notification process;

(4) A description of the device that is the subject of the premarket notification submission, such as might be found in the labeling or promotional material for the device, including an explanation of how the device functions, the scientific concepts that form the basis for the device, and the significant physical and performance characteristics of the device, such as device design, material used, and physical properties;

(5) A statement of the intended use of the device that is the subject of the premarket notification submission, including a general description of the diseases or conditions that the device will diagnose, treat, prevent, cure, or mitigate, including a description, where appropriate, of the patient population for which the device is intended. If the indication statements are different from those of the legally marketed device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the 510(k) summary shall contain an explanation as to why the differences are not critical to the intended therapeutic, diagnostic, prosthetic, or surgical use of the device, and why the differences do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device when used as labeled; and

(6) If the device has the same technological characteristics (i.e., design, material, chemical composition, energy source) as the predicate device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a summary of the technological characteristics of the new device in comparison to those of the predicate device. If the device has different technological characteristics from the predicate device, a summary of how the technological characteristics of the device compare to a legally marketed device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(b) 510(k) summaries for those premarket submissions in which a determination of substantial equivalence is also based on an assessment of performance data shall contain the following information:

(1) A brief discussion of the nonclinical tests submitted, referenced, or relied on in the premarket notification submission for a determination of substantial equivalence;

(2) A brief discussion of the clinical tests submitted, referenced, or relied on in the premarket notification submission for a determination of substantial equivalence. This discussion shall include, where applicable, a description of the subjects upon whom the device was tested, a discussion of the safety or effectiveness data obtained from the testing, with specific reference to adverse effects and complications, and any other information from the clinical testing relevant to a determination of substantial equivalence; and

(3) The conclusions drawn from the nonclinical and clinical tests that demonstrate that the device is as safe, as effective, and performs as well as or better than the legally marketed device identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(c) The summary should be in a separate section of the submission, beginning on a new page and ending on a page not shared with any other section of the premarket notification submission, and should be clearly identified as a “510(k) summary.”

(d) Any other information reasonably deemed necessary by the agency.

### § 807.95 Confidentiality of information.

(a) The Food and Drug Administration will disclose publicly whether there exists a premarket notification submission under this part:

(1) Where the device is on the market, i.e., introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution;

(2) Where the person submitting the premarket notification submission has disclosed, through advertising or any other manner, his intent to market the device to scientists, market analysts, exporters, or other individuals who are not employees of, or paid consultants to, the establishment and who are not in an advertising or law firm pursuant to commercial arrangements with appropriate safeguards for secrecy; or

(3) Where the device is not on the market and the intent to market the device has not been so disclosed, except where the submission is subject to an exception under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

(b) The Food and Drug Administration will not disclose publicly the existence of a premarket notification submission for a device that is not on the market and where the intent to market the device has not been disclosed for 90 days from the date of receipt of the submission, if:

(1) The person submitting the premarket notification submission requests in the submission that the Food and Drug Administration hold as confidential commercial information the intent to market the device and submits a certification to the Commissioner:

(i) That the person considers his intent to market the device to be confidential commercial information;

(ii) That neither the person nor, to the best of his knowledge, anyone else, has disclosed through advertising or any other manner, his intent to market the device to scientists, market analysts, exporters, or other individuals, except employees of, or paid consultants to, the establishment or individuals in an advertising or law firm pursuant to commercial arrangements with appropriate safeguards for secrecy;

(iii) That the person will immediately notify the Food and Drug Administration if he discloses the intent to market the device to anyone, except employees of, or paid consultants to, the establishment or individuals in an advertising or law firm pursuant to commercial arrangements with appropriate safeguards for secrecy;

(iv) That the person has taken precautions to protect the confidentiality of the intent to market the device; and

(v) That the person understands that the submission to the government of false information is prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 21 U.S.C. 331(q); and

(2) The Commissioner agrees that the intent to market the device is confidential commercial information.

(c) Where the Commissioner determines that the person has complied with the procedures described in paragraph (b) of this section with respect to a device that is not on the market and where the intent to market the device has not been disclosed, and the Commissioner agrees that the intent to market the device is confidential commercial information, the Commissioner will not disclose the existence of the submission for 90 days from the date of its receipt by the agency. In addition, the Commissioner will continue not to disclose the existence of such a submission for the device for an additional time when any of the following occurs:

(1) The Commissioner requests in writing additional information regarding the device pursuant to § 807.87(h), in which case the Commissioner will not disclose the existence of the submission until 90 days after the Food and Drug Administration's receipt of a complete premarket notification submission;

(2) The Commissioner determines that the device intended to be introduced is a class III device and cannot be marketed without premarket approval or reclassification, in which case the Commissioner will not disclose the existence of the submission unless a petition for reclassification is submitted under section 513(f)(2) of the act and its existence can be disclosed under § 860.5(d) of this chapter; or

(d) FDA will make a 510(k) summary of the safety and effectiveness data available to the public within 30 days of the issuance of a determination that the device is substantially equivalent

                        to another device. Accordingly, even when a 510(k) submitter has complied with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, confidentiality for a premarket notification submission cannot be granted beyond 30 days after FDA issues a determination of equivalency.

(e) Data or information submitted with, or incorporated by reference in, a premarket notification submission (other than safety and effectiveness data that have not been disclosed to the public) shall be available for disclosure by the Food and Drug Administration when the intent to market the device is no longer confidential in accordance with this section, unless exempt from public disclosure in accordance with part 20 of this chapter. Upon final classification, data and information relating to safety and effectiveness of a device classified in class I (general controls) or class II (performance standards) shall be available for public disclosure. Data and information relating to safety and effectiveness of a device classified in class III (premarket approval) that have not been released to the public shall be retained as confidential unless such data and information become available for release to the public under § 860.5(d) or other provisions of this chapter.

### § 807.97 Misbranding by reference to premarket notification.

Submission of a premarket notification in accordance with this subpart, and a subsequent determination by the Commissioner that the device intended for introduction into commercial distribution is substantially equivalent to a device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or is substantially equivalent to a device introduced into commercial distribution after May 28, 1976, that has subsequently been reclassified into class I or II, does not in any way denote official approval of the device. Any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device because of complying with the premarket notification regulations is misleading and constitutes misbranding.

### § 807.100 FDA action on a premarket notification.

(a) After review of a premarket notification, FDA will:

(1) Issue an order declaring the device to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device;

(2) Issue an order declaring the device to be not substantially equivalent to any legally marketed predicate device;

(3) Request additional information; or

(4) Withhold the decision until a certification or disclosure statement is submitted to FDA under part 54 of this chapter.

(5) Advise the applicant that the premarket notification is not required. Until the applicant receives an order declaring a device substantially equivalent, the applicant may not proceed to market the device.

(b) FDA will determine that a device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device using the following criteria:

(1) The device has the same intended use as the predicate device; and

(2) The device:

(i) Has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device; or

(ii)(A) Has different technological characteristics, such as a significant change in the materials, design, energy source, or other features of the device from those of the predicate device;

(B) The data submitted establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device and contains information, including clinical data if deemed necessary by the Commissioner, that demonstrates that the device is as safe and as effective as a legally marketed device; and

(C) Does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device.

(3) The predicate device has not been removed from the market at the initiative of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or has not been determined to be misbranded or adulterated by a judicial order.
