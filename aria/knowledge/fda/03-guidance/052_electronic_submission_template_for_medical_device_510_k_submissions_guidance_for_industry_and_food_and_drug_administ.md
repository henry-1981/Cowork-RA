Electronic Submission Template for
Medical Device 510(k) Submissions
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing this guidance document to
introduce submitters of premarket notification (510(k)) submissions to the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to
the current resources and associated content developed and made publicly available to support
510(k) electronic submissions to FDA. This guidance is intended to represent one of several
steps in meeting FDA’s commitment to the development of electronic submission templates to
serve as guided submission preparation tools for industry to improve submission consistency and
enhance efficiency in the review process. 1 This guidance facilitates the implementation of the
FDA’s mandate under section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C
Act), amended by section 207 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) (Pub. L. 11552 2) to provide further standards for the submission by electronic format, a timetable for
establishment of these further standards, and criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the
requirements.
FDA’s guidance document “Providing Regulatory Submissions for Medical Devices in
Electronic Format — Submissions Under Section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act” 3 (hereafter referred to as the “745A(b) device parent guidance”) provides a
process for the development of templates to facilitate the preparation, submission, and review of
regulatory submissions for medical devices solely in electronic format. As described in the
745A(b) device parent guidance, FDA plans to implement the requirements of section
745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act with individual guidances specifying the formats for specific

submissions and corresponding timetables for implementation. This guidance provides such
information for 510(k) electronic submissions solely in electronic format.
In section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, Congress granted explicit statutory authorization to
FDA to specify in guidance the electronic submissions requirement by providing standards,
criteria for waivers and exemptions, and a timetable for such submissions. Accordingly, to the
extent that this document provides such requirements under section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C
Act, indicated by the use of mandatory words, such as must or required, this guidance is not
subject to the usual restrictions in section 701(h) of the FD&C Act and FDA’s good guidance
practices (GGPs) regulations, such as the requirement that guidances not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. See 21 CFR 10.115(d).
This document provides guidance on FDA’s interpretation of the statutory requirement for
electronic submissions solely in electronic format. Therefore, to the extent that this guidance
describes recommendations that are not “standards,” “timetable,” or “criteria for waivers” and
“exemptions” under section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, this document does not create or
confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public, but does
represent the Agency’s current thinking on this topic. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to
discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff listed on the title page of this guidance.
To comply with the GGP regulations and make sure that regulated entities and the public
understand that guidance documents are nonbinding, FDA guidances ordinarily contain standard
language explaining that guidances should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. This guidance contains both binding and
nonbinding provisions. Insofar as this guidance provides “standards,” “timetable,” or “criteria for
waivers” and “exemptions” pursuant to section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, it has binding effect.
For those provisions not identified as binding, the contents of this document do not have the
force and effect of law. This document, other than the binding provisions, is intended only to
provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance
documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance
means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Background
Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, amended by section 207 of FDARA, requires that presubmissions and submissions for devices under sections 510(k), 513(f)(2)(A), 515(c), 515(d),
515(f), 520(g), 520(m), or 564 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act,
and any supplements to such pre-submissions or submissions, including appeals of those
submissions, be submitted in electronic format specified by FDA beginning on such date as
specified by FDA in final guidance. It also mandates that FDA issue draft guidance not later than
October 1, 2019, and a final guidance not later than 1 year after the close of the public comment
period, providing for further standards for the submission by electronic format, a timetable for

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
establishment of these further standards, and criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the
requirements. 4
In addition, in the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV) Commitment
Letter 5 from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress, FDA committed to
developing “electronic submission templates that will serve as guided submission preparation
tools for industry to improve submission consistency and enhance efficiency in the review
process” and “[by] FY [fiscal year] 2020, the Agency will issue a draft guidance document on
the use of the electronic submission templates.” In addition, the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter
states that “[n]o later than 12 months after the close of the public comment period, the Agency
will issue a final guidance.” The 745A(b) device parent guidance was intended to satisfy the final
guidance documents referenced in section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act and the MDUFA IV
Commitment Letter.
In September 2018, as a first step in the transition to 510(k) electronic submissions solely in
electronic format, FDA launched the “Quality in 510(k) Review Program Pilot” 6 for the
submission of Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s for certain devices using the eSubmitter
electronic submission template. The eSubmitter template was developed by FDA as an optional
free tool consisting of a collection of questions, text, logic, and prompts that guides a user
through preparation of a 510(k) submission in electronic format. Upon completion, the resulting
submission package would contain the structured and unstructured data of a complete 510(k) 7
submission. The pilot helped facilitate the production of well-organized submissions, however,
as of May 30, 2021, FDA concluded the Quality in 510(k) Review Program Pilot, along with use
of the eSubmitter electronic submission template for preparation of a 510(k) submission in
electronic format.
In February 2020, to support the next step in transition to 510(k) electronic submissions solely in
electronic format, CDRH developed and has piloted the use of the electronic Submission
Template And Resource (eSTAR) electronic submission template through launching the eSTAR
Pilot Program. 8 CBER began piloting the use of eSTAR in June 2022. 9 Based on the experience
with the eSubmitter software, FDA developed eSTAR to include similar benefits as eSubmitter,
See section 745A(b)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act.
See 163 CONG. REC. S4729-S4736 (daily ed. August 2, 2017) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee
Reauthorization), also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/102699/download.

Information on the Quality in 510(k) Review Program Pilot is available at: https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/premarket-notification-510k/510k-program-pilots#quik.
7
The 510(k) regulations at 21 CFR 807.87 to 807.100 provide greater detail regarding the specific information that
each premarket notification submission must contain. For example, the submission must include proposed labeling
(21 CFR 807.87(e)), a statement regarding the similarities and differences between the device and others of
comparable type (21 CFR 807.87(f)), supporting data (21 CFR 807.87(f) and 807.100(b)(2)(ii)(B)), and FDA may
request any additional information necessary to determine whether the device is substantially equivalent when the
information provided is insufficient to enable such a determination (21 CFR 807.87(m)).

as well as additional benefits. Similar to eSubmitter, eSTAR includes the following benefits:
automation (e.g., form construction, autofilling); content and structure that is complementary to
CDRH internal review templates; integration of multiple resources (e.g., guidances, databases);
guided construction for each submission section; automatic verification; and it is free to use. In
contrast to eSubmitter, eSTAR incorporates additional benefits, including: use of a familiar
software application, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and not a proprietary application that requires training;
more dynamic functionality, such as support for images and messages with hyperlinks;
supporting the creation of Supplements and certain Amendments; mobile device compatibility
for certain dynamic PDF features; ability for the submitter to add comments to the PDF after
flattening the dynamic version, for the purposes of helping submission preparation; and that
eSTAR content and logic fully mirrors the internal templates used by reviewers to review
devices, therefore supporting completeness of the submission content and facilitating more
efficient review. During the transition time up to the point when 510(k) electronic submissions
will be required (see Section VI.B below), anyone can voluntarily use eSTAR for 510(k)
submissions. As described below, eSTAR is the only electronic submission template currently
available to enable 510(k) electronic submissions.

Scope
This guidance describes the technical standards associated with preparation of the electronic
submission template for 510(k)s that enable submission of the 510(k) electronic submission
solely in electronic format. The electronic submission template includes the information and
guided prompts FDA believes will best facilitate the collection and assembly of the necessary
elements of a ‘complete’ submission, as required by regulation or essential to FDA’s substantive
review of the 510(k) submission. This guidance is not intended to specify the user-interface and
detailed content of the eSTAR, but instead is limited to establishing the 510(k) electronic format
and standards for complying with section 745(A)(b)(3) of the FD&C Act. FDA intends to
implement new versions of eSTAR as relevant policies change. FDA also has an ongoing
process to collect and consider public comments and stakeholder feedback, which is described on
FDA’s website. 10

Significant Terminology
For the purpose of this document the following significant terminology is described:
eCopy: An electronic copy is a duplicate device submission in electronic format of the
previously required paper copy submission sent to FDA. 11 An electronic copy is not considered
to be an electronic submission, as defined below.

See FDA’s website on the eSTAR program at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-yourdevice/voluntary-estar-program.

eSubmitter: A freely available FDA software program 12 that contains electronic submission
templates, including the eSubmitter electronic submission template that was available for
preparing 510(k) eSubmissions from September 2018, through May 2021, and is no longer
available for use to prepare 510(k) submissions.
Electronic Submission (eSubmission): The submission package produced by an electronic
submission template 13 that contains the data of a ‘complete’ submission.
eSTAR (electronic Submission Template And Resource): An electronic submission
template 14 built within a structured dynamic PDF that guides a user through construction of an
eSubmission. eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission template that is currently
available to facilitate the preparation of 510(k) submissions as eSubmissions. For simplicity, the
electronic submission created with this electronic submission template is often referred to as an
eSTAR.
Electronic submission template: A guided submission preparation tool for industry. An
electronic submission template walks industry through the relevant contents and components for
the respective premarket submission type and device to facilitate submission preparation and
enhance consistency, quality, and efficiency in the premarket review process. 15
Structured data: Data and content that are captured in the fields, dropdown boxes, checkboxes,
etc., within the electronic submission template.
Unstructured data: Data and content that are submitted as attachments to the electronic
submission template.

Current Electronic Submission Template Structure,
Format, and Use
The electronic submission template, eSTAR, is the only currently available electronic
submission template at this time to facilitate the preparation of 510(k) electronic submissions.
eSTAR consists of a collection of questions, text, logic, and prompts within a template that
guides a user through construction of a ‘complete’ 510(k) submission. eSTAR is highly
automated, includes integrated databases (e.g., FDA product codes, 16 FDA-recognized voluntary
consensus standards 17), and includes targeted questions designed to collect specific data and
information from the submitter. eSTAR also includes applicable links to regulations, relevant
guidances, and other resources for the submitter’s reference. Finally, eSTAR is structured to

See 84 FR 68334 and the FDA guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions” at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-devicesubmissions.

collect and assemble content in the 510(k) submission as an electronic submission that closely
follows the content of the “SMART” 510(k) review memo template 18 used by CDRH reviewers.
Given that an electronic submission properly prepared with an electronic submission template
should represent a complete submission, 19 eSTAR submissions are not anticipated to undergo a
refuse to accept (RTA) process. The CDRH Portal will automatically verify that the eSTAR is
complete, and therefore we do not expect to receive incomplete 510(k) eSTARs. However, FDA
intends to employ a virus scanning and technical screening process for an eSTAR. A technical
screening process is a process for verifying that eSTAR responses accurately describe the
device(s) (e.g., there are, in fact, no tissue contacting components if indicated as such) and that
there is at least one relevant attachment per each applicable attachment-type question (e.g., a
Software Description attachment is included in response to the Software Description question if
software is applicable to the submission). The technical screening process is anticipated to occur
within 15 days of FDA receiving the 510(k) eSTAR. FDA intends to only begin the technical
screening for 510(k) electronic submissions where the appropriate user fee has been paid. If the
eSTAR does not pass technical screening, FDA will notify the submitter via email 20 and identify
the incomplete information, and the 510(k) will be placed and remain on hold until a complete
replacement eSTAR is submitted to FDA. If a replacement eSTAR is not received within 180
days of the date of technical screening deficiency notification, FDA will consider the 510(k) to
be withdrawn and the submission will be closed in the system. The technical screening review
time does not impact the review clock for files that pass the technical screening. For a
submission that passes technical screening, the review clock starts on the day the submission was
received by FDA.

A.

Structure of the current 510(k) Electronic Submission
Template

In Table 1 below, is a high-level overview of the structure of the current electronic submission
template for 510(k)s, 21 including a summary of the anticipated submission content provided by
the submitter in each section: 22

For more information on the “SMART” 510(k) review memo template, please see “FDA Has Taken Steps to
Strengthen The 510(k) Program” available at https://www.fda.gov/media/118500/download or “Improve 510(k)
Submission Quality” available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fdatrack/view/track_project.cfm?
program=cdrh&id=CDRH-ODE-Improve-510k-Submission-Quality.
19
After a submitter completes all necessary sections in their eSTAR file correctly, the status message at the top of
the PDF will indicate “eSTAR Complete” to represent a complete submission.
20
For additional information about email communications with CBER, please see the “SOPP 8119: Use of Email for
Regulatory Communications,” available at https://www.fda.gov/media/108992/download.
21
As indicated above, FDA intends to employ a technical screening process to verify that electronic submission
template responses accurately describe the device.
22
Throughout completion of the eSTAR, submitters can add attachments as unstructured data, including but not
limited to documents, PDFs, images, and videos that the submitter believes are pertinent to the review of their
device. In addition, eSTAR will prompt for any documents that are needed. For example, when the use of clinical
testing to support the submission is affirmatively indicated, eSTAR will automatically prompt for the attachment of
clinical testing documents and any applicable financial certifications or disclosure statements. These attachments
appear within the applicable bookmark of the eSTAR PDF when viewed by the submitter or FDA.

Inclusion of responses to Additional Information requests. 48

Electronic Submission Template Waivers, Exemptions,
and Timing
All 510(k) submissions, including original submissions for Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated
510(k)s, and subsequent Supplements and Amendments (amendments include add-to-files and
appeals), 49 and any other subsequent submissions to an original submission unless exempted
below in Section VI.A of this guidance, are required to be submitted as electronic submissions. A
510(k) submission that is not provided as an electronic submission as described in Section V
above, will not be received unless an exemption from the electronic submission requirements or
a waiver with respect to that submission applies.

While the responses to FDA additional information requests are included in this section, submitters should include
the actual changes to the information to be reviewed by FDA in the respective section of eSTAR (e.g., updated draft
labeling should be included in the Labeling section).

References to supplements and amendments are generally meant to capture the various submission types that
typically occur in association with a 510(k) file that is undergoing review or has received a final decision.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Above, FDA identified that 510(k) submissions are subject to electronic submission
requirements. However, section 745A(b)(2) of the FD&C Act allows for FDA to set forth criteria
for exemptions and waivers from electronic submission requirements. FDA has identified such
criteria for 510(k)s below.
Exemptions
At this time, FDA is exempting the following 510(k) submissions/information from the 510(k)
electronic submission requirements:
• Interactive review responses; 50
• Amendments: 51
• Appeals/requests for supervisory review; 52
• Substantive summary requests;
• Change in correspondent amendments;
• Amendments after final decision (i.e., add-to-files); and
• Withdrawal requests. 53
Waivers
At this time, FDA has not identified any particular circumstances appropriate for a waiver of the
510(k) electronic submission requirements and does not intend to grant requests for waiver.
Given the widespread availability of software to enable use of the current 510(k) eSTAR PDF
(available to download on FDA’s website), all submitters should have the ability to provide a
510(k) eSTAR. 54

B.

When Electronic Submissions Will Be Required

As described in the 745A(b) device parent guidance, this guidance specifies the corresponding
timetable(s) for implementation of 510(k) electronic submissions. FDA is identifying October 1,
2023 as the date on which the 510(k) electronic submission requirements will take effect. This
If the reviewer used interactive review via phone or email, the submitter should reply to the reviewer via email
with the requested attachments and additional information. Other responses to requests for additional information
must be submitted in eSTAR (see “Amendment/Additional Information (AI) Response” category in Table 1 above).
51
These 510(k) amendments remain subject to any applicable eCopy requirements. For more information, see the
FDA guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions” at https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions.
52
Section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to also require that appeals be submitted solely in such
electronic format as specified by the Agency in guidance. Once FDA develops such a format, FDA intends to update
this guidance to specify any further standards for the submission of 510(k) appeals by electronic format, the
timetable for establishment of such further standards, and any criteria for a waiver from such requirements.
53
As 510(k) supplements, submission withdrawal requests remain subject to any applicable eCopy requirements.
For more information, see the FDA guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions” at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-devicesubmissions. FDA recommends that withdrawal requests be submitted electronically via email or to the CDRH
Portal.
54
While use of the eSTAR will be required starting on October 1, 2023, there are currently known technical reasons
that preclude electronic submission via the CDRH Portal and impacted submissions will need to be mailed to the
CDRH Document Control Center (DCC). For a list of the known technical reasons, please refer to FDA’s CDRH
Portal webpage, available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/industry-medical-devices/send-and-trackmedical-device-premarket-submissions-online-cdrh-portal

date includes a transition period of a minimum of one year prior to the requirement that all
510(k) submissions be provided as electronic submissions. During the transition period, eSTARs
may be used voluntarily for 510(k) submissions. At this time, eSTAR is the only electronic
submission template available to prepare a complete 510(k) electronic submission using the
guided prompts for the collection of structured and unstructured data. As instructed at the
website for the eSTAR Program (under the heading, “How to prepare a submission using
eSTAR” 55), the electronic submission must be submitted using FDA’s electronic portal when
submitted to CDRH, or via FDA’s Electronic Submission Gateway 56 when submitted to CBER.
FDA only intends to accept 510(k) submissions saved to a form of electronic storage media and
mailed to FDA if they are received by FDA before October 1, 2023.
