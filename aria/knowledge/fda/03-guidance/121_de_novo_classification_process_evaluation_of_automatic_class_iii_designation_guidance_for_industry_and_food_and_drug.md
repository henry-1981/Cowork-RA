De Novo Classification Process
(Evaluation of Automatic Class III
Designation)
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on the process for the submission and
review of a De Novo classification request (hereafter a “De Novo request”) under section
513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), also known as the De
Novo classification process. This process provides a pathway to class I or class II classification
for medical devices for which general controls or general and special controls provide a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is no legally marketed
predicate device.
Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to FDA staff from the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research (CBER) involved in the review and decision-making aspects of the De Novo
classification process. “You” and “your” refers to the submitter of a De Novo request and/or
related materials.
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind
the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A device may be classified in class III and be subject to premarket approval (PMA) via several
different regulatory vehicles. In accordance with the criteria at section 513(a)(1)(C) of the
FD&C Act, FDA may promulgate a regulation classifying, or issue an order reclassifying,1 a
device type into class III based on the risks posed by the device and the inability of general and
special controls to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
All particular devices of such a type are considered to be in class III and such devices are not
eligible for the De Novo classification process.
Alternatively, devices of a new type that FDA has not previously classified based on the criteria
at section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act are “automatically” or “statutorily” classified into class III
by operation of section 513(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, regardless of the level of risk they pose or
the ability of general and special controls to assure safety and effectiveness. This is because, by
definition, a new type of device would not be within a type that was on the market before the
1976 Medical Device Amendments or that has since been classified into class I or class II. Thus,
there would be no available predicate device.
This second scenario is what Congress targeted when it enacted section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C
Act as part of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA). The
process created by this provision, which was referred to in FDAMA as the Evaluation of
Automatic Class III Designation, will be referred to as the “De Novo classification process”2
throughout this guidance document. Congress included this section to limit unnecessary
expenditure of FDA and industry resources that could occur if devices for which general controls
or general and special controls provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness were
subject to premarket approval under section 515 of the FD&C Act. Section 513(f)(2) of the
FD&C Act has allowed manufacturers to submit a De Novo request to FDA for devices
“automatically” classified into Class III by operation of section 513(f)(1). As enacted by
FDAMA, in order to submit a De Novo request, a device first had to be found not substantially
equivalent (NSE) to legally-marketed predicate devices through a premarket notification
(510(k)). The 21st Century Cures Act3 removed a requirement that a De Novo request be
submitted within 30 days of receiving an NSE determination.4
Section 513(f)(2) was modified by section 607 of FDASIA, which created an alternative
mechanism for submitting a De Novo request that does not require that a device be reviewed first
under a 510(k) and found NSE prior to submission of a De Novo request. If a person believes
their device is appropriate for classification into Class I or Class II and determines, based on

1

Prior to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) enacted in 2012, FDA
reclassified devices under section 513(e) of the FD&C Act through rulemaking; FDASIA changed this to an order
process.
2
The process has been termed “De Novo” because it requires the agency to evaluate novel devices anew, in
accordance with the criteria at section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.
3
On December 13, 2016, as part of the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), Congress revised § 513(f)(2)(i) of
the FD&C Act.

currently available information, there is no legally marketed predicate device, they may submit a
De Novo request without a preceding 510(k) and NSE (hereafter “Direct De Novo”).
On October 5, 2021, FDA issued a final rule on the De Novo Classification Process.5 This final
rule will add new regulations at 21 CFR Part 860, Subpart D--De Novo Classification that
describe the procedures and criteria FDA will use in assessing whether a request for an
evaluation of automatic class III designation (De Novo classification request or De Novo
request) contains the information necessary to permit a substantive review. FDA is updating this
guidance to reflect the De Novo final rule. This guidance provides recommendations for
interactions with FDA related to the De Novo classification process, including what information
to submit when seeking a path to market via the De Novo classification process. This guidance
replaces “New Section 513(f)(2) – Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation, Guidance for
Industry and CDRH Staff,” dated February 19, 1998.

III. The De Novo Classification Process
In accordance with section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, you may submit a De Novo request for
FDA to make a classification determination for the device according to the criteria at section
513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act. The De Novo request must include a description of the device and
detailed information and reasons for any recommended classification (see section
513(f)(2)(A)(v) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 860.220). FDA must make a classification
determination for the device that is the subject of the De Novo request by written order within
120 days of receipt of the request (see section 513(f)(2)(A)(iii) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR
860.240).
If the requester demonstrates that the criteria at section 513(a)(1)(A) or (B) of the FD&C Act are
met, we will grant the De Novo request, in which case the specific device and device type is
classified in class I or class II. The granting of the De Novo request allows the device to be
marketed immediately, creates a classification regulation for devices of this type, and permits the
device to serve as a predicate device. We will publish a notice in the Federal Register
announcing the classification and the controls necessary to provide reasonable assurance of
safety and effectiveness. Note that the classification, including any special controls, is effective
on the date the order letter is issued granting the De Novo request. If the De Novo request is
declined, the device remains in class III and may not be marketed, unless the device is found
substantially equivalent to an existing legally marketed class I, class II, or preamendments
device, the device is reclassified under section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act, a PMA is approved,
or a new De Novo request is granted.

A. When the De Novo Classification Process May and May
Not Be Used
FDA will review De Novo requests for devices that are not within a device type that has been
classified under the criteria at section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 CFR 860.200). This
includes devices that do not fall within any existing classification regulation, where the De Novo
5

https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-21677

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
requester either determines that there is no predicate device (21 CFR 860.200(b)(2)) or has
received an NSE determination on a 510(k) submission (21 CFR 860.200(b)(1)). If the device is
of a type for which there is an existing classification regulation or one or more approved PMAs,
the appropriate mechanism for classification into class I or II would be reclassification under
section 513(e) or section 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act.6
For devices that have already undergone 510(k) review, FDA will consider a De Novo request if
the device has been determined to be NSE due to: (1) the lack of an identifiable predicate device,
(2) a new intended use, or (3) different technological characteristics that raise different questions
of safety and effectiveness. Devices that have been found to be NSE due solely to performance
data that is inadequate to demonstrate substantial equivalence (SE) would generally be ineligible
for the De Novo classification process.7
In considering whether to submit a De Novo request, the device should appear, based on what is
known about the device, to meet the statutory standards for classification into class I or class II
under section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, i.e., general controls or general and special controls
would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device (see 21 CFR
860.200(a)). Furthermore, you should sufficiently understand and be able to explain all of the
probable risks to health associated with use of the device that are known or should reasonably be
known to you and the proposed mitigations, including general controls and, if applicable, special
controls for each risk8 (21 CFR 860.220(a)(9)).

B.

Submitting a Pre-Submission for a De Novo Request

A Pre-Submission (Pre-Sub) is not required in order to obtain FDA review of a De Novo request,
but it is a useful way for requesters to obtain early feedback from FDA and is therefore strongly
recommended prior to the submission of a De Novo request, especially for devices we have not
previously reviewed under a 510(k). A Pre-Sub allows FDA to provide feedback on whether a
device may be eligible for the De Novo classification process, including whether a potential
predicate device exists, and/or to advise you on the documentation needed in a subsequent De
Novo request. The primary advantage of a Pre-Sub is that it provides an opportunity to obtain
our preliminary perspective on the likely regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness, as well as feedback on the evidence, including non-clinical
and/or clinical data, that will likely be necessary to support the De Novo request. By obtaining
this feedback, you can optimize your resources in collecting the safety and effectiveness

evidence needed to support a De Novo request, without performing additional unnecessary tests.
This should also facilitate the review of a subsequent De Novo request.
A Pre-Sub may be submitted early in the development process for a device; however, we believe
it is most useful after you have identified the proposed intended use and key aspects of the
device design sufficient to permit a meaningful discussion. A Pre-Sub related to a future
anticipated De Novo request should contain sufficient information to enable us to provide
guidance on the test methods and protocols that should be used for the collection of non-clinical
and/or clinical data. De Novo Pre-Subs will be handled in accordance with our normal presubmission process. For information on Pre-Subs, please see the FDA guidance document
entitled “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program
and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff” (Q-Sub Guidance)].9
In addition to the recommended content for all Pre-Subs (device description, proposed intended
use/indications for use, previous submissions, etc.), we suggest that a Pre-Sub prior to
submission of a De Novo request also include:
·
·

·

Proposed class (I or II). Describe why you believe general or general and special controls
are adequate to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
The searches of FDA public databases and other resources, including search terms, used
to establish that no legally marketed device and no classification regulation for the same
device type exists. Provide a list of regulations, 510(k)s, PMAs, and/or product codes
that may be relevant to the subject device. You should also provide a rationale for why
the subject device does not fit within and/or is different from any identified classification
regulations, 510(k)s, PMAs, and/or product codes, based on available information.
Specific questions regarding review issues relevant to a planned De Novo request.
Insofar as they are necessary in order for us to consider the specific questions, the PreSub should also include the following:
o Each identified risk to health associated with the device and the reason for each
risk (tracing back to risk analysis, clinical testing, etc.). Briefly describe any
ongoing and/or planned protocols/studies that need to be completed to collect the
necessary data to establish the device’s risk profile.
o Information regarding the safety and effectiveness of the device. Cite the types of
valid scientific evidence you anticipate providing in your De Novo request,
including types of data/studies relating to the device’s safety and effectiveness.
Briefly describe any ongoing and/or planned protocols/studies that need to be
completed to collect the necessary safety and effectiveness data.
o Protocols for non-clinical and clinical studies (if applicable), including how they
will address the risks you anticipate and targeted performance levels that will
demonstrate that general controls or general and special controls are sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
o The proposed mitigation measure(s)/control(s) for each risk, based on the best
available information at the time of the submission. Highlight which mitigations
are general controls and which are special controls. Provide details in the Pre-Sub

on each recommended mitigation measure (e.g., specific testing required,
labeling).
Examples of questions to pose to FDA in a De Novo Pre-Sub include:
· Based on the device description, its intended use/indications for use, and/or technological
characteristics, and information on the search performed for legally marketed devices,
does FDA believe the device is eligible for De Novo classification?
· Are there other risks, in addition to those identified in the Pre-Sub, given the indications
for use for the device?
· If applicable, are there controls that should be considered to provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device?
· Are the non-clinical study protocols sufficient to allow the collection of data from which
conclusions about device safety and/or effectiveness can be drawn? For example:
o Is the identified level of concern the appropriate level of concern for the device
software?10
o What, if any, additional biocompatibility and/or sterility testing would be
appropriate?
· If clinical data are needed, are the proposed study design and selected control group
appropriate?
After you submit your Pre-Sub, we may ask you for clarification or to provide more information.
You may also request meetings with us. For more information on Pre-Subs and meetings with
FDA staff, please see the Q-Sub Guidance.

C.

Submitting a De Novo Request for FDA Review

A De Novo request may be submitted with or without a preceding 510(k) premarket notification.
The success of a De Novo request that is filed without a preceding 510(k) or without a Pre-Sub
will depend more on how well you search for a potential predicate device, identify the risks to
health and special controls (if applicable), and provide adequate valid scientific evidence to
support granting the De Novo request.
The De Novo review process is outlined in Attachment 1.
In preparing to submit a De Novo request, we suggest you review publicly posted information,
including classification orders, for recently granted CDRH De Novo requests, available on our
website at https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cdrh-transparency/evaluation-automatic-class-iiidesignation-de-novo-summaries and
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/denovo.cfm or the CBER website
(see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/substantially-equivalent-510k-deviceinformation/evaluation-automatic-class-iii-designation-de-novo-summaries-cber).

Contained in Medical Devices” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/guidance-content-premarket-submissions-software-contained-medical-devices)

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The required content for a De Novo request can be found at 21 CFR 860.220. This includes, for
example, the device’s regulatory history (21 CFR 860.220(a)(3)), indications for use (21 CFR
860.220(a)(5)), and device description (21 CFR 860.220(a)(6)), among other requirements. The
De Novo request should include a discussion demonstrating that the data and information in the
De Novo request constitute valid scientific evidence within the meaning of § 860.7(c) and
pursuant to § 860.7, when subject to general controls, or general and special controls, the
probable benefit to health from use of the device outweighs any probable injury or illness from
such use (21 CFR 860.220(a)(14)).
For De Novo requests, sponsors must submit at least one valid electronic copy (eCopy). See
section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act and FDA’s eCopy guidance, “eCopy Program for Medical
Device Submissions.”11 De Novo requests (and subsequent submissions, as applicable)
submitted without valid eCopies will be placed on hold and the review clock will not start until a
valid eCopy is received.

D.

Address for De Novo Requests

For devices regulated by CDRH, De Novo requests should be submitted to the current mailing
address displayed on the website https://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress.
For devices regulated by CBER, De Novo requests should be submitted to to the current mailing
address displayed on the website https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-biologics-evaluationand-research-cber/regulatory-submissions-electronic-and-paper.

IV. FDA Review Process for De Novo Requests
A.

510(k) Followed by De Novo Request

If, at the end of our review of a 510(k), we determine that a device is NSE due to lack of a
predicate, a new intended use or different types of technology issues, and if we believe general
controls or general and special controls may provide reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness, we may indicate in the NSE letter that the product may be appropriate for the De
Novo classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. Inclusion of this language
within an NSE letter does not indicate that sufficient information currently exists within the
510(k) submission to support a successful De Novo request, but simply indicates that given the
risk profile of the device, it seems reasonable that De Novo classification may be appropriate.

B.

De Novo Request – Acceptance Review

Once a De Novo request is received, whether or not it is preceded by a 510(k), FDA intends to
conduct an acceptance review to make a threshold determination that the De Novo request
contains the information necessary to permit a substantive review (Section IV.C below). The
acceptance review process, including the criteria for whether a De Novo request should be
11

https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-devicesubmissions

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
refused or accepted for review, is described in 21 CFR 860.230. FDA also explains the required
elements, as well as additional recommendations for preparing your De Novo request, in the
FDA guidance document “Acceptance Review for De Novo Classification Requests.”12
If your De Novo request is not accepted for review, the review clock stops and we will notify
you that it is on hold pending receipt of additional information. In the event you do not provide
the requested information within 180 calendar days, we will consider your De Novo request to be
withdrawn (21 CFR 860.250(a)(2)).
Within 15 calendar days after a De Novo request is received by FDA, FDA will notify the
requester whether the De Novo request has been accepted (21 CFR 860.230(a)). If FDA fails to
complete the acceptance review within 15 days, FDA will accept the De Novo request for review
and notify the requester (21 CFR 860.230(b)).

C.

De Novo Request – Substantive Review

After FDA has accepted the De Novo request for review, FDA will begin the substantive review
of the De Novo request. As part of FDA’s substantive review, FDA intends to conduct a
classification review of legally marketed device types. FDA intends to analyze whether an
existing legally marketed device of the same type exists (e.g., whether your device likely falls
under an existing class II classification regulation), including whether a predicate was
established through the De Novo classification process. If a likely predicate device exists or
your device falls under a class III classification regulation, your product is not eligible for De
Novo classification and your De Novo request will be declined (section 513(f)(2)(A)(iv) and 21
CFR 860.260(c)(5)-(6)). FDA will inform you of the deficiencies in your De Novo request,
including each applicable ground for declining the De Novo request (21 CFR 860.260(d)). If the
device falls within a class III classification regulation or there is one or more approved PMAs for
the same type of device and FDA believes general and/or special controls are adequate to
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, the appropriate mechanism for
classification into class I or II would be reclassification under section 513(e) or 513(f)(3) of the
FD&C Act. If no existing legally marketed device of the same type is identified, we will
continue our review.
If the De Novo request is missing information and/or data necessary to determine whether
general controls or general and special controls can provide reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness, we may issue an additional information (AI) letter or request information via
interactive review (21 CFR 860.240(b)). Issuance of an AI letter stops the review clock, and
once you provide a complete response, the clock will resume and review will continue. If you
fail to provide a complete response within 180 calendar days of the date of the AI request, we
will consider the De Novo request to be withdrawn (21 CFR 860.250(a)(1)). If a De Novo
request is withdrawn due to failure to submit adequate information, a new De Novo request is
required in order to reinitiate review of the device under the De Novo classification process.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A De Novo request may be declined for a number of reasons (21 CFR 860.260(c)).13 If a De
Novo request is declined, we will issue a written order (21 CFR 860.260(b)) to the requester
identifying the reasons, including lack of performance data, which warrant declining the De
Novo request (21 CFR 860.260(d)) and the device remains in class III and may not be legally
marketed (section 513(f)(2)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act). You may either submit an application for
premarket approval (PMA) under section 515 of the FD&C Act or collect additional information
to address the issues and submit a new De Novo request that includes the additional information.
FDA will issue to the requester an order granting a De Novo request if none of the reasons in 21
CFR 860.260(c) for declining the De Novo request applies (21 CFR 860.260(a)). If a De Novo
request is granted, we will issue you a written order granting the De Novo request and
identifying the classification of the device (either class I or class II). For class II devices, we will
also identify the special controls. Effective on the date of the granting order, the requester may
immediately begin marketing the device subject to the general controls and any identified special
controls, and the device may be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions as
appropriate.
Within 30 days of granting the De Novo request, we will then publish a final order in the Federal
Register providing public notice of the decision (21 CFR 860.260(a)(2)), which will result in
codification of the device’s identification, classification, and applicable requirements in Title 21
of the Code of Federal Regulations (device classifications are at parts 862 – 892).
A De Novo request for a device that receives marketing authorization via the De Novo
classification process is referred to as having been “granted” (similar to “PMA approved” and
“510(k) cleared”). If a De Novo request is granted, we intend to make the written order to the
submitter granting the De Novo request and a summary of our review of the De Novo request
available on the CDRH website (see https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/cdrhtransparency/evaluation-automatic-class-iii-designation-de-novo-summaries and
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/denovo.cfm) or the CBER website
(see https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/substantially-equivalent-510k-deviceinformation/evaluation-automatic-class-iii-designation-de-novo-summaries-cber). Once a De
Novo request is granted, then the subject device may be used as a predicate for any future 510(k)

This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C.

An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.
The OMB control number for this information collection is 0910-0844 (To find the
