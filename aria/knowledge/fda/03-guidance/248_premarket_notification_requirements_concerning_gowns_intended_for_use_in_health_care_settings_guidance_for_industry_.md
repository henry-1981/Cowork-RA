Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for implementing this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this guidance to describe the Agency’s
premarket regulatory requirements and the performance testing needed to support liquid
barrier claims for gowns intended for use in health care settings. This guidance is being
issued in light of the public health importance of personal protective equipment in health care
settings and the recognition that terminology used to describe gowns has evolved, including
by FDA, industry, the standards community, and health care professionals.
FDA believes this guidance is important to promote and protect public health by describing
premarket regulatory requirements pertaining to gowns regulated under 21 CFR 878.4040.
Specifically, it will describe for industry the premarket regulatory requirements and data
requirements for marketing of gowns with claims that they meet certain liquid barrier
performance standards established by the American National Standards Institute, Inc., and
the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (ANSI/AAMI) and other
similar terminology associated with these claims.
FDA recognizes that differences in terminology used to describe the functional performance
of various kinds of gowns intended to provide liquid barrier protection in health care settings
have developed among FDA, industry, the standards community, and health care
professionals. While this guidance document will not resolve existing differences in

3

terminology, it is intended to clarify FDA’s premarket notification requirements for gowns
making liquid barrier protection claims intended for use in health care settings.
This document is intended to supplement the 1993 guidance document, Guidance on
Premarket Notification [510(K)] Submissions for Surgical Gowns and Surgical Drapes
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocu
ments/ucm081305.pdf).
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see
the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
FDA issued a final rule1 on June 24, 1988, defining “surgical apparel” under 21 CFR
878.4040 as:
devices that are intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical
procedures to protect both the surgical patient and the operating room personnel
from transfer of microorganisms, bodily fluids, and particulate material.
Examples include surgical caps, hoods, masks, gowns, operating room shoes and
shoe covers, and isolation masks and gowns. Surgical suits and dresses,
commonly known as scrub suits, are excluded.
Under this 1988 final rule, surgical gowns and surgical masks were classified as Class II
subject to premarket review under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act, and surgical apparel other than surgical gowns and surgical masks, were classified as
Class I also subject to 510(k) premarket review requirements. A manufacturer of any gown
that met the intended use of surgical apparel under 21 CFR 878.4040 was required to submit
a 510(k) notification before the device could be introduced into interstate commerce.
On January 14, 2000, FDA issued a final rule2 to designate as exempt from premarket
notification (510(k)) requirements surgical apparel other than surgical gowns and surgical
masks, subject to the limitations of exemptions under 21 CFR 878.9, which includes
requiring a premarket notification for devices intended for a use different from the intended
use of a legally marketed device in that generic type of device. Specifically, the
classification regulation was modified to read:

53 FR 23874 (June 24, 1988).
65 FR 2318(January 14, 2000).

21 CFR 878.4040 Surgical apparel.
(a) Identification. Surgical apparel are devices that are intended to be worn by
operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both the surgical
patient and the operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms, body
fluids, and particulate material. Examples include surgical caps, hoods, masks,
gowns, operating room shoes and shoe covers, and isolation masks and gowns.
Surgical suits and dresses, commonly known as scrub suits, are excluded.
(b) Classification. (1) Class II (special controls) for surgical gowns and surgical
masks.
(2) Class I (general controls) for surgical apparel other than surgical gowns and
surgical masks. The class I device is exempt from the premarket notification
procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter subject to § 878.9.
At the time of the 2000 final rule, the Agency viewed “surgical gowns” as gowns intended
for use during surgical procedures and/or for use to provide moderate to high level barrier
protection and “isolation gowns” as gowns intended to provide minimal or low levels of
barrier protection. For the purposes of this guidance, isolation gowns that are intended for
use to provide moderate to high level barrier protection are referred to as “surgical isolation
gowns.”
Since the original 1988 final rule, a number of terms have been used to refer to gowns
intended for use in health care settings including, but not limited to, surgical gowns, isolation
gowns, surgical isolation gowns, nonsurgical gowns, cover gowns, comfort gowns,
procedural gowns, and operating room gowns. Although the Agency has not defined the
other terms by regulation or guidance, in its 1993 guidance, the Agency referred to the
regulation definition of the term “surgical gowns” which was “surgical apparel worn by
operating room personnel during surgical procedures to protect both the surgical patient and
the operating room personnel from transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate
material.”3 In addition, the Agency has reviewed certain gowns based on the intended use of
those gowns as surgical gowns and was able to determine substantial equivalence to the other
surgical gowns classified under 21 CFR 878.4040(b)(1), based on assessments of liquid
chemical permeation, fluid penetration, viral penetration and other appropriate scientific
analysis.
In 2004, FDA recognized the consensus standard ANSI/AAMI PB70:2003, Liquid barrier
performance and classification of protective apparel and drapes intended for use in health
care facilities.4 ANSI/AAMI PB70 utilized new terminology for barrier performance of
gowns. This terminology described and assessed the barrier protection levels of gowns and

other protective apparel intended for use in health care facilities, by specifying test methods
and performance results necessary to verify and validate the newly defined levels of barrier
protection. Although FDA has recognized ANSI/AAMI PB70’s barrier performance levels
(i.e., Levels 1-4) and the associated test methods, the definitions and terminology used in this
standard are inconsistent with FDA’s historical definitions of these terms. Thus, the
differences in regulatory and standards terminology have added confusion in the marketplace as it relates to regulatory requirements for gowns with liquid barrier protection claims.
Specifically, ANSI/AAMI PB70 defines an “isolation gown” as an “[i]tem of protective
apparel used to protect health care personnel and patients from the transfer of
microorganisms and body fluids in patient isolation situations,” and “surgical gowns” as
“devices that are intended to be worn by operating room personnel during surgical
procedures to protect both the surgical patient and the operating room personnel from the
transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate matter [material].’”5 Under 21
CFR 878.4040 and the Agency’s regulatory approach, however, both surgical gowns and
isolation gowns are “surgical apparel,” and surgical isolation gowns are considered to be
class II “surgical gowns” because they are intended for use as such based on their moderate
to high barrier protection claims.
The Agency has considered gowns that claim moderate to high barrier protection, such as
ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4, to be a higher risk device than those that claim minimal or
low levels of barrier protection, such as ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2. Thus, FDA
considers both level-of-protection claims and the terminology used (e.g., isolation,
nonsurgical, procedural, operating room) because of such devices’ substantial importance in
preventing impairment of human health. The level of protection claimed is particularly
relevant in light of the inconsistent terminology used, and that, at the time of the 2000 final
rule, surgical apparel other than surgical gowns and surgical masks were associated with low
levels of barrier protection. The purpose of this guidance, therefore, is to clarify and describe
the premarket regulatory requirements pertaining to gowns regulated under 21 CFR 878.4040
and the performance testing needed to support liquid barrier claims for gowns intended for
use in health care settings.

III. Scope
The scope of this document is limited to gowns making liquid barrier protection claims and
intended for use in health care settings. For the purposes of this guidance document:
Minimal or Low Barrier protection6 refers to:
· ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 protection or equivalent; or
· ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 2 protection or equivalent.
5

See, respectively, sections 3.13 and 3.31 of the ANSI/AAMI PB 70:2012 (citing 21 CFR 878.4040).
Prior to the existence of ANSI/AAMI PB70, minimal or low barrier protection claims included, but were not
limited to, “Protective Apparel,” “Effective Barrier,” “Fluid-Resistant,” “Water Resistant,” and “Splash
Resistant.” The Agency discourages the use of these claims because they lack specificity with respect to
performance characteristics and test methods. ANSI/AAMI PB70 was developed to address these issues and
provide clarity to the user community regarding the levels of liquid barrier protection provided by a gown.

Moderate or High Barrier protection7 refers to:
· ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 protection or equivalent; or
· ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 4 protection or equivalent
This guidance document does not address the data needed to support gowns making claims
of providing protection against specific organisms, chemical agents, chemotherapy drugs or
those making specific disease prevention claims (such as “protects against Ebola”). In
addition, this guidance does not address the data needed to support the addition of
antimicrobial agents in gowns. Manufacturers desiring to market gowns with these types of
claims and/or design features are encouraged to utilize the pre-submission process8 to obtain
further guidance from the Agency prior to the submission of a premarket submission.

IV. Policy
The Agency is describing its approach to determining which gowns are Class I and which are
Class II. Specifically, consistent with 21 CFR 878.4040(b), a gown that is not intended for
use as a surgical gown is a Class I exempt device that is not subject to premarket notification
requirements, and a gown that is intended for use as a “surgical gown” is a class II device
subject to premarket notification. The determination of the intended use of a device is
factually driven and generally made on a case-by-case basis. In determining whether a gown
is intended for use as a “surgical gown” under 21 CFR 878.4040(b)(1) that is class II subject
to premarket notification, the Agency considers a number of factors, including, but not
limited to, the terminology used, level of barrier protection claimed, and the device’s
technological characteristics.
a) Class I exempt gowns
For purposes of determining classification of a gown under 21 CFR 878.4040(b), the
Agency’s regulatory approach is that a gown falling within this regulation is not a “surgical
gown” if all of the following factors exist:
· it is labeled as a gown other than a surgical gown (e.g., isolation gown);
· it is not described in its labeling as a surgical gown; and
· if it has statements relating to barrier protection, such statements are for only minimal
or low barrier protection.

7

Prior to the existence of ANSI/AAMI PB70, moderate or high barrier protection claims included, but were not
limited to, “Prevents Strikethrough,” “Highest Fluid Protection,” “Impervious,” “Highest Level of Protection,”
and “Impermeable.” The Agency discourages the use of these claims because they lack specificity with respect
to performance characteristics and test methods. ANSI/AAMI PB70 was developed to address these issues and
provide clarity to the user community regarding the levels of liquid barrier protection provided by a gown.

In that case, the labeling or descriptions of the device, along with any minimal or low barrier
protection (or no barrier protection) claims, show that its intended use is as a nonsurgical
gown. Such a gown is considered class I, exempt from premarket notification under 21 CFR
878.4040(b)(2), subject to the limitations in 21 CFR 878.9, as surgical apparel other than
surgical gowns and surgical masks. The device is class I exempt because the general
controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the
device, under section 513(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act. The general controls include, but are
not limited to, the quality system regulation (21 CFR part 820), registration and listing (21
CFR part 807), medical device reporting (21 CFR part 803), and labeling (21 CFR part 801).
b) Class II gowns
For purposes of determining classification of a gown under 21 CFR 878.4040(b), the
Agency’s regulatory approach is that a gown falling within this regulation is a “surgical
gown” if:
· it is labeled as such;
· it is described as such in its labeling;
· it has statements relating to moderate or high level barrier protection; and/or
· it has statements that it is intended for use during sterile procedures.
In that case, the terminology (e.g., “surgical gown” or “surgical isolation gown”); description
in the gown’s labeling (e.g., “this gown is suitable as a surgical gown”); and/or Level 3 or 4
barrier protection claims show that the gown is intended for use as a “surgical gown” (which
includes “surgical isolation gown”). Such gowns are considered class II devices under 21
CFR 878.4040(b)(1) and are subject to premarket notification. The Agency considers gowns
that claim moderate to high level barrier protection, such as ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 3 or 4,
to be a higher risk device than those that claim minimal or low levels of barrier protection,
such as ANSI/AAMI PB70 Level 1 or 2, because of such devices’ substantial importance in
preventing impairment of human health, and, thus, the Agency considers such gowns to be
“surgical gowns” within the meaning of 21 CFR 878.4040(b)(1).
Statements in the labeling that a gown is a surgical gown (which includes “surgical isolation
gown”) provide strong evidence that the gown is a “surgical gown,” as that term is used in 21
CFR 878.4040(b)(1), even if there are claims that the gown only provides minimal or low
barrier protection.
When a premarket notification (510(k)) for a “surgical gown” (which includes “surgical
isolation gown”) falling within this section is submitted for FDA review, the 510(k) should
contain the following information in addition to the items identified in FDA’s Guidance on
Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Surgical Gowns and Surgical Drapes
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocu
ments/ucm081305.pdf ):
1. Evidence that the gown complies with the claimed barrier performance criteria of the
currently FDA-recognized version of ANSI/AAMI PB70, or equivalent standard.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

ANSI/AAMI PB70 establishes barrier performance and documentation requirements
for gowns and their materials.
2. Performance test data to demonstrate that the gown is an effective barrier in
accordance with ANSI/AAMI PB70 barrier performance specifications. For both
single use and reusable gowns, barrier performance testing should be completed on
the final, finished, pre-shipment gown, at the end of the stated shelf life of the gown.
If the gown is intended to be reusable, barrier performance testing should also be
performed at the end of the labeled use-life (maximum reprocessing cycles).
3. Representative engineering drawing(s), schematics, illustrations and/or figures of the
gown that are clear, legible, labeled with the barrier protection levels of the gown,
and include dimensions and the location of the critical and non-critical zones.
4. Sample labeling that clearly identifies the level of liquid barrier protection per
ANSI/AAMI PB70.
5. Sample labeling that includes the direction(s) for use and indication(s) for use.
Current Agency policy is to require the submission of a premarket notification (510(k)) for
manufacturers proposing to begin the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate
commerce for commercial distribution a gown falling within section IV.b. The Agency does
not intend to enforce compliance with premarket notification requirements for gowns
marketed on or before June 26, 2015 that fall within section IV.b. and do not have an existing
510(k) clearance when manufacturers: 1) submit a 510(k) for the gown to the Agency within
60 days of publication of the final guidance; 2) have a 510(k) submission for the gown
accepted by the Agency for review within 75 days of publication of the final guidance;9 and
3) obtain 510(k) clearance for the gown within 180 days of publication of the final guidance.
Manufacturers can bundle multiple gowns within a single 510(k) submission.10 FDA intends
to work interactively with manufacturers, as appropriate, during the review process. If a
manufacturer has complied with steps 1 and 2 above, but has not received clearance for its
device within 180 days because the submission remains under active review, the
manufacturer should contact FDA to discuss whether the Agency intends to continue to defer
enforcement under these circumstances.
