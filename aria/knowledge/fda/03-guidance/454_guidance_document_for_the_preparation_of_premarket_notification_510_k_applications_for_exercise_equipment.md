This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s Good
Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both. This guidance will be
updated in the next revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

PREFACE
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to the sponsors of premarket notifications
[510(k)'s] for restorative devices. This document is intended to assist the sponsors in organizing
and providing the essential information that should be submitted to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for review.
This guidance is based on the Restorative Devices Branch's (REDB's) identification of specific
criteria necessary to conduct an adequate evaluation of a 510(k) for the purpose of determining
substantial equivalence for physical medicine/restorative devices. The objective of this document is
to delineate to the device manufacturer important administrative, descriptive, and scientific
information that should be included in a 510(k) for a restorative device. Individual 510(k)
submissions may require additional information pertinent to each specific device. The suggestions
and recommendations included in the guidance reflect the minimal requirements that would allow
an evaluation of the device as determined by REDB. While the use of this document in the
preparation of a 510(k) premarket notification will not ensure FDA clearance of a device, following
the guidance will ensure that sufficient basic information is available to initiate a substantive
review.
Note that the guidance document is a living document. It will be periodically revised as scientific
knowledge and regulations change.

Is currently being reviewed for different indications by the same or different branch
within ODE; or

c.

Has been previously cleared by the FDA for different indications.

DEVICE DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION
Intended Use
Identify the specific intended use(s), including the specific diagnostic and/or therapeutic
indications, for the subject device and the predicate device. The new device must have the same
intended medical uses as those specified for the predicate device, to the extent that the changes do
not alter the therapeutic or diagnostic effect and do not affect safety and effectiveness. These
page 4

intended uses must be consistent with the descriptions of intended medical uses contained within
the CFR section that is applicable to the device and must identify the specific medical conditions
for which the device is indicated. If the indication differs, you must provide a justification as to
how the change(s) do not affect safety and effectiveness. If special labeling claims are sought,
information must be provided to support these claims.
Identify all available and intended motions, and the muscles and/or joints to be exercised. These
intended uses should be clearly identified in the labeling.
Note that FDA regulates exercise equipment only if the equipment is intended to be used for
medical purposes, such as to redevelop muscles or restore motion to joints or for use as an adjunct
treatment for obesity. FDA does not regulate exercise equipment intended only for general physical
conditioning and/or for the development of athletic abilities in individuals who lack physical
impairment. Therefore, it is not necessary to notify FDA of an intent to market a device if it will
not be labeled or promoted for medical uses. However, FDA will regulate the equipment and may
require premarket notification if any promotional material appears which makes medical claims
after marketing begins.
Device Description
1.

Provide a written device description (e.g., mechanical, electrical, materials considerations),
specifically including any measuring systems/components, describing how they interface
the device, and any new features of the device.

2.

Identify the relevant dimensions of the device and all possible configurations.

3.

Also, identify all exercise functions, and if applicable, all measuring functions of the new
device.

4.

Provide engineering drawings and/or photographs of the device, and provide circuit
diagrams for novel or complex electrical components or systems. Also provide illustrations
or photographs and written descriptions of the predicate device.

5.

Provide a hazards analysis for the new device, identifying the device's safety features.

6.

For each intended motion, the range of motion through which the intended muscles and/or
joints are exercised and the range of forces exerted should be provided. For powered
exercise equipment, the speed by which the intended muscles and or joints will be exercised
should also be provided.
If available, provide this information for the predicate device (for documentation of
substantial equivalence as discussed in Substantial Equivalence section below).
Performance data must be provided for all clinical measuring functions.
methodology and conclusions of the testing should be described.

Materials
Identify the specific materials for each component, any additional processing that may affect the
material properties and the voluntary standards with which the device materials will conform.
Labeling
1.

Provide draft or sample package labeling, package inserts, including complete operator's
and maintenance instructions for the new device.

2.

Include copies of promotional materials for the new and predicate devices.

3.

Depending on the device's indication, the following prescription statement may be required
(both on the device itself and in the operator's manual, and in any advertising and/or
promotional materials) according to 21 CFR 801.109:
"Caution: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a practitioner
licensed by the law of the State in which he/she practices."

Additional Information
1.

If your device uses controlling software, you should refer to the FDA document entitled
"Reviewer Guidance for Computer Controlled Medical Devices Undergoing 510(k)
Review", dated August 29, 1991. As described in this document, you should determine and
justify the level of concern you believe to be associated with your device's software.
Further, in accordance with this guidance, provide documentation, commensurate with the
level of concern, including: 1) System and Software Requirements & Design, 2) Software
Development, 3) Verification & Validation (V&V), 4) Test Results and Analysis, and 5)
Certification. You must also provide a hazards analysis for the software, identifying safety
requirements for the software and system.

2.

Please be advised that if you provide only the minimum information highlighted in the
"510(k) Review Software Documentation Matrix", this may not assure adequate
information to make a determination about the software. In documenting V&V procedures
(all levels of concern), you should provide pass/fail and test completion criteria, and a
system level functional test plan. You should refer to the sample questions provided in this
guidance and to other sources, as necessary. You are encouraged to submit a summary of
the development life cycle in terms of how it assures traceability of the safety concerns
throughout development, and how the testing and analyses adequately demonstrate that the
software meets its functional and safety requirements. Overall, the software documentation
provided should allow for an adequate assessment of the quality of the software design and
development, and of the level of software quality control.
Copies of this guidance document can be obtained from the Division of Small
Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA), at 800-638-2041.

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC):
You should be aware that the issue of EMC may need to be addressed in future applications
for this type of device. Such a requirement will be announced in advance.

SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE INFORMATION
1.

The legally marketed predicate device with which the subject device is to be compared for
the determination of substantial equivalence must be identified. Evidence must be provided
that the device was placed into interstate commerce for other than research uses or as part of
a plant-to-plant transfer and was actually labeled and promoted for the intended use to
which the submitter of the premarket notification is claiming substantial equivalence. This
may be accomplished by providing copies of the firm's advertisements, catalog pages, or
other promotional material dated prior to May 28, 1976 and shipping documents such as
invoices, bills of lading, receipts showing the interstate transit of the device (for other
information which can be used to prove Pre-Amendment status contact DSMA).
Alternatively, the 510(k) number(s) of the predicate device(s) may be identified. The
510(k) number may be obtained from the Electronic Docket (ED), an automated retrieval
system of the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA), which provides
medical device regulations, FDA talk papers and press releases, device evaluation guidance,
and the listing of all approved 510(k)s sorted by applicant name. This 510(k) information is
located under the Product Clearance Main Menu Item # 12. Dial (301) 594-4802 or (800)
252-1366. For more guidance on how to assess this information, contact DSMA. Call toll
free (800) 638-2041, (301) 443-6597, or fax (301) 443-8818.

2.

The submission should include a description of all significant similarities and differences
between the new and predicate devices. To facilitate review, the submission should contain
a summary table which compares the two devices in terms of the intended medical uses,
functions and physical characteristics, including safety characteristics. In addition, the
submission should provide a written summary as to the substantial equivalence of the new
device compared to the predicate in terms of safety and effectiveness considerations.

PREMARKET NOTIFICATION EXEMPT DEVICES
Medical devices described within 21 CFR 890.5350 (Exercise Component) and 21 CFR 890.5370
(Nonmeasuring Exercise Equipment) are classified into Class I (general controls) and are exempt
from the premarket notification procedures in Subpart E of Part 807 of 21 CFR. FDA therefore
does not require 510(k) premarket notifications for these devices. Nevertheless, they are still
subject to general controls.
Persons requesting FDA to determine whether it is necessary to submit a 510(k) premarket
notification for exercise equipment that might be regulated under 21 CFR 890.5350 or 21 CFR
890.5370 should supply:
1.

A complete description of the device.

2.

Provide engineering drawings and/or photographs of the device, and provide circuit
diagrams for novel or complex electrical components or systems. Also provide illustrations
or photographs and written descriptions of the predicate device.

3.

Identify the specific intended use(s), including the specific diagnostic indications, for the
subject device and the predicate device. The new device must have the same intended
medical uses as those specified for the predicate device, to the extent that the changes do not
alter the therapeutic or diagnostic effect and do not affect safety and effectiveness. These
intended uses must be consistent with the descriptions of intended medical uses contained
within the CFR section that is applicable to the device and must identify the specific
medical conditions for which the device is indicated. If the indication differs, you must
provide a justification as to how the change(s) do not affect safety and effectiveness. If
special labeling claims are sought, information must be provided to support these claims.
These intended uses must be consistent with the descriptions of intended medical uses
contained within the CFR section that is applicable to the device and must identify the
specific medical conditions for which the device is indicated.
Note that FDA regulates exercise equipment only if the equipment is intended to be used for
medical purposes, such as to redevelop muscles or restore motion to joints or for use as an
adjunct treatment for obesity. FDA does not regulate exercise equipment intended only for
general physical conditioning and/or for the development of athletic abilities in individuals
who lack physical impairment. Therefore, it is not necessary to notify FDA of an intent to
market a device if it will not be labeled or promoted for medical uses. However, FDA will
regulate the equipment and may require premarket notification if any promotional material
appears which makes medical claims after marketing begins.

4.

Provide a copy of the labeling and promotional material for the device. All medical claims
in this material must be consistent with the medical purposes described in the cited CFR
section. Also, provide a copy of promotional material for a similar marketed device.
