Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Pediatric Expertise for Advisory Panels
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
The purpose of this guidance is to describe internal office procedures to ensure that an
advisory panel reviewing a premarket submission or other regula tory documents includes
or consults with one or more pediatric experts, when appropriate. These premarket
submissions may include premarket approval applications (PMA) or premarket
notification submissions (510(k)). These regulatory documents may include general or
device-specific guidance documents.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical
device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and
legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply
with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be
less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send
your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the
CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including
ways to contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/

Background
On October 26, 2002, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002
(MDUFMA) was signed into law. MDUFMA amended section 515(c) of the Federal,
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), Application for Premarket Approval to read, in
part: “Where appropriate, the Secretary shall ensure that such panel includes, or consults
with, one or more pediatric experts.” This is one of several provisions in MDUFMA
intended to promote the development of safe and effective pediatric devices and to
protect this vulnerable patient population during the course of clinical trials involving
such products. This guidance puts procedures in place to implement this new provision.
A collateral guidance document, which we are currently developing, will address the
other related provisions of MDUFMA.

Pediatric Populations
For purposes of this guidance, we are defining pediatric subpopulations as shown below.
Pediatric Subpopulation

Approximate Age Range

newborn

birth to 1 month of age

infant

1 month to 2 years of age

child

2 to 12 years of age

adolescent

12-21 years of age

Although the upper age limit used to define the pediatric population varies among
experts, including adolescents up to the age of 21 is consistent with the definition found
in several well-known sources.1,2,3 The Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH) believes this age range is generally appropriate for the use of medical devices in
pediatric subpopulations, but recognizes that there may be cases in which the pediatric
populatio n should be defined differently, depending upon the type of device.

Circumstances Requiring Pediatric Expertise
Although MDUFMA amended the premarket approval section of the statute, CDRH will
include pediatric expertise on an advisory panel, when appropriate, for all types of premarket
submissions (i.e., PMA, product development protocol (PDP), 510(k), humanitarian device
exemption (HDE), de novo applications, and investigational device exemption (IDE)). We
will also include pediatric expertise on advisory panels when we seek panel
recommendations for other documents, e.g., device-specific guidance documents,
reclassification petitions. Therefore, the executive secretary of the panel, following
consultation with the team leader and division management, should arrange for a pediatric
expert to be consulted or included in panel deliberations for any of the above submissions or
documents when:

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

There are labeled indications for use that include a pediatric subpopulation or there is
a reasonable likelihood that the device would be used in a pediatric subpopulation for
the labeled indication;

•

There are data in the study that include a pediatric subpopulation;

•

There is a reasonable likelihood that the data from the study in the adult population
may be used by the applicant to subsequently support a pediatric indication;

•

There is a need for advisory panel input on a study design and/or protocol for use of
the device in the pediatric population; or

•

There is a reasonable likelihood that the advisory panel may discuss the potential use
of the device in the pediatric population.

Advisory Panel Readiness
The Medical Device Advisory Committee will have a cadre of special government
employees (SGEs) with pediatric expertise who have already been appointed to serve on
one of its 18 advisory panels. In addition, CDRH may utilize pediatric expertise available
on advisory committees of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) The Office of the Director, Office
of Device Evaluation (ODE) or Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety
(OIVD) will recruit individuals with pediatric expertise to serve as panel members or
consultants through outreach efforts that will include contacting pediatric professional
associations, current SGEs, and industry stakeholders.

Appointment of Pediatric Experts
For SGEs recruited for their pediatric expertise, as with all SGEs, the Center’s
Committee Management will complete the paperwork in accordance with the policies and
procedures described in the Policy & Guidance Handbook for FDA Advisory
Committees. (Although currently being revised, the previous version of this handbook is
available from National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Rd.,
Springfield, VA 22161, 703-487-4650 (Order No. PB94-158854))

Team Leader Responsibilities
The review team leader will determine the need for pediatric expertise during panel
deliberations by conferring with appropriate individuals in the review division and ODE/
OIVD management, as well as with the applicant and advisory panel members. If the
team leader concludes that pediatric expertise is appropriate, (s)he will advise the
executive secretary of the advisory panel that will review the premarket submission or
regulatory document.

Executive Secretary Responsibilities
The executive secretary will ensure that pediatric expertise is available for the advisory
panel deliberations.

Quality Control Measures
The availability of individuals with pediatric expertise will be monitored as a part of
ODE’s and OIVD’s Performance Scorecards in the “Panel Readiness Index”
measurement.
