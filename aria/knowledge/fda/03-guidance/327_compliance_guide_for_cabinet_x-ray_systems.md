Compliance Guide for Cabinet
X-Ray Systems
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
Manufacturers of cabinet x-ray systems sold in the United States (U.S.) are responsible for
complying with the electronic product radiation control provisions of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act), including radiation performance standards [21 U.S.C. 360hh360ss]. This guide is intended to assist manufacturers of cabinet x-ray systems with meeting
the requirements of the Act and applicable federal radiation safety regulations [21 CFR
1020.40, Parts 1000-1005, 1010 1 ]. The term ‘manufacturers’ includes those engaged in the
business of manufacturing, assembling, or importing cabinet x-ray systems into the U.S.
The federal radiation safety performance standard for cabinet x-ray systems (performance
standard) is found at 21 CFR 1020.40. Cabinet x-ray systems sold in the U.S. are required to
comply with all applicable requirements of the performance standard. Before selling a
cabinet x-ray system in the U.S., a manufacturer must certify that its product meets the
applicable requirements of the performance standard [21 CFR 1010.2]. This certification
must be based on a quality control and testing program that is in accordance with good
manufacturing practices [21 CFR 1010.2]. Certification of compliance with a foreign

In addition to the requirements implemented through these regulations, manufacturers must
comply with other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations, including provisions
applicable to the product if it is a medical “device” under the Act (21 U.S.C. 301(h)) or if the
product is used in food irradiation (21 CFR Part 179). Discussion of medical device and
food irradiation provisions and regulations is beyond the scope of this document.

radiation safety standard can not be substituted for certification of compliance with the U.S.
performance standard.
Throughout this guide, relevant sections of the regulation will be cited. This guide does not
replace the regulations. Should a conflict between the two arise, the regulations supersede
this guide. When the text of a regulation is quoted it will appear in italics.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
and electronic product regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant
scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to
comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would
be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send
your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the
CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways
to contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

1. Definitions
You may find many of the following definitions in 21 CFR 1000.3 or 1020.40(b) (we have
provided the specific citations). Some of the definitions are interpretations of terms not
specifically defined in the regulations but are based on our experience with electronic
products.
Categories of X-Ray Products
This guidance discusses a variety of x-ray categories. Cabinet x-ray systems are subject to
the most extensive requirements because cabinet x-ray systems are subject to a specific
performance standard [21 CFR 1020.40]. In addition to the performance standard [21 CFR

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
1020.40], manufacturers of cabinet x-ray systems sold in the U.S. must comply with 21 CFR
Parts 1000, 1002, 1003, 1004, 1005, and 1010.
•

Cabinet X-Ray System [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(3)] means an x-ray system with the x-ray tube
installed in an enclosure (hereinafter termed cabinet) which, independently of existing
architectural structures except the floor on which it may be placed, is intended to contain at
least that portion of a material being irradiated, provide radiation attenuation, and exclude
personnel from its interior during generation of x radiation. Included are all x-ray systems
designed primarily for the inspection of carry-on baggage at airline, railroad, and bus
terminals, and in similar facilities. An x-ray tube used within a shielded part of a building, or
x-ray equipment which may temporarily or occasionally incorporate portable shielding is
not considered a cabinet x-ray system.
A cabinet x-ray system always includes an x-ray tube installed in a shielded enclosure
intended to contain the item being irradiated. The enclosure protects people from the x-rays
generated and excludes people from the enclosure’s interior. Because the shielding
surrounds the volume exposed to x-ray and the shielding is an inherent part of the system,
cabinet x-ray systems are sometimes referred to as closed x-ray systems.
Cabinet x-ray systems are primarily used for security screening and industrial quality control.
Security applications range from screening baggage at airports to systems used to inspect
trucks entering the U.S. Industrial quality control applications include food, circuit board,
and tire inspections. There are also a few medical devices that are also cabinet x-ray systems
such as x-ray systems used to view tissue samples.
The provisions of the performance standard apply to cabinet x-ray systems designed
primarily for inspecting carry-on baggage manufactured or assembled on or after April 25,
1974. Additionally, the performance standard applies to all cabinet x-ray systems
manufactured or assembled on or after April 10, 1975 [21 CFR 1020.40(a)].
If an x-ray system does not meet all of the criteria of the definition in the regulations, then it
is not a cabinet x-ray system. For example, adding shielding to an existing room does not
make that room a cabinet because the room is not independent of existing architectural
structures. A free-standing shielded room independent of existing architectural structures,
excluding the floor, built to house an x-ray tube is subject to the performance standard.
X-ray systems that are not cabinet x-ray systems are subject to different reporting
requirements [21 CFR 1002.1, Table 1]. The performance standard [21 CFR 1020.40(a)]
does not apply to:
·systems designed exclusively for microscopic examination of materials;
·systems designed for intentional exposure of humans to x-rays; or
·products that use radioactive material as the source of their radiation.
Other categories of x-ray systems are defined below.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Products intended to produce particulate radiation or x-rays other than diagnostic 2 or
cabinet x-ray systems [21 CFR 1002.1, Table 1]
Although the following products are not subject to a mandatory performance standard, the
products and manufacturers are subject to regulation under the Act. Manufacturers of x-ray
and particle radiation systems sold in the U.S. are responsible for complying with 21 CFR
Parts 1000, 1002, 1003, 1004, and 21 CFR 1005.25. When possible, FDA recommends that
manufacturers design their products to comply with voluntary consensus radiation safety
standards when those standards are available and appropriate for the product.
•

Analytical X-Ray Systems
Analytical x-ray systems are those systems that are designed exclusively for the microscopic
examination of material. The phrase “exclusively for the microscopic examination of
material,” refers to x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, or x-ray fluorescence. These x-ray
systems are usually intended to be operated only in a laboratory setting. An x-ray system is
exempt from the performance standard [21 CFR 1020.40(a)] when it is designed exclusively
for microscopic examination of material. The performance standard is applicable to systems
intended for education (for example teaching x-ray physics) or for industrial quality control
used in a manufacturing environment because those uses are not, “exclusively for the
microscopic examination of materials.”

•

Medical X-Ray Systems
Products that are not subject to the cabinet x-ray or diagnostic x-ray standards and that are
medical devices are medical x-ray systems. Examples include, but are not limited to,
radiation therapy products that use accelerators and veterinary x-ray systems.

•

Industrial X-Ray and Particulate Radiation Systems
Products that are not subject to the cabinet x-ray or diagnostic x-ray standards, do not fall
into the analytical x-ray or medical x-ray categories, and use x-ray tubes or accelerators to
produce ionizing radiation fall into the industrial x-ray or particle radiation category.
However, x-ray products that have an industrial purpose and are closed systems are cabinet
x-ray systems subject to the performance standard. Examples of industrial x-ray systems
include accelerators used for medical device sterilization, open beam systems used for
nondestructive testing, open beam systems used for bomb detection, and personnel security
screening systems that use x-rays.

•

Regulatory Terms
Accidental radiation occurrence (ARO) [21 CFR 1000.3(a)] means a single event or series
of events that has/have resulted in injurious or potentially injurious exposure of any person
to electronic product radiation as a result of the manufacturing, testing, or use of an
electronic product.

2

Diagnostic x-ray systems are subject to a specific performance standard, 21 CFR 1020.30.
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Reports of an ARO are required by 21 CFR 1002.20. Discussion of this requirement appears
in the Reports and Records section of this document.
•

Commerce [21 CFR 1000.3(d)] means:
(1) Commerce between any place in any State and any place outside thereof, and
(2) Commerce wholly within the District of Columbia.
Building a system for your own use at the location where it will be used is not ordinarily
considered entry into commerce. Building a system for your company’s use and transporting
it from one location to another can be commerce.

•

Manufacturer [21 CFR 1000.3(n)] means any person engaged in the business of
manufacturing, assembling, or importing electronic products.

•

Model [21 CFR 1000.3(o)] means any identifiable, unique electronic product design, and
refers to products having the same structural and electrical design characteristics and to
which the manufacturer has assigned a specific designation to differentiate between it and
other products produced by that manufacturer.

•

Cabinet X-Ray System Terms
Access panel [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(1)] means any barrier or panel which is designed to be
removed or opened for maintenance or service purposes, requires tools to open, and permits
access to the interior of the cabinet.
Any barrier that is designed to be moveable or opened for routine operation is a door
(defined below), not an access panel.
Some cabinet x-ray systems have cosmetic covers that conceal electronics but do not allow
access to the cabinet when opened. These covers are not access panels unless they are used
to prevent access to interior system components that do allow access to the cabinet.
Tools can be keys or common tools such as screwdrivers and wrenches.

•

Aperture [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(2)] means any opening in the outside surface of the cabinet,
other than a port, which remains open during generation of x radiation.
Apertures are usually holes for routing cables, ventilation, or wiring into or out of the
cabinet.

•

Cabinet [interpreted from 21 CFR 1020.40(b)(3)] means the enclosure that contains an x-ray
tube and is intended to contain at least that portion of a material being irradiated, provide
radiation attenuation, and exclude personnel from its interior during generation of x
radiation. The cabinet is the only space within a cabinet x-ray system where radiation
exposure greater than the emission limit [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)] is permitted.

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

Door [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(4)] means any barrier which is designed to be movable or opened
for routine operation purposes, does not generally require tools to open, and permits access
to the interior of the cabinet. For the purposes of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section,
inflexible hardware rigidly affixed to the door shall be considered part of the door.
If the barrier is only opened for maintenance and service, then it is an access panel as defined
above. However, if the barrier must be moved for the material being irradiated to be placed
in or removed from the cabinet as part of routine operations, then the barrier is a door even if
tools are needed.

•

Exposure [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(5)] means the quotient of dQ by dm where dQ is the absolute
value of the total charge of the ions of one sign produced in air when all the electrons
(negatrons and positrons) liberated by photons in a volume element of air having mass dm
are completely stopped in air.

•

External surface [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(6)] means the outside surface of the cabinet x-ray
system, including the high-voltage generator, doors, access panels, latches, control knobs,
and other permanently mounted hardware and including the plane across any aperture or
port.

•

Floor [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(7)] means the underside external surface of the cabinet.

•

Ground fault [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(8)] means an accidental electrical grounding of an
electrical conductor.

•

Port [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(9)] means any opening in the outside surface of the cabinet which
is designed to remain open, during generation of x-rays, for the purpose of conveying
material to be irradiated into and out of the cabinet, or for partial insertion for irradiation of
an object whose dimensions do not permit complete insertion into the cabinet.

•

Primary beam [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(10)] means the x radiation emitted directly from the
target and passing through the window of the x-ray tube.

•

Safety interlock [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(11)] means a device which is intended to prevent the
generation of x radiation when access by any part of the human body to the interior of the
cabinet x-ray system through a door or access panel is possible.
One of the two interlocks required on each door must meet very specific requirements
(discussed below). [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(4)(i)].

•

X-ray system [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(12)] means an assemblage of components for the
controlled generation of x-rays.

•

X-ray tube [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(13)] means any electron tube which is designed for the
conversion of electrical energy into x-ray energy.

2. Overview of Requirements for Manufacturers of
Cabinet X-Ray Products
To comply with the Act and the regulations [21 CFR Parts 1000 – 1020], manufacturers of
Cabinet X-Ray system products must:
•

Design and manufacture their products to comply with the performance standard
[21 CFR 1020.40].

•

Test their products to assure compliance with the performance standard [21 CFR
1010.2(c)]; this test should be an element of a quality control and testing program that
is in accordance with good manufacturing practices.

•

Certify that their products comply with the requirements of the performance standard
[21 CFR 1010.2], based on their quality control and testing program.

•

Permanently affix certification and identification labels to their cabinet x-ray system
products [21 CFR 1010.2(b) and 1010.3].

•

Maintain and preserve test and distribution records and a file of correspondence
concerning radiation safety, safety complaints, and inquiries [21 CFR 1002.30 and
1002.31];

•

Provide Cabinet X-Ray Product Reports [21 CFR 1002.10] to the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH), describing compliance of the product design,
quality control, and testing program.

•

Provide Annual Reports [21 CFR 1002.13] summarizing test data and records to
CDRH;

•

Report accidental radiation occurrences (i.e., has/have resulted in injurious or
potentially injurious exposure) when reasonable grounds exist to suspect an incident
has occurred. [21 CFR 1000.3(a) and 1002.20];

•

Report radiation safety defects or failure to comply with the performance standard
[21 CFR 1003.10];

•

Recall (repurchase/refund, repair, or replace) products that have a radiation safety
defect or fail to comply with the performance standard [21 CFR 1004].

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

Provide all labels, reports, data, specifications, and correspondence in English [21
CFR 1010.2(b) and 1010.3(a)].

•

Additionally, cathode ray tube (CRT) video monitors used in a cabinet x-ray system
should be certified to meet the requirements of the federal radiation safety
performance standard for television receiver products [21 CFR 1020.10].

•

Designate an agent in the U.S. if the original manufacturer is not located in the U.S.
[21 CFR 1005.25]

The details of these requirements are discussed in other sections of this document.

3. Requirements of the General Federal Radiation Safety
Performance Standard
The general performance standard for electronic products [21 CFR Part 1010] applies to
cabinet x-ray systems because the specific performance standard for cabinet x-ray systems
[21 CFR 1020.40] applies. The general standard contains the requirements for manufacturer
certification of compliance to the specific standard as well as requirements for product
identification. The general standard also contains the regulations regarding variances and
exemptions from the specific standard.
Certification [21 CFR 1010.2]
(a) Every manufacturer of an electronic product for which an applicable standard is in effect
under this subchapter shall furnish to the dealer or distributor, at the time of delivery of such
product, the certification that such product conforms to all applicable standards under this
subchapter.
(b) The certification shall be in the form of a label or tag permanently affixed to or inscribed
on such product so as to be legible and readily accessible to view when the product is fully
assembled for use, unless the applicable standard prescribes some other manner of
certification. All such labels or tags shall be in the English language.
(c) Such certification shall be based upon a test, in accordance with the standard, of the
individual article to which it is attached or upon a testing program which is in accordance
with good manufacturing practices. The Director, Center for Devices and Radiological
Health may disapprove such a testing program on the grounds that it does not assure the
adequacy of safeguards against hazardous electronic product radiation or that it does not
assure that electronic products comply with the standards prescribed under this subchapter.
Manufacturers of cabinet x-ray system products must certify their products comply with all
the applicable requirements of the performance standard [21 CFR 1020.40]. The
certification must be in the form of a label or tag permanently affixed to or inscribed on the
cabinet x-ray product, and it must be legible, written in English, and readily accessible to
view when the product is fully assembled. The certification must be based on a quality

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
control and testing program which is carried out in accordance with good manufacturing
practices. In addition, the certification must be furnished to the dealers or distributors at the
time of delivery.
The certification label must contain a statement that the product complies with the applicable
performance standard. The regulations do not require specific wording of the certification
statement. This label may not be ambiguous about compliance with the performance
standard.
FDA does not approve cabinet x-ray products’ compliance with the performance standard.
Certification is the manufacturer’s statement that its product complies with all of the
applicable requirements of the cabinet x-ray radiation safety performance standard [21 CFR
1020.40] and the general performance standard [21 CFR Part 1010]. Manufacturers are
responsible for assuring the certification is true to the best of their knowledge. This
statement of certification must be based on a quality control and testing program that
demonstrates that each product manufactured complies with the applicable standard.
FDA can disapprove a manufacturer’s quality control and testing program if it is not
adequate because it does not assure compliance with the performance standards. Because
certification must be based on a test or testing program that shows the product conforms to
the standards, a manufacturer cannot certify its products if its quality control and testing
program is disapproved. Therefore, if FDA disapproves a quality control and testing
program a manufacturer cannot legally sell its products.
Identification [21 CFR 1010.3]
(a) Every manufacturer of an electronic product to which a standard under this subchapter is
applicable shall set forth the information specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this
section. This information shall be provided in the form of a tag or label permanently affixed
or inscribed on such product so as to be legible and readily accessible to view when the
product is fully assembled for use or in such other manner as may be prescribed in the
applicable standard. Except for foreign equivalent abbreviations as authorized in paragraph
(a)(1) of this section all such labels or tags shall be in the English language.
(a)(1) The full name and address of the manufacturer of the product; abbreviations such as
"Co.," "Inc.," or their foreign equivalents and the first and middle initials of individuals may
be used. Where products are sold under a name other than that of the manufacturer of the
product, the full name and address of the individual or company under whose name the
product was sold may be set forth, provided such individual or company has previously
supplied the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health with sufficient
information to identify the manufacturer of the product.
(a)(2) The place and month and year of manufacture:
(i) The place of manufacture may be expressed in code provided the manufacturer has
previously supplied the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health with the key to
such code.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(ii) The month and year of manufacture shall be provided clearly and legibly, without
abbreviation, and with the year shown as a four-digit number as follows:
Manufactured: (Insert Month and Year of Manufacture.)
(b) In the case of products for which it is not feasible to affix identification labeling in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, upon application by the manufacturer, the
Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health may approve an alternate means by
which such identification may be provided.
(c) Every manufacturer of an electronic product to which a standard under this subchapter is
applicable shall provide to the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health a list
identifying each brand name which is applied to the product together with the full name and
address of the individual or company for whom each product so branded is manufactured.
Manufacturers must place identification information on their cabinet x-ray system which is
either permanently affixed as a tag or a label or is inscribed on the product. This information
must be legible, written in English, and readily accessible to view when the product is fully
assembled. The identification information must include:
1. The full name and address of the manufacturer.
a. If the product is sold under a different name, then the full name and address of the
individual or company selling the product may appear instead if information to
identify the manufacturer has been previously provided to CDRH in a product
report [21 CFR 1002.10] or supplemental report [21 CFR 1002.11].
b. See 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) for the details on acceptable abbreviations in the
manufacturer’s name.
2. The place of manufacture.
3. The month and year of manufacture.
a. The month and year must not be abbreviated.

4. Requirements of the Federal Radiation Safety
Performance Standard for Cabinet X-ray Systems
Manufacturers are required to certify [21 CFR 1010.2] that their products sold in the U.S.
comply with the radiation safety performance standard for cabinet x-ray systems [21 CFR
1020.40]. The applicability of the performance standard is discussed above in the definitions
of the terms ‘cabinet x-ray system’ and ‘analytical x-ray system.’
Emission Limit [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(i)]: Radiation emitted from the cabinet x-ray
system shall not exceed an exposure of 0.5 milliRoentgen in one hour at any point five
centimeters outside the external surface.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
This requirement does not limit the rate of x-ray emission. It limits the total emission
possible in any one hour. Consider the factors that will result in the maximum x-ray
emission from the external surface of your product when designing your test program. The
system must be tested at the settings and operating conditions resulting in the highest output
to assure that this limit can not be exceeded [21 CFR 1010.2].
The amount of time x-ray can be on (x-ray on time) in any one-hour period, the duty cycle, is
a factor in meeting this requirement. X-ray on time can be limited by physical system
properties or interlocks. Total emissions must not exceed an exposure of 0.5 mR in one hour
even when x-ray on time is at its maximum.
Cabinet x-ray systems with ports often use lead curtains to reduce the emissions. Most lead
curtains are composed of multiple strips of leaded material. These strips of leaded material
are deflected as items pass through creating intermittent gaps. A cabinet x-ray system with
ports covered by lead curtains must meet the emission limit at the plane of any port even
during an hour when items are being loaded into the system as fast as the system allows. A
check of the condition of lead curtains should be included on the maintenance schedule [21
CFR 1020.40(c)(9)(i)] to assure the system remains compliant with the performance
standard.
Test and Measurement [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(ii)]: Compliance with the exposure limit in
paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section shall be determined by measurements averaged over a
cross-sectional area of ten square centimeters with no linear dimension greater than 5
centimeters, with the cabinet x-ray system operated at those combinations of x-ray tube
potential, current, beam orientation, and conditions of scatter radiation which produce the
maximum x-ray exposure at the external surface, and with the door(s) and access panel(s)
fully closed as well as fixed at any other position(s) which will allow the generation of x
radiation.
The standard states that compliance is determined by measurements averaged over a crosssectional area of 10 square centimeters with no linear dimension greater than 5 centimeters.
This means that when FDA makes a measurement to determine if a product complies with
the emission limit, our test procedure will use a meter that meets that criteria or a test
procedure that produces equivalent results. When selecting instrumentation and designing
test procedures, manufacturers should be able to justify the equivalence of their results.
You should explain any correction factors used in your test and subsequent calculations in
your procedure and your product report.
The measurement from the point of the highest emission reading must be less than the .5 mR
emission limit [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1)(i)]. An average of all emission measurements that is
less than 0.5 mR in one hour is not sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the
performance standard.
You should set the rejection limit for your test to determine compliance with the emission
limit conservatively to account for the inherent error from measurement methods and
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
instrument accuracy. A rejection limit set at the emission limit might result in false
certification of a product that does not comply but appeared to comply with the performance
standard.
For your records, you need to write the measured exposure as a numerical measurement of
the worst case emission from every system that you test. You must provide a summary of
these test results as a histogram in your annual report [21 CFR 1002.30; see Guide for Filing
Annual Reports for X-ray Components and Systems (July 1980)
(http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/radhlth/pdf/xrcrpt0a.pdf)].
Instrumentation
Thin walled Geiger-Mueller (GM) meters are very useful in making a qualitative
measurement to identify the location of the largest amount of radiation emission on a cabinet
x-ray system’s external surface. GM meters cannot be adequately calibrated for making
quantitative measurements of x-ray emission. X-ray tubes produce radiation that contains a
spectrum of different energies. GM meters do not have a linear response to radiation at
different energies. GM meters respond to the number of ionizing events occurring in their
measurement volume; however, they produce no information about the energy associated
with each ionization event. Therefore, GM meters do not respond with equal count rates to
equal exposure rates from photons of different energies. You should not assume that because
a GM meter’s readout scale is scribed in exposure rate units that the meter will accurately
measure that quantity. More information about instrument selection criteria can be found in
National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reports 57 and 112
(available from http://www.ncrponline.org).
Ion chambers are usually appropriate instruments for making quantitative measurements of
radiation emission from cabinet x-ray systems. You should calibrate instruments as
recommended by their manufacturers. Calibration should be done for an appropriate energy
range for your product. Calibrating a meter with a Cesium 137 source (beta 511 keV and
gamma 662 keV) and using it to measure a 120 kVp x-ray spectrum will lead to error that
may be significant.
Floors [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(2)]: A cabinet x-ray system shall have a permanent floor. Any
support surface to which a cabinet x-ray system is permanently affixed may be deemed the
floor of the system.
When a space is occupied below the floor where a cabinet x-ray system is located, the floor
may need additional shielding to assure that the emission below the floor meets the
requirements of 21 CFR 1020.40(c)(1).
Ports and Apertures [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(3)]: (i) The insertion of any part of the human
body through any port into the primary beam shall not be possible. (ii) The insertion of any
part of the human body through any aperture shall not be possible.
This requirement is intended to prevent accidental and routine operator exposure to the
primary x-ray beam. Under this provision, insertion of any body part into a port must not be
12

a standard operating procedure. This requirement is not intended to prevent people from
intentionally attempting to defeat system safety features to reach the primary beam.
Contorting to reach into, crawling into, or riding through the port into the system are
examples of intentional defeat of safety systems.
You can use many means to meet this requirement. A system with a straight tunnel that is at
least 36 inches from any port to the primary beam complies with this requirement. A system
with a straight tunnel less than 36 inches from any port to the primary beam should have
some means other than distance to make the primary beam difficult to reach. One example
includes incorporating photoelectric sensors that turn on the beam when interrupted, and
placed so they are unlikely to be triggered by someone in a normal posture reaching into the
cabinet. Another example is locating system ports lower (near the floor) or higher (at head
height) than is conventional. Also, integrating the system into a production line where the
products being examined move fast enough to limit access to the port itself.
When your product uses ports [21 CFR 1020.40(b)(9)], you should describe the means used
to prevent unintentional access to the primary beam in your product report. An isometric
view of the cabinet system showing these features is often very helpful. Drawings or photos
that show both a top down and side view can also make it much easier to explain your
system's safety features.
Safety Interlocks [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(4)(i)]: Each door of a cabinet x-ray system shall
have a minimum of two safety interlocks. One, but not both of the required interlocks shall be
such that door opening results in physical disconnection of the energy supply circuit to the
high-voltage generator, and such disconnection shall not be dependent upon any moving
part other than the door. [Note: Safety interlock is defined in 21 CFR 1020.40(b)(11).]
The primary door interlock should be of conventional design. The second door interlock
must physically disconnect the energy supply circuit to the high voltage generator. Physical
disconnection means opening the energy supply circuit by removing a piece of the circuit.
This is usually accomplished with a ‘knife-edge and finger stock’ or ‘plug and socket’ type
connection. It is good practice to assure the primary interlock will remove power from the
energy supply circuit before the physical disconnection occurs. Relays, micro switches, and
‘safety switches’ all contain moving parts and, therefore, cannot be used to satisfy the
requirement that the physical disconnect interlock is "not dependent on any moving part
other than the door."
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(4)(ii)] Each access panel shall have at least one safety interlock.
Access panel interlocks are not required to physically disconnect the energy supply circuit.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(4)(iii)] Following interruption of x-ray generation by the functioning of
any safety interlock, use of a control provided in accordance with paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this
section shall be necessary for resumption of x-ray generation.

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
After the triggering of any interlock, it must be necessary to use a control that is in
compliance with the control regulations to resume x-ray generation. This requirement
prevents the use of an interlock as a switch to turn x-ray production on.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(4)(iv)] Failure of any single component of the cabinet x-ray system
shall not cause failure of more than one required safety interlock.
Ground Fault [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(5)]: A ground fault shall not result in the generation of
x-rays.
A narrative text describing the possible ground fault failures and why they can not result in
generation of x-rays is a good way to document compliance with this requirement [21 CFR
1002]. A simplified block electrical diagram to illustrate your analysis of possible ground
faults is also helpful.
Controls and Indicators [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(6)]: For all systems to which this section is
applicable there shall be provided:
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(6)(i)] A key-actuated control to insure that x-ray generation is not
possible with the key removed.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(6)(ii)] A control or controls to initiate and terminate the generation of
x-rays other than by functioning of a safety interlock or the main power control.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(6)(iii)] Two independent means which indicate when and only when
x-rays are being generated, unless the x-ray generation period is less than one-half second,
in which case the indicators shall be activated for one-half second, and which are
discernible from any point at which initiation of x-ray generation is possible. Failure of a
single component of the cabinet x-ray system shall not cause failure of both indicators to
perform their intended function. One, but not both, of the indicators required by this
subdivision may be a milliammeter labeled to indicate x-ray tube current. All other
indicators shall be legibly labeled “X-RAY ON”.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(6)(iv)] Additional means other than milliammeters which indicate when
and only when x-rays are being generated, unless the x-ray generation period is less than
one-half second in which case the indicators shall be activated for one-half second, as
needed to insure that at least one indicator is visible from each door, access panel, and port,
and is legibly labeled “X-RAY ON”.
At least one indicator must be visible from each door, access panel, and port. These
indicators must be legibly labeled “X-RAY ON”. These additional indicators can not be
milliammeters. The additional indicators must indicate when and only when x-rays are being
generated. If the x-ray generation period is less than one-half second, the indicators must be
activated for one-half second.

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Some systems have standby modes where it is necessary to provide some current to the x-ray
tube and some use capacitors to supply the tube. In these situations, there is not enough
current for an x-ray tube to produce sufficient radiation for normal operation but there may
be enough current to produce some radiation. It is appropriate to have the x-ray on indicators
indicate whenever there is any current available to the x-ray tube. We also recommend that
you have an additional indicator to show when x-rays are being produced at an operational
level.
Additional Controls and Indicators [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(7)]: For cabinet x-ray systems
designed to admit humans there shall also be provided:
(i) A control within the cabinet for preventing and terminating x-ray generation, which
cannot be reset, overridden or bypassed from the outside of the cabinet.
(ii) No means by which x-ray generation can be initiated from within the cabinet.
(iii) Audible and visible warning signals within the cabinet which are actuated for at least 10
seconds immediately prior to the first initiation of x-ray generation after closing any door
designed to admit humans. Failure of any single component of the cabinet x-ray system shall
not cause failure of both the audible and visible warning signals.
(iv) A visible warning signal within the cabinet which remains actuated when and only when
x-rays are being generated, unless the x-ray generation period is less than one-half second in
which case the indicators shall be activated for one-half second.
(v) Signs indicating the meaning of the warning signals provided pursuant to paragraphs
(c)(7) (iii) and (iv) of this section and containing instructions for the use of the control
provided pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section. These signs shall be legible,
accessible to view, and illuminated when the main power control is in the "on" position.
Warning Labels [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(8)]: (i) There shall be permanently affixed or
inscribed on the cabinet x-ray system at the location of any controls which can be used to
initiate x-ray generation, a clearly legible and visible label bearing the statement:
Caution: X-Rays Produced When Energized
(ii) There shall be permanently affixed or inscribed on the cabinet x-ray system adjacent to
each port a clearly legible and visible label bearing the statement:
Caution: Do Not Insert Any Part of the Body When System is Energized--X-ray Hazard
Instructions [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(9)(i)]: Manufacturers of cabinet x-ray systems shall
provide for purchasers, and to others upon request at a cost not to exceed the cost of
preparation and distribution, manuals and instructions which shall include at least the
following technical and safety information: Potential, current, and duty cycle ratings of the
x-ray generation equipment; adequate instructions concerning any radiological safety
procedures and precautions which may be necessary because of unique features of the

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
system; and a schedule of maintenance necessary to keep the system in compliance with this
section.
In addition to major maintenance, such as when to change the x-ray tube, the schedule of
maintenance should include items such as daily, weekly, monthly, and annual inspections to
be carried out by the system operators. For example, your maintenance schedule could state,
“Operators must check that all indicator lights function at least once a day.” Another
example would be periodic inspection of the condition of lead curtains for systems that use
lead curtains. This regulation does not require that the maintenance schedule tell a system
owner how to perform all of the required maintenance, only what maintenance must be done
and how often.
Failure to provide a schedule of necessary maintenance is a common problem. If your
product truly does not need any scheduled maintenance to keep it in compliance with the
standard, you should explain why in your product report and provide a clear justification.
[21 CFR 1020.40(c)(9)(ii)] Manufacturers of cabinet x-ray systems which are intended to be
assembled or installed by the purchaser shall provide instructions for assembly, installation,
adjustment and testing of the cabinet x-ray system adequate to assure that the system is in
compliance with applicable provisions of this section when assembled, installed, adjusted
and tested as directed.
X-Ray Baggage [21 CFR 1020.40(c)(10)]: X-ray systems designed primarily for the
inspection of carry-on baggage at airline, railroad, and bus terminals, and at similar
facilities, shall be provided with means, pursuant to paragraphs (c)(10) (i) and (ii) of this
section, to insure operator presence at the control area in a position which permits
surveillance of the ports and doors during generation of x-radiation.
(i) During an exposure or preset succession of exposures of one-half second or greater
duration, the means provided shall enable the operator to terminate the exposure or preset
succession of exposures at any time.
(ii) During an exposure or preset succession of exposures of less than one-half second
duration, the means provided may allow completion of the exposure in progress but shall
enable the operator to prevent additional exposures.
X-ray baggage systems must have a means to ensure that the operator is present at the
controls so that the operator can clearly view the ports and doors at all times during x-ray
generation.
The phrase, “facilities similar to airline, railroad, and bus terminals,” includes any place
where members of the public walk up to an x-ray system for the purpose of security
screening of their carried belongings. Therefore, cabinet x-ray security screening systems
used in office buildings, court houses, and schools are also subject to this section [21 CFR
1020.40(c)(10)]. Cabinet x-ray systems that are in controlled access areas and are always
loaded and unloaded by trained operators are not subject to this section.

Modification of a certified system [21 CFR 1020.40(d)] The modification of a cabinet x-ray
system, previously certified pursuant to 1010.2 by any person engaged in the business of
manufacturing, assembling or modifying cabinet x-ray systems shall be construed as
manufacturing under the act if the modification affects any aspect of the system's
performance for which this section has an applicable requirement. The manufacturer who
performs such modification shall recertify and reidentify the system in accordance with the
provisions of 1010.2 and 1010.3 of this chapter.

7. Variances and Exemptions
Variances [21 CFR 1010.4]
Manufacturers that wish to produce a cabinet x-ray system that varies from any part of the
performance standard must gain approval before the system can be sold in the United States.
In order to gain this approval, an application for variance must be submitted. Variation from
the standard can be granted if the product meets the following criteria:
• The cabinet x-ray system utilizes an alternate means for providing radiation safety or
protection equal to or greater than that provided by other cabinet systems that meet all
requirements of the standard, or
• The cabinet x-ray system performs a function or is intended for a purpose that could not
be performed or accomplished if required to meet the cabinet x-ray system standards and
a suitable means for assuring radiation safety or protection are provided, or
• One or more requirements of the standard are not appropriate, and suitable means for
assuring radiation safety or protection are provided.
An original and four copies of the application for variance should be submitted to:
Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305)
Food and Drug Administration
5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061
Rockville, MD 20852
The application for variance should supply the information required by 21 CFR 1010.4(b).
Historically, few variances have been granted for cabinet x-ray products.
Exemptions [21 CFR 1010.5]
In certain cases, when applied for, exemptions from the performance standard may be
approved by the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, if it is determined that
the cabinet x-ray system is intended for use by departments or agencies of the United States
and the system meets the following criteria:
• The acquiring agency prescribes procurement specifications for the cabinet x-ray
system governing radiation emissions of the cabinet x-ray system and the cabinet
x-ray system shall be used solely or predominantly by a department or agency of the
United States.

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

The cabinet x-ray system is intended for research, investigations, studies,
demonstration, training, or for reasons of national security.

Applications for exemptions should include an original and two copies and should be
addressed to:
Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305)
Food and Drug Administration
5630 Fishers Lane, Room 1061
Rockville, MD 20852
You should not include information classified for reasons of national security in your
application. The contents and criteria for an application for exemption and its approval are
found in 21 CFR 1010.5.
Information related to an application for exemption may be requested from FDA under the
Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) (FOIA). FDA will comply with the requirements
of 21 CFR Part 20 on the disclosure of information.

8. Imports and Exports
Imports [21 CFR part 1005]
Import of a cabinet x-ray system will be refused entry into the United States unless there is
affixed to the cabinet x-ray system a label or tag certifying compliance with the performance
standard. Any systems refused entry will be destroyed or exported under regulations
prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury unless a timely and adequate petition for
permission to bring the cabinet x-ray system into compliance is filed and granted. Further
information about the importation process can be found on the FDA web site:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/radhlth/eprc_imports_and_exports.html
Service of process on manufacturers [21 CFR 1005.25]
(a) Every manufacturer of electronic products, prior to offering such product for importation
into the United States, shall designate a permanent resident of the United States as the
manufacturer's agent upon whom service of all processes, notices, orders, decisions, and
requirements may be made for and on behalf of the manufacturer as provided in section
360(d) of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 263h(d)) and
this section. The agent may be an individual, a firm, or a domestic corporation. For purposes
of this section, any number of manufacturers may designate the same agent.
(b) A manufacturer designating an agent must address the designation to the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health; ATTN: Designation of Agent (HFZ-240);
Office of Communication, Education, and Radiation Programs; 10903 New Hampshire Avenue,
Silver Spring, MD 20993. It must be in writing and dated; all signatures must be in ink. The
designation must be made in the legal form required to make it valid and binding on the
manufacturer under the laws, corporate bylaws, or other requirements governing the making
of the designation by the manufacturer at the place and time where it is made, and the

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
persons or person signing the designation shall certify that it is so made. The designation
must disclose the manufacturer's full legal name and the name(s) under which the
manufacturer conducts the business, if applicable, the principal place of business, and
mailing address. If any of the products of the manufacturer do not bear his legal name, the
designation must identify the marks, trade names, or other designations of origin which these
products bear. The designation must provide that it will remain in effect until withdrawn or
replaced by the manufacturer and shall bear a declaration of acceptance duly signed by the
designated agent. The full legal name and mailing address of the agent must be stated. Until
rejected by the Secretary, designations are binding on the manufacturer even when not in
compliance with all the requirements of this section. The designated agent may not assign
performance of his function under the designation to another.
Exports [21 CFR 1010.20]
The performance standards prescribed in this subchapter shall not apply to any electronic
product which is intended solely for export if:
(a) Such product and the outside of any shipping container used in the export of such product
are labeled or tagged to show that such product is intended for export, and
(b) Such product meets all the applicable requirements of the country to which such product
is intended for export.
Once a product has been exported, it may not be possible to return it to the U.S., even if that
return is only for service and then re-export. Products that are labeled for export, and
therefore not certified, will be refused entry to the U.S.
FDA does not issue export certificates for non-medical cabinet x-ray systems.
