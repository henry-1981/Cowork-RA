Latex Condoms for Men
Information for 510(k) Premarket Notifications:
Use of Consensus Standards for Abbreviated Submissions
Section 510(k) of the Act and the implementing regulation, 21 CFR Part 807, require persons who intend to
market a new device to submit a premarket notification containing information that enables FDA to determine
whether the new device is substantially equivalent within the meaning of Section 513(i) of the Act to a legally
marketed device that does not require premarket approval. Unless exempted from premarket notification
requirements, persons may not market a new device under Section 510(k) of the Act, unless they receive a
substantial equivalence order from FDA or an order reclassifying the device into Class I or Class II (section
513(i) of the Act). Male condoms are classified as Class II devices under 21 CFR §884.5300 and §884.5310
(Condom with spermicidal lubricant) and are not exempted from 510(k) requirements, therefore, a 510(k)
premarket notification must be cleared by order of FDA before a new male condom, or one that has been
significantly changed or modified, is introduced into interstate commerce.
A person required to submit a 510(k) premarket notification must provide information as required by the statute
and regulations to allow the Center to make an appropriate decision regarding the clearance of the submission.
The Center believes that conformance with recognized consensus standards can provide a reasonable assurance
of safety and/or effectiveness for many aspects of medical devices, including Male Latex Condoms. A 510(k)
that contains a declaration of conformity to recognized consensus standards, as discussed below, will, in most
cases, eliminate the need to review the actual test data for those aspects of the device addressed by the
standards. This, however, does not affect the Center's ability to obtain any information authorized by the statute
or regulations. Conformance with recognized consensus standards in and of itself may not always be a
sufficient basis for regulatory decisions. For example, a specific device and/or intended use may raise safety or
effectiveness issues not addressed by any recognized consensus standard, or a specific FDA regulation may
require additional information beyond what conformity to recognized consensus standards provide. Under such
circumstances, conformity with recognized standards will not satisfy all requirements for marketing the latex
condom in the United States.
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health has recognized and will use consensus standards pursuant to
the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-115), which amends section 514 of the
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 514(c)). FDA has recognized voluntary consensus standards for
Latex Condoms for Men, and other relevant standards may also be applicable to the submission of a 510(k) for
a latex condom, e.g., ISO 10993. A list of recognized standards is maintained on the CDRH website and is
updated at least annually. Other recognized standards may be applicable for latex condoms and manufacturers
have the right to make a declaration of conformity to any listed standard. [FDA Guidance on the
Recognition and Use of Consensus Standards, February 19, 1998, q.v.]
Building on FDA’s recognition of the ASTM voluntary consensus standard for condoms and the ISO voluntary
consensus standard for biological evaluation of medical devices, this guidance document provides an outline for
a 510(k) premarket notification that incorporates a declaration of conformance with these standards. When the
declaration is combined in a 510(k) which is complete and accurate, it can serve as the basis for an FDA finding
of substantial equivalence for a Natural Rubber Latex (NRL) Condom. (Other criteria exist for blends and nonNRL Male Condoms and for Female Condoms.)
This guidance document represents the agency’s current thinking on the use of consensus standards for
abbreviated submissions for 510(k) Premarket notifications for latex condoms for men. It does not create or
confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach
may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.

LABELS, LABELING AND ADVERTISEMENTS
Provide proposed labels, labeling and advertisements sufficient to describe the device, its intended
use, and the directions for use. (21 CFR 807.87(e)) For overall labeling guidance, manufacturers
are encouraged to consult with FDA's manual "Labeling: Regulatory Requirements for Medical
Devices,” (HHS Publication FDA 89-4203). (Also see Title 21 CFR §801, §801.435 and
§801.437.) Labeling for latex condoms should include but not be limited to the following:
A. Statement of Identity and Intended Use
1.

The principal display panel as defined in 21 CFR 801.60 and primary package (individual
condom packet) should identify the device as a male LATEX condom.

2.

The principal display panel and primary package should identify the intended use for male
condoms, i.e., contraception.

3.

The principal display panel, and primary package (individual condom packet) should also
include the following statement:

If used properly, latex condoms will help to reduce the risk of transmission
of HIV infection (AIDS) and many other sexually transmitted diseases.
The following expanded statement should be added to the package insert, directions for use:

If used properly, latex condoms will help to reduce the risk of transmission
of HIV infection (AIDS) and many other sexually transmitted diseases,
including chlamydia infections, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea,
hepatitis B, and syphilis.
4.

Special labeling is required for condoms lubricated with a spermicidal lubricant. The
principal display panel, primary package and any package insert must prominently and
conspicuously bear a specific contraceptive effectiveness cautionary provision:

This product combines a latex condom and a spermicidal lubricant. The
spermicide, nonoxynol-9, reduces the number of active sperm, thereby
decreasing the risk of pregnancy if some semen spills or seeps outside the
condom. However, the extent of decreased risk has not been established.
This condom should not be used as a substitute for the combined use of a
vaginal spermicide and a condom.
B. The package insert for latex condoms should contain a contraceptive effectiveness table with
pregnancy rates for all drug and device contraceptives. This information will enable contraceptive
users to compare their contraceptive to alternatives and make appropriate choices. FDA has
developed such a table entitled "Pregnancy Rates for Birth Control Methods," that can be used for
this purpose. This table is the result of an intra-agency effort that included focus studies funded
by FDAs Office of Womens Health. Data for this table comes from Contraceptive Technology,
17th ed., Hatcher et al., and will be updated periodically as new data becomes available.
See ODE guidance entitled "Uniform Contraceptive Labeling: Guidance To Industry."

LABELS, LABELING AND ADVERTISEMENTS
(continued)
C. The Center has issued specific guidance that established the intended use and suggested directions
for use for male latex condoms. This guidance provides acceptable and appropriate labeling. The
following are suggested precautions and directions for use:
Precautions
•

Use a new condom every time you have sexual intercourse or other acts between
partners that involve contact with the penis.

•

Do Not Reuse Condoms.

•

Store condoms in a cool, dry place.

•

If the rubber material is sticky or brittle or obviously damaged, do not use it.

•

If a lubricant is wanted, use water-based lubricants such as [name of product]. DO NOT
USE OIL-BASED LUBRICANTS, such as those made with petroleum jelly (e.g.,
Vaseline®), mineral oil, vegetable oil, or cold cream, as these may damage the condom.

Directions for Use
•

Put the condom on after the penis is fully erect and before intimate contact. Lesions, pre­
ejaculate secretions, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, urine, and feces can all transmit
disease organisms.

•

Place the condom on the head of the penis and unroll or pull it all the way to the base.

•

Leave an empty space at the end of the condom to collect semen. Remove any air
remaining in the tip of the condom by gently pressing the air out toward the base of the
penis.

•

After ejaculation and while the penis is still erect, hold onto the rim of the condom so
that the condom does not slip off as the penis is carefully withdrawn.

D. The retail and primary package (individual condom packet) must include an expiration date. (See
21 CFR §801.435, User labeling for latex condom, effective March 25, 1998.)
E. On September 30, 1997, FDA published a Final Rule (62 FR 51021-51030, 1997), codified at 21
CFR 801.437, which will require all medical device products composed of or containing, natural
rubber latex and which contact humans, such as latex condoms, to bear the following statement in
bold print on the device labeling, in conformance with Section 502(c) of the Act:

CAUTION: THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS NATURAL RUBBER LATEX
WHICH MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTIONS
This statement must appear on all device labels, and other labeling, and shall appear on the
principal display panel of the device packaging, the outside package, container or wrapper, and the
immediate device package, container or wrapper. This final rule has an effective date of
September 30, 1998. This labeling requirement is considered necessary because devices
composed of, or containing, natural rubber latex, pose a significant health risk to some individuals.
(See also, FDA's March 29, 1991, FDA Medical Alert, Allergic Reactions to Latex-Containing
Medical Devices. MDA91-1.)
