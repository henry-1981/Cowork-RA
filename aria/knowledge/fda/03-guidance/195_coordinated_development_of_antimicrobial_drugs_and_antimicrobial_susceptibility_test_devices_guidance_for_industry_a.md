Coordinated Development of
Antimicrobial Drugs and
Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test
Devices
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

This guidance is intended to assist drug sponsors and device manufacturers who are planning to
develop new antimicrobial drugs and antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) devices and who seek
to coordinate development of these products such that the AST device could be cleared either at the
time of new drug approval or shortly thereafter.
Specifically, the guidance intends to accomplish the following:
•

Describe interactions between drug sponsors and device manufacturers for coordinated
development of a new antimicrobial drug and an AST device;

•

Explain the considerations for submitting separate applications to the Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH) when seeking clearance of an AST device coincident with, or soon following,
antimicrobial drug approval; and

•

Clarify that the review of the new antimicrobial drug product and AST device(s) will
remain independent, and that coordinated development does not influence the Medical
Device User Fee Act (MDUFA) and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)
review timelines for either product.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word “should” in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or

recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is an important component in supporting the development of
new antimicrobial drugs and the subsequent clinical use of these agents. In addition to informing
the appropriate clinical use of antimicrobial drugs for individual patients, antimicrobial
susceptibility testing used in epidemiological studies can identify the emergence of drug
resistance and monitor overall population changes in antimicrobial susceptibility.
This guidance applies to AST devices, including qualitative disc diffusion or elution tests,1
manual and automated systems that provide qualitative and quantitative susceptibility
information,2 and other growth-based devices 3 used for the testing of in vitro susceptibility of
bacterial pathogens to antimicrobial drugs. This guidance may also apply to molecular-based
devices that infer antimicrobial resistance through the detection of microbial resistance markers.
AST devices are subject to premarket notification 510(k) requirements. Such devices are often
updated to accommodate new antimicrobial drugs or other improvements. A new submission is
required for modifications to a cleared AST device when the modifications could significantly
affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. 4 For example, when seeking to add a new
antimicrobial drug to an existing AST panel, a 510(k) submission is generally required because
this could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device and is a major modification
to the intended use of the device. Firms manufacturing a device of a type classified under 21 CFR
866.1645 must show that the device addresses the issues of safety and effectiveness identified in
the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document on AST Systems,5 either by meeting the special
controls identified in the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document on AST Systems or by
some other means that provides equivalent assurances of safety and effectiveness. Although AST
devices classified under other classification regulations are not subject to these special controls,
we recommend the studies and performance characteristics outlined in the Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document on AST Systems to support 510(k) submissions for these devices.
Historically, the development of antimicrobial drugs and AST devices that test for in vitro
antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens has not been optimally coordinated, with AST
device development sometimes occurring late in the drug development process or after the drug
development/approval process is completed. This has contributed to delays in the availability of
AST devices for newly approved drugs. FDA encourages sponsors of new antimicrobial drugs
and AST devices to collaborate early in the drug development process to minimize the time
between the new antimicrobial drug approval and the clearance of an AST device that tests for in

vitro susceptibility of pathogens to that drug product. Drug sponsors may benefit from this
collaboration by having access to AST device technology during clinical studies of the
antimicrobial drug, and AST device manufacturers may benefit by having access to clinical
isolates obtained during the drug development process that may aid in device validation. Patients
and health care professionals benefit by the early availability of AST devices to determine
susceptibility to approved antimicrobial drugs.

III. Interactions Between Antimicrobial Drug Sponsors
and AST Device Manufacturers
FDA encourages antimicrobial drug sponsors and AST device manufacturers to discuss
coordinated development opportunities. Ideally, these discussions would occur early during
new antimicrobial drug development to enable information helpful to the development of AST
devices to be generated during clinical trials for the drug product. This approach may be
broadly applicable to various types of AST devices, including AST broth dilution panels, disc
diffusion or elution, or gradient diffusion devices used with antimicrobial test systems, and for
new or existing molecular-based devices that can identify mutations associated with decreased
antimicrobial susceptibility. The nature of these interactions can take many forms and need
not be restricted to a single device manufacturer. Even simple availability of a drug to
multiple device manufacturers for use during AST device development may translate to
earlier AST device development and the ultimate goal of having clinical laboratory access to
FDA-cleared AST devices at the time of drug approval or shortly thereafter.
In the circumstance where an AST sponsor has not directly coordinated development with the
drug manufacturer, most of the principles described below remain applicable. AST sponsors
who seek to submit a 510(k) application (e.g., for a disc AST) but have not coordinated
development with the drug manufacturer as part of a New Drug Application (NDA) may
obtain feedback on device development through the Q-Submission Program at CDRH. 6 For
disc diffusion tests, where (or whose) performance data is available through reference to an
NDA, such data may be sufficient to support a 510(k) submission by the AST sponsor who
took part in those studies with the drug manufacturer.

IV. Considerations for Coordinated Development of
Antimicrobial Drugs and AST Devices
Because the goal of coordinated development is timely clearance of an AST device, the device
sponsor should utilize the Q-Submission Program to obtain feedback from FDA throughout the
coordinated development process, as described below.
CDRH feedback on device development can be obtained through the Q-Submission Program. Please refer to
FDA Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, Requests for Feedback on Medical Device
Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff, available at:
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311

FDA recommends that the AST device manufacturer submit a coordinated development plan
through the Q-Submission Program7 to CDRH for review and comment prior to or no later than
shortly after the NDA submission. The plan should include: (1) identification of the antimicrobial
drug under development; and (2) letters of authorization from the device manufacturer and drug
sponsor permitting FDA to reference information from any relevant IND or NDA. Please refer to
Appendix A in this document for information on critical points that should be considered in the
coordinated development process. CDRH intends to consult with the CDER review team for the
antimicrobial drug and provide joint feedback on the coordinated development plan.
After an initial Q-Submission has been submitted, additional Q-Submission supplements may be
submitted, as appropriate, following NDA submission and during NDA review to facilitate a
future 510(k) submission. In particular, FDA recommends an additional Q-Submission if the
AST device under development is to be used in phase 2 and/or phase 3 drug clinical trial(s).
Depending on the use, an investigational device exemption (IDE) may also be required (21 CFR
part 812).
FDA welcomes joint meetings with the drug sponsor, the device manufacturer, and personnel
from both CDER and CDRH at any point in the coordinated development process. The AST
device manufacturer or drug sponsor may request such a meeting through the CDRH QSubmission Program. If CDER participation is requested, CDRH intends to coordinate to include
CDER.
FDA recommends submission of a 510(k) for the AST device 4 to 6 weeks before anticipated
drug approval. The submission may be based on provisional susceptibility test interpretive
criteria (breakpoints) and updated as needed when final breakpoints are identified or
recognized by CDER. If appropriate documentation has been provided giving FDA
permission to share information from the NDA with the AST device sponsor, FDA can
communicate to the AST device sponsor information regarding breakpoint(s) and indicated
organisms that are communicated to the drug sponsor during the NDA review process and
prior to approval. Alternatively, if such agreements do not exist, the final breakpoints and
indicated organisms would become publicly available once the drug is approved. 8
Regardless, CDRH review of the 510(k) submission can begin during the NDA review
process to maximize the likelihood that AST device clearance can occur either coincident with
or shortly after drug approval.
If the device manufacturer does not wish to solicit early FDA feedback on their device
performance, coordinated development may still be achieved through direct interaction
between the device and drug manufacturers without a Q-Submission for the device, with the
510(k) submission occurring prior to or shortly after drug approval. However, without prior
FDA interaction through the Q-Submission process, there may be a delay in availability of the
The Q-submission program provides several mechanisms for feedback from FDA, including face-to-face
meetings, teleconferences, or written feedback. Additional information is provided in FDA Guidance for
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The

device due to a potentially longer review time and/or the need for additional information to be
submitted.
FDA intends to continue to make review decisions for the antimicrobial drug product and the
AST device independently. Although coordinated development of the antimicrobial drug
product with an AST device does not alter performance goals associated with review
timelines, or approval or clearance of either product, FDA intends to facilitate clearance of the
AST device coincident with or shortly after drug approval, as appropriate.
Appendix A below provides details regarding critical points in the coordinated development
process.

APPENDIX A:
Review process for coordinated development with a device Q-Submission (refer to
Figure A)
Each of the following steps should be considered optional, and individual device
manufacturers may use pieces of the process below as applicable to their specific needs.
However, FDA emphasizes that close communication during AST development can facilitate
510(k) review and successful device clearance coincident with or soon after drug approval.
1. During the drug development process, the device manufacturer submits an initial QSubmission to solicit preliminary FDA feedback regarding their plans for coordinated
development with the drug manufacturer, including, as appropriate, any anticipated
need for an IDE and proposals for data collection and analysis.
2. The device manufacturer submits a supplement to the Q-Submission for the device, the
content of which should describe the anticipated 510(k) submission and information
based on provisional breakpoints provided by the drug manufacturer if available.
(Note: There is no change in data submitted for an AST device using coordinated
development for their 510(k). The information expected to be provided is the same as
that described in the “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Test (AST) Systems.” 9)
3. FDA reviews each Q-Submission or Q-Submission supplement and communicates
feedback regarding a future 510(k) submission to the sponsor. The device
manufacturer may then provide CDRH with any necessary additional information in a
Q-Submission supplement, or the requested information may be included in the 510(k)
submission without prior FDA review.
4. A 510(k) can be submitted at any time during the NDA review process; however, it is
strongly encouraged that interactions occur through the Q-Submission process and that
formal 510(k) submission occur close to the anticipated time of drug approval
(approximately 4-6 weeks prior to anticipated drug approval). For device clearance to
occur either coincident with or shortly after drug approval, the AST device 510(k)
submission should be submitted early enough to allow sufficient time for FDA to
complete its review.
5. CDRH and CDER intend to communicate during the drug review process such that
when changes to tentative breakpoint(s) for the drug under review and indicated
organisms as determined by CDER are communicated to the drug sponsor, this
information can be communicated to the device manufacturer on condition that the
drug and device manufacturer have the necessary agreements in place to enable such
communication. Alternatively, if such agreements do not exist, the final breakpoints
and indicated organisms would become publicly available once the drug is approved.
6. Once breakpoints are finalized by CDER, if necessary, the device manufacturer should
modify the 510(k) package with the final data analysis using the approved breakpoints.

7. Assuming all issues previously communicated to the device manufacturer have been
addressed and analysis of the data in the 510(k) confirms adequate performance,
CDRH should be able to arrive at a regulatory decision coincident with or shortly after
drug approval.
8. If there are circumstances that suggest a need for modification of the procedures noted
above, they should be communicated to CDRH through the Q-Submission process.

Note: The figure below is an outline of the “process” of coordinated development and is
intended to show the flow of information between the AST device manufacturer, the drug
manufacturer, and FDA. As a representation of the overall process, it is not intended to
convey exactly what information is required, nor the exact timing of the exchanges, which
may differ based on the drug, the device, and the specifics of the relationship between their
respective manufacturers. For example, it is not expected that CDRH and CDER review
during the development stage will occur at identical times, or that a 510(k) application will be
received by FDA the same day as the NDA submission.
