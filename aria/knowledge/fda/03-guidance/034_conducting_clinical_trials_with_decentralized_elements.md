Conducting Clinical Trials With Decentralized Elements
Guidance for Industry, Investigators, and Other Interested Parties 1
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance provides recommendations for sponsors, investigators, and other interested parties
regarding the implementation of decentralized elements in clinical trials. 2 Decentralized
elements allow trial-related activities to occur remotely at locations convenient for trial
participants. Decentralized elements can include, among other things, telehealth 3 visits with
trial personnel, in-home visits with remote trial personnel, or visits with local health care
providers (HCPs) 4 (see sections II and III.B). In this guidance, a decentralized clinical trial
(DCT) refers to a clinical trial that includes decentralized elements where trial-related activities
occur at locations other than traditional clinical trial sites.
FDA’s regulatory requirements for investigations of medical products are the same for trials that
This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) in cooperation with the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH),
and the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE) at the Food and Drug Administration.

This guidance is intended to apply to decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) that are required to be conducted under an
investigational new drug application (IND) and are subject to the requirements under 21 CFR part 312 and to DCTs
that require approval of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application under 21 CFR 812.20(a). However,
the considerations in this guidance may be relevant for clinical trials that do not require an IND or an IDE
application (such as investigations of “nonsignificant risk” devices conducted under 21 CFR 812.2(b)). FDA
recommends that sponsors and investigators of clinical trials that do not require an IND under 21 CFR part 312 or
approval of an IDE application under 21 CFR 812.20(a) take the considerations in this guidance into account when
implementing decentralized elements in such trials.

Terms that appear in bold at first mention are defined in the Glossary.

For research supported or conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services and subject to the
requirements under 45 CFR part 46, parties should consider the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP)
guidance Engagement of Institutions in Human Subjects Research (October 2008) when evaluating whether local
health care-providing organizations are engaged in research. The guidance is available at
https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-engagement-of-institutions/index.html.
Parties should also consider OHRP’s 2009 clarification of the 2008 engagement guidance and 2011 correspondence
on non-engaged scenarios, which are available, respectively, at https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-andpolicy/guidance/determining-when-institutions-are-engaged-in-research/index.html and

include decentralized elements and trials that do not include decentralized elements. 5 Section
3606(a) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 directs FDA to issue a final guidance that
includes recommendations to clarify and advance the use of DCTs to support the development of
drugs and devices. 6 This guidance provides recommendations related to FDA’s requirements for
investigations of medical products when applied to DCTs and fulfills the requirement set forth in
section 3606(a)(2) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023. The content described in
section 3606(b) of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 is further addressed through this
guidance’s reference to the guidance for industry, investigators, and other stakeholders entitled
Digital Health Technologies for Remote Data Acquisition in Clinical Investigations (December
2023).
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.
II.

BACKGROUND

Many clinical trials already include decentralized elements. For example, laboratory tests are
often conducted by clinical laboratory facilities at locations remote from traditional clinical
trial sites. DCTs have the potential to expand access to more representative patient populations
and improve trial efficiencies. 7 Advances in using electronic communications and information
technology to interact with trial participants in different locations (i.e., telehealth) allow for
fewer in-person visits to traditional clinical trial sites. Digital health technologies (DHTs), for
example, have expanded the types of trial-related data that can be obtained remotely from trial
participants. By enabling remote participation, DCTs may enhance convenience for trial
participants, reduce the burden on caregivers, and facilitate research on rare diseases and
diseases affecting populations with limited mobility or limited access to traditional clinical trial
sites. This may help improve trial participant engagement, recruitment, enrollment, and retention
of a more representative trial participant population to improve the strength and generalizability
of the evidence produced by the trial.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Trials where all activities are decentralized may be appropriate for investigational products
(IPs) that have well-characterized safety profiles (see section III.G) and do not require complex
preparation, administration, or medical assessments. Alternatively, there may be cases when the
administration of an IP or a complex medical assessment needs to be performed at a traditional
clinical trial site and some follow-up assessments could be performed remotely through
electronic patient-reported outcome measures, via telehealth or in-home visits, or by local HCPs,
as appropriate.
Challenges related to DCTs may include coordination of trial activities with individuals and
facilities in multiple locations that are not traditional clinical trial sites. Specific plans to
facilitate decentralization of the trial should include, as appropriate, the use of local HCPs, local
clinical laboratory facilities, and local health care facilities; visits to trial participants’ homes;
and direct distribution of the IP to trial participants at their locations. 8 Specific issues related to
the feasibility, design, implementation, or analysis of a DCT should be discussed early with the
relevant FDA review divisions. 9,10 Appropriate training, oversight, and up-front and continuing
risk assessment and management will be key to implementing a DCT successfully.
III.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING DCTS

The sections below provide guidance on specific topics for implementing decentralized elements
in clinical trials.
A.

DCT Design and Conduct

In a DCT, some or all trial-related activities will occur at locations other than traditional clinical
trial sites (e.g., the participant’s home, mobile research units, or local health care facilities).
DCTs may involve a network of locations where trial personnel and local HCPs work and where
trial-related activities (e.g., imaging and laboratory tests) are performed. Whether trial-related
activities are performed by local HCPs or trial personnel, the clinical trial should be designed to

See 21 CFR 312.57(a), 312.60, 312.62(a), 812.100, 812.110, 812.140(a)(2), and 812.140(b)(2) (describing
requirements for IP accountability and disposition of the IP).

See the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA
Products (September 2023) and the draft guidance for industry Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or
Applicants of BsUFA Products (August 2023). When final, these guidances will represent FDA’s current thinking
on these topics. See also the guidance for industry and FDA staff Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical
Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program (June 2023).

The principles discussed in this guidance may be relevant for bioequivalence studies conducted to support
abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). If an ANDA applicant is interested in conducting a bioequivalence
study using decentralized elements, CDER’s Office of Generic Drugs encourages submission of controlled
correspondence or a pre-ANDA meeting request (if applicable) to discuss the design, analysis, and implementation
of the study before conducting it. See the guidance for industry Controlled Correspondence Related to Generic
Drug Development (March 2024). For submitting a pre-ANDA meeting request, see the guidance for industry
Formal Meetings Between FDA and ANDA Applicants of Complex Products Under GDUFA (October 2022).

limit variability in the data collected by including, as applicable, specific instructions in the
protocol for performing these activities.
DCTs that permit tests to be performed independently by participants at home (e.g., spirometry)
may introduce variability compared to tests performed under supervision at traditional clinical
trial sites. Training or video supervision (i.e., during a telehealth visit) may reduce such
variability. Likewise, allowing participants to choose whether an assessment will be performed
at a traditional clinical trial site or remotely may result in bias (e.g., sicker participants may
prefer remote visits). The protocol should specify which visits will be conducted at traditional
clinical trial sites, which visits will be conducted remotely, and which visits can be left to
participants’ choice. In general, obtaining patient input may be helpful in ensuring that the
clinical trial design fits participants’ needs and that remote activities are feasible.
When designing a trial with decentralized elements, certain statistical approaches may be
challenging to implement. For example, when the effect size of an active control, such as a drug
indicated for sleep disorders, has been determined based upon data collected at traditional
clinical trial sites, the same effect size may not be seen for the active control assessed remotely in
a DCT (e.g., via telehealth or in a participant’s home). This may present challenges in
calculating a non-inferiority margin. Sponsors should consult with the relevant FDA review
division when planning a non-inferiority trial in a DCT setting.
B.

Remote Clinical Trial Visits and Clinical Trial-Related Activities

Remote clinical trial visits and clinical trial-related activities are important strategies to make
trials more convenient and more accessible to trial participants. Remote clinical trial visits may
include telehealth visits, participant visits to local HCPs, or in-person visits by trial personnel or
local HCPs to participants’ homes. The following should be considered when planning remote
clinical trial visits or remote clinical trial-related activities:
•

When designing a DCT, sponsors can consider telehealth visits instead of in-person visits
with trial participants if no in-person interaction is needed. The sponsor should consider
the IP and the medical condition of the anticipated trial population when determining
whether telehealth visits are appropriate. The protocol should specify when a telehealth
visit with a trial participant is appropriate and when a participant should be seen in
person.

•

Investigators should take measures to ensure the privacy of in-home and telehealth visits.
For participants sharing their residence with others, this may involve accommodating
times most suitable for participants and the possibility of using convenient locations
outside of participants’ homes.

•

In-person visits and trial-related activities can be conducted by trial personnel who are
sent to participants’ homes or participants’ preferred locations.

•

Depending on the trial protocol, in-person visits and trial-related activities may also be
conducted by HCPs who are located close to trial participants’ homes. Investigators may
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
use these local HCPs (such as doctors or nurses) to perform certain trial-related activities;
for example, on a fee-for-service basis. The trial-related activities local HCPs perform
should not differ from those that they are qualified to perform in clinical practice and
should not require a detailed knowledge of the protocol, investigator’s brochure, or IP
(e.g., performing physical examinations or obtaining vital signs). These local HCPs
would not be considered trial personnel, nor would they be considered subinvestigators in
a drug trial. 11
•

Trial-related activities that are unique to a research study (i.e., not routine in clinical
practice) and/or require a detailed knowledge of the protocol, investigator’s brochure, or
IP should be performed by qualified trial personnel who have been appropriately trained
on the protocol. When applicable, both trial personnel and trial participants should be
trained on how to conduct or participate in a telehealth visit and other visits not
conducted at traditional clinical trial sites (e.g., home visits).

•

Study records should indicate if a visit was conducted via telehealth and should include
the date of the visit and the name of the person who conducted the visit.

•

The trial protocol should specify how adverse events identified remotely will be
evaluated and managed. The protocol should describe how care will be provided for
adverse events that require urgent or in-person attention.

•

Sponsors and investigators should ensure that remote clinical trial visits conducted via
telehealth comply with laws governing telehealth in the relevant U.S. States or territories
and other countries, as applicable.
C.

Digital Health Technologies

DHTs may allow transmission of data remotely and securely from trial participants wherever
they are located. The sponsor should consider the following information regarding the use of
DHTs in a DCT:
•

The guidance for industry, investigators, and other stakeholders Digital Health
Technologies for Remote Data Acquisition in Clinical Investigations provides
recommendations to sponsors, clinical investigators, and other parties for measuring
clinical events and characteristics of interest using DHTs to acquire data remotely from
participants in clinical trials evaluating drugs, biological products, and devices. The
guidance discusses, among other things, selection of DHTs for use in clinical trials;
verification, validation, and usability evaluations; use of DHTs to collect data for clinical
trial endpoints; training on the use of DHTs; and management of risks related to the use

Local HCPs can also be utilized in clinical trials that are integrated into routine clinical practice. See the draft
guidance for industry Integrating Randomized Controlled Trials for Drug and Biological Products Into Routine
Clinical Practice (September 2024). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
of DHTs in clinical trials. Other issues regarding the use of DHTs in clinical
investigations are discussed in other FDA guidances. 12
•

Sponsors should ensure that DHTs used in a DCT are available and suitable for use by all
trial participants. When a trial permits participants to use their own DHTs, sponsorprovided DHTs should be available as an option to ensure that participants who do not
have a protocol-specified DHT are not excluded from the DCT for that reason (e.g.,
lower socioeconomic groups who cannot afford the DHT). Sponsor-provided
telecommunication services should also be made available as needed so that participants
who have no or limited access to these services are not excluded from the clinical
investigation.
D.

Roles and Responsibilities

The roles and responsibilities of sponsors and investigators are described below.
1.
•

The Sponsor

Sponsor responsibilities are the same for trials that include decentralized elements and
trials that do not include decentralized elements. 13 Because DCTs may involve many
contracted services, sponsors should ensure proper coordination of decentralized
elements (e.g., use of remote trial personnel for at-home visits, use of local HCPs, direct
shipping of IP to participants) (see sections III.B and III.H). Such contracted services
may be performed by networks of local HCPs (e.g., local clinic networks, pharmacy
chains). Sponsors should ensure these networks of local HCPs are qualified to perform
the contracted activities. Sponsors should also keep a record of these networks and other
contracted service providers, including their roles and assigned activities.

See the revised draft guidance for industry Electronic Systems, Electronic Records, and Electronic Signatures in
Clinical Investigations: Questions and Answers (March 2023). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s
current thinking on this topic. For more information on FDA’s regulation of DHTs, consult the Guidances with
Digital Health Content web page, available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-centerexcellence/guidances-digital-health-content.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

The clinical trial population should reflect the intended patient population for the medical
product being studied, including with respect to race, ethnicity, age, sex, and geographic
location, as applicable. 14 Outreach through local health care institutions (e.g.,
pharmacies, clinics) may facilitate recruitment of participants with diverse demographic
characteristics more reflective of the intended patient population in areas where there are
limited or no traditional clinical trial sites. Bringing trial-related activities to participants’
homes may reduce the need for travel and improve engagement, recruitment, and
retention amongst potential participants who have challenges accessing traditional
clinical trial sites. The use of local HCPs close to potential participants’ homes may
further improve engagement, recruitment, and retention of a more representative
participant population and reduce cultural or linguistic barriers to participation in clinical
trials.

•

To account for multiple sources of data collection in a DCT, the sponsor should include
at least the following in a data management plan or other trial-related documents:
- Data origin and data flow from all sources to the sponsor (see section III.J) (e.g., a
diagram that depicts the flow of data from creation to final storage)
- Methods and technologies used for remote data acquisition from trial participants,
trial personnel, and contracted service providers (e.g., local clinical laboratory
facilities and local HCPs who perform trial-related activities) 15
- A list identifying service providers for data collection, handling, and management

•

Sponsors should describe in the trial protocol or other trial-related documents how
operational aspects of the DCT will be implemented. This description should cover, but
may not be limited to, the following:
- Scheduled and unscheduled clinical trial visits
- Activities to be performed by trial personnel and those that may be performed by
local HCPs

See the draft guidance for industry Diversity Action Plans to Improve Enrollment of Participants from
Underrepresented Populations in Clinical Studies (June 2024). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s
current thinking on this topic. See also the guidance for industry Enhancing the Diversity of Clinical Trial

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
- Transmission of reports on activities performed at different locations (e.g.,
medical imaging; clinical laboratory tests; and procedures performed at trial
participants’ homes, work, or other local facilities)
- Delivery of IPs to trial participants, if applicable, and accountability for IPs
- Safety monitoring and management of adverse events
•

Study records should capture the visit type (i.e., telehealth or in person), the visit location
(e.g., participant’s home, local health care facility, traditional clinical trial site), the date
of the visit, and the data originator. 16

•

Sponsors should ensure compliance with local laws, regulations, and licensing
requirements governing medical practice and IP administration relevant to the conduct of
a DCT. This may involve addressing laws in multiple U.S. States, territories, and other
countries.

•

Sponsors must ensure proper monitoring of an investigation. 17 As with any trial,
sponsors may use a variety of approaches to monitor DCTs, and the monitoring plan for a
trial should be based on the sponsor’s risk assessment. 18 A trial monitoring plan should
(1) describe how monitoring will be implemented to assess protocol compliance and data
quality and integrity, (2) specify the frequency with which trial records and source
documents will be reviewed, and (3) note any unique aspects related to the decentralized
elements. FDA recommends risk-based monitoring approaches and the use of centralized
monitoring to identify and proactively follow up on missing data, inconsistent data, data
outliers, and potential protocol deviations that may be indicative of systemic or
significant errors.
2.

The Investigator and Delegation of Trial-Related Activities

Investigators are responsible for the conduct of the DCT and for protecting the rights, safety, and
welfare of subjects under their care. 19 Investigators must also maintain accurate records of each
subject’s case history, including observations and other data pertinent to the investigation. 20
Consistent with these responsibilities, investigators should review data from other trial personnel
and local HCPs, as applicable, and follow up on any data that are missing, concerning, or appear
to be in error. Investigators must also ensure assessments are being completed consistent with

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the protocol 21 and confirm that participants have received the IP. 22 When permitted by the
protocol, 23 investigators can delegate trial-related activities to appropriate local HCPs.
Investigators can work with enrolled participants to identify such providers when appropriate.
Investigators must ensure that trial-related activities delegated to local HCPs are conducted
according to the investigational plan and applicable regulations and remain responsible for the
adequate supervision of those to whom they have delegated these activities. 24,25
The extent of decentralization in a clinical trial may vary depending on the investigator’s use of
telehealth, trial personnel working remotely, local HCPs, and/or DHTs. Whether all activities
can be decentralized depends on the types of assessments and procedures needed to collect
endpoints and monitor safety. Additional training, coordination, and standard operating
procedures may be needed for decentralized elements to ensure consistent implementation.
•

When permitted by the trial protocol, 26 investigators may delegate trial-related activities
that require in-person interactions to appropriate local HCPs (e.g., physical examinations
and other medical procedures). These procedures may take place at participants’ homes,
local health care facilities, or other suitable locations convenient for participants.

•

As part of the requirement that investigators protect the safety of subjects, 27 investigators
should evaluate reports from local HCPs of abnormal signs or symptoms detected at inperson visits. Investigators should follow up with participants as appropriate.

•

Videoconferencing may be useful to allow investigators to oversee trial personnel
performing activities described in the trial protocol (e.g., photographing lesions, fitting
wearable sensors) at participants’ locations.

•

Investigators should enroll only as many trial participants as they can appropriately
manage to ensure adequate supervision of DCT-related activities.

•

As for any drug trial required to be conducted under an investigational new drug
application (IND) under 21 CFR part 312, Form FDA 1572 must be completed by all
investigators. 28 The decision to include individuals as subinvestigators in a DCT should

be based on their assigned responsibilities. When trial personnel contribute directly and
significantly to the trial data (e.g., assessing adverse events, performing a clinical
outcome assessment, applying a protocol-defined scoring system) or require a detailed
knowledge of the protocol, investigator’s brochure, or IP, they should be included on
Form FDA 1572 as subinvestigators. 29 Individuals who are not subinvestigators should
not be listed on Form FDA 1572. In addition, as part of the IND, sponsors must submit a
list of all investigators and subinvestigators. 30
•

Investigators do not need to maintain a log of local HCPs performing trial-related
activities. However, as part of preparing and maintaining adequate case histories,
investigators should ensure that reports from local HCPs include the name of the local
HCP and the date when activities were performed. 31

•

For device investigations, investigator and sponsor responsibilities under 21 CFR part
812 include the requirement that there be a signed agreement between the investigator
and sponsor (see 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4) and 812.100). A list of all investigators in the
study is also required as part of an investigational device exemption (IDE) application
(see 21 CFR 812.20(b)(4) and (b)(5) and 812.150(b)(4)). Local HCPs who provide trialrelated services that are part of routine clinical practice and where a detailed knowledge
of the protocol or IP is not required are not considered investigators and should not be
included in the IDE list of investigators.

•

Investigators should communicate any specific instructions included in the protocol to
local HCPs for trial-related activities they are delegated to perform (e.g., having
participants rest for 5 minutes before measuring a blood pressure) to limit variability and
to ensure consistency and completeness of the data. Investigators should also review data
provided by local HCPs regularly to ensure data quality.

•

Some trial protocols will include designated clinical laboratory facilities 32 to perform
activities required by the protocol (e.g., phlebotomy, x-rays). Other trial protocols may
permit the use of a variety of clinical laboratory facilities close to the trial participant to
perform these activities. Use of local clinical laboratory facilities is generally appropriate
for routine clinical tests that are well standardized. Designated clinical laboratory

facilities should be used for tests that are specialized or specific to the trial. If
appropriate, specimens from trial participants (e.g., blood, sputum) may be collected by
remote trial personnel, local HCPs, local clinical laboratory facilities, or participants
using home collection kits and sent to designated clinical laboratory facilities for
processing.
•

For drug trials required to be conducted under an IND, all clinical laboratory facilities
must be listed on Form FDA 1572. 33 For device trials, clinical laboratories should be
identified in the investigational plan as appropriate (e.g., specifying clinical laboratories
that are traditional clinical trial sites in in vitro diagnostic device studies, 34 identifying
use of core labs for performing critical tests, outlining plans to use local labs not
associated with traditional clinical trial sites). The investigator should maintain a record
of any clinical laboratory facilities used by participants under their supervision that are
added during the course of either a drug or device trial. If a network of clinical
laboratories is used, the name and address of the network headquarters may be listed
instead of individual satellite clinical laboratories.

•

As in any trial, participants experiencing any health emergency (e.g., hypoglycemia or
abnormal cardiac rhythm) should seek medical attention at local health care facilities
(such as an emergency room), as appropriate. With the permission of trial participants,
investigators should obtain reports from these local health care facilities.
E.

FDA Oversight

FDA uses a variety of tools to conduct oversight of regulated entities (e.g., sponsors and clinical
investigators). This includes inspections conducted under sections 704(a)(1) or 704(a)(5) of the
FD&C Act 35 and, when appropriate, remote regulatory assessments. 36 For FDA inspections of
clinical investigators, the investigator should identify a physical location where a responsible
person is available to facilitate the FDA inspectors’ access to trial-related records (either paper or
electronic access) for participants under the clinical investigator’s care and to facilitate
interviews with trial personnel (either in person or remotely). For INDs, the investigators
33

See 21 CFR 312.53(c)(iv).

For certain device studies, information on the clinical laboratory may need to be included in the IDE application.
See, e.g., 21 CFR 812.20(b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(6), and (b)(7). For example, for some in vitro diagnostic studies, a
clinical laboratory may be the sponsor of the study or a traditional clinical trial site at which the investigator is
located.
34

Generally, an inspection, such as described in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)), involves
duly designated officers or employees of the FDA physically entering (at reasonable times and in a reasonable
manner) establishments subject to regulation under the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable
requirements. See section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act; see also FDA’s Investigations Operations Manual, Section
2.2.3, Authority to Inspect (2024).

35

See section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act. See also the draft guidance for industry Conducting Remote Regulatory
Assessments: Questions and Answers (January 2024). When final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current

for inspection purposes.
F.

Informed Consent and Institutional Review Board Oversight

Obtaining informed consent remotely may be considered as part of a DCT. Institutional review
board (IRB) oversight is required to ensure the process is adequate and appropriate. 37

37

•

Investigators may obtain informed consent (either electronically or on paper) from trial
participants at their remote locations provided that all applicable regulatory requirements
are met. 38 The process of obtaining informed consent from participants at their remote
locations can include a remote visit. Obtaining informed consent is an investigator
responsibility. 39 If the investigator delegates this responsibility, the individual obtaining
informed consent should, among other things, have a detailed knowledge of the protocol
and have the appropriate training and credentials to be able to address any questions or
concerns the subject may have about the trial. 40 FDA therefore does not consider
obtaining informed consent to be an appropriate activity for a local HCP to perform.

•

With a DCT, the informed consent process must include notifying participants (or their
legally authorized representatives) of whom to contact for answers to pertinent questions
about the research and research subjects’ rights and whom to contact in the event of a
research-related injury to the subject in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. 41

•

When appropriate, FDA recommends the use of a central IRB in DCTs to facilitate
efficient review of the protocol, the informed consent documents, and other relevant trialrelated information. 42

21 CFR 56.109, 56.111, 312.66, and 812.42.

For FDA regulations about informed consent, see 21 CFR part 50 (including the elements of informed consent
under 21 CFR 50.25 and the documentation of informed consent under 21 CFR 50.27). For additional information,

Investigational Products in a DCT

1.

Drugs and Biological Products

The administration of an IP to participants must be performed under the supervision of the
investigator or subinvestigator responsible to the investigator. 43 The investigator shall not
supply the investigational drug to any person not authorized to receive the IP. 44 Sponsors should
consider the nature of the IP when determining whether administration outside of a traditional
clinical trial site in a DCT is appropriate. Administration of IP that has a high-risk safety profile,
especially in the immediate post-administration period; that is in early stages of development
such that the safety profile is not well defined; or that requires complex preparation,
administration, or medical assessments may need in-person supervision by the investigator at a
traditional clinical trial site. Alternatively, it may be appropriate for local HCPs or trial
personnel working remotely to administer an IP at, for example, local health care facilities,
mobile research units, or participants’ homes if the safety profile of the IP is well characterized
and specialized monitoring during the immediate period following administration is not
needed. 45
Depending on the safety profile of the IP (e.g., a class of drug with a risk of hypersensitivity,
abuse potential) and the type of trial (e.g., dose escalation trial), sponsors should estimate the
urgency and complexity of care that may be needed based upon risks related to the IP and the
underlying condition in the population being studied. Investigators should take steps to help
ensure that participants have access to an appropriate level of local care.
Drugs best suited for direct shipment to the participant’s home include those with good stability
profiles. Drugs that involve specialized handling, shipping, and storage conditions may not be
suited for direct shipment to locations outside the traditional clinical trial site.

2.

Medical Devices

When determining the appropriate use or administration of an investigational device in a DCT,
sponsors should consider the type of medical device, its intended use, its instructions for use, and
the potential risks of the device for participants.
Investigational devices intended for home use may be appropriate for use by trial participants
without the investigator’s direct oversight when such direct oversight is not needed to mitigate
potential serious risks to trial participants. Investigational devices that are not intended for selfuse (i.e., devices used in hospital or ambulatory care settings) should be used or administered by
qualified trial personnel with investigator oversight. An investigator shall not supply an
investigational device to any person not authorized under 21 CFR part 812 to receive it. 46
Certain follow-up assessments or procedures needed after using the investigational device or
after surgical implantation of the device in trial participants may be performed by appropriately
qualified and trained local HCPs or trial personnel via telehealth visits, at the homes of trial
participants, or in local health care facilities. A telehealth visit may be appropriate if an
assessment in that setting does not pose significant risk to trial participants and if there are plans
in place to ensure that adverse events identified during such visits will be properly assessed,
managed, and documented.
H.

Packaging and Shipping of Investigational Products

In some cases, DCTs may involve the direct distribution of IPs to trial participants or local
HCPs. In these cases, investigators must remain responsible for supervising the supply of IP to
trial participants or local HCPs. 47 When applicable, trial personnel should be trained on
procedures and appropriate documentation for handling, packaging, shipping, and tracking IPs.
When IPs are directly distributed to trial participants or local HCPs, such as through a central
distribution service, the investigator must authorize the release of the IP by the distributor;
ensure receipt by trial participants or local HCPs, which should be done according to procedures
described in the investigational plan or other trial-related documents; and document the return or
disposal of any unused product as directed by the sponsor. 48 When IPs are shipped directly to
participants, investigators should ensure participants have appropriate instructions for use of the
product.
Sponsors should address the following in trial-related documents:
•

How the physical integrity and stability of the IP will be maintained during shipment,
including appropriate packaging materials and methods (e.g., temperature control).

46

See 21 CFR 812.110.

I.

Safety Monitoring in DCTs

To protect the safety and welfare of trial participants in a DCT, sponsors should implement a
safety monitoring plan that addresses the following:
•

The safety monitoring plan should take the decentralized nature of the clinical trial into
account and ensure that adverse events and medication errors are appropriately collected
and adequately addressed. 52 Generally, adverse events should be captured during
scheduled visits with investigators or trial personnel. However, there may be instances
when local HCPs performing trial-related activities become aware of a concerning sign,
symptom, or clinical event. The safety monitoring plan should describe how local HCPs
will be instructed to report such findings.

•

As in any clinical trial, the safety monitoring plan should describe how participants are
expected to respond to and report adverse events, including where to seek medical
assistance locally when necessary and where to receive follow-up care. 53

•

When applicable, the safety monitoring plan should describe the type of information that
will be collected by a DHT, how that information will be used and monitored, and what

action trial participants or personnel should take in response to abnormal findings or
electronic alerts. 54
Trial participants should have clear instructions about how to contact trial personnel to report
adverse events and to have pertinent questions answered. Trial participants should also be able
to arrange for an unscheduled visit with trial personnel using telehealth or an in-person visit, as
appropriate (see section III.B).
If unreasonable and significant safety risks emerge because of use of an IP (e.g., due to remote
administration), sponsors must discontinue all or part of the trial presenting the risk (e.g.,
discontinue remote administration or use) and notify FDA, the IRB, and all investigators who
have participated in the trial. 55
If authorized in the protocol, routine safety monitoring involving laboratory testing and imaging
may be performed using local clinical laboratory facilities close to trial participants (see section
III.D.2). Investigators should ensure they promptly receive reports of these tests and review
them in a timely manner.

Electronic Systems Used When Conducting DCTs

Electronic systems can be used to perform multiple functions to manage DCT operations,
including:
- Managing electronic informed consent (e.g., maintaining approved versions of
informed consent, documenting IRB approval, archiving signed forms)
- Capturing and storing reports from remote trial personnel, local HCPs, and local
clinical laboratory facilities
- Managing electronic case report forms (eCRFs)
- Scheduling trial visits and other trial activities
- Tracking IPs that are shipped directly to trial participants
- Syncing information recorded by DHTs
- Serving as communication tools between trial personnel and trial participants

54
For more information on safety monitoring as it relates to DHTs used in clinical investigations, see the guidance
for industry, investigators, and other stakeholders Digital Health Technologies for Remote Data Acquisition in
Clinical Investigations.

•

Training should be provided to all parties (e.g., trial personnel, local HCPs, and trial
participants) who are using electronic systems to support the conduct of DCTs.

•

There are several ways local HCPs can submit trial-related data for inclusion in clinical
trial records, including but not limited to the following:
- An eCRF can be designed to allow local HCPs to enter trial-related data directly
into the eCRF. 56
- Local HCPs can send forms or documents electronically by methods of secure
data transfer (e.g., via secure email or fax) to investigators who are responsible for
entering these trial-related data into the eCRF and retaining the trial-related
records. 57

•

Remote trial personnel or local HCPs submitting trial data directly into the eCRF should
be included in the sponsor’s list of authorized data originators. 58

•

Electronic systems that are used to produce and process trial records required by the
FD&C Act and FDA regulations are subject to 21 CFR part 11. 59 These systems must
ensure data reliability, security, privacy, and confidentiality. 60

•

FDA considers real-time video and audio interactions as a live exchange of information
between trial personnel and trial participants. These live interactions are not considered
electronic records and, therefore, are not subject to 21 CFR part 11, but other
requirements governing telehealth, including local laws, may apply. However, the visits
must be documented (e.g., visit notes), 61 and if such documents are in electronic form,
they must be captured in systems that are subject to the requirements in 21 CFR part 11. 62
Investigators should ensure the privacy and security of these real-time visits.
