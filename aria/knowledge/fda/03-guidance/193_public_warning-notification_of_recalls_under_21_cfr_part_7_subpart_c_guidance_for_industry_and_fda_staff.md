Public Warning and Notification of
Recalls Under
21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
This guidance represent the current thinking of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA,
we, or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on the FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA
staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction:
The purpose of this guidance is to assist and provide recommendations to industry and FDA staff
regarding the use, content, and circumstances for issuance of public warnings and public
notifications for firm-initiated or FDA-requested recalls under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C –
Recalls (Including Product Corrections) –Guidance on Policy, Procedures, and Industry
Responsibilities. The guidance also discusses what information should be included in a public
warning, as well as the parties responsible for issuing it. It represents FDA’s current thinking on
public warning and notification of recalls under 21 CFR Part 7.
This guidance applies to voluntary recalls of products subject to FDA’s jurisdiction, including
any food, drug, and device intended for human or animal use, any cosmetic and biologic
intended for human use, any tobacco product intended for human use, and any item subject to a
quarantine regulation under 21 CFR Part 1240. However, it does not apply to radiation emitting
electronic products which are governed only by 21 CFR Parts 1003 and 1004.
FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead,
guidance describes the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the
word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not
required.

II. Terminology:
Recall
Recall means a firm’s removal or correction of a marketed product that FDA considers to be in
violation of the laws it administers and against which the Agency would initiate legal action,
e.g., seizure. Recall does not include a market withdrawal or a stock recovery.1 (21 CFR
§7.3(g))
Recall Determination
A recall determination is the assessment the FDA makes in deciding that a firm’s ongoing or
completed removal or correction of a marketed violative product constitutes a recall as defined at
21 CFR § 7.3(g). A firm’s characterization of its action is not determinative of whether the FDA
would determine that the action is a recall. A firm’s action constitutes a recall when it meets the
definition of “recall” under 21 CFR § 7.3(g).
Recall Classification
Recall classification means the numerical designation, i.e., I, II, or III, assigned by the FDA to a
particular product recall to indicate the relative degree of health hazard presented by the product
being recalled or considered for recall. (21 CFR §§ 7.3(m), 7.41(b)). The determination is made
on the basis of the health hazard evaluation and in consideration of the factors provided at 21
CFR § 7.41.
Public Warning
The purpose of a public warning under 21 CFR Part 7 is to alert the public that a product being
recalled presents a serious health hazard. It is reserved for urgent situations where other means
of preventing use of the recalled product appear inadequate. (21 CFR § 7.42(b)(2)).2 Public
warnings under 21 CFR Part 7 can be disseminated through general or specialized news media,
e.g., professional or trade press, and/or to specific segments of the population such as physicians,
hospitals, etc. The FDA may issue public warnings in a variety of forms, including, but not
limited to, press releases, emails, and web and social media postings.
Public Notification of Recalls
The FDA promptly makes available to the public in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report a
descriptive listing of each new recall according to its classification, whether it was FDArequested or firm-initiated, and the specific action being taken by the recalling firm. (21 CFR §
1

21 CFR § 7.3(j) defines market withdrawal to mean a firm's removal or correction of a distributed product which
involves a minor violation that would not be subject to legal action by the Food and Drug Administration or which
involves no violation, e.g., normal stock rotation practices, routine equipment adjustments and repairs, etc. Stock
recovery means a firm's removal or correction of a product that has not been marketed or that has not left the direct
control of the firm, i.e., the product is located on premises owned by, or under the control of, the firm and no portion
of the lot has been released for sale or use. 21 CFR § 7.3(k).
2
In addition to the public warning authority described in 21 CFR Part 7, the Agency has other authorities to
disseminate information in an array of circumstances, for example, the Secretary’s authority in 21 U.S.C. 375(b) to
disseminate information about FDA regulated products in situations that the Secretary determines involve imminent
danger to health or gross deception of the consumer . Nothing in this guidance is meant to define, shape, or limit
those authorities in any way.

7.50).
Confidential Commercial Information (CCI)
Commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential means valuable data or
information which is used in one's business and is of a type customarily held in strict confidence
or regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by the person to whom it
belongs. (21 CFR § 20.61(b)).
III. Discussion:
The FDA’s policy is to evaluate the particular circumstances of each individual recall in
determining whether a public warning is needed in accordance with 21 CFR § 7.42(b)(2) as part
of the recall strategy. The FDA may issue a public warning or notification before formally
classifying a recall under 21 CFR § 7.41(b). We note that due to the level of hazard associated
with Class I recalls, the FDA has generally issued, and/or sought issuance of, public warnings in
Class I or potential Class I recalls unless specific circumstances indicate that one would not be
beneficial to the public. The FDA also recommends and/or issues public warnings for some
urgent Class II recalls that, while not rising to Class I hazards, still present a serious hazard to
health.3
Once the FDA makes a recall determination or classification, the recall will be listed in the
weekly FDA Enforcement Report in accordance with 21 CFR §7.50.
A. Public Warnings
1. Under what circumstances should firms issue public warnings?
Public warnings are for urgent situations and are issued to alert the public that a product being
recalled presents a serious hazard to health, and where other means for preventing the use of a
recalled product appear inadequate. For instance, public warnings may be appropriate for urgent
recalls of prescription drugs or medical devices when retail level consignees cannot identify
persons to whom the drug or device was dispensed. A public warning is also often needed when
a recalled product has been widely distributed.
On the other hand, when recalled products have only been distributed to direct accounts4, and the
recalling firm has records that show exactly where the products have gone, a prompt and
effective communication to such accounts informing them of the recall may be adequate to

3

FDA has recommended public warnings for Class II recalls involving, for example, foods with low levels of
undeclared allergens (e.g., wheat). While the adverse health consequences may be remote or temporary, FDA is
committed to acting immediately when necessary to protect the public health.
4
For internet purchases, the consumer level is considered a direct account. For some internet purchases, prompt and
effective communication may not be feasible, and thus distribution to the direct account in an internet transaction
may warrant a public warning. Where communication is feasible, the internet seller should attempt to confirm
receipt of the communication.

prevent the use of a recalled product.5 This could be an instance where the product has only
reached the wholesale level, such as a warehouse or distribution center, and has not been further
distributed to the retail or consumer level.
The FDA generally recommends public warning for recalls that are likely to be classified as, or
have been classified as Class I recalls, unless specific circumstances indicate that the warning
would not be beneficial to the public. Such circumstances could be where there is not adequate
information to convey risk and appropriate actions, or when the product is limited to a small
number of consignees that are easily identified and can be rapidly reached through targeted
contact. Furthermore, different products might dictate different communication considerations.
For instance, during a medical device recall, the FDA may consider how patients respond to a
public warning about a defective product without first having the benefit of consulting with their
physician. In these and similar situations, public warnings may be more confusing than helpful.
The FDA will continue to assess the need for public warnings for voluntary recalls of FDAregulated products based on the particular circumstances of the individual recall. The following
recalls generally present examples of serious hazards to health such that a public warning may be
warranted:


Recalls of food products initiated by a firm after receipt of consumer reports of illness
or injury (including allergic reactions), for which there is an active outbreak
associated with the product or its ingredients, or for which the FDA has substantiated
reports of illness or injury.



Recalls of food products that are intended for or would more likely be consumed by
vulnerable populations. Examples of vulnerable human populations include infants,
toddlers, the elderly, pregnant women, and medically-compromised individuals, who
may be more susceptible to foodborne hazards than healthy persons.



Recalls of food products initiated because of manufacturing deviations where the
consequences of the manufacturing deviations could have significant health impacts;
e.g., under processed low-acid canned foods which could result in botulism if the
product is consumed.



Recalls of food products initiated because of microbiological pathogen findings (e.g.,
Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, etc.) in environmental testing where direct food
manufacturing contact surfaces are found to be contaminated.



Recalls of animal food products which may be contaminated with low levels of drugs
or unsafe food additives. Examples include pet jerky treats contaminated with
antibiotics, and cat food products containing propylene glycol.



Recalls of home use medical devices which could malfunction and lead to incorrect
dosing of drugs or blood volumes.

5

To be adequate to prevent the use of the product, a recalling firm should be able to confirm that business accounts
received the communication and understood the instructions conveyed in the communication. FDA’s model recall
return response form, available in FDA’s Regulatory Procedures Manual, is one way a recalling firm can document
such confirmation from business accounts.



Recalls of sterile injectable drug products which may contain particulate matter.



Recalls of implantable pacemakers or defibrillators where the device’s battery may
fail suddenly and without warning.

The FDA may issue or supplement a firm’s public warning, among other actions, in the
following situations: a firm refuses to issue its own public warning when recommended or
requested by the FDA, an ongoing recall or public warning is not prompt or effective, or the
FDA learns of a completed recall where new adverse events associated with the product are
reported after completion of the recall. The FDA will generally provide a timeframe for when the
firm should issue a public warning based on the circumstances of the individual recall. While
timeframes will vary depending on the recall and product, these firms should generally issue a
public warning within 24 hours of the FDA notifying the firm that it believes a public warning is
appropriate.
2. Who prepares public warnings?
The FDA generally gives firms the first opportunity to prepare and issue public warnings during
recalls. For instance, for firm-initiated recalls, recalling firms are expected to develop their own
recall strategy. The recall strategy addresses, among other things, whether a public warning is
needed and how it will be issued. In most cases, the FDA reviews and comments on the recall
strategies, including any public warnings developed by firms (see 21 CFR § 7.42(b)(2)). Firms
should include any drafted public warning as part of their submission of the recall strategy to the
extent that it does not delay strategy development or recall initiation.6 In other situations that
warrant an immediate warning, firms may choose to issue public warnings without the FDA’s
review. The FDA may supplement that warning with its own public statement, if necessary.
When the FDA believes that a public warning is appropriate and the recalling firm does not
include one in its initial recall strategy, the FDA will generally request one from the recalling
firm.
In some situations, the FDA may prepare and issue public warnings on its own initiative and in
accordance with 21 CFR § 7.42(b)(2). This may occur, for instance, when the public needs
immediate warning concerning a product and the firm has not issued a public warning or a firm’s
public warning is deficient. The FDA will ordinarily work with the recalling firm to ensure the
factual accuracy of a public warning. However, the FDA is not required to contact the firm
before issuing a public warning or allow its review of the proposed statement.
If a firm issues a public warning that is deficient in any respect (see also section III.A.3 in this
document), the FDA may supplement or correct that warning with its own public warning. If a
firm’s public warning is not reasonably likely to be adequately received by the target audience,
the FDA may ask the firm to reissue its public warning and/or the FDA may issue its own public
warning. Additionally, the FDA may publicly issue information that may address outstanding
questions about the nature of the incident and/or the Agency’s actions.
Firms are reminded that, under 21 CFR § 7.42, they need not delay the initiation of a recall pending the FDA’s
review of their recall strategy.

3. What information should be contained in a public warning?
The purpose of a public warning is to alert the public that a product being recalled presents a
serious hazard to health. As such, a public warning should include: a) information to help
identify the recalled product including images, numerical product information (e.g., lot number,
expiration date, serial number, unique device identification (UDI) number), packaging
information or brand names; b) the geographic areas and dates of distribution of the affected
product; c) a thorough description of the product defect, health hazard involved, and reason(s)
for recall (e.g., product testing, environmental sampling, etc.); d) the name and contact
information for the recalling firm; e) instructions to consumers or users; f) the number and nature
of any illnesses/injuries/complaints associated with the product, related to the product defect; and
g) a description of common symptoms of any illness of concern. The headline of the public
warning should include the brand name, type of product, and the hazard prompting the recall
(e.g., “XYZ chocolate chip cookies recalled for potential Salmonella contamination.”).
In some cases, it may also be necessary to include the recalling firm’s supply-chain relationships
in order to alert the public of the product being recalled. When possible, the FDA encourages
firms to provide specifics about firms it sold product to in order to help people better identify and
avoid recalled product.7
What should not be included
Public warnings should not contain content that detracts from or defeats the purpose of the
warning. Brief and succinct warnings are generally better at informing consumers of a product
hazard and helping consumers understand the importance of avoiding the product. On the other
hand, messages that cloud or lengthen a warning may distract a consumer and should be avoided.
Generally, firms should not promote the qualities of the product being recalled, other products
sold by the firm, or the firm in general, as part of a public warning. Phrases such as “an
abundance of caution,” that can be seen as trying to minimize the hazard, should not be used, for
example, when illnesses or injury have resulted, or when there are positive results for pathogens
associated with the finished product or ingredients.
What might make a public warning deficient
A public warning may be considered deficient if, among other things, it does not adequately
identify the recalled product, describe the health hazard involved, or identify relevant
information about the product’s distribution. A public warning might also be considered
deficient if, on the basis of the FDA’s media monitoring, it is determined that the warning did
not sufficiently reach the target audience (e.g., the firm’s release was not disseminated
sufficiently by the news media; the firm’s warning for a nationally-distributed product was
issued only to a regional audience; no Spanish translation was made available for a product
largely used by Spanish-speaking populations). A factual statement in a firm’s public warning
that the FDA is unable to verify might also cause the FDA to issue a separate public warning.
FDA’s recall communications are intended to be as informative as possible within the scope of the Agency’s
authority for information disclosure. For example, depending on the circumstances, certain information such as
supply-chain relationships and product distribution data may be CCI, which is generally protected from public
disclosure. FDA’s regulations authorize the release of CCI, in relevant part, when necessary to effectuate a recall.
(21 CFR § 20.91).

The FDA will take actions to correct or supplement deficient public warnings as described in this
guidance. The Agency encourages firms issuing public warnings to monitor media coverage and
take further action to raise public awareness if media coverage appears to be insufficient.
4. How are public warnings distributed and displayed?
Firms and the FDA can alert the public about a recall by various means, including issuing press
releases to the media, sending emails to a listserv or subscription service, and posting on the
FDA and company websites or social media. All of these methods could be used to issue a
public warning.
Issuing the Public Warning through a Press Release
It is critical that public warnings are distributed in a way that ensures that the information
conveyed in the warning actually reaches the public. To this end, the FDA is open to different
vehicles of dissemination that best convey the information of the particular recall. Historically,
the FDA and industry have used general news media, as well as specialized news media, e.g.,
professional or trade press, among other means. When warranted, the FDA recommends that
firms use press release distribution services or other mechanisms that ensurethe information in
the press release will be appropriately relayed to the public, e.g., through news media outlets.
Part of a firm’s responsibility to inform a consumer of a recalled product includes taking earnest
efforts to ensure that the information is actually distributed.
Firms issuing public warnings through press releases should also consider the area of distribution
of the recalled product. The distribution of the release should match the distribution of the
product: if the product is available online or is distributed nationally, the public warning should
also be available online and/or distributed nationwide. Similarly, if the product is only available
in a regional market, and the FDA and the firm are confident that no consumers from outside that
region may have received it, the distribution of the public notification may be similarly targeted.
If it is apparent that a significant percentage of consumers using the recalled product speak a
language other than English, firms should consider having the public warning translated into that
language and distributed via the appropriate distribution service.
Posting a Public Warning or Press Release on a firm or FDA Webpage
In many cases, a firm will announce a removal of an FDA regulated product from the market or
correction8 through a press release or other public announcement prior to the FDA reviewing and
determining the action to be a recall. The FDA may post the information in or the text of the
announcement on FDA.gov/recalls9 if the FDA believes the announcement is factually correct
and beneficial to consumers.
The FDA does not typically post a firm’s announcement of an action that the FDA believes will
8

A correction is a repair, modification, adjustment, relabeling, destruction or inspection (including patient
monitoring) of a product without its physical removal to some other location. 21 CFR § 7.3(h).

not be considered a recall. Further, not all recalls are posted on the FDA.gov/recalls page since
not all recalls warrant a public warning and not all firms will issue a press release, depending on
the circumstances. When the FDA posts removal or correction information that has been
publicized by a firm, we do so as a public service and it does not necessarily mean that the
situation is urgent or that the product presents a serious hazard to health, such that it would be
considered a “public warning” as the term is defined in this guidance document. Information on
major product recalls that the FDA believes merit expanded coverage due to the impact they
have on public health can be found at
https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/MajorProductRecalls/default.htm. When a firm posts its
public warning on its own webpage, it should ensure that the warning is prominently displayed
and accessible from both its home page and a web search. The posting should remain publicly
accessible until the product is no longer expected to be used or consumed.
B. Public Notification of Recalls
The FDA provides public access to information on recalls by posting a listing of recalls
according to their classification in the FDA Enforcement Report, whether they were requested by
FDA or firm-initiated, and the specific action taken by the recalling firm.10 The FDA
Enforcement Report is designed to provide a public listing of products in the marketplace that
are being recalled. Unlike with public warnings, the recalls listed in the FDA Enforcement
Report are not limited to urgent situations that present serious hazards to health and are not
necessarily used to alert the public about the risk or hazard of a product under recall.
Information on all recalls will be provided in the FDA Enforcement Report, regardless of the
level of the hazard. The FDA will attempt to promptly post public notifications; however, delays
might occur due to the timeliness of a firm’s recall submission, the availability of facts, and other
factors outside the FDA’s control. The FDA may consider delaying public notification if it may
cause unnecessary and harmful anxiety in certain consumers (e.g., when a patient needs to hear
first from his doctor about a defective implanted medical device). The FDA is not required to
provide firms with an opportunity to review and comment on public notifications, but may
consult with a firm to ensure factual accuracy or when otherwise warranted.
Public notifications of recalls will only be posted in the FDA Enforcement Report after the FDA
makes a determination that the action is a recall under 21 CFR § 7.3(g). If the recall posted in
the FDA Enforcement Report has not yet been classified, the FDA will document the recall as
not yet classified.11
