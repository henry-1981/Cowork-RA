On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.
FDA notes that in particular, the QMSR does not utilize certain terms, such as “Design
Controls,” and “Design Validation.” The elements that comprise these terms are described in
ISO 13485:2016, Clause 7.3 and its subclauses.

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) current thinking on
premarket notifications (510(k)s) appropriate for review as a Special 510(k). The intent of this
guidance is to describe an optional pathway for certain well-defined device modifications where
a manufacturer modifies its own legally marketed device, and design control procedures produce
reliable results that can form, in addition to other 510(k) content requirements, the basis for
substantial equivalence (SE). This guidance clarifies the types of technological changes
appropriate for review as Special 510(k)s. Specifically, within the scope of appropriate changes,
we are including certain design and labeling changes, including changes to the indications for
use, by focusing on whether the method(s) to evaluate the change(s) are well-established, and
whether the results can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format.
The Special 510(k) Program is consistent with FDA’s statutory mission to protect and promote
human health and FDA’s commitment to helping patients gain timely access to new medical
devices that are high quality, safe and effective by using efficient review practices consistent
with least burdensome principles.1 This guidance, provides consistency, clarity, and transparency
to industry to describe when a Special 510(k) is appropriate. This guidance supersedes the
Special 510(k) policy in the “The New 510(k) Paradigm: Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications.”
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
FDA established the Special 510(k) Program in 1998 and described the program and policy in
the guidance document “The New 510(k) Paradigm: Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications” (“New 510(k) Paradigm Guidance”).4 The
program was intended to create an efficient review process for certain changes subject to 510(k)
submission requirements.
Design controls were added to the Quality System (QS) Regulation and have been in effect since
June 1, 1997 (21 CFR 820.30, 61 FR 52602). The Special 510(k) Program leverages design
controls requirements to support SE determinations through the reliance on risk analysis and
verification and validation for existing devices. Special 510(k)s allow FDA and industry to rely
on previous Agency review of detailed information, where appropriate, without altering any
statutory or regulatory requirements related to the premarket notification process under sections
510 and 513 of the FD&C Act, and 21 CFR 807 Subpart E. The Special 510(k) Program
provides a least burdensome approach to the review of certain changes to a manufacturer’s own
legally marketed predicate device (“existing device”) because a Special 510(k) provides an
efficient pathway for manufacturers to provide the minimum required information necessary to
establish SE for a modified device. Because of this efficiency, FDA stated in the New 510(k)
Paradigm Guidance that we intend to process Special 510(k)s within 30 days of receipt by the
Document Control Center, rather than the 90 days for 510(k)s required by section 510(n)(1) of
the FD&C Act.
The Special 510(k) Program was previously limited to review of changes that did not affect the
device’s intended use nor alter the device’s fundamental scientific technology. Under this
approach, Special 510(k)s that included modifications to the indications for use or any labeling
change that affected the device’s intended use and/or modifications that had the potential to alter
the fundamental scientific technology of the device compared to the manufacturer’s own legally
marketed predicate device5 were routinely converted to Traditional 510(k)s. FDA now no longer

The New 510(k) Paradigm Guidance was superseded by this guidance and “The Abbreviated 510(k) Program.”
5
A legally marketed predicate device is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (i.e.,
preamendments), reclassified from class III to class II or class I, found substantially equivalent through a 510(k), or
granted marketing authorization through the De Novo classification process.

intends to focus on changes that affect indications for use or alter fundamental scientific
technology in determining whether the 510(k) is appropriate as a Special 510(k). Instead, FDA’s
approach focuses on whether the method(s) to evaluate the change(s) are well-established, and
whether the results can be sufficiently reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format. A Special
510(k) would generally not be appropriate for devices that manufacture a biological product at
the point of care, because there would likely be no well-established method to evaluate such
changes and/or the performance data would not be reviewable in a summary or risk-analysis
format.
Through the finalization of this guidance, we are updating the Special 510(k) Program to clarify
existing policy and the types of changes appropriate for the program to improve the efficiency of
510(k) review. Under this approach, certain changes to the indications for use may be made.
FDA has also clarified the types of changes to technological characteristics that are appropriate
for review as a Special 510(k). For more information about how FDA evaluates whether changes
to the indications for use fall within the same intended use and how differences in technology
affect FDA’s SE determination process, see the FDA guidance document The 510(k) Program:
Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications [510(k)].6 Special 510(k)s remain
subject to the content and format requirements for 510(k) submissions, 510(k) summary or
510(k) statement, and class III certifications (21 CFR 807.87, 807.90, 807.92, 807.93, and
807.94, respectively).

III. Special 510(k) Program
The Special 510(k) Program is intended to facilitate the submission, review, and clearance of a
change to a manufacturer’s own legally marketed predicate device (“existing device”) that is
already authorized for commercial distribution through 510(k) clearance, preamendments status,
reclassification, or through a granted De Novo classification request under section 513(f)(2) of
the FD&C Act.
For certain device changes, FDA believes that design control procedures can produce reliable
results that can form the basis for a SE determination without compromising the statutory and
regulatory criteria for SE. Under design controls, manufacturers are required to conduct
verification and validation (21 CFR 820.30(f) and (g)). Verification and validation include
procedures to ensure that design outputs meet design inputs, and that devices conform to defined
user needs and intended uses. The QS Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, has records establishment
and maintenance requirements that apply to design changes subject to design controls (21 CFR
820.30 and 820.180). These records must be made available to an FDA investigator upon request
under section 704(e) of the FD&C Act.
When a manufacturer considers submitting a Special 510(k), FDA recommends that
manufacturers consider all relevant guidance documents, special controls, or recognized
voluntary consensus standards that apply to the device type or to a scientific topic area (e.g.,
biocompatibility or electromagnetic compatibility). For example, if a manufacturer is modifying
6

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
a powered lower extremity exoskeleton device, then the manufacturer’s design inputs should
address the special controls that FDA has established for that device type under 21 CFR
890.3480. If a manufacturer modifies an in vitro diagnostic (IVD), the manufacturer’s design
inputs should include any relevant clinical and laboratory standards recognized by FDA. This
guidance is not intended to supersede device-specific policies regarding the submission of
complete test reports or Special 510(k) considerations that are identified in some guidance
documents. For example, as discussed in the FDA guidance Reprocessing Medical Devices in
Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling (referred to as Reprocessing Guidance),7
510(k) submissions for certain reusable devices are required to include validation data pursuant
to section 510(q) of the FD&C Act. These devices are identified in FDA’s Federal Register
notice published in 82 FR 268078 and Appendix E of the Reprocessing Guidance. FDA does not
consider such 510(k) submissions to be appropriate for review under the Special 510(k) Program
because these validation data reports cannot be provided in a summary or risk analysis format.
Subject to FDA’s acceptance review in accordance with the guidance Refuse to Accept Policy
for 510(k)s,9 FDA generally reviews Special 510(k) submissions within 30 days of receipt. If a
manufacturer submits a Special 510(k) that FDA does not believe is appropriate for review under
the Special 510(k) Program, FDA intends to convert the submission to a Traditional 510(k) and
notify the submitter.
When FDA converts a Special 510(k) to a Traditional 510(k), management concurrence occurs
prior to the conversion. During FDA’s notification of 510(k) conversion, FDA intends to provide
an explanation of the reason(s) for conversion using the Special 510(k) factors discussed below.
The 510(k)-conversion process can result in delayed review because complete test reports are not
reviewed in a Special 510(k), but are typically requested in a Traditional 510(k). This difference
in content between Special and Traditional 510(k)s often results in FDA refusing to accept the
510(k) after conversion to a Traditional 510(k). Therefore, FDA recommends that both FDA and
manufacturers consider the below factors to determine whether review as a Special 510(k) is
appropriate. If the 510(k) submission was accepted for a substantive review and later converted
to a Traditional 510(k), the review clock continues into FDA’s 90-day statutory deadline under
section 510(n)(1) of the FD&C Act and remains subject to MDUFA performance goals for
510(k) submissions.
In accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), and as explained in FDA’s guidance Deciding When to
Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device10 (“510(k) Modifications Guidance”), not all
changes require a new 510(k) and manufacturers should use a risk-based assessment approach, as
appropriate, to guide their analysis of whether a new 510(k) is likely required. If a manufacturer
determines that a new 510(k) is likely required, then the flowchart provided in Figure 1 and the
companion text guide FDA staff and manufacturers through the decision-making process to
determine whether a particular submission is appropriate for review as a Special 510(k).

Subject to the framework identified in sections III.A-E of this guidance, a design or labeling
change to an existing device (including certain changes to the indications for use) may be
appropriate for a Special 510(k) when:
·
·
·

The proposed change is submitted by the manufacturer legally authorized to market the
existing device;
Performance data are unnecessary, or if performance data are necessary, well-established
methods are available to evaluate the change; and
All performance data necessary to support SE can be reviewed in a summary or risk
analysis format.

These considerations and associated decision making are summarized in Figure 1. Examples of
changes that are and are not appropriate for review under the Special 510(k) Program are
included in Appendix B.
Although most Class I devices are not subject to the design control requirements of the QS
Regulation, manufacturers of Class I (reserved) devices11 may voluntarily elect to comply with
the design controls regulation and submit Special 510(k)s.

A.

Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?

To be within the scope of the Special 510(k) Program, the 510(k) should be for a change to the
submitter’s own legally marketed predicate device. This is because the Special 510(k) Program
relies on the Agency’s previous review of detailed information and a manufacturer who modifies
its own legally marketed device is able to conduct the risk analysis and the necessary verification
and validation activities to demonstrate that the design outputs of the modified device meet the
design input requirements in a Special 510(k) submission. FDA intends to convert Special
510(k)s to Traditional 510(k)s when the submitter is not the manufacturer legally authorized to
market the predicate device. In cases where the referenced 510(k) was submitted under a
different name than the submitter, FDA recommends that the submitter include a statement
affirming that they are the manufacturer legally authorized to market the predicate device.

B.

Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?

Manufacturers should use their design control procedures and consider the information necessary
to support SE to determine whether performance data are needed to evaluate the change. As part
of design controls, manufacturers must establish and maintain procedures for the validation, or
where appropriate, verification, of design changes before their implementation (21 CFR
820.30(i)). Verification and validation testing, however, may not be necessary to support SE. For
example, FDA may receive a 510(k) from a manufacturer requesting clearance to label their
device as Magnetic Resonance (MR) Unsafe after previously labeling their device as ‘Safety in
MR Imaging Not Evaluated.’ As discussed in the FDA guidance document Establishing Safety
and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment,12 MR
Unsafe labeling is based on a scientific rationale and does not involve any performance data. In
other cases, verification and validation testing may be necessary to support changes in
indications for use and design. For example, identification of a new environment of use in the
indications for use or labeling without changes to the intended users or user interface may result
in the need for additional verification and validation testing to support continued electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC) and other performance characteristics.
In cases where manufacturers determine under their design control procedures that no additional
verification or validation testing is necessary to evaluate a change that otherwise requires
submission and clearance of a 510(k), manufacturers may submit these changes as a Special
510(k) with a clear rationale supporting their conclusion that no performance data are necessary.
When FDA does not agree with the manufacturer’s assessment about whether performance data
will be necessary to support a SE determination, FDA intends to continue its review with the
additional Special 510(k) factors discussed in sections III.C-E before considering whether the
510(k) submission should be converted to a Traditional 510(k).

C.

Is there a well­established method to evaluate the change?

FDA believes that in order to qualify for the Special 510(k) Program, well-established methods
should be available to evaluate the change under design controls. The Special 510(k) Program
should not include the submission and review of complete test reports, but summary information
generated from well-established methods. Well-established methods are those that have been
established for evaluation of the device, device type, or scientific topic area, and are validated
according to scientific principles. Minor deviations to a well-established method may be
acceptable within the context of a Special 510(k), but significant deviations to the protocol or
acceptance criteria of a well-established method can result in the 510(k) being no longer
appropriate for review as a Special 510(k). If manufacturers are uncertain whether protocol or
acceptance criteria deviations from an otherwise well-established method are significant, they
can use the Pre-Submission process to obtain feedback per the FDA guidance Requests for
Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.13
FDA believes that well-established methods may include:
· The submitter’s methods, protocols, and acceptance criteria used to support the
previously cleared 510(k) that can be applied to the subject 510(k);
· Methods found in an FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standard14 or FDA guidance
document;
· Qualified medical device development tools (MDDTs); or
· Widely available and accepted methods published in the public domain, scientific
literature, or found acceptable by FDA through the submitter’s own 510(k)-clearance, a
granted De Novo classification request, or premarket application (PMA) approval.
FDA recommends that manufacturers describe why the methods applied to evaluate the impact
of the changes included in a Special 510(k) are well-established. This description can include a
discussion that the methods and acceptance criteria were the same as the predicate device and are
relevant to the change under review. When standards undergo revision, the FDA-recognized
version(s) as identified in our online database15 are considered to include well-established
methods. Such methods should rely on established acceptance criteria, or a comparison of
performance to the predicate device and/or reference device16 under the same testing
methodology. For example, Traditional 510(k)s often identify the verification and validation
approaches that are used for software such that many subsequent software changes may occur
under a Special 510(k). To remain appropriate for review as a Special 510(k), all test methods
used to support the 510(k) should be well-established.

For the purposes of this guidance, FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standards include those that FDA has
recognized or decided to recognize. For more information, see “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards

flowchart after a manufacturer successfully navigates through Decision Point 4 using a single predicate device.
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Submissions that use methods that rely on clinical studies or animal data to support SE are not
typically appropriate for the Special 510(k) Program because the methodologies and endpoints
vary, are often dependent on the condition(s) being studied, and cannot be appropriately
summarized. The use of clinical specimens to conduct IVD verification and validation does not
necessarily mean that a well-established method does not exist to evaluate the change. When
FDA does not agree that a well-established method exists to evaluate the change, FDA intends to
convert the Special 510(k) to a Traditional 510(k). In that case, FDA intends to explain to the
submitter why the method to evaluate the change is not well-established.

D. Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis
format?
To be appropriate for a Special 510(k), the results from verification and validation associated
with design or labeling changes should be able to be placed in a summary or risk analysis format
without losing information necessary to support SE. Complete test reports should not be
submitted in a Special 510(k). If complete test reports are submitted, FDA intends to assess
whether the information can be reviewed in a summary format before converting to a Traditional
510(k). This assessment should occur during FDA’s acceptance review in accordance with the
510(k) Refuse to Accept (RTA) policy. Given the shorter timeframe for review of Special
510(k)s, if the submitter cannot provide summary information within the timeframe identified
during interactive RTA review, FDA intends to convert the submission to a Traditional 510(k).
FDA does not believe that data can be summarized when the SE determination will depend on
the Agency’s interpretation of the underlying data, such as images, raw graphs, or line item data.
For example, FDA does not believe that data can be placed in a summary format when fatigue to
failure testing involves the review of graphical images to interpret the failure modes observed. In
limited circumstances where a small number of representative images for non-clinical
performance are submitted, such would be appropriate for a Special 510(k). For example,
representative images used to demonstrate radiopacity for guidewires or devices with radiopaque
markers may be included in a Special 510(k). FDA has included anticipated common scenarios
for when data may be unable to be summarized without loss of information in section III.E.
FDA believes that the results from risk management activities, including relevant verification
and validation information, produced under design controls procedures can be used to support a
SE determination of the Special 510(k) under the conditions described in this guidance. As
described in Appendix A, this information should include a concise summary of design control
activities and verification and validation testing required to comply with 21 CFR 820.30 based
on a manufacturer’s procedures. To have sufficient information to establish SE under a Special
510(k), your summary or table should describe, for each change that required a 510(k), the
specific verification and validation activities, how the methods applied are appropriate for the
change, acceptance criteria, any changes or deviations from testing methods in previous 510(k)
submissions, and a summary of the results. When FDA does not agree that the performance data
can be summarized, FDA intends to convert the submission to a Traditional 510(k). This should
typically occur during the RTA review. In this case, FDA intends to explain to the submitter why
the performance data could not be provided in a summary or risk analysis format.
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

In accordance with the flexibility of the QS Regulation, there can be different approaches to the
summary of design control activities and verification and validation that can be included in a
Special 510(k). This can include redlined software requirements specification (SRS) and design
documentation that clearly documents the changes that were made, consistent with wellestablished methods. Manufacturers can include their risk management documentation, such as a
Design Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (DFMEA), along with a separate summary of
supporting verification and validation. Manufacturers could also summarize their risk
management activities with the specifics of verification and validation that provide information
necessary for FDA’s SE determination process. To facilitate FDA review, the summary of design
control activities and verification and validation should highlight and focus on the information
that is relevant to the changes under review. FDA has provided examples in Appendix C of this
guidance.

E.

Additional considerations

Because FDA intends to review a Special 510(k) within 30 days, FDA believes there are some
circumstances when it is not appropriate to submit a Special 510(k), including:
·
·
·

·

When evaluation of the change(s) to the device generally involve greater than three
scientific disciplines (e.g., biocompatibility, sterility, electromagnetic compatibility);
For multiple devices with unrelated changes as described in the FDA guidance Bundling
Multiple Devices or Multiple Indications in a Single Submission;17
When a recent QS inspection has resulted in the issuance of a violative inspection report
identifying observations related to design controls that are relevant to the design changes
under review in the 510(k). If a manufacturer believes such violations are unrelated to the
subject 510(k), they should provide a rationale for why the 510(k) should still be
appropriate for review under the Special 510(k) Program;
When Special 510(k)s are submitted for common scenarios that FDA anticipates a review
of complete test reports will be necessary to establish SE, such as:
· Changes to the indications for use that are supported by clinical, animal,18 or

FDA supports the principles of the “3R’s,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.

Appendix A. Recommended content of a Special 510(k)
A Special 510(k) should include:
·
·
·

·

·

A coversheet clearly identifying the submission as a “Special 510(k): Device
Modification;”
The name of the manufacturer’s legally marketed (existing) device and the 510(k)
number under which it was cleared;
Information required under 21 CFR 807.87, including a description of the modified
device, a comparison to the cleared device, the indications for use of the device, and the
proposed labeling for the device. To help ensure that FDA has a complete understanding
of the device under review, this should include:
· A detailed description of the change(s) made to the device that resulted in the
submission of a new 510(k). When labeling or specific technological
characteristics (e.g., materials, dimensions) are unchanged in comparison to the
predicate, the submission should clearly state that no changes were made;
· A comparison of the modified device to the cleared device in a tabular format;
· Clean and redlined copies of documents that were updated from what was
submitted in the predicate device’s submission because of the device change (e.g.,
labeling, risk analysis); and
· Other changes to labeling or design since the most recently cleared 510(k) (i.e.,
those that did not require submission of a new 510(k)) that would have been
documented as part of the original 510(k), in accordance with the
recommendations in the FDA guidance Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a
Change to an Existing Device.27
If the Special 510(k) includes reference(s) or a declaration of conformity to a recognized
voluntary consensus standard, we recommend that you consult the FDA guidance
Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for
Medical Devices;28
A concise summary of the design control activities. Appendix C provides examples of
narratives and a table of this information that has been historically provided. FDA
considers the information generated from the design control activities to be “appropriate
supporting data” within the meaning of 21 CFR 807.87(g). Your risk management file
may already contain some of the design control activities in a risk analysis format. In lieu
of creating a new table that addresses all recommended content, you may instead submit
your risk analysis as an attachment or appendix to your submission. This summary should
include the following:
· Identification of the risk analysis method(s) used to assess the impact of the
change on the device and the results of the analysis;
· Identification of the device change(s);

Identification of all risks associated with each device change, including
identification of risks that are considered new because of the change; and
· Risk control measures to mitigate identified risks (e.g., labeling, verification).
Based on the risk analysis, an identification of the verification and/or validation activities
required to comply with 21 CFR 820.30. This identification should include a summary of
test methods, acceptance criteria, and results, and why each is adequate to establish SE. If
unchanged from a previous premarket submission, the manufacturer can reference the
location of protocols and acceptance criteria by providing a submission and section
numbers. When the results are quantitative in nature, the submission should include basic
descriptive statistics, such as the mean, standard deviation, and range of the data.
Protocol deviations observed during testing should be provided and justified, if
applicable. When appropriate, the summary of verification and validation should include:
· For non-standardized test methods only:
· A reference to the protocol used for the existing device with an
identification of any differences (e.g., protocol, test conditions, predefined acceptance criteria, sample size) from the previous 510(k). If
protocol changes were made, the results summary should describe why the
test methods, acceptance criteria, and results support SE.
· For test methods described in an FDA-recognized standard:
· Cross-reference to the relevant section of the Special 510(k) where a
declaration of conformity (DOC) was submitted under section 514(c) of
the FD&C Act. This should also include or cross-reference applicable
supplemental documentation per ISO/IEC 17050-229 to support the DOC;
or
· If a DOC is not submitted, the basis for general use of a consensus
standard should include underlying information or data that supports how
the standard was used. For Special 510(k)s, submitters that rely on general
use of a consensus standard should provide a description of methods with
deviations, selected options and the reasons for their selection, acceptance
criteria, and a results summary. See the FDA guidance Appropriate Use of
Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices30 for more information about the use of voluntary consensus
standards.
Indications for Use form (Form FDA 3881);31 and
A signed statement by the manufacturer’s designated individual(s) responsible for design

Appendix B. Examples of changes
These examples are for illustrative purposes and may not include all details for each change. The
examples are intended to help FDA staff and industry determine which changes can be submitted
as a Special 510(k).
Example B.1
Change: The submitter wants to change their 2-D chest x-ray image processing software to
add a feature that highlights nodules in the lung. The submitter is also requesting to modify
their indications for use to describe this new software feature that now quantifies and
characterizes information about the nodules.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Clinical testing should be provided to support marketing clearance for such a change in
the indications for use to assess the performance of the software on patients with and without
nodules in the lung. This clinical testing should support that the software can successfully
quantify and characterize information about the nodules.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
No. There are no well-established methods identified in the predicate’s submission for the
evaluation of lung nodules, consensus standards, or widely available and accepted methods
published in the public domain to address the change in the indications for use.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
N/A.
Decision: Change cannot be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.2
Change: The submitter wants to add wireless control capabilities to their bilevel positive
airway pressure (BiPAP) device intended to treat patients with obstructive sleep apnea.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. The predicate device did not contain and was not tested for wireless functionality.
Verification and validation should be conducted to ensure that the BiPAP has acceptable
wireless quality of service, coexistence, cybersecurity, and maintains EMC in its intended

18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
environment of use, as described in the FDA guidance Radio Frequency Wireless
Technology in Medical Devices.32
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
No. International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601-1-233 and Association for the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) Technical Information Report (TIR) 6934
can be used to support EMC and wireless coexistence. However, there are not wellestablished methods in an FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standard or in the
manufacturer’s previous 510(k) that address the methods to evaluate the addition of wireless
control for this BiPAP. The test methods vary depending on the wireless quality of service
necessary for the device’s intended use and environment of use.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
N/A.
Decision: Change cannot be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.3
Change: The submitter wants to modify their general indications for delivering illumination
and laser energy for photocoagulation to include specific clinical applications for treatment
of retinopathy.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Clinical testing is typically provided to support marketing clearance for such a change
in the indications for use. The requested change in the indications for use now identify a
specific disease condition. The clinical outputs have changed from general coagulation of
blood vessels to treatment of retinopathy. Clinical testing should be conducted to assess new
outcomes such as decrease in vision impairment, whereas the predicate assessed the general
outcome of successful vessel coagulation.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
No. There is no well-established method identified in the predicate’s submission or a
consensus standard to evaluate clinical endpoints for this device. The SE determination rests
on a review of the underlying clinical performance data.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?

Decision: Change cannot be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.4
Change: The submitter currently markets a cardiac output monitor that is cleared for use
with their endotracheal tube. The submitter is requesting clearance to modify the indications
for use so that the submitter’s cardiac output monitor can be used with their 510(k)-cleared
endobronchial tube that also includes integrated electrodes for sensing.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Verification should be completed to demonstrate that the newly identified tube can be
used for cardiac output by impedance cardiography as safely and effectively with the monitor
as the endotracheal tube does with the monitor, and that the monitor and endobronchial tube
both continue to function as intended.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. Because the bench testing to verify the change uses the same protocol as the predicate
device, and the methods and acceptance criteria have not changed, the protocol is considered
a well-established method. In addition, this type of connection for the specified tube and
monitor has been included in other cleared 510(k) submissions for this device, and the
submitter referenced these devices in their submission.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. The protocol, methods and acceptance criteria were not modified from those used in the
predicate submission to evaluate the change. The existing methods were appropriate to
evaluate the change because the same cardiac output parameters are intended to be monitored
and displayed. The acceptance criteria and a summary of the results were provided for each
test. The results can be summarized because the SE determination does not depend on the
Agency’s interpretation of the underlying data, such as images, raw graphs, or line item data.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.5
Change: The company is requesting clearance to change the environment of use identified in
their labeling for their transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device from a
professional healthcare facility only to both professional healthcare facility and home use.
The device is still intended to be used under the direction and supervision of a healthcare
professional.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. There are different acceptance criteria for electrical safety and electromagnetic
compatibility (EMC) to address home use.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. For example, the FDA-recognized standard methods American National Standards
Institute (ANSI)/AAMI ES60601-135 and IEC 60601-2-1036 address basic safety and
essential performance, EMC (IEC 60601-1-237), and basic safety for home use devices
(ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-1138 or IEC 60601-1-1139), along with the International Special
Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) 1140 emission limits for Group 1 and Class B. The
manufacturer provided their statement of essential performance and associated devicespecific acceptance criteria.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. The particular standard used was identified. The acceptance criteria and results were
summarized in a tabular format. A justification was provided for all results that were outside
the bounds of an acceptance range or differed from the predicate. The results can be
summarized because the SE determination does not depend on the Agency’s interpretation of
the underlying data, such as images, raw graphs, or line item data.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.6
Change: The submitter is requesting clearance to market metal bone screws terminally
sterilized via gamma irradiation that were previously only supplied non-sterile and sterilized
by the end user. The indications for use and materials of construction remain unchanged from
the clearance for the manufacturer’s existing device.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.

B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. The submitter should include an evaluation of biocompatibility, sterility, pyrogenicity,
package integrity, and shelf-life to support the proposed change. Non-clinical testing to
address performance of the device outside of biocompatibility, sterility, packaging, and shelflife is not necessary based on a scientifically-based rationale from the submitter that gamma
irradiation does not impact the material composition or properties of this metallic device.
Based on the recommendations in the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO
10993-1, “Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a
risk management process,”41 the submitter provided a valid scientifically-based rationale
supporting the decision that no further biocompatibility testing was necessary to address this
change.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The FDA guidance Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile42 indicates that gamma
irradiation is an Established Sterilization Method, Established Category A. The FDArecognized standards ISO 11137-143 and ISO 11137-244 can be used to support the
sterilization validation. Pyrogenicity can be assessed using the recommendations discussed in
the FDA guidance documents Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile45 and Pyrogen and

D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. The methods are standardized, and the results can be summarized because the SE
determination does not depend on the Agency’s interpretation of the underlying data, such as
images, raw graphs, or line item data. The FDA guidance Submission and Review of Sterility
Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile53
discusses how sterilization validation, package integrity, and pyrogenicity information can be
summarized in 510(k) submissions.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.7
Change: The submitter wants to increase the number of channels for their receive-only
magnetic resonance (MR) coil.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Consistent with the FDA guidance Submission of Premarket Notifications
for Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices,54 performance testing should be provided for
the increased number of coils to address image quality metrics and patient safety from
surface heating. For a receive-only coil, this should include signal-to-noise ratio, image
uniformity, and coil surface heating assessments.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. There are standard test methods for MR devices such as FDA-recognized consensus
standards National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) MS 955 and NEMA MS
6.56 The predicate device used the same standards, protocols, and acceptance criteria.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. The methods can be summarized and the results can be placed into a summary format
for each test conducted because the SE determination does not depend on the Agency’s
interpretation of the underlying data, such as images, raw graphs, or line item data. While a
small, representative subset of sample images were included, the manufacturer did not
include a complete dataset of images that would be necessary for FDA to evaluate SE.
Instead, the manufacturer provided a statement from a U.S. Board Certified radiologist
attesting that images produced by the device are of sufficient quality for diagnostic use.

Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.8
Change: The submitter wants to add analytical sensitivity data for the new H7N9 influenza
strain to their diagnostic test.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Analytical reactivity testing should be provided to address the addition of analytical
sensitivity data for the new strain into the labeling.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The same protocol as the original submission was used for collecting and assessing the
data. The acceptance criteria were not altered from those used for the original device. No
additional types of evaluation are needed.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. The results can be summarized because the SE determination does not depend on the
Agency’s interpretation of the underlying data, such as images, raw graphs, or line item data.
In addition, the methods and acceptance criteria are unmodified from the predicate testing.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.9
Change: The submitter wants to change the labeling of their blade-form endosseous dental
implant from “Safety in MRI Not Evaluated” to “MR Conditional.”
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Non-clinical performance testing to support SE should be provided by manufacturers
seeking MR Conditional labeling for a device that contains metallic components. The FDA
guidance document Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the
Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment57 provides recommendations for such testing.

C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. There are FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standards such as ASTM F2503,58
ASTM F2052,59 ASTM F2213,60 ASTM F2182,61 and ASTM F211962 for MR compatibility
testing of passive implants.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
No. Although there are consensus standards for all test methods, FDA does not believe this
data can be summarized because the SE determination will depend on FDA’s interpretation
of the underlying data to support the MR Conditional label. This includes interpretation of
device-specific pass/fail criteria and results that are not addressed in the standard. This is
referenced in section III.E as an anticipated common scenario for when data may be unable
to be summarized.
Decision: Change cannot be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.10
Change: The submitter wants to increase the size of their MR Conditional blade-form
endosseous dental implant from 4mm long to 5mm long.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. FDA has designated special controls for blade-form endosseous dental implants in 21
CFR 872.3640(b)(2)(i)-(ix) that must be addressed, including performance testing for fatigue,
corrosion, biocompatibility evaluation, sterility, and evaluation of the device in the MR
environment. The FDA guidance document Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive
Implants in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment63 recommends that manufacturers
seeking MR Conditional labeling for a device that contains metallic components provide
non-clinical performance testing to support SE. The manufacturer also submitted a
biocompatibility evaluation based on a scientific justification.

There are FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standards such as ASTM F2503,64 ASTM
F2052,65 ASTM F2213,66 ASTM F2182,67 and ASTM F211968 for MR compatibility testing
of passive implants. There are also FDA-recognized voluntary consensus standards for
fatigue testing of endosseous dental implants, such as ANSI/American Dental Association
(ANSI/ADA) Standard No. 12769 and ISO 1480170 to address the performance of the device.
In addition, ISO 14801 and ANSI/ADA Standard No. 127 are applicable to all dental
implants.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. There are consensus standards for test methods, and guidance documents for reference.
The fatigue testing can be placed into a summary format because the size change does not
necessitate protocol or acceptance criteria deviations. In addition, the size change (4mm to
5mm) does not necessitate clinical or animal data. Because there has been no material
change, and the 1 mm size change is not expected to alter the safety of the device with
respect to MR compatibility, and the protocol and acceptance criteria has not changed, the
MR testing results can be placed into a summary format because the SE determination does
not depend on the Agency’s interpretation of the underlying data, such as images, raw
graphs, or line item data.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.11
Change: The submitter proposes to change the shape of the test cassette for a lateral flow
immunoassay for fecal occult blood. The new test cassette has a longer and slimmer housing
design in comparison to the predicate device.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. A method comparison study should be conducted using the predicate device and
candidate device to measure patient samples from the intended use population.

C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The submitter stated in their submission that the test method used is the same as that
used for assessment of the predicate device.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. Given that the test method used is the same for this submission as used for the predicate,
a risk analysis was used to assess the impact of the change on the device and its components.
The results of the method comparison study can be reviewed in terms of meeting the
predefined acceptance criteria and a summary of study results that includes the observed
false positive and false negative rates.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.12
Change: The submitter wants to change their over-the-counter (OTC) human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) urine pregnancy test device to add an absorbent sample application tip
and change the instructions for use to specify that the results should be read between three
and ten minutes after use, instead of at five minutes.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Analytical validation studies and a clinical lay user study should be provided to
demonstrate that device performance is substantially equivalent to the predicate.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The protocols used for the analytical validation and clinical studies (method comparison
study and lay user study) were consistent with protocols that have been found acceptable by
FDA in the submitter’s own 510(k) submission for the predicate device.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. For the analytical and clinical validation studies, the Agency’s determination of
substantial equivalence relies on well-defined acceptance criteria that are specific enough to
assess whether the device has substantially equivalent performance to its predicate. For the
analytical method comparison study, results can be reviewed as a summary of false positive
and false negative rates. For the clinical lay user study, the patient population information
can be adequately described in the study protocol and the results can be reviewed as a
summary of agreement rate between the subject and predicate devices. These assessments do
not require review of study line item data.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).

Example B.13
Change: The submitter wants to widen the hematocrit range for blood samples that their
OTC blood glucose meter can measure and change the design and materials used in the
external housing of their device.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes, the submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Analytical validation should be conducted to assess the effect of the wider hematocrit
range on device performance. Disinfection efficacy studies and a cleaning and disinfection
robustness study should assess whether the new external case design and materials can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The FDA guidance documents Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose Test Systems for Overthe-Counter Use71 and Blood Glucose Monitoring Test Systems for Prescription Point-ofCare Use72 include recommendations for hematocrit range evaluation, disinfection efficacy,
and cleaning and disinfection robustness testing methods.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. For these analytical validation studies, the Agency’s determination of substantial
equivalence relies on well-defined acceptance criteria that are specific enough to assess
whether the device has substantially equivalent performance to its predicate. For the
hematocrit and cleaning and disinfection robustness studies, summary results of the
measurement bias can be reviewed. For the disinfection efficacy study, results can be
reviewed as a pass/fail summary compared to predefined acceptance criteria for viral
inactivation. These assessments do not require review of study line data.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.14
Change: The submitter wants to change the Reference Range section in the package insert
for an immunoglobulin light chain specific assay by adding the normal range of the kappa
lambda free light chain ratio. The submitter is not proposing to change their indications for
use or device design.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes. The submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.

B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Testing with relevant samples should be completed to determine the normal range of the
test results.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The reference range study may be conducted based on the FDA-recognized version of
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP28-A3c.73
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. A summary of subject demographic information and summary statistics (e.g., mean,
median, and range) can be reviewed for the samples used in the new reference range study.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).
Example B.15
Change: The submitter wants to change the threshold for the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
probe of a specific bacterial pathogen to address customer feedback. The threshold change
increases the stringency for determining if a test result is positive to reduce potential false
positives and as a preventative measure to mitigate against variability at customers’ sites. No
changes were made to the assay reagents or procedure.
Relevant Questions:
A - Is it a change to the manufacturer’s own device?
Yes. The submitter is the manufacturer of the predicate device.
B - Are performance data needed to evaluate the change?
Yes. Analytical testing, including both reanalysis of existing data and new performance
“wet” testing, should be conducted to demonstrate that the assay performance is not
negatively impacted by the change.
C - Is there a well-established method to evaluate the change?
Yes. The analytical testing methods and acceptance criteria are the same as the predicate
device’s submission.
D - Can the data be reviewed in a summary or risk analysis format?
Yes. Summary review of limited analytical performance testing are sufficient to determine
the assay performance is not adversely affected by the change.
Decision: Change can be reviewed in a Special 510(k).

Appendix C. Examples of the summary of design control
activities
This section provides sample design control activities summaries that can be used to support a
Special 510(k). Because of the inherent flexibility of design controls and the QS regulation, this
summary may differ depending on a manufacturer’s internal procedures. The examples are
intended to show different formats that have been used in previously cleared Special 510(k)
submissions.
Example C.1
In the subject 510(k), the manufacturer requested clearance to change their lacrimal stent to
remove a metal ring, change the shape of the stent’s duct tube, and alter the surface area of a
hydrophilic coating. The manufacturer’s design controls narrative described that a risk analysis
was conducted to assess the impact of the changes on the subject device using internal design
control procedures and a fault tree analysis described in the FDA-recognized version of ISO
14971.74 The manufacturer included their fault tree analysis specific to this design change in an
attachment for the Special 510(k) to identify the hazardous situations, causes, risk control
measures, and acceptability before and after risk control measures. The manufacturer explained
that the protocol, test methods, and acceptance criteria used were the same as those used in the
predicate submission and provided references to the applicable sections in the previous
submission. The risk analysis identified the verification and validation activities necessary to
establish SE, and summarized that information in the following table:

Example C.2
In the subject 510(k), the manufacturer requested clearance to modify the geometric design and constructive materials of the singleuse sheath used in a self-retaining retractor for neurosurgery. The manufacturer’s design controls narrative described that a design
failure modes and effects analysis (DFMEA) was included in the submission. In accordance with their risk management procedures,
the manufacturer identified their design inputs, identified risks with their evaluation, risk control measures, and residual risk. The risk
analysis identified the verification and validation activities and summarized them in this table:
