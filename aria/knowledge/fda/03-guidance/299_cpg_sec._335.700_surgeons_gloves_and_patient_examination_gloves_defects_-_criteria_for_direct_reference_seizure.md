This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this
topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.

I. Introduction:
This CPG provides guidance to FDA staff on the submission of seizure recommendations for
medical gloves that exceed the defect levels in 21 CFR 800.20.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background:
Surgeons’ and patient examination gloves have been increasingly relied upon by health care
workers as a barrier to the transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and other
blood and fluid-borne infectious agents. * * In view of the rapid increase in demand for
imported and domestically produced gloves, and the public health benefits of further reducing
the risk of transmission of HIV and other blood and fluid borne infectious agents, and to better
utilize Agency resources, on November 21, 1989, FDA published in the Federal Register
proposed rules to insure that *gloves manufactured for medical use and distribution in the
United States* are not adulterated. The final rule, *entitled "Patient examination gloves and
surgeons’ gloves; sample plans and test method for leakage defects; adulteration",* was
published on December 12, 1990, at 55 FR 51254. It was amended on December 19, 2006 at

71 FR 75876, with an effective date of December 19, 2008. It is codified at 21 CFR 800.20.*
*FDA will collect samples from lots of gloves using the sample sizes and inspection levels in 21
CFR 800.20(c), and test for defects using the test methods in 21 CFR 800.20(b).* The
sampling inspection plan used by the FDA is derived from *ISO-2859 (the International
Organization for Standardization’s* standard for "Sampling Procedures and Tables for
Inspection by Attributes"), based on general inspection level II, normal inspection, and an
acceptable quality level (AQL) of *1.5%* for surgeons’ gloves and *2.5%* for patient
examination gloves. Single sampling will be used for lots less than or equal to 1200 gloves,
while multiple sampling will be used for larger lots.

III. Policy:
Surgeons’ gloves and patient examination gloves that contain holes are adulterated devices.
Adulteration will be determined on a lot by lot basis for enforcement purposes. *FDA considers
a lot of medical gloves to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501(c) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(c), when the number of defective gloves found in
the tested sample meets or exceeds the applicable rejection number at the 1.5 AQL for
surgeons’ gloves or the 2.5 AQL for patient examination gloves. See 21 CFR 800.20(c)(3).*

IV.

Regulatory Action Guidance:

Lots of surgeons’ and patient examination gloves that *are sampled, tested, and rejected using
the procedures in 21 CFR 800.20* are subject to administrative and judicial action, such as
detention of imported products and direct reference seizure of domestic products. * *
SPECIMEN CHARGES:
"The article of device is adulterated within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(c), in that its
quality falls below that which it purports or is represented to possess because its defect rate
exceeds the permissible rate for medical gloves set forth at 21 CFR 800.20."
Sample language for the letter to the U.S. Attorney:
Medical gloves are intended for use by health professionals, such as physicians and dentists,
during surgery and routine medical and dental examinations, and by health care technicians
and associated workers. All rely on medical gloves as an effective barrier against the
transmission and spread of disease and blood and fluid-borne infectious agents. An effective
barrier is increasingly essential in light of the current Human Immunodeficiency Virus and
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic, and the potential for a pandemic influenza.
We request seizure because analyses of the gloves by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
shows that their quality falls below that which they purport or are represented to possess
because the defect rate of the gloves exceeds the permissible level set forth in 21 CFR 800.20.
___ out of ___ gloves tested were found to leak or contain holes. 21 U.S.C. 351(c).
