Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Applicability of the Performance
Standard for High-Intensity Mercury
Vapor Discharge Lamps (21 CFR
1040.30)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This document is intended to provide guidance to manufacturers and importers of highintensity mercury vapor discharge lamps (HID) and to FDA import staff. The guidance
clarifies that FDA’s intent is to apply the performance standard at 21 CFR 1040.30 for
HID lamps only to those lamps used for general purpose lighting. General purpose
lighting includes lighting in gymnasia, auditoriums, and stores.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Background
What is a high-intensity mercury vapor discharge lamp?
A high-intensity mercury vapor discharge lamp consists of a quartz discharge tube
enclosed within a hard glass outer envelope. The glass outer envelope blocks the
transmission of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation from the discharge tube and also

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
protects the tube and interior structural and electrical elements. These lamps can
continue operating when the outer envelope becomes partially or completely broken
away, allowing ultraviolet radiation to escape.
How can exposure to this ultraviolet radiation affect health?
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation can cause painful injuries such as photokeratitis and
erythema, also known as snow-blindness and sunburn. Because of numerous incidents
involving scores of people requiring emergency room treatment, FDA issued a radiation
safety performance standard that became effective in 1980. The overwhelming majority
of these incidents occurred in school gymnasia after the outer envelope of a lamp in an
open fixture was broken by a ball or other projectile. The injured people were usually
spectators at a sporting event who sat beneath the broken lamp for many minutes to a few
hours before they felt the symptoms of ultraviolet exposure.

Performance Standard
What does the performance standard say?
The entire performance standard can be found at 21 CFR 1040.30. The text we are
addressing in this guidance document is 21 CFR 1040.30(a), which reads as follows:
Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to any high-intensity mercury
vapor discharge lamp that is designed, intended, or promoted for illumination purposes
and is manufactured or assembled after March 7, 1980, except as described in paragraph
(d)(1)(ii) of this section.
FDA issued the performance standard to establish performance criteria for selfextinguishing (T Type) lamps. The standard also requires packaging for non-self
extinguishing (R Type) lamps that warns they should not be used in locations where
people congregate for more than a few minutes. The public health goal was to preclude
the injuries that were occurring to people who gathered and remained in locations lighted
by potentially broken HID lamps, such as gymnasia and auditoriums.

Issue
Why are some manufacturers and importers of high-intensity mercury vapor
discharge lamps, which are not used for general purpose lighting, experiencing
import delays?
As explained above, FDA intended the performance standard to apply only to HID lamps
used for general purpose lighting, such as gymnasia (see the preambles to the proposed*
and final** rules authorizing the standard), and FDA has been interpreting the regulation
to apply only to those products since it was promulgated. However, the standard uses the
term “illumination” rather than “general purpose lighting.” This has recently caused some

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
confusion because in its broadest sense, “illumination” can mean casting light on
anything. Some FDA import officers have been applying this broad interpretation and
detaining importations of lamps designed and intended for applications other than general
purpose lighting. As the preambles to the proposed and final rule indicate, this is not the
intent of the standard.
* The proposed rule can be found in the Federal Register of April 21, 1978 (43 FR 16997).
** The final rule can be found in the Federal Register of September 7, 1979 (44 FR 52195).
FDA interprets 21 CFR 1040.30 to be applicable only to the high-intensity mercury vapor
discharge lamps that are intended for use in fixtures for general purpose lighting. This
lighting is to aid vision within rooms such as gymnasia, auditoriums, or industrial
locations where people are present for sports, entertainment, or work.
What is an example of a high-intensity mercury vapor discharge lamp that is
outside the scope of the performance standard?
Large size projection televisions use high-intensity mercury vapor discharge lamp
assemblies for illumination of the images that are projected on the screen. In this type of
application, the lamps are installed inside the television so they are not subject to impact
from external projectiles, unlike lamps in open fixtures in gymnasia. Additionally, the
lamp assemblies for large size projection televisions are in precision mountings to ensure
correct positioning when installed.
We do not consider HID lamps for specialized applications and for installation within
products, such as large size projection televisions, to be within the scope of the standard.
What are the intended results of this guidance?
FDA import officers should refrain from asking for import papers, including FD Form
2877, for HID lamps other than those for general purpose lighting.
This restatement of the intent of the standard should result in expedited clearance of
imports of HID lamps other than those for general purpose lighting. Importers may refer
to this guidance in responding to questions from import officers.
