Air-Powered Dental Handpieces and
Air Motors – Performance Criteria for
Safety and Performance Based
Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for air powered or contra- and right-angle
attachment dental handpieces and air motors in support of the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway. Under this framework, submitters (you) planning to submit a 510(k) using the Safety
and Performance Based Pathway for these devices will have the option to use the performance
criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence, rather than a direct
comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter could
demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the specific set of
performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an appropriate predicate
for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria represent performance
that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed devices of that device type.
Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature,
and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed surgical sutures to determine the
performance criteria and associated testing methods that could support a finding of substantial
equivalence for surgical sutures as described in this guidance. FDA recognizes that in some
cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing against an appropriate
predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of performance and
technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate performance
criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the optional device-specific Safety
and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance criteria identified in this guidance
provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The devices that are the subject of this guidance are dental air powered handpieces and air
motors (product code EFB) or contra- and right-angle attachment (product code EGS). These are
Class I (reserved) devices regulated under 21 CFR 872.4200. The scope of this guidance includes
devices where the main body is constructed of metal, for example stainless steel or titanium, with
a maximum rotational speed of 450,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) that are intended to be
end-user sterilized.
The dental handpieces that are the subject of this guidance are intended for use in general
dentistry including the following functions: cutting and grinding teeth; cavity preparations; tooth
and crown preparation; and finishing and trimming teeth and filling materials.
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The dental handpieces that fall within the scope of this guidance document are air-powered
dental handpieces and air motors intended for general dentistry. These devices are prescription use
devices.
Dental handpieces with the following intended uses or characteristics are not within the scope of
this guidance:

o Ultrasonic Scalers under 21 CFR 872.4850
§ ELC; Scaler, Ultrasonic
Single use handpieces
Handpieces not intended to be user sterilized (e.g., provided sterile, high-level
disinfected)

Device Design Characteristics:
The subject devices are prescription use air-powered dental handpieces and air driven motors
that are used by trained dental professionals for removal of carious material, cavities, crown
preparations, and as a surgical tool for impacted third molar removal and periodontal procedures.
The air-powered dental handpiece and motors use compressed air as a power source to drive the
turbine in the head of the handpiece to generate drill rotation for dental procedures. The
handpiece is designed with a head with a chunking mechanism for insertion of dental
files/shanks with a straight or angled body. The base of the handpiece contains holes for drive
air, spray air, and/or spray water to go through by connection to an air motor or a hose
connection.
The air motor may consist of the housing, handpiece connection, and coupling for hose
connection (i.e., air and water supply). The air motor converts compressed air into mechanical
rotation energy. Compressed air runs into the air motor and transfers energy by a coupling to a
straight or angled handpiece, which is connected to the motor.
General guidance that is beyond the scope of this safety and performance guidance document
regarding submission of a 510(k) for dental handpieces (i.e., labeling) can be found in FDA’s
guidance Dental Handpieces – Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to make a determination regarding eligibility into the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion with

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k) as described in FDA guidance Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DOC)1) recommended below for each test or
evaluation below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k)
submissions under the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review
underlying data demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria
and testing methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the sections below, test
information such as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should be submitted
as part of the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway.
For additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information,
please see FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench
Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions. For information about supplemental
documentation that should be included with a DOC, see FDA’s guidance Appropriate Use of
Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.

Manufacturers
Performance Criteria: Validation testing should demonstrate the cleanliness and
sterility of, or the ability to clean and sterilize to a sterility assurance level of 10-6, the
device and device components and accessories. You should provide a description of the
legally marketed sterilization pouch used to sterilize your device and each component of
the device.
Performance Criteria Source: FDA guidance Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health
Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff (referred to as the FDA Reprocessing Guidance)
Submission Information: See Section X.A of the FDA Reprocessing Guidance. The full
cleaning and reprocessing validation reports should be provided in the submission and
should clearly identify the following information within the submission:
a. Reprocessing risk assessment for each component of the device.
b. Spaulding classification for each component or accessory.
c. Identification and justification for selection of worst-case inoculation locations on
the dental handpiece.
d. Test soil: which should include synthetic blood, bone, bacterial, saliva and mucus.
e. Rationale for selection of test soils.

f. Separate validated cleaning instructions and separate validated sterilization
instructions should be provided. As described in the FDA Reprocessing Guidance
document, two quantitative evaluation methods should be used to demonstrate
effective cleaning of the subject device. The validation testing should be
conducted as described in the FDA Reprocessing Guidance.
g. You should use applicable steam sterilization validation parameters as described
in Appendix C of the FDA Reprocessing Guidance.
h. Reprocessing instructions should be clear, complete and include recommended
cleaning agents available in the US.
Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation,
you should use Attachment A of FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
Surface Devices in contact with mucosal membranes with a less than 24 hours contact duration
and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Oral Mucous Irritation
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determine that testing is needed to address some or all the identified endpoints,
FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless a
declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, as
discussed in Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive,
negative, and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. As described in the FDA guidance, Safety
and Performance Based Pathway, if a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria
identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program; however, the previously established
510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are
conducted, including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated 510(k)s, remain available.

Performance Criteria: All direct/indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
