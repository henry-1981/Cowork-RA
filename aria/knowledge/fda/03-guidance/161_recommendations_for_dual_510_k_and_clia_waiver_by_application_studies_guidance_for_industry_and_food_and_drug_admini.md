Recommendations for Dual 510(k)
and CLIA Waiver by Application
Studies
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The purpose of this guidance is to assist manufacturers in using the Dual 510(k) and Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver by Application pathway. It describes
study designs for generating data that may support both 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver.
Use of the Dual 510(k) and CLIA Waiver by Application pathway is optional; however, FDA
believes this pathway is in many instances the least burdensome and fastest approach for
manufacturers to obtain a CLIA waiver at the same time as 510(k) clearance for new In Vitro
Diagnostic (IVD) tests. FDA believes increased use of this pathway will speed up the
process of bringing simple and accurate IVD tests to CLIA-waived settings, which will better
serve patients and providers.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see
the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.1 For more information regarding use
of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
“Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices.”2
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and

should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Typically, in an application for CLIA waiver (CLIA Waiver by Application) a manufacturer
submits evidence to FDA that a previously cleared or approved test, initially categorized as
moderate complexity, meets the CLIA statutory criteria for waiver3 and requests that FDA
categorize the test as waived. This means that, historically, a CLIA Waiver by Application
has followed clearance or approval of an IVD test. For additional information about FDA’s
procedures for determination of CLIA categorization, please see FDA’s guidance
“Administrative Procedures for CLIA Categorization.”4
While a premarket notification (510(k)) and CLIA Waiver by Application each include
discrete elements not required in the other, both submissions generally include comparison
and reproducibility studies. For a 510(k), such studies are often performed by trained
operators (i.e., test operators who meet the qualifications to perform moderate complexity
testing;5 sometimes referred to as “moderate complexity users”). For a CLIA Waiver by
Application, we believe such studies should be conducted by the intended user (i.e., test
operators in waived settings and with limited or no training or hands-on experience in
conducting laboratory testing; sometimes referred to as “untrained operators” or “waived
users”).6
An applicant may choose to conduct a single set of comparison and reproducibility studies
with untrained operators to satisfy certain requirements to establish both substantial
equivalence under section 513(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)
for 510(k) clearance and simplicity and insignificant risk of erroneous results under 42
U.S.C. § 263a(d)(3) for CLIA waiver. To streamline the review of such data, the Dual
510(k) and CLIA Waiver by Application (Dual Submission) pathway was established as part
of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (MDUFA III).7 The Dual Submission
pathway is a mechanism for the review of both a 510(k) and CLIA Waiver by Application
3

Tests may obtain a CLIA waiver if the tests “have been approved by the [FDA] for home use or that, as
determined by the Secretary, are simple laboratory examinations and procedures that have an insignificant risk
of an erroneous result, including those that (a) employ methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to
render the likelihood of erroneous results by the user negligible, or (b) the Secretary has determined pose no
unreasonable risk of harm to the patient if performed incorrectly.” 42 U.S.C. § 263a(d)(3).

within a single submission, with a reduced overall review time compared to separate,
sequential submissions.

III. Scope
This guidance is intended to aid manufacturers in developing study designs for Dual
Submissions. A Dual Submission is especially appropriate for devices that are simple, have
fail-safe and failure alert mechanisms, have few pre-analytical steps, and are subject to
premarket notification requirements.
This guidance focuses on recommendations for designing a single set of comparison and
reproducibility studies, such that the data generated will support both 510(k) clearance and
CLIA waiver.
While the study design recommendations in this guidance were developed with a Dual
Submission in mind, they may also be utilized in a sequential submission approach in which
a CLIA Waiver by Application follows marketing authorization. In such cases, the applicant
may utilize the studies described herein to support marketing authorization and reference
such data in their subsequent CLIA Waiver by Application.

IV. Process and Content of a Dual Submission
A Dual Submission should be submitted following a Pre-Submission.8 As described in the
Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV) Commitment Letter,9 an
applicant should inform FDA that it plans to submit a Dual Submission during a PreSubmission. FDA recommends using this Pre-Submission to discuss planned study designs
for comparison and reproducibility studies that support both 510(k) clearance and CLIA
waiver.
A Dual Submission should contain the same information as a complete 510(k) and CLIA
Waiver by Application.10 Content related to the comparison and reproducibility studies may

V.

General Study Design Considerations

When designing comparison and reproducibility studies to support a Dual Submission, FDA
recommends that applicants evaluate test performance in settings designed to replicate, as
closely as possible, the actual CLIA-waived settings, patients/samples, and test operators.
Therefore, study designs should include the following:
·

Testing sites that are representative of the intended use of the waived test.

·

Subject populations that are representative of the intended patient population(s).

·

Intended sample type and matrix.

·

Untrained operators representative of those at intended waived settings. We
encourage you to enroll operators with the least amount of training that might be
encountered at the types of sites for which this device is intended.

·

Testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the site where the
operators are often multitasking between patient care, testing, and other duties.

General study design considerations for CLIA waiver studies are provided in Section V of
FDA’s guidance Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of
1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices.19 We
recommend that manufacturers consider the general recommendations in Sections V.B, V.C,
and specific recommendations in Section V for Option 4 studies (i.e., comparison studies in
which the results of the candidate test in the hands of untrained operators are directly
compared to the results of an appropriate comparative method in the hands of trained
operators) when designing studies in support of a Dual Submission. Additional general study
design considerations for Dual Submissions are described below.
The appropriate design of the studies and data analysis is strongly influenced by the type of
the candidate test. For the purposes of this guidance:

A quantitative test is a test that gives numerical results (e.g., concentration of an
analyte in a patient sample) which are referenced to a measuring interval and
standards.
A binary qualitative test is a test that provides only two outputs (e.g.,
positive/negative or yes/no).

This Section includes recommendations for quantitative and binary qualitative tests. If your
test is a different type of test from the two types described above (e.g., qualitative with
multiple nominal categories, semi-quantitative, a multi-analyte assay with algorithmic
analyses), please contact FDA through a Pre-Submission20 for discussion of study designs.
If the candidate test is intended to be used at Point-of-Care (POC) non-waived sites in
addition to waived sites and the intended use patient population at the CLIA-waived sites in
the comparison study does not sufficiently represent the intended use patient population at
POC non-waived sites, FDA recommends that you address this issue by also including one or
a few POC non-waived sites in the study. At any included POC non-waived sites, trained
operators representative of those at intended POC non-waived sites should perform testing
with the candidate test.
The recommendations for comparison and reproducibility studies described in this guidance
are for studies that include the type of samples that are typical of CLIA-waived devices (for
example, capillary whole blood samples). If you plan to pursue a 510(k) clearance for POC
non-waived use for additional sample types beyond those for which you are requesting a
CLIA waiver in your Dual Submission, please contact FDA through a Pre-Submission for
discussion of study designs.21

A.

Comparison Study Designs

For comparison study design and analysis to establish performance characteristics related to
the accuracy of the candidate test, we recommend you follow appropriate FDA-recognized
consensus standards, such as:
·

For quantitative tests: Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP21,22 CLSI
EP2723

·

For qualitative tests: CLSI EP1224

These standards include discussion of the importance of selecting an appropriate comparative
method (CM) and describe quality hierarchies of preferred CM types for quantitative and

binary qualitative tests. Comparison to higher quality CMs (e.g., reference methods or
methods traceable to higher order references), when available, provides more absolute
information about the accuracy of the candidate test while comparison to lower quality CMs
may provide only relative performance information. Where there is no generally accepted
CM for an IVD device type, the use of a legally marketed predicate device or other welldocumented method as the CM would generally be appropriate. We recommend discussing
the selection of an appropriate CM as part of a Pre-Submission25 prior to conducting the
comparison study.

(1) Quantitative Tests
·

An appropriate type of regression analysis should be performed and biases at the
medical decision levels and at the lower and upper limits of the measuring
interval should be calculated along with the confidence interval of each bias
estimate.

·

Total error (central 95% region of observed differences between the candidate test
and CM) should be estimated for the entire measuring interval of the candidate
test, and for 3 subintervals (low, medium and high), as described in CLSI EP21.

·

The measuring interval of the CM should be at least as wide as the measuring
interval of the candidate test. If there are samples with either candidate test or
CM values outside of the corresponding measuring intervals, these samples
should be analyzed separately.

·

If one of the medically important points of the candidate test includes the Limit of
Blank (LoB)/Limit of Detection (LoD)/Limit of Quantitation (LoQ), then some
additional calculations for samples with very low levels of analyte may be needed
for appropriate evaluation and comparison of the LoB/LoD/LoQ of the candidate
test in the hands of untrained operators (see CLSI EP17)26.

(2) Binary Qualitative Tests
·

Binary qualitative tests with an analytical cutoff: For some qualitative tests (e.g.,
when non-diseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte
of interest), clinical performance and analytical accuracy of the qualitative tests
are the same concepts, and, therefore, in most situations, a study for evaluation of
analytical accuracy can be considered as a study for clinical performance
evaluation with measures such as clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, positive
and negative likelihood ratios, and positive and negative predictive values for a
binary qualitative test. When certain types of CMs are used in the study,
measures such as positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent
agreement (NPA) should be estimated instead.27

·

Binary qualitative tests with a clinical cutoff: For some qualitative tests, clinical
performance related to the target condition (for example, cancer present or absent)
and analytical accuracy related to the amount of the analyte detected are different
concepts and the cutoff for the qualitative test is chosen to optimize clinical
sensitivity and clinical specificity of the test based on a clinical data set. Note that
the scientific evidence recommended to support a CLIA waiver for a qualitative
test in this Section is related to the analytical accuracy of the qualitative test.
Issues related to the clinical performance of a qualitative test are out of the scope
of the guidance (please contact FDA through a Pre-Submission28 for further
discussion).

·

Each untrained operator should run the candidate test with a minimum of 5
samples that are positive by the CM and 5 samples that are negative by the CM.

B.

Reproducibility Study Designs

We recommend conducting the reproducibility study at a minimum of 3 of the same sites that
were included in the comparison study29 and are representative of the intended use of the
waived test. To facilitate statistical analysis, the same number of untrained operators (likely
2 or 3) should be included at each site of the reproducibility study. For reproducibility study
design and analysis, we recommend you follow FDA-recognized consensus standards (e.g.,
CLSI EP05,30 CLSI EP12). We recommend that you include the following sources of
variability: different sites, different untrained operators, different days, different runs,
different lots (if applicable), and a few replicates. If the candidate device is a unitized
device, contact FDA through a Pre-Submission31 to discuss how you should evaluate
repeatability.
Two possible study designs for evaluation of lot-to-lot variability are described below:
·

Design 1: Include three different lots at each of three sites in the reproducibility
study in such a way that the between-lot component can be evaluated.

·

Design 2: Evaluate lot-to-lot variability in a separate small study at one internal
site where patient (or surrogate) samples and controls are tested over a few days.

A reproducibility study design where each site uses a different lot is generally undesirable,
especially for new technologies, because it would be impossible to determine whether
observed differences are lot-related or site-related.
If specimens used with the candidate test are not stable (for example, capillary whole blood),
attempts to use small-scale repeatability/reproducibility studies that use the intended use
clinical samples should be explored (please contact FDA through a Pre-Submission33 to
discuss study designs for precision/reproducibility studies).
We recommend that you include in the reproducibility study the following samples:
·

For quantitative tests, the following levels of analyte should be included: close to
the lower limit of the measuring interval, below the medical decision level
(MDL), around the MDL, above the MDL, and close to the upper limit of the
measuring interval. If the candidate device has more than one MDL, then
samples with concentrations around these MDLs should be evaluated. It is
understood that some tests will not have specific MDLs, but rather a range of
values; in such cases, the reproducibility panel should contain samples scattered
throughout the measuring interval of the candidate test.

·

For binary qualitative tests with an analytical cutoff: true negative, close to the
LoD, and moderate positive samples should be included. For binary qualitative
tests with a clinical cutoff: true negative, high negative (close to C5), low positive
(close to C95) and moderate positive samples should be included. C5 is a sample
concentration which yields a positive result 5% of the time (and a negative result
95% of the time), and C95 is a sample concentration which yields a positive result
95% of the time (and a negative result 5% of the time).34

·

In addition, you should run the appropriate quality control samples associated
with the candidate test.

We recommend discussing reproducibility study design as part of a Pre-Submission prior to
conducting the reproducibility study.
32

Note that the same lot is then included at each site in the main reproducibility study.
