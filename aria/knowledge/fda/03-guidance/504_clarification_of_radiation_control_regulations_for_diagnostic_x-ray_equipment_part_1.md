This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s
Good Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if

such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be updated in the next revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

FOREWORD

In October 1982, the Food and Drug Administration established the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) by merging the Bureau of Medical Devices and
the Bureau of Radiological Health.

The Center develops and implements national programs to protect the public health
in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to
assure the safety, effectiveness and proper labeling of medical devices, to control
unnecessary human exposure to potentially hazardous ionizing and nonionizing radiation,
and to ensure the safe, efficacious use of such radiation.

The Center publishes the results of its work in scientific journals and in its own
technical reports. These reports provide a mechanism for disseminating results of
CDRH and contractor projects. They are sold by the Government Printing Office and/or
the National Technical Information Service.

Also, CDRH technical reports in radiological health are made available to the World
Health Organization (WHO) under a memorandum of agreement between WHO and the
Department of Health and Human Services. Three WHO Collaborating Centers,
established under the Bureau of Radiological Health, continue to funetion under CDRH:

WHO Collaborating Center for Standardization of Protection Against Nonionizing
Radiations;

WHO Collaborating Center for Training and General Tasks in Radiation Medicine;
and

WHO Collaborating Center for Nuclear Medicine.

We welcome your comments and requests for further information.

PREFACE

The Office of Compliance and Surveillance of the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH) has received numerous requests for interpretation of
various sections of the Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-ray Equipment, 21 CFR
Subchapter J, since its publication in the Federal Register on August 15, 1972. The
Center compiles its responses to such queries, to the extent possible, in a composite
document for distribution to the x-ray industry and other interested individuals or
agencies.

This publication ineludes all current FDA Compliance Policy Guides pertaining to the
Performance Standard, interpretations of the Performance Standard in either narrative
or question-and-answer form, and interpretive letters that have been sent to the indus-
try. Manufacturers are reminded that they must also meet pertinent requirements of
the Medical Device Amendments, which are not addressed in this document. Guidance
on Medical Device requirements may be obtained by contacting the Division of Smail
Manufacturers' Assistance (800-638-2041).

Placing this document in a binder will enable you to make revisions by adding or
replacing pages. The Center will periodically prepare and distribute additional or
replacement pages to provide clarifications, changes, or additions.

Specific questions or comments concerning this document should be addressed to the
X-Ray Products Branch, Division of Standards Enforcement, Office of Compliance and
Surveillance, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville,

CLARIFICATION OF RADIATION CONTROL REGULATIONS
FOR DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Compliance and Surveillance of the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH) has received many requests for interpretation of
the Federal regulations that relate to diagnostic x-ray equipment. Our
responses to these requests were originally issued as FDA Compliance Policy
Guides, industry-wide letters, and letters to individuals. This document is
a compilation of those responses that remain applicable. Guides or opinions
that have been withdrawn or are now obsolete because they have been
incorporated into the regulations are not included in this document.

This document consists of two sections. The first is the General section,
which contains information of a general nature. The second is the Specific
section, which contains information specific to particular sections of the
Federal Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment (21 CFR 1020.30-
32). When the term "Revised Language" appears in an item heading, it
indicates English grammar correction; the term "Revised" indicates an
updated version of the original clarification.

We recommend that this document be placed in a binder to permit insertion of
additional issuances.

Insufficient Initial Report Documentation

QUESTION: Will you accept reports without the material called for in the
guideline document for submitting of reports, pages 2 & 3, paragraph 102.7
(information to users) and 102.6 (assembler's instructions) with the under-
standing that this material will be sent as soon as available for attachment to
the previously submitted reports?

ANSWER: We will accept such reports with the understanding that they are
partial submission only. In addition, our acceptance of such reports does not
relieve you, as manufacturer, of the responsibility of submitting the material
as a supplement to your report nor of including the instruction manuals and
assemblers! manuals with your equipment prior to its introduction into commerce.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDE
COMPLIANCE POLICY GUIDES 7133.05

CHAPTER 33 - RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH

SUBJECT: Determination by Secretary that Product Fails to Comply or Has
Defect - 21 CFR 1603.11

BACKGROUND:

Section 359(e) of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (P.L.
98-682), and 1803.11 of the implementing regulations (21 VFR 1003.11) state
that if the Food and Drug Administration determines that any electronic
product either does not comply with an applicable Federal performance
Standard, or has a defect that relates to the safety of use of such product,
the manufacturer shall immediately be notified in writing of the alleged
defect or noncompliance, the findings of the FDA, and all information on
which the findings are based. The notification shall also state a
reasonable period of time during which the manufacturer may present his view
and evidence to establish that there is no failure of compliance, or that
the alleged defect does not exist. If the FDA alleges a defect or
noncompliance which the manufacturer believws was caused by the user rather
than through any fault in manufacture, the manufacturer will have an
opportunity to present evidence in substantiation of his position.

POLICY:

As a general rule, a manufacturer is reponsible for defects or
noncompliance. However, if it can be shown that a product no longer meets a
performance standard because-of modification of the equipment by
unauthorized personnel, installation of improper replacement parts or
materials, or unforeseeable abuse of the equipment by the owner or user,
there may be a basis for a finding that certain of the notification
requirements and the repair, replace and refund provisions (21 CFR 1093 and
1884) will not apply.

The manufacturer bears the burden of proof in establishing that a defect or
noncompliance is due to a cause other than faulty manufacture. The FDA's
mandate to protect the public health and safety under P.L. 90-602, together
with the Act's specification that measures to enforce the control of
electronic product radiation be directed against the manufacturer cf a
product, requires that the primary responsibility of a manufacturer for the
safety of his product not be lifted unless the responsiblity can clearly be
Placed on another. FDA will refrain from requiring the manufacturer to
repair, replace, or refund only in those situations where there is no

GUIDE 7133.85

reasonable basis for believing that a violation of the Act resulted from a
manufacturer's act or omission.

For example, a certain amount of normal wear will occur in electronic
products. If such normal wear results in radiation emitted by the product
exceeding the limit prescribed in an applicable standard, the manufacturer
may be charged with noncompliance because of his failure to design the
product to maintain an acceptable level of radiation leakage over its useful
life. The distinction between normal wear and damage resulting from misuse
of the equipment is something which the manufacturer would have to justify.
Similarly, a manufacturer will be held responsible when he fails to act
reasonably to inform users of the equipment and service personnel of the
need for, and methods of proper servicing.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDE
COMPLIANCE POLICY GUIDES 7133.6

CHAPTER 33 - RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH

SUBJECT: Early Correction of Defects or Noncompliance - 21 CFR 1004.6

BACKGROUND :

If a product defect or noncompliance with the Federal standard is discovered
by a manufacturer (or x-ray equipment assembler), he may wish to initiate
repair simultaneously with notification to FDA so that down time is
minimized. Part 1003 requires that FDA (and others) be notified of
radiation safety defects or failure to comply with a performance standard,
and Part 1004 requires that the manufacturer must repair, replace, or refund
the purchase price of a defective or noncompliant product. The correction
of the product must be performed pursuant to a plan approved by FDA (21 CFR
1004.6).

POLICY:

The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, and the regulations, do not
preclude purchaser notification and correction of a defect or noncompliance
prior to the approval of a plan; however, such corrective action would still
be subject to a plan approved by FDA. To avoid the possibility of having to
prepare and implement a second corrective action plan, a manufacturer or
assembler should communicate with the Food and Drug Administration as early
as possible after discovery of a defect or failure to comply.

Tube Housing Assembly Repair

QUESTION: In the case where a manufacturer repairs a tube housing assembly,

including repairs that require the temporary removal of the insert, shall that
repair constitute the manufacture of a new tube housing assembly?

ANSWER: Any repair done on any tube housing assembly that does not include the

replacement of a tube insert in a previously certified tube housing shall not
constitute the manufacture of a new tube housing assembly.

Definitions

Defects and Burned-Out X-Ray Tubes

QUESTION: In Section 1003.2(b)(3), a defect is defined as a product which "fails
to accomplish the intended purpose." Does a burned-out x-ray tube fall under
the definition of a defect?

ANSWER: As provided in the Act, the only defects for which the regulations apply
are those which relate to the safety of use by reason of the emission of elec-
tronic product radiation. Thus, a burned-out x-ray tube would not be considered
a "defect" but would be considered normal repair of the tube housing assembly.
PBL systems or other beam-limiting devices which fail to accomplish their
intended purpose may, on the other hand, be considered defective if they create
a risk of injury, including genetic injury, as a result of such failure. Thus,
a defect may be related to a product system as a whole, or a component of such
system. However, it is important to recognize that the failure of a product to
function and thereby produce no radiation would not be considered a radiation
safety defect under the Act, since there can be no radiation safety problem.

Meaning of Numerical Limits

REVISED BRH:DOC:MA 337

The preamble to the final order establishing the Performance Standards for Diag-
nostic X-Ray Equipment, published in the Federal Register of August 15, 1972

(FR 16461), stated that normal roundoff procedures could be employed in measure-
ments related to numerical values specified in the standard. However, the Com-
missioner has determined that such roundoff procedures may be misleading and not
consistent with Section 360B(a)(5) (42 U.S.C. 2634) of the Public Health Service
Act. The current policy prohibits the roundoff of measurements resulting in the
certification of a product known to exceed any limit imposed by the standard.
This means that numerical limits stated in the standard are to be treated as
absolute limits, and the manufacturer must design his testing and quality con-
trol program in order to ensure that these limits are not exceeded.

TO: MANUFACTURERS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT
SUBJECT: Definition of X-Ray Table, Tabletops, and Cradle

The following working definitions have been used by the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health in the administration of the Performance Standard
for Diagnostic X-Ray Systems and Their Major Components, 21 CFR 1020.30, 31,
and 32. This letter is issued to restate the definitions, clarify that
stretchers intended for diagnostic x-ray procedures are x-ray tables, and
provide interim guidance regarding hospital stretcher x-ray tables.

X-ray table means a device with its patient support structure (tabletop)
interposed between the patient and the image receptor during normal use.
This includes but is not limited to any stretcher equipped with a radio-
lucent panel and any table equipped with a cassette tray (or Bucky),
cassette tunnel, image intensifier, or spot film device beneath the
tabletop.

Mobile x-ray table means an x-ray table designed for patient transport.

Stationary tabletop means a tabletop which, when assembled for use, is
incapable of movement with respect to its supporting structure within the
plane of the tabletop. Mobile x-ray tables (stretchers) with a single
radiolucent panel are considered equivalent to x-ray tables equipped with
a Stationary tabletop. (The maximum aluminum equivalent permitted for
these tabletops is 1.0 mm Al.)

Movable tabletop means a tabletop which, when assembled for use, is
capable of movement with respect to its supporting structure within the
plane of the tabletop. Mobile x-ray tables (stretchers) with two hinged
radiolucent panels are considered equivalent to x-ray tables equipped
with a movable tabletop. (The maximum aluminum equivalent permitted for
these tabletops is 1.5 mm Al.)

Cradle means a removable device which supports and may restrain a patient
above an x-ray table; or a device with its patient support structure
interposed between the patient and the image receptor during normal use,
equipped with means for patient restraint, and capable of rotation about
its long (longitudinal) axis. Mobile x-ray tables (stretchers) with
three or more hinged radiolucent panels are considered equivalent to
cradles. (The maximum aluminum equivalent for cradles and these table-
tops is 2.0 mm Al.)

A hospital bed equipped with a standard hospital mattress and other
operational features common to hospital beds is not considered an x-ray
table unless the bed manufacturer represents the use of the bed as an x-ray
table as defined elsewhere in this letter.

CHAPTER 33 — RADIOLOGICAL HRATTH

SUEJECT: Definition of "Commerce" = 21 CFR 1080.3(g)

BACKGROUND:

Section 360B(a)(1) of the Radiation Control for Health & Safety Act
prohibits the introduction into conmerce of any electronic product which
does not conform to an applicable standard.

Questions have been raised as to whether a person who manufactures an
electronic product for which a standard has been prescribed, for use solely
in his own conmercial activities or manufacturing process, has introduced
the product into "commerce".

POLICY:

Such a person would not have introduced the product “into commerce" within
the meaning of Section 360B(a)(1). However, Section 36@B(a) (5) of the Act
makes it a prohibited act for any person to fail to issue a certification as
required by Section 358(h), regardless of whether the electronic product in
question has itself been physically introduced into commerce. The assembly
and use of an electronic product by a person “engaged in the business" of
assembling that product (as defined in Section 355(3)) for commercial
purposes in his own facility affects interstate commerce; thus Section
358 (h) would require that the manufacturer certify that the product conforms
to the relevant standard. However, if that person in no way receives
compensation for the assembly and use of the Product, he would not be
“engaged in the business" and use of the product, he would not be "engaged
in the business" and therefore would not be a "manufacturer" subject to
Sections 358(h) and 36@B(a) (5).

Reassembly and X-Ray System

QUESTION: Please define the meaning of "reassembly" and "x-ray system" as used
in 21 CFR 1020.30(p).

ANSWER: "Reassembly" means the installation of a group of components (ineluding
upgraded components) that were previously assembled and used as an "x-ray sys-
tem." An "x-ray system," as defined in the standard (21 CFR 1020.30(b)(47)), con-
sists minimally of an x-ray control, high-voltage generator, tube housing assem-
bly, beam-limiting device, and any necessary supporting structures. As stated

in Section 1020.30(p)(1)(iv), an assembler may reassemble a previously existing
(used) system for resale whether or not the system is comprised of all uncer-
tified components.
