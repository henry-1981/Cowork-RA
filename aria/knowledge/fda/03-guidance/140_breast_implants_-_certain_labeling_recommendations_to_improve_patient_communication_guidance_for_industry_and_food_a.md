Breast Implants - Certain Labeling
Recommendations to Improve Patient
Communication
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance contains recommendations concerning the content and format for certain labeling
information for saline and silicone gel-filled breast implants. FDA is issuing this guidance to
help ensure that a patient receives and understands the benefits and risks of these devices. The
recommendations are being made based on concerns that some patients are not receiving and/or
understanding information regarding the benefits and risks of breast implants. These labeling
recommendations are intended to enhance, but not replace, the physician-patient discussion of
the benefits and risks of breast implants that uniquely pertain to individual patients.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Breast implants are medical devices implanted under the breast tissue or chest muscle to increase
breast size (augmentation) or to replace breast tissue that has been removed due to cancer or
trauma or that has failed to develop properly due to a severe breast abnormality (reconstruction).
They are also used in revision surgeries, which seek to correct or improve the result of an
original surgery. The use of breast implants in reconstructive and augmentation procedures is
elective, and alternatives to the use of breast implants exist (such as an external breast prosthesis
and tissue reconstruction).
1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

There are two types of breast implants approved for sale in the United States: saline-filled and
silicone gel-filled. Saline-filled breast implants are inflated to the desired size with sterile
isotonic saline. Silicone gel-filled breast implants contain a fixed volume of silicone gel. Silicone
gel viscosity differs among implants and manufacturers.
Breast implants are manufactured with smooth and textured surfaces. The outer surface, or
“shell” for both types of breast implants is manufactured from polysiloxane silicone rubber and
may vary in shell surface, shape, profile, volume, and thickness. For breast implants with a
textured shell surface, each breast implant manufacturer utilizes a proprietary manufacturing
process to create the textured surface, which means that each manufacturer’s textured shell is
different.
Over the past few years, FDA has received new information pertaining to risks associated with
breast implants, including breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIAALCL) and systemic symptoms commonly referred to as breast implant illness (BII) that some
patients attribute to their implants. BIA-ALCL is a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cancer of
the immune system). In most cases, BIA-ALCL is found in the scar tissue and fluid near the
implant, but in some cases, it can spread throughout the body. An individual’s risk of developing
BIA-ALCL is considered to be low; however, this cancer is serious and can lead to death,
especially if not treated promptly. In most patients, it is treated successfully with surgery to
remove the implant and surrounding scar tissue, but some patients may require chemotherapy
and radiation therapy. The most common symptoms of BIA-ALCL are persistent swelling,
presence of a mass or pain in the area of the breast implant that may occur years after implant
placement. Systemic symptoms such as fatigue, memory loss, rash, “brain fog,” and joint pain
have been reported by some patients with breast implants. The term “breast implant illness” has
been used to describe these symptoms. Researchers are investigating these symptoms to better
understand their origins. The exact relationship of these symptoms with breast implants is
unclear at this time.
FDA has taken a number of steps to better understand and address risks associated with breast
implants, 1 including convening the General and Plastic Surgery Devices Advisory Panel
(“Panel”) on March 25-26, 2019, to discuss the long-term benefits and risks of breast implants
indicated for breast augmentation and reconstruction. 2 The meeting covered a range of important
topics on breast implant safety, including characterization of BIA-ALCL incidence and risk
factors, and methods for assessing systemic symptoms. The Panel gave recommendations on
these topics, including recommending that FDA require a boxed warning in breast implant
labeling and a standardized checklist as part of the informed consent process, revise the MRI
screening recommendations for silent ruptures of silicone gel-filled breast implants, and provide
greater transparency regarding materials present in breast implants; the Panel also discussed the
role of the patient device card in providing important information about the patient’s breast
implant. 3 In addition, FDA learned from presentations at the March 2019 Panel meeting and

through comments submitted to the associated public docket, 4 that some patients may not be
receiving or understanding important information regarding the benefits and risks of breast
implants in a format that allows them to make a well-informed decision about whether or not to
have a breast implantation. Notably, approved labeling for currently marketed breast implants is
lengthy, often in excess of fifty pages. 5
For these reasons, FDA is now providing recommendations concerning the content and format of
certain labeling information for these devices. Specifically, FDA is recommending that
manufacturers incorporate a boxed warning and a patient decision checklist into the labeling for
these devices to better ensure certain information is received and understood by patients. This
guidance also recommends updated and additional labeling information, including updates to the
silicone gel-filled breast implant rupture screening recommendations, inclusion of an easy-tofind description of materials, and provision of patient device cards that were recommended at the
March 2019 Panel meeting.
The Agency will continue to monitor information about potential safety risks and take steps to
ensure they are being adequately conveyed to and understood by physicians and patients.

III. Scope
This guidance provides recommendations concerning the content and format of certain labeling
information for breast implants filled with saline or silicone gel indicated for breast
augmentation or breast reconstruction.
FDA believes it is important for patients considering breast implants to have the information they
need for a balanced discussion with their physicians regarding the benefits and risks of breast
implants. To help ensure that patients have this information, a boxed warning, a patient decision
checklist, and a patient information booklet/brochure specific to the breast implant should be
provided by manufacturers and given to patients prior to implantation. For those patients who
decide to have breast implants, a patient device card should also be provided to patients after
surgery. FDA intends to work with manufacturers of new breast implants through the premarket
approval application (PMA) process, and manufacturers of currently marketed breast implants
through the PMA supplement process, to integrate these important labeling recommendations.
This guidance is not intended to include a complete listing of all labeling components for breast
implants. This guidance should be used as a complement to FDA’s “Guidance on Medical
Device Patient Labeling” 6 (which describes FDA’s current thinking on making medical device
patient labeling understandable to and usable by patients), existing regulations, and other
relevant guidance documents containing additional labeling recommendations.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

This guidance also supplements FDA’s Guidance “Saline, Silicone Gel, and Alternative Breast
Implants” 7 (hereafter referred to as the “Breast Implant Guidance”) and should not be construed
as a replacement for such guidance. Manufacturers should consider both the recommendations in
this guidance and in the Breast Implant Guidance.
We note that accurate product labeling and effective communication of that labeling are
important to help ensure that patients are aware of the risks associated with breast implants prior
to undergoing implantation. Moreover, a device shall be deemed misbranded if, among other
things: its labeling is false or misleading; its labeling does not contain adequate warnings; or any
information required to be in the labeling is not prominently placed with such conspicuousness
and in such terms to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under
customary conditions of purchase and use (see sections 502(a), 201(n), 502(c), and 502(f)(2) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)). 8

IV. Labeling Components
The patient booklet/brochure and the patient device card are all part of the patient labeling for
breast implants. FDA recommends that the patient booklet/brochure include a boxed warning,
patient decision checklist, rupture screening recommendations, and materials/device description
(as described in this guidance) as well as other patient information (as described in the Breast
Implant Guidance).
Specifically, FDA believes manufacturers should include a boxed warning and patient decision
checklist to help ensure patients receive and understand information about the benefits and risks
of breast implants. This section contains FDA’s format and content recommendations for these
components, and to help illustrate, FDA has provided examples of each in the appendices.

Boxed Warning
FDA believes that a boxed warning should be part of physician and patient labeling materials for
breast implants. In general, boxed warnings are noticeable and easy to read and understand, and
FDA believes a boxed warning would be particularly useful in communicating risks that have
been identified in new information and for which patients may be unaware. To achieve the goals
described above, FDA recommends that a boxed warning generally inform patients that:
•
•
•
•

Breast implants are not considered lifetime devices;
The chance of developing complications increases over time;
Some complications will require more surgery;
Breast implants have been associated with the development of a cancer of the immune
system called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL);

Under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, it is a prohibited act to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate
commerce any device that is misbranded.

•
•

BIA-ALCL occurs more commonly in patients with textured breast implants than smooth
implants, and deaths have occurred from BIA-ALCL; and
Breast implants have been associated with systemic symptoms.

FDA believes that this form and content of boxed warning will help to ensure that patients
receive and understand information regarding the benefits and risks of these devices. An example
of a boxed warning that follows these recommendations is provided in Appendix A.

Patient Decision Checklist
FDA also believes that a patient decision checklist highlighting key information regarding risks
should be included at the end of the patient information booklet/brochure.
To help ensure the checklist is read and understood by patients, FDA is providing
recommendations regarding content and organization below. First, FDA recommends that the
introduction for the checklist include a description of the purpose and importance of the
checklist, as well as instructions to patients on how to review and complete the document prior to
deciding whether to undergo the implant procedure. Next, to achieve the goals described above,
FDA recommends that the body of the checklist include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Situations in which the device should not be used or implanted;
Considerations for a successful breast implant candidate;
Risks of undergoing breast implant surgery;
Importance of appropriate physician education, training and experience;
Risk of BIA-ALCL;
Risk of systemic symptoms; and
Discussion of options other than breast implants, as appropriate.

Additionally, to help ensure the material is reviewed, FDA recommends the checklist allow for
patients and physicians to affirmatively acknowledge (e.g., via initials and/or signatures) that
specific information was read and discussed.
FDA recommends that a copy of the patient decision checklist be provided to the patient so that
the patient can refer back to this important information. The FDA also encourages device
manufacturers to develop a plan to ensure that patients are adequately informed of the risks of
breast implants and breast implant surgery, to update the checklist as additional data are
collected with post-market experience, and to provide a dedicated website link for each device
that allows providers involved in the care of breast implant patients and patients with that
specific breast implant to regularly monitor changes to the patient decision checklist, boxed
warning, and product label. FDA specifically recommends that the rates of BIA-ALCL included
in the patient decision checklist reflect current information based on estimated incidence rates.
These rates include overall incidence rates of BIA-ALCL, as well as rates for the manufacturer’s
specific breast implant based on published literature, registries, and medical device reports.
Manufacturers should explain in the patient decision checklist the methodology used for
determining the incidence rates for BIA-ALCL.

An example of a checklist that follows these recommendations is provided in Appendix B.
Please note the rates for risks provided in this example checklist are derived from percentages of
reported complications for approved breast implants in publicly available summaries of safety
and effectiveness data (SSEDs) at the time of issuance of this guidance document. These
numbers are provided for illustrative purposes only. FDA recommends that manufacturers’
patient decision checklists identify the percentages of reported complications for their specific
implants based on current information.

V.

Additional Labeling Recommendations

This section contains additional labeling recommendations for the physician and patient labeling
of breast implants. Specifically, this section includes recommendations on rupture screening for
silicone gel-filled breast implants, a materials/device description in the product labeling of breast
implants filled with saline or silicone gel indicated for breast augmentation or breast
reconstruction, and a patient device card.
The updated rupture screening recommendations follow the consensus recommendation of the
Panel to remove the current FDA MRI screening recommendations, and to adopt screening
recommendations that begin between years 5 and 6 post surgery, and occur every 2-3 years after
that. 9 Additionally, FDA is also recommending ultrasound as an acceptable alternative for
screening asymptomatic patients pursuant to the Panel’s recommendation. These additional
labeling recommendations were discussed at the March 2019 Panel Meeting. 10

Rupture Screening Recommendations Update
We recommend that the physician and patient labeling for silicone gel-filled breast implants 11
include the specific, updated rupture screening recommendations as shown below:
Physician Labeling:
For asymptomatic patients, the first ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be
performed at 5-6 years postoperatively, then every 2-3 years thereafter.
For symptomatic patients or patients with equivocal ultrasound results for rupture at any time
postoperatively, an MRI is recommended.
Patient Labeling:
It is recommended that you have periodic imaging (e.g., MRI, ultrasound) of your silicone gelfilled breast implants to screen for implant rupture regardless of whether your implants are for
cosmetic augmentation or reconstruction. These recommendations do not replace other
additional imaging that may be required depending on your medical history or circumstances
(i.e., screening mammography for breast cancer).

Saline-filled breast implants do not have screening recommendations as rupture is detectable without screening.
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Even if you have no symptoms, you should have your first ultrasound or MRI at 5-6 years after
your initial implant surgery and then every 2-3 years thereafter. If you have symptoms at any
time or uncertain ultrasound results for breast implant rupture, an MRI is recommended.

Materials/Device Descriptions
At the March 2019 Panel meeting, 12 patients and panel members expressed concern about not
knowing the materials used in breast implants and the possible deleterious health effects of these
materials. They emphasized the importance of greater communication and transparency
regarding the materials present in breast implants to help patients to make an informed decision
about implantation in light of potential adverse effects due to these materials, including in the
event of rupture, leakage, or diffusion. Therefore, in addition to the labeling recommendations
provided in the Breast Implant Guidance, FDA recommends the patient information
booklet/brochure also include a detailed device description of the materials of construction of the
breast implant shell and filling in a format that is understandable to the patient.
Specifically, FDA recommends that the patient information booklet/brochure include tables
listing breast implant materials, chemicals that might be released from breast implants, and
heavy metals present in breast implants. FDA recommends that the patient information
booklet/brochure provide context to the levels of risk/exposure of the chemicals and heavy
metals listed in these tables. For example, manufacturers may note that the potential toxicity of
the chemicals and metals have been evaluated through toxicity testing and risk assessments to
assess the exposure levels in comparison to the amount determined to likely be safe, but that
individual responses may vary, and that all reactions cannot be predicted. Appendix C provides
an example of a format that follows these recommendations. Please note the concentrations
included in the Materials Device Description Example in Appendix C are provided for
illustrative purposes only.
Although this information is currently publicly available in the FDA Summary of Safety and
Effectiveness Data (SSED) for each of the approved breast implants, 13 FDA recommends that
this detailed device description information be available and easily accessible to the patients to
help ensure transparency and patient safety. This device description information is intended to
help inform the patients of the types and quantities of chemicals and heavy metals that are
detected in breast implants. The patient should also be informed that most of these chemicals
stay inside the shell of the implant but small quantities have been found to diffuse (gel bleed)
through the implant shell of silicone gel-filled implants, even if the implant is intact and not
ruptured or leaking.

Patient Device Card
Breast implants are subject to medical device tracking requirements under section 519(e) of the
FD&C Act; tracking is intended to facilitate notification and recall in the event a device presents

a serious risk to health that requires prompt attention. As such, we believe it is important to
include specific information related to the device in the patient device card.
This piece of labeling has been referred to in different ways by manufacturers, such as a
manufacturer device card, patient identification card, or patient information card. Regardless of
the name used, the purpose of the patient device card is to provide patients with specific
information about their device(s). As such, FDA recommends that the card clearly be labeled so
that the physician can easily find it and provide it to the patient immediately following surgery.
Additionally, we recommend that the device card include, but need not be limited to, the
following information:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

A statement that “This card belongs to the patient. Please give it to the patient.”
Device’s serial or lot number;
Device’s style and size;
Unique Device Identifier (UDI); 14
Web link to access most current patient decision checklist, boxed warning, and labeling
for the specific implant that the patient received;
A statement that “There is a boxed warning for breast implants, see web link;” and
Toll-free phone number to the breast implant manufacturer.

Appendix A: Boxed Warning Example
WARNING:
•

•

•

Breast implants are not considered lifetime devices. The longer
people have them, the greater the chances are that they will develop
complications, some of which will require more surgery.
Breast implants have been associated with the development of a
cancer of the immune system called breast implant-associated
anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). This cancer occurs
more commonly in patients with textured breast implants than
smooth implants, although rates are not well defined. Some patients
have died from BIA-ALCL.
Patients receiving breast implants have reported a variety of systemic
symptoms such as joint pain, muscle aches, confusion, chronic
fatigue, autoimmune diseases and others. Individual patient risk for
developing these symptoms has not been well established. Some
patients report complete resolution of symptoms when the implants
are removed without replacement.

Appendix B: Patient Decision Checklist Example
To the patient considering breast implants filled with saline or silicone gel intended for breast
augmentation or breast reconstruction:
The review and understanding of this document is a critical step in making the decision whether
you should choose breast implant surgery. You should learn about breast implants and then
carefully consider the benefits and risks associated with breast implants and breast implant
surgery before you make that decision. This form lists important risks, including those known or
reported to be associated with the use of the device based on information from clinical trials,
scientific literature, and reports from patients who have undergone device placement.
This patient decision checklist is intended to supplement the additional patient labeling that
should be provided to you by your physician. You should receive a patient booklet/brochure that
includes important information about your specific breast implant, as well as a boxed warning
and patient decision checklist. After reviewing the information in the patient information
booklet/brochure for the specific implant that will be used, please read and discuss the items in
this checklist carefully in consultation with your physician. You should place your initials in the
location provided next to each item to indicate that you have read and understood the item. Your
full signature at the end of this document means that you have read the materials and that your
physician has answered all questions to your satisfaction.
Considerations for a Candidate for Successful Breast Implantation
I understand that I am not a candidate for breast implants if any of the following situations
applies to me:
•
•
•

I have an active infection anywhere in my body;
I have an existing cancer or pre-cancer of my breast tissue that has not been adequately
treated; or
I am pregnant or nursing.

I understand that if I have any of the following conditions, I may be at a higher risk for a poor
surgical outcome:
•
•
•

•
•

Medical condition that affects my body’s ability to heal (e.g., diabetes, connective tissue
disorder);
Active smoker or a former smoker;
Currently taking drugs that weaken the body’s natural resistance to disease, such as
steroids and chemotherapy drugs (e.g., prednisone, tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate,
azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, chlorambucil, leflunomide, or
cyclophosphamide);
History of chemotherapy or planned chemotherapy following breast implant placement;
History of radiation therapy or planned radiation following breast implant placement;

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•
•

Conditions that interfere with wound healing or blood clotting (e.g., hemophilia, von
Willebrand disease, factor V Leiden, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, or systemic lupus erythematosus); or
Reduced blood supply to the breast tissue.

I understand the following conditions have not been adequately studied to determine whether the
conditions put me at higher risk:
•
•
•

Autoimmune disease (e.g., Hashimoto’s, Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis) or family history
of autoimmune disease (breast implant premarket clinical studies have not evaluated the
safety of breast implants in patients with autoimmune disease);
Clinical diagnosis of depression or other mental health disorder (including body
dysmorphic disorder or eating disorder); or
Have other products permanently implanted in the breast.

Risks of Breast Implant Surgery
I understand that there are risks 15 of undergoing breast implant surgery. I understand that risks of
undergoing breast implant surgery may include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

breast pain (reported in up to 36.5% of procedures),
skin or nipple areola sensitivity changes or loss (reported in up to 35% of procedures),
asymmetry (reported in up to 28% of procedures),
impact of aging or weight change on size and shape of breast (reported in up to 10% of
procedures),
infection requiring possible removal of implant (reported in up to 9% of procedures),
swelling (reported in up to 9% of procedures),
scarring (reported in up to 7% of procedures),
fluid collections (seroma) (reported in up to 6.5% of procedures),
hematoma (reported in up to 2.8% of procedures),
tissue death of breast skin or nipple (reported in up to 2% of procedures),
inability to breast feed (reported in up to 1.6% of procedures),
complications of anesthesia (reported in up to 1% of procedures),
bleeding (may occur but specific rates are not publicly available in Summaries of Safety
and Effectiveness Data (SSEDs) 16),
chronic pain (may occur but specific rates are not publicly available in SSEDs),
damage to surrounding tissue, such as muscle, nerves, and blood vessels (may occur but
specific rates are not publicly available in SSEDs), and

15

These rates were reported in the clinical studies used to support approval of breast implants up through October
2019. Each rate specified herein represents the largest percentage reported in any PMA approved for breast implants
up through October 2019.

impact on imaging of breast tissue (may occur but specific rates are not publicly available
in SSEDs).

My physician has discussed these risks and has provided me with the patient information
booklet/brochure (including the boxed warning) with information on the types of risks that are
possible and expected rates of occurrence.
My physician has discussed the potential use of other implanted products during my breast
implant surgery. My physician has also discussed the risks and benefits of using these implanted
products and their planned surgical approach.

Risk of Cancer - Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIAALCL)
I understand that breast implants are associated with the development of a type of cancer of the
immune system called Breast Implant-Associated Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (BIAALCL). Information regarding the number of medical device reports of BIA-ALCL can be found
on FDA’s website. 17 I have received information regarding the overall incidence rates of BIAALCL and the rates as they pertain to my specific breast implant.
I understand that this cancer has been reported more frequently for textured breast implants, but
that patients with smooth surfaced implants have also been diagnosed.
I understand that patients with breast implants have a risk of developing BIA-ALCL within the
scar tissue and fluid surrounding the breast implant.
I understand that BIA-ALCL typically takes several years to develop after implantation, but
cases have been reported as early as within one year. Typical symptoms to be aware of include:
swelling, breast tightness, pain, lumps, or swelling of the breast months or years after I receive
my implants.
I understand that treatment for BIA-ALCL involves an operation to remove the implants and the
surrounding scar tissue capsule. Based on the stage of the cancer at diagnosis, some patients have
required chemotherapy or radiation. While BIA- ALCL typically responds well to therapy, some
patients have died from BIA-ALCL. Diagnosis and treatment may be at my own expense and is
not always covered by insurance.

Systemic Symptoms
I understand that some patients who have received breast implants have reported a variety of
systemic symptoms including joint pain, fatigue, rash, memory loss, and “brain fog” that some
patients have called breast implant illness. While the causes of these symptoms are unclear, some
patients have reported relief of these symptoms with removal of their implants and surrounding
scar tissue capsule, however not all patients may experience improvement in their symptoms.
Researchers are working to better understand the possible link between breast implants and these
symptoms.
I also understand that some patients with breast implants have reported health problems in their
children after birth or breastfeeding. While a causal link between breast implants and these
reported health problems in children has not been demonstrated, more research is needed. I
understand that breast implants and breast surgery may interfere with my ability to successfully
breastfeed.
Patient Initials: __________
Breast-Implant Specific Risks
I understand that a breast implant is NOT a lifetime device and the longer I have my implants,
the more likely I am to experience a complication and the more likely I am to require a
reoperation requiring the replacement or removal of my breast implant. As many as 20 percent of
women who receive breast implants for augmentation have to have their implants removed
within 8 to 10 years, but my implants may last for a shorter or longer time.
I understand that my breast implant may rupture or leak at any time, and that the longer I have
my implants, the more likely I am to experience a complication such as rupture. I understand that
gel bleed (small quantities of chemicals diffusing from the implant shell) of silicone gel-filled
implants may occur. I understand that if I have a saline-filled implant, my breast may deflate in
appearance if there is a rupture or leakage of the saline.
I understand that if I have a silicone gel-filled breast implant, I or the physician may not be able
to tell on physical exam whether my implant has ruptured or is leaking silicone gel. Because
rupture or leakage of silicone gel-filled breast implants is difficult to detect, I understand that
periodic imaging evaluation is recommended for screening of silicone gel-filled breast implant
rupture. It is recommended that I have periodic imaging of my silicone gel-filled breast implants
to screen for implant rupture regardless of whether my implants are for cosmetic augmentation or
reconstruction. These recommendations do not replace other additional imaging that may be
required depending on my medical history or circumstances (i.e., screening mammography for
breast cancer).
Even if I have no symptoms, I should have regular imaging evaluations as described in the
“Recommended Follow-Up” section below. These imaging evaluations may not detect all
ruptures or leaks, be costly, and the expense may not be covered by my medical insurance.

I understand that silicone can migrate from my implant into nearby tissues (e.g., chest wall,
lymph nodes under the arm) and organs (e.g., liver, lungs) where it may not be possible to
remove.
I understand that all breast implants can interfere with mammography and breast exams, which
could delay the diagnosis of breast cancer. Mammography can also cause the breast implant to
rupture or leak. I should tell the mammography technician if I have breast implants.
I understand that the long-term risks of breast implants may include:
• painful or tightening of scar tissue (capsule) around my implant (capsular contracture)
(reported in up to 51.7% of patients),
• rupture or leaking of the implant (reported in up to 31.2% of patients),
• wrinkling of the implant (reported in up to 20% of patients),
• visibility of the implant edges (reported in up to 6% of patients),
• shifting of the implant (reported in up to 11.5% of patients), or
• need for reoperation (reported in up to 59.7% of patients).
I understand that I will receive a patient device card after my surgery that has information on
each of my specific implants. I understand that it is important for me to keep each card in case I
or my physician need to know what kind of implant I have many years later.
I understand that all breast implants contain chemicals and heavy metals. I understand that most
of these chemicals stay inside the shell of the implant, but small quantities have been found to
diffuse (gel bleed) through the implant shell of silicone gel-filled implants, even if the implant is
intact and not ruptured or leaking. A list of the components, chemicals, and heavy metals is
available in the patient information booklet/brochure.
Patient Initials: __________
Recommended Follow-up
Even if I have no symptoms, I should have my first ultrasound or MRI at 5-6 years after my
initial implant surgery and then every 2-3 years thereafter. If I have symptoms or uncertain
ultrasound results for breast implant rupture at any time, an MRI is recommended.
I understand that I will need routine and regular follow-up with my physician as long as I have a
breast implant for examination of my breast implant as well as to discuss any updates regarding
breast implant issues.
National Breast Implant Registry (NBIR): I understand and have discussed with my physician
that there is a National Breast Implant Registry where information regarding my health and
breast implant information can be entered. The NBIR may help understand the long-term safety
and performance of breast implants.
Patient Registry and Outcomes For breast Implants and anaplastic large cell Lymphoma (ALCL)
etiology and Epidemiology (PROFILE): I understand and have discussed with my physician that
14

there is a registry (PROFILE) where information is collected to better understand BIA-ALCL in
patients with breast implants.
Patient Initials: __________
Questions for My Physician
I have had the opportunity to ask my physician questions about his or her experience, medical
degree, specialty of training, and credentials. I understand that breast implants have associated
procedural risks and should only be used by physicians who are appropriately trained.
Patient Initials: __________
Options Following Mastectomy
I understand that breast reconstruction is an elective procedure which I can choose to do or not.
I understand that I may choose not to have breast reconstruction (“going flat”) and may choose to
use an external prosthesis in my bra to look like I have a breast when wearing clothes.
I understand the surgical options for breast reconstruction, including the use of a breast implant
and the use of my own tissue (“autologous reconstruction”).
I understand that if my breast implants are ever removed, I may be left with dimpling, chest wall
concavity, puckering, or sagging of my breasts or skin.
I understand that more surgeries may be necessary in the future due to complications or to
remove or replace the breast implants.
I have discussed all of the options for breast reconstruction with my provider, including whether
I am a candidate and the benefits and risks of each, and I believe that breast reconstruction with a
breast implant is the best option for me.
Patient Initials: __________
Breast Augmentation Options
I understand that breast augmentation is an elective procedure to increase the size of my breasts.
I understand that breast augmentation may result in permanent changes to my breast tissue and if
my implants are ever removed, I may be left with unsatisfactory appearance, changes to the size
and shape of my breasts, including but not limited to dimpling, chest-wall concavity, puckering,
sagging, or different incision size or location.
If I am an augmentation patient, any additional surgeries or medical procedures will likely be at
my own expense.

CONFIRMATION OF DISCUSSION OF RISKS
Patient: I acknowledge that I have received and read the patient information booklet/brochure
for the specific implant that will be used during my surgery and that I have had time to discuss
the information in it and on this document with my physician. I have had the opportunity to ask
questions and understand the benefits and risks of breast implants for me, given my specific
health conditions. I have considered alternatives to breast implants, including reconstruction
without breast implants, no reconstruction/augmentation, and their benefits and risks.

_______________________________________
Patient Signature and Date

Physician: I acknowledge that I have discussed the benefits and risks of breast implants as
described elsewhere in the patient information booklet/brochure and in this checklist. I have also
explained the benefits and risks of the alternatives. I have encouraged the patient to ask
questions, and I have addressed all questions.
