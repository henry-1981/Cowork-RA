User Fees and Refunds for 
De Novo Classification Requests 
Guidance for Industry and 
Food and Drug Administration Staff 
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA 
or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding 
on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements 
of the applicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the 
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.  
I. 
Introduction 
The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 20221 (MDUFA V), amended the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to collect user fees for the 
review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2022, including De 
Novo classification requests (De Novo requests).2  The additional funds obtained from user 
fees will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the medical device review 
process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical 
device review process as outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to Congress.3 
The purpose of this guidance document is to identify: (1) the types of De Novo requests 
subject to user fees; (2) exceptions to user fees; and (3) the actions that may result in refunds 
of user fees that have been paid. This document also incorporates MDUFA V process 
improvements. 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed 
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The

use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required. 
II. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
1. 
Are all De Novo requests subject to user fees? 
Most De Novo requests are subject to user fees. Section 738(a)(2)(A)(xi) of the FD&C 
Act requires you to pay a user fee for any De Novo request that you submit to FDA, 
unless you qualify for one of the exceptions listed below. You will not have to pay a 
user fee for your De Novo request if: 
• 
your submission is for a device intended solely for a pediatric population; see 
section 738(a)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the FD&C Act4 or, 
• you are a state or federal government entity and your device will not be 
distributed commercially; see section 738(a)(2)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. 
Refer to Appendix 1 for a summary of when a De Novo request is subject to user fees 
(Table 1). 
2. 
What are the De Novo user fees? 
User fees for the current fiscal year are established under section 738 of the FD&C Act 
and shown on the FDA MDUFA User Fees website at 
https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/medical-device-user-fee­
amendments-mdufa. 
3. 
How do I pay my user fee(s)? 
As outlined below, there are three ways you may submit your user fee.5 Be sure to 
include the Payment Identification Number (PIN, beginning with MD) and the FDA 
P.O. Box on your check, bank draft, or U.S. Postal Money Order. A PIN is obtained 
after creating a User Fee Cover Sheet and selecting “Submit Cover Sheet to FDA.” 
Also, you should include a copy of your User Fee Cover Sheet (Form FDA-3601, 
accessible through FDA’s User Fee System at 
https://userfees.fda.gov/OA_HTML/fdaCAcdLogin.jsp) with your payment. 
4 For guidance on the type of safety and effectiveness information that may be needed to support marketing of 
pediatric devices and on protection of pediatric subjects during the course of clinical trials involving such 
devices, please see the guidance entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices,” available at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/premarket-assessment-pediatric­
medical-devices.

1) Preferred method: Credit Card or Electronic Check (ACH): FDA has partnered 
with the U.S. Department of the Treasury to utilize https://www.pay.gov/, a Web-
based payment system, for online electronic payment. You may make a payment 
via electronic check or credit card after submitting your cover sheet. To pay online, 
select the “Pay Now” button. Credit card transactions for cover sheets are limited to 
$24,999.99. 
2) Check: All paper checks must be in U.S. currency from a U.S. bank and made 
payable to the Food and Drug Administration. Please write your unique PIN, from 
the upper right-hand corner of your completed Medical Device User Fee cover 
sheet, on the check and mail the check to the appropriate address listed below. FDA 
will not be able to process your payment correctly without your cover sheet PIN. 
Check payments by mail:

4. 
What are the circumstances when FDA will refund my user fee 
payment? 
Statutory exception: If we determine that you have mistakenly paid a fee for a De Novo 
request that does not require a fee because of a statutory exception (see FAQ 1 and 
Appendix 1 (Table 1)), FDA will refund your payment for that submission upon 
request. 
Failure to supply a valid electronic copy (eCopy) or an electronic submission template: 
See FAQ 7 and Appendix 1 (Table 2). 
Withdrawal of submission if acceptance criteria are not met: See FAQ 8 and Appendix 
1 (Table 2). 
Withdrawal of an electronic submission template which did not pass technical 
screening and is placed on hold: See FAQ 9 and Appendix 1 (Table 2). 
5. 
What are the circumstances when FDA will not refund my user fee 
payment? 
1) Your De Novo request is accepted for review: After the user fee is paid and a valid 
eCopy is provided to FDA, FDA intends to conduct an acceptance review of your 
submission within 15 calendar days, in accordance with 21 CFR 860.230 and as 
detailed in the FDA guidance, “Acceptance Review for De Novo Classification 
Requests.”6 If the De Novo request is accepted for review, we will not refund your 
user fee payment. 
2) Your De Novo request submitted via eSTAR has passed technical screening: When 
submitting an electronic submission (eSubmission) using an electronic submission 
template (e.g., electronic Submission Template And Resource (eSTAR)7,8 ), the 
refuse to accept (RTA) requirements of 21 CFR 860.230 have been automated 
within the eSTAR.9 However, FDA intends to employ a virus scanning and 
technical screening process for an eSTAR. The technical screening process is 
anticipated to occur within 15 calendar days of FDA receiving the De Novo

7 For more information see FDA’s website regarding the eSTAR program (https://www.fda.gov/medical­
devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/voluntary-estar-program). This website provides current 
information regarding eSTAR program for CDRH and CBER. 
8 eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission template that is currently available to facilitate the 
preparation of De Novo requests as eSubmissions. For simplicity, the electronic submission created with this 
electronic submission template is often referred to as an eSTAR. 
9 For more information on the RTA process, please see “Acceptance Review for De Novo Classificaiton 
Requests” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/acceptance­
review-de-novo-classification-requests.

eSTAR. FDA intends to begin the technical screening for De Novo electronic 
submissions after confirmation of user fee payment. If the eSTAR does not pass the 
technical screening process, FDA will notify the submitter via email10 and identify 
the inaccurate or irrelevant information, and the De Novo will be placed and remain 
on hold until a complete replacement eSTAR is submitted to FDA. FDA will not 
refund user fees paid for eSTARs that have passed technical screening. 
3) Your De Novo request is declined: If your De Novo request is accepted for review 
and declined, we will not refund your fee payment. Please note that there are 
multiple reasons for declining a De Novo request that are identified in 21 CFR 
860.260(c), including that the product in the De Novo request is not a device under 
section 201(h) of the FD&C Act and is not a combination product as defined at 21 
CFR 3.2(e) (21 CFR 860.260(c)(4)). Please see the FDA guidance document 
entitled “FDA and Industry Actions on De Novo Classification Requests: Effect on 
FDA Review Clock and Goals”11 for more information. 
Consultation with FDA personnel before submitting De Novo requests for products for 
which a De Novo request is not the appropriate pathway will serve to conserve both 
FDA and industry resources. Among the resources to help you ascertain whether your 
device is eligible for De Novo classification are the Division of Industry and Consumer 
Education (DICE) for CDRH and the Manufacturers Assistance and Technical Training 
Branch (MATTB) for CBER ; the CDRH or CBER review staff; and product 
classification resources on the CDRH website, available at 
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/classify-your­
medical-device. DICE can be reached by phone at (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100, 
or by email at DICE@fda.hhs.gov. MATTB can be reached at (800) 835-4709 or (240) 
402 8020, or by email at Industry.Biologics@fda.hhs.gov. 
In addition, in order to obtain information regarding the class in which a device has 
been classified or the requirements applicable to a device, a manufacturer may submit a 
request under section 513(g) of the FD&C Act. For more information on submitting a 
513(g) Request for Information, please see the guidance document entitled “User Fees 
for 513(g) Requests for Information.”12

6. 
Do I have to pay for a new submission if I previously received a De 
Novo decline order for my device? 
Yes, unless a statutory exception applies. Any new submission for a device for which a 
previous De Novo request was issued a decline order is subject to the fee associated 
with the submission type, if the type is subject to fees.13 
If we decline your De Novo request for any of the reasons set forth in 21 CFR 
860.260(c),14 it may be appropriate to submit a different type of marketing application 
for the product that was the subject of the request, such as a premarket notification 
(510(k)), a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application, or a premarket approval 
application (PMA). HDEs are not subject to user fees.15 However, if you submit a 
510(k) or PMA, FDA will assess the 510(k) or PMA fee in effect at the time of 
submission (https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/medical-device-user­
fee-amendments-mdufa). 
You may also submit a new De Novo request if you believe you have additional 
information, including performance data, demonstrating that either general controls 
alone, or general and special controls, provide reasonable assurance of safety and 
effectiveness for the device. Because FDA considers this submission a new De Novo 
request, we will assess the fee in effect for a De Novo request at the time of the new De 
Novo request. This information is summarized in Appendix 1 (Table 3). 
7. 
If FDA considers my De Novo request withdrawn because I failed to 
supply a valid electronic copy (eCopy) or an eSTAR, will FDA refund 
my fee payment? 
Yes. Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act provides statutory authority to require eCopies 
or submission solely in electronic format (e.g., eSTAR) after issuance of final 
guidance.  As outlined in FDA’s guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device 
Submissions,”16 if FDA does not receive an eCopy, or receives an eCopy that cannot 
be accepted because it does not meet our technical standards, the omission or reasons 
for that failure will be communicated to you in writing to aid in your creation of a valid 
replacement eCopy. If a valid eCopy of an original submission is not received within 
180 calendar days of this notification, the Agency considers a De Novo request to be 
withdrawn. A notice of withdrawal in these circumstances is sometimes referred to as a 
“deletion letter.” The term “deletion” is used to differentiate withdrawal due to a lack 
of timely response (21 CFR 860.250(a)(1)-(2)) from a request to withdraw a pending 
13 Section 738(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act. 
14 For more information, see FDA’s guidance entitled, “FDA and Industry Actions on De Novo Classification 
Requests: Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory­

De Novo request submitted by the requester (21 CFR 860.250(a)(4)). If the De Novo 
request is withdrawn (deleted) in this manner, FDA will refund the fee paid upon 
request. If you decide not to submit a valid replacement eCopy of your original 
submission in response to the eCopy hold notification, you may also send a written 
request to withdraw your submission (see 21 CFR 860.250(a)(4)) before receiving a 
deletion letter and request a refund of the fee paid. FDA intends to follow a similar 
process should an eSTAR be submitted that does not pass an automatic verification 
process.17 Note that your fee will not be refunded if you fail to provide a valid eCopy or 
an eSTAR for a response to an additional information request after the De Novo 
request has been accepted for review (see FAQ 14 and Appendix 1 (Table 2)). 
8. 
If acceptance criteria are not met for my De Novo request, will FDA 
refund my user fee payment? 
Yes. FDA intends to conduct an acceptance review18 of your submission in accordance 
with 21 CFR 860.230 and as detailed in the FDA guidance, “Acceptance Review for 
De Novo Classification Requests.”19 If FDA refuses to accept your submission, you 
will be notified within 15 calendar days of receipt that your submission has not been 
accepted (21 CFR 860.230(a) and 21 CFR 860.230(c)). You may submit additional 
information to the De Novo request to address the reasons for the refusal without 
submitting a new user fee. Alternatively, you may send a written request to withdraw 
the submission (see 21 CFR 860.250(a)(4)) and request a refund of the fee paid if you 
decide not to provide additional information. See FAQ 15 below for more information 
on how to request a refund. 
9. 
Will FDA refund the user fee if I submit a De Novo request using 
eSTAR, the eSTAR does not pass technical screening and is placed on 
hold, and I withdraw the De Novo request? 
Yes. You will be notified within 15 calendar days of receipt if your eSTAR does not 
pass technical screening and is placed on hold. You may submit additional information 
to the De Novo request to address the reasons for the technical screening hold without 
submitting a new user fee. Alternatively, you may send a written request to withdraw 
the submission (see 21 CFR 860.250(a)(4)) and request a refund of the fee paid if you 
decide not to provide additional information. Additionally, Section V, Question 5 of 
FDA’s guidance “Acceptance Review for De Novo Classification Requests”20 explains 
that FDA may refuse to accept a De Novo request, if, on its face, the De Novo request 
is ineligible for De Novo classification due to the existence of a legally marketed 
predicate, an existing classification regulation exists for the same device type, or an 
17 https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/voluntary-estar-program

860.230 have been automated within the eSTAR.

approved PMA(s) exists for the same device type. For eSTARs, FDA intends to refund 
user fee payments, upon request, for an eSTAR that FDA determines to be ineligible on 
its face for the same reasons as outlined above. In such instances, FDA will use the 
technical screening process to place the eSTAR on hold within 15 calendar days of 
eSTAR receipt. The requester may then request withdrawal of the eSTAR and request a 
refund. 
10. Will FDA refund the user fee if I submit an eSTAR and the eSTAR 
passes technical screening? 
No. The RTA requirements of 21 CFR 860.230 have been automated within eSTAR, 
and therefore, FDA will consider a De Novo eSTAR that passes the technical screening 
process to have fulfilled the acceptance review requirements. As such, we will not 
refund user fees paid for eSTARs that have passed technical screening. 
11. Do I have to pay an additional fee if I submit additional information 
to a pending De Novo request? 
No. There are no fees when you submit additional information to a De Novo request 
for which FDA has not yet rendered a final decision. 
12. Will FDA refund the user fee if I withdraw my De Novo request after 
it has been accepted for review? 
No. The FD&C Act does not identify withdrawal of a De Novo request under 
substantive review as a basis for a refund; see section 738(a)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act. 
Although the FD&C Act provides FDA limited authority to provide a partial refund 
when a premarket application, premarket report, or supplement21 is withdrawn after 
filing,22 that authority does not extend to De Novo requests. 
13. Must I pay a new user fee if I withdraw and resubmit my De Novo 
request after it has been accepted for review (or my eSTAR passes 
technical screening)? 
Yes. If you withdraw your De Novo request after it has been accepted for review (or, 
for an eSTAR, after it passes technical screening), and resubmit at a later time, you 
must pay the fee in effect at the time of the new De Novo request. 
14. If FDA considers my De Novo request withdrawn after it has been 
accepted because I failed to supply requested information, will FDA 
require a new user fee if I resubmit my De Novo request? 
21 These terms are defined by sections 737(1), 737(2), and 737(4)(A), of the FD&C Act. 
22 See section 738(a)(2)(D)(iii) of the FD&C Act.

Yes. If you fail to respond to an FDA request for additional information pursuant to 21 
CFR 860.240(b)(1) (i.e., a supplement or amendment to revise existing information or 
provide additional information), FDA will issue a notice of withdrawal (deletion letter) 
stating that it considers your De Novo request to be withdrawn (21 CFR 
860.250(a)(1)). You must pay the De Novo fee in effect at the time of the new De 
Novo request. 
15. If eligible, how do I request a refund? 
To facilitate the Agency’s orderly issuance of refunds, you should submit a written 
request23 for a refund to the appropriate Center in FDA within 180 calendar days after 
the fee was due. 
For devices regulated by CDRH, requests for refunds should be submitted to the 
current mailing address displayed on the website
