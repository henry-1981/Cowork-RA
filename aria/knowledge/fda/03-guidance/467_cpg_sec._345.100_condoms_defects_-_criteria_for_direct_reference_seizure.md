CPG Sec. 345.100 Condoms; Defects - Criteria for Direct Reference Seizure
BACKGROUND:
The FDA has had a long history of seizure actions against condoms because of defects. On June 4, 1968,
FDA issued a plan for the sampling and examination of condoms which provided the basic criteria for
direct reference seizures of defective condoms in the Administrative Guideline 7424.03, published
January 1, 1973. The direct reference seizure authority was rescinded on October 1, 1980, in the
Compliance Policy Guide 7124.21 (See Sec. 310.100), "Prophylactics - Adulteration; Defects" when the
Bureau of Medical Devices chose to review the FDA inspection sampling criteria as well as sampling
criteria set forth in other specifications and standards used to determine the acceptability of lots of
condoms.
After completing its review of the inspection sampling criteria, FDA altered its position to bring it more
in line with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) "Standard Specification for Rubber
Contraceptives (Condoms)," "Designation: D3492-83." This is the voluntary standard that is available to
domestic latex condom manufacturers to assess the quality of their medical devices. According to this
voluntary standard, the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) for leakage is at 0.4%, or not to exceed 4 leaking
condoms per 1000 condoms.
For purposes of FDA's sampling inspection plan, the AQL of 0.4% is the value of the maximum percent
defective for leakage that will be considered satisfactory as a process average. In this regard, the
sampling inspection plan used by FDA emphasizes protection against the rejection of lots where the
percent defective is less than or equal to 0.4%.
The sampling inspection plan used by FDA has been extracted from MIL-STD-105D, (the military
standard for "Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection by Attributes"), based on an AQL of 0.4%,
inspection level II, and normal inspection. Single sampling will be used for lots less than or equal to
3200. For lots greater than 3200, multiple sampling will be used. The FDA plan is described in
Attachment A - Sampling Inspection Plan.
REGULATORY ACTION GUIDANCE:
Lots of condoms that are rejected based on the criteria in Attachment A - Sampling Inspection Plan are
subject to direct reference seizure. Divisions should forward seizure recommendations to the Division of
*Office of Medical Device and Radiological Health Operation (OMDRHO) in consult with*the Division of
Enforcement, Office of Enforcement and Import Operations, Office of Regulatory Affairs, Food and Drug
Administration.
SPECIMEN CHARGES:
Note: Charges for seizure of devices do not include allegations of shipment in interstate commerce
because allegations of interstate commerce are not required to support seizure of devices [see section
304(a)(2)] and FDA's jurisdiction to bring enforcement actions involving devices is presumed under
section 709 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).

1. For lots that exceed an AQL of 0.4%, charge:
"That the article of device is adulterated within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(c), in that it is not
subject to 21 U.S.C. 351(b) and its quality falls below that which it purports or is represented to possess
in that the devices contain defects/holes."
2. If the condoms are labeled for the prevention of disease, also charge:
"That the article of device is misbranded within the meaning of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), in that its
labeling 'for the prevention of disease' is false *or* misleading, because the article contains holes."
3. If the lot to be seized was repacked by the dealer, and it is believed that holes may have
occurred during repacking, add a statement to the examination paragraph of the complaint
similar to the following:
"(Insert name of firm) repacked the article of device from bulk stock after receipt in interstate
commerce."

Collect the condoms randomly and representatively across the lots. *All sample sizes listed above under
the column headed "Maximum Number of Condoms/Samples" are included as an accommodation to
the industry's quantitative packaging practices, and consist of more condoms than will be tested under
the sample examination plan below.*
2. Sample Examination
*Two single and five multiple sample examination plans are presented below for various lot sizes.
Examination may cease when a lot is determined to be violative.*
