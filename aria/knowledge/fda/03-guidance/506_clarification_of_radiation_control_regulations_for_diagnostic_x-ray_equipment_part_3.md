SECTION 1020.30(c) - CERTIFICATION OF COMPONENTS
Labeling Requirements for Imports

QUESTION: Since many packages are probabiy not opened at the customs entry,
should there be any certification on the outside of the package?

ANSWER: A certification label need not be attached to the outside of a package
containing a certified component(s). However, you must file a declaration upon
entry of your product, as deseribed in Title 19, Part 12, Section 12.91(b).

Certifying a Tube Housing Assembly

QUESTION: The requirement for leakage radiation and standby radiation applies
to the diagnostic source assembly that includes the tube housing assembly and
the beam limiting device. How does one certify a tube housing assembly separ-
ately from the beam limiting device?

ANSWER: You must ensure that the tube assembly which you are certifying is
compatible with the beam limiting devices for which it is intended. This means
that you must test your tube housing assembly on those beam limiting devices

with which you want to specify compatibility. Compatibility may be specified in
terms of manufacturer name and model number or in terms of generic physical char-
acteristics.

SECTION 1020.30(d) - CERTIFICATION BY ASSEMBLER

Certification of Assembly of Components of Diagnostic X-Ray System
(21 CFR 1020.30(d))

REF:BRH:DOC:MA 3703
Background

This opinion is issued in response to inquiries and misunderstandings concerning
the definition of "date of installation" as called for in item 3e of "Report of
Assembly of a Diagnostic X-ray System," FD 2579 (item 6 prior to 8/82). A num-
ber of manufacturers have incorrectly instructed their dealers and installers to
withhold the submission of FD 2579 until the purchaser of an x-ray system for-
mally accepts the installation and agrees to pay for it.

Opinion

The date of installation of an x-ray system or component is considered to be the
date the x-ray system is released by the assembler for use by the facility on
human patients. The assembler has fifteen (15) days from the date of instal-
lation to complete and distribute the FD-2579 before he will be considered to be

in violation of the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Section 1020.30(c).

Certify the Installation

QUESTION: The following is a question of terminology: When an ausembler com-

pletes an installation, does he affirm that certified components were properly
installed?

ANSWER: The term "certify the installation" does not appear in paragraph
1020.30(d) "Certification by Assembler." This paragraph states that the assem-
bler is required to assemble, install, adjust, and test certified components in
accordance with the instructions of the respective manufacturer, and assemblers
who install certified components shall file a report of such assembly. There-
fore, the assembler is certifying the assembly by affirming that certified
components were installed according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

37

Installation of Certified Components

QUESTION: Can an assembler install a certified component into a system contain-
ing certified components that have been modified by the user (or repairman) such
that a compliant installation cannot be made? If so, how does he report the
noncompliant assembly on Form FD 2579?

ANSWER: No, unless Section 1020.30(d)(2) of the standard, which strictly defines
the circumstances whereby an assembler may install a certified component with
noncompatible component(s) of an x-ray system, is satisfied. All the following
criteria must be met:

(a) Components of the existing x-ray system do not meet the manufacturer's
specifications for compatibility, as given by the certified component manu-
facturer.

(b) There is no commercially available certified component of a similar type
that is compatible with the existing x-ray systen.

(c) The component(s) of the existing x-ray system not meeting the specifi-
cation for compatibility (1020.30(d)) must be a certifiable component which
does not bear a certification label due to date of manufacture.

In the situation you have described, the components of the existing system that
preclude following manufacturers’ instructions do not meet criteria (c) above.
Therefore, an assembler is prohibited from installing a certified, noncompatible
component on such a system.

Section 1020.30(d)(2) of the standard prohibits any modification of a certified
component that will adversely affect the performance of the certified component
with respect to the standard. If such a modification is found to be desirable,

the user should seek advice from the appropriate State agency and/or the
National Center for Devices and Radiological Health. An exemption or a variance

may be necessary to allow the desired modification and subsequent installation
of other certified components.

38

Late Report of Assembly

QUESTION: If an assembler does not recognize the labeling of a given component

at the time of installation, he will not have reported it on FD 2579. His atten-
tion is directed, at a later date, to the fact that the component is certified.
He realizes that he is in violation, although the violation is not willful.

He returns to the site, verifies the installation, and conducts all tests and
adjustments to verify compliance.

We take the viewpoint that he shall file a supplementary FD 2579 giving actual
installation date, and adding the "Comments" block notation:

"Late report of component installation because the labeling was not recognized."

ANSWER: No, he should file a second complete FD 2579 listing all components
shown on the first form plus the overlooked component. A comment, as described,
would be appropriate and should point out which component was overlooked.

SECTION 1020.30(e) - IDENTIFICATION OF X-RAY COMPONENTS

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GUIDE
COMPLIANCE POLICY GUIDES 7133.63

CHAPTER 33 ~ RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH

SUBJECT: Certification and Identification of X-ray Components - Sections
1810.2 and 1028.38 (e)

BACKGROUND:

The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Section 1020.38(e) requires that
manufacturers of components of diagnostic x-ray equipment subject to the
Performance Standard shall: (1) permanently inscribe or affix thereon the
model number and serial number of the camponent so as to be: (2) legible and
accessible to view.

Manufacturers wno do not indicate a model designation on the component, but
instead have listed such terminology as part numbers, style numbers, type
numbers, catalog numbers, and transformer numbers do not meet the intent of
Section 1928.3@(e). It has been found that a manufacturer may list the
model designation on the component but this designation applies to the
complete x-ray system and not to an individual component. Other
manufacturers have placed the model designation on the component but do not
identify it as such. Still other manufacturers have given model names which
are not unique to the components involved and some identification labels
contain both a catalog number and a model number that are easily confused.

Another problem closely related to the one discussed above concerns what is
meant by "legible and accessible to view" as it appears in Section
1028.38(e) of the Standard. Many manufacturers and assemblers are
installing certified components in a manner that precludes the easy
identification of the component. Some are installed such that the inspector
must crawl around on his hands and knees to read the label, others require
the use of a mirror for reading, while still others require removal of some
part of the x-ray system to identify the component. The Bureau has
previously stated that the only label that must be conspicuous is the
warning label but that all required labels must be accessible to view if the
certified component is accessible to view.

POLICY:

To comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 162@.38@(e) which requires that a
model number and serial number be inscribed or affixed to a component, the
word "model" or "type" must appear as part of the manufacturer's required
identification of certified x-ray components. A model designation may

GUIDE 7133.03

describe only one certified component and may not be used to describe an
assemblage of components except as specified in Section 1928.30(e) or as
specifically approved by the Bureau. Similarly, the words (or reasonable
abbreviation of) “serial number" must appear as part of the serial
identification of a certified component.

Tne label bearing this identification and other information required by 21
CFR 1018.2, 1010.3, and 1020.30(e) shall be in a location that is readily
accessible to view to anyone inspecting the x-ray machine after it is
installed in a user location without having to unbolt, unlock, or relocate
the x-ray system to read such a label. The identification and certification
labels shall be on the outside of the equipment and not on a side that is
normally placed against a wall. It is realized that for some components
such as a tube housing assembly mounted under a table, the identification
and certification labels cannot be in view from outside the completed
system. In such a case, the identification and certification labels shall
be mounted on the component, although the component itself is not visible.
However, if the identification or certification label is behind a door,
panel, under a table, etc., which is readily accessible and can be opened or
removed without the need to unbolt, unlock, or relocate the x-ray system,
wording shall appear on the door, panel, etc., indicating the location of
the identification and/or certification labels.

Changes in a manufacturer's model designations must be reported by the
manufacturer to the Bureau by way of a supplement to their applicable
initial reports.

Cassette Holder Which is Considered a Part of a Certified
Positive Beam Limitation (PBL) System

Ref: NCDRH:DOC:MA 356

This is a clarification to the FDA position regarding the certification status
of a cassette holder used in a radiographic (only) x-ray system utilizing a
C-arm configuration and a certified PBL system.

A stationary C-arm radiographic (only) x-ray system classified as a stationary
general purpose x-ray system is subject to the provisions of 21 CFR 1020.31(e)
for field limitation and alignment. As such, it must provide positive beam
Limitation (PBL).

With the cassette holder (image receptor) permanently mounted at one end of a
C-arm configuration, it is the FDA position that the cassette holder is an
integral part of the PBL system. Thus, it is not subject to separate certi-
fication and identification. The certification and identification label located
on the system's collimator is sufficient for the entire PBL system.

Location of ID Nameplate

QUESTION: We would like further interpretation of Sections 1010.3 and 1020.30(e)
concerning the location of the identification nameplate. That is, does legible
and accessible to view when the product is fully assembled for use mean that

(1) the nameplate must not be inside a panel removable with a screwdriver, (2) it
must be on the outside of equipment but not against the wall, or (3) it cannot

be inside a panel when the panel can be opened without a tool but with a key? It
is felt that the identification and nameplate usually do not add to the aes-
thetic appearance of the product and, therefore, it is usually placed in an
inconspicuous location.

ANSWER: Being legible and accessible to view does not imply that the label must
be conspicuous. The intent of the standard is that an identification or certifi-
cation label be in a location where one who is inspecting the x-ray machine when
it is installed in a user location can read the label without having to unbolt

or relocate the x-ray system. However, the warning label should be conspicuous.
It should be so situated that a user of an x-ray machine could see the warning
when he is looking at the main control panel.

43

Identification of Multiple Parts

QUESTION: Many items such at phototimers, brightness stabilizers (automatic
exposure controls), and positive beam limiting systems (collimator, sensing
tray, electrical chassis), are made up of many components located in or on other
major components.

(a) How shall these items be identified with nameplates per Sections 1010.3
and 1020.30(e)? Must one model number be assigned to the two or more
scattered parts?

(b) Where must nameplates be located?

ANSWER: Our response to (a) is that it is permissible for a manufacturer to
assign more than one model number and nameplate to the scattered parts of major
components; however, it is not always required.

In response to (b) it is not necessary that every physically separated piece of
a major component be labeled. It is reasonable to label only the essential
parts of a major component if desired. Please note that in the event two or
more major components are sold as an integrated system (i.e., one catalog item
which is not intended to be subdivided for use with other components), only one
label is required. All tube housing assemblies must be labeled, since they are
subject to replacement. Following is a list of major components and suggested
label locations for each:

Major Component Label location

Tube Housing Assemblies On housing, including undertable tubes

X-ray Control On each x-ray control panel

X-ray HV Generators On generator housing

Spot Film Devices On spot film device

Image Intensifier On image intensifier

Tables On table

Cradles On cradle

Image Receptor Support On the image receptor support

Film Changer On changer (If separated control unit
is provided, this must also be
labeled)

Cassette Holders On cassette holder

Beam Limiting Devices On outside of collimator

SECTION 1020.30(f) - LIMITS OF RESPONSIBILITY

Final Testing of Diagnostic X-ray Systems and Components
Following Assembly

REF:BRH:DOC:MA 362

This is intended to establish NCDRH policy relative to final testing of a
newly-assembled x-ray system or component before release to the user.

Manufacturer Responsibility - The FDA believes that plant-based manufacturers
must include in their assembly instructions a specific requirement that the
assembler perform a test(s) for the applicable requirements of the FDA perfor-
mance standard at the time of installation. A thorough explanation of the equip-
ment required and step-by-step instructions must be provided by the component or
system manufacturer. The instructions should include a requirement to record

key data to demonstrate at a later date that all tests were performed and that
the equipment was left in full compliance with the standard. The FDA's National
Center for Devices and Radiological Health will ensure that these assembler test
instructions are provided through a close review of the information submitted by
manufacturers in initial, model change, and annual reports. Plant-based manufac-
turers who do not include a final compliance test in their assembler instruc-
tions could be subject to disapproval of their quality control and testing
programs.

Assembler Responsibility - Assemblers of diagnostic x-ray equipment must perform
a test or tests for the applicable requirements of the FDA performance standard
at the time of installation, if specified in the assembly instructions provided
by the component or system manufacturer. Assemblers who do not perform and docu-
ment such final compliance tests will be considered by the FDA to have issued a
false and misleading certification and will, therefore, be subject to regulatory
action by the Agency.

45

SECTION 1020.30(g) - INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO ASSEMBLERS
Installation and Operating Instructions

QUESTION: The manufacturer must provide to assemblers the installation and
operating instructions, ete., at no cost or not to exceed cost of publication
and distribution. What is cost of publication and distribution?

ANSWER: The cost to the buyer cannot exceed printing, handling, and mailing
costs.

Listing of Compatible Components

QUESTION: Regarding the listing of compatible components as required under
21 CFR 1020.30(g), we understand quite clearly that we must list one company's
x-ray tubes and collimators and our buckys if they are to be used on our equip-~

ment. However, we are confused as to whether other companies must, in turn,
list our components in their literature and specifications.

ANSWER: Component manufacturers are not required to list their products as being
compatible with any other manufacturer's products. However, an assembler may
mate only certified components that are compatible. Thus, unless one of the
manufacturers states that certified components to be mated are compatible, an
assembler who chooses to do so must submit his testing and quality control pro-
gram to the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Most assem-
blers will not have the necessary testing equipment and expertise to perform the
appropriate tests. Consequently, to ensure that his components can be used, it

is advantageous to a manufacturer to list those components of other manufac-
turers that are compatible with his own.

Acceptable Statements for Compatible Components

QUESTION: Is it acceptable to use a statement that the component is compatible
with all products bearing this company's nameplate? I recognize that this
places the responsibility on my company to assure that the component is com-

patible; however, it would greatly simplify the documentation changes when
adding or deleting products.

ANSWER: The procedure you have described is acceptable. However, it would mean
that all components bearing your nameplate must be compatible regardless of when

they were manufactured. Thus, 20 years from now a component that you certified
must still be compatible with all components bearing your nameplate. This may

present some difficult problems in the future.

47

SECTION 1020.30(h) - INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED FOR USERS
Maximum Line Current Specifications

QUESTION: Paragraph 1020.30(h)(3)(ii) of the Performance Standard for Diagnostic
X-Ray Equipment requires that when a generator may be used with various tube
units, the manufacturer must specify maximum line current as a function of tube
unit ratings.

Our past practice has been to satisfy maximum line current based on maximum gen-
erator ratings. In addition to providing best line characteristic, this prac-
tice has permitted upgrading of tube units without the need to replace the room
power system. Therefore, the standard requirements do not appear reasonable,
and the possibility exists that we have not interpreted it correctly. Please
clarify this point.

ANSWER: It is not our intent to prevent you from supplying information relating
to the generator rating by itself, but rather to give a system rating which will
allow field measurement of parameters that are dependent upon maximum line cur-
rent. It will still be essential that you give generator ratings so that they

ean be compared with the tube ratings. We would also encourage the installation

of a line adequate for the maximum rated component such that the system could be
upgraded in the future.

Measurement Basis

QUESTION: It is not clear what is meant by "measurement basis" in Section
1020.30(h)(3) (vii).

ANSWER: The regulations define technique factors such as peak tube potential,
tube current, etc. However, the definitions are general in nature and more
precise information is needed to interpret the manufacturers' indicated
technique factors. Specifically, the criteria used to obtain the indicated
technique factors should be given. For example, when measuring exposure time
for three phase equipment, the beginning and end of the exposure oycle may be
the 70-80 percent points on the high voltage waveform.

A statement of "measurement basis" is important since this is a basis for
compliance measurements.

49

SECTION 1020.30(j) - WARNING LABEL
Label Placement

Revised Ref: BRH:DOC:MA 4150

Warning Label

There have been several cases where manufacturers have chosen to affix the warn-
ing label either on the top or side panels of the main x-ray control. While the
labels themselves are legible, their placement would not be considered acces-
sible to the user, thus defeating their purpose.

A warning label, by its nature, should be conspicuous to the user. It should be

so situated that a user of an x-ray machine can see the warning when he is look-

ing at the main control panel. This usually is the front panel of the x-ray con-
trol where the main power switch and technique factor indications are located.

Any other placement of the warning label would be considered in noncompliance
with 21 CFR 1020.30(j).

Wording of Warning Label
QUESTION: Must the warning label be exactly as specified in Section 1020.30(j)?

ANSWER: The general rule is that warnings that differ slightly from the standard

and are more forceful and restrictive in content meet the intent of the regula-
tions.

51

Multiple Tube Head Systems

QUESTION: A hospital has an existing radiographic table, tube stand, tube, col-
limator, and a control with capability of energizing only the one tube. They
purchase new equipment consisting of a head stand, tube housing assembly, and
collimator (all certified) to add to the room. The new tube housing assembly
(THA) is to be energized by the old generator. *

We interpret the regulations to require that a light shall be mounted on the
existing THA as well as the new THA. The old control must also be modified to

give clear indication of which tube, old as well as new, is selected for energi-
zation. In summary, we interpret 21 CFR 1020.31(j) as being invoked to the sys-

tem, even if part of the system has existed prior to the effective date of the
standards.

ANSWER: The requirements apply only to the certified components and only the new
THA would require the indicating light. When the old THA and control are re-
placed, the new certified components would have to have the required indicators.

52

SECTION 1020.30(k) - LEAKAGE RADIATION FROM THE
DIAGNOSTIC SOURCE ASSEMBLY

Source Assembly as Encompassing the Entire Table Body

QUESTION: We have a tube mount/beam limiting mechanism that is designed for use
in a spot-film table only. The beam limiting mechanism is an integral part of
the fluoroscopic assembly as mounted in the table.

For purposes of radiation leakage testing, can we define the source assembly as
encompassing the entire table body? We would then test for leakage radiation
below the plane of the table top one meter from the source but, in any event,
measured at a point outside the table enclosure.

ANSWER: When the beam limiting device is an integral part of an undertable tube
mounting system and is not designed for use outside a table, it is reasonable to
perform the test for leakage radiation with the tube and mounting assembly in
place under the table. Therefore, the concept of the test you propose is

acceptable.

Leakage Testing

QUESTION: Is it agreed that when measuring leakage from the diagnostic tube
housing, the main beam will be blocked at the end of the cone in such a manner
to ensure the measurement of leakage radiation? May I dump the entire main beam
into a black body absorber?

ANSWER: Please note that radiation which "...passes through the tube housing
port and the aperture of the beam limiting device ...," 21 CFR 1020.30(b) (40),

is considered part of the useful beam even though it is not part of the
"x-ray field" and is, therefore, not subject to the leakage requirement.

Therefore, your proposal of blocking the end of the beam limiting device is
appropriate. This will be a somewhat more restrictive test than dumping the
entire useful beam into a "black body" asborber. It would also be appropriate
to block the port of the tube housing assembly for this test.

53

SECTION 1020.30(m) - BEAM QUALITY
Positive Means to Ensure That at Least The Minimum Filtration is Present

QUESTION: What is considered positive means to ensure that at least the minimum
filtration needed to achieve the beam quality requirements is in the useful beam
during each exposure as specified in Section 1020.30(m)? Specifically, would a
special tool with appropriate warnings and instructions that would disengage the
filtration elements where special (mammography ) radiographic techniques require
temporary disengagement of the filter and/or mirror optic system meet the
requirements of "positive means"?

ANSWER: We would not accept a special tool as being a "positve means." By "pos-
itive means" it is intended that the manufacturer design the equipmert so that
the filter(s) cannot be easily removed, and the probability of use of the equip-
ment without the proper filters is reduced. "Positive means" should ensure that
the proper filtration is in the beam without the operator having to remember to
take some action to ensure this. Although special tools may be used to remove
the filter during servicing, the equipment should be such that it is not nec-
essary for the operator to routinely add and/or remove it.

Measuring Compliance for Capacitor Energy Storage Equipment

QUESTION: Section 1020.30(m), "Beam Quality," states that measuring compliance

for capacitor energy storage equipment shall be determined with the maximum
quantity of charge per exposure. Regarding the actual method, we have a
question as follows:

Should this maximum quantity of charge be interpreted as:

(i) The maximum quanity stored in capacitors for each charging (namely,
the product of its capacitance and charged voltage), or

(ii) the maximum selectable or pre-determined quantity for each exposure

that is designed to be generated by the unit being measured?

ANSWER: The intent of the standard is consistent with option (ii). The maximum
selectable discharge available on the unit, as designed, should be used and not
the maximum stored in the capacitors.

55

Filtration and Beam Quality

QUESTION: Is the compensation filter used to obtain a uniform exposure at the
surface of the film covered by the standard? The filter is only in the edges of
the x-ray beam.

ANSWER: The Performance Standards for Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment do not place
requirements directly on the filtration but rather address beam quality and set
requirements as in Table 1, 21 CFR 1020.30(m). We would test your unit for
compliance by opening the compensation filter to the widest setting and making
the half-value layer determination.

Tolerance Levels of Technique Factors and Inherent Filtration

QUESTION: The standard requires each manufacturer to establish and state his own
tolerance levels of technique factors. If, for example, a manufacturer produces
an x-ray system rated nominally at 70 kVp and has established a kVp tolerance of
plus or minus 5 percent, must the inherent filtration be at least 2.2 mm of Al
equivalent filtration rather than 1.5 mm, as specified in the standard?

ANSWER: The question misinterprets the requirement of the standard. Ifa

machine is designed to operate at 70 kVp, then the appropriate range for measure-
ment of half-value is the 50 to 70 kVp range, regardless of whether or not the
measured kVp exceeds 70.

56

SECTION 1020.30(n) - ALUMINUM EQUIVALENT OF MATERIAL
BETWEEN PATIENT AND IMAGE RECEPTOR

Requirements for Film Changer with Image Intensifier

QUESTION: We have a film changer whose front panel meets the 1 mm requirement.
However, we occasionally mount an image intensifier under the film changer. The
total filtration between patient and image intensifier now includes the changer
front panel, the screens, film, grid--if used--and film compressor plate. The

total of all this is approximately 10 mm Al equivalent. Is this kind of appli-
cation covered in the regulations?

ANSWER: No. However, the intent of the regulations is violated by the introduc-
tion of 10 mm Al equivalent between the patient and the image receptor. If this
practice is continued, it may be necessary for the Center to amend this para-

graph to limit the total Al equivalent that may be so located. The manufacturer
is urged to devise an acceptable alternative.
