Utilizing Animal Studies to Evaluate
Organ Preservation Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

While the national transplant waiting list continues to grow, donation and transplant rates remain
stagnant. The shortage of organs available for transplants has propelled a new wave of
innovation in organ preservation technologies. These technologies are evaluated in animal
models to demonstrate that they are suitable for clinical experience.
The intent of this guidance is to provide recommendations regarding best practices for utilizing
animal studies for the evaluation of organ preservation devices. For information regarding Good
Laboratory Practice (GLP) requirements that may apply to such studies, you should refer to 21
CFR Part 58 Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies. FDA recommends
balancing the ethical principles of The Three R’s (replacement, reduction and refinement) 1 as
well as regulatory least burdensome principles, with the goal of using the minimum number of
animals necessary to generate data to demonstrate device safety. You should consider the best
practices for the development, conduct and presentation of these animal studies while
incorporating modern animal care and use strategies.
FDA recognizes that best practices for conducting animal studies to evaluate organ preservation
devices are evolving with the rapid advancements in such technologies. This guidance is not
intended to be comprehensive or prescriptive. Instead, it aims to highlight FDA’s initial thoughts
on how animal transplant models can be utilized to evaluate organ preservation technologies,
with careful considerations of regulatory least burdensome principles. While FDA expects that at
this time, most of these animal studies will be initially submitted to support investigational
device exemption (IDE) applications, and may also be used to support premarket approval

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required. In this document, the terms “you” and “your” refer to members
of industry, also known as “sponsors” or “submitters.” The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to
FDA.

II. Scope
The recommendations in this guidance document are applicable to devices intended to preserve
human vascularized organs via machine perfusion (hypothermic or normothermic) from the time
of organ procurement until transplant. The Health Resources and Services Administration
(HRSA), not FDA, oversees the donation and transplantation of human organs.
Many of the devices to which this guidance applies are currently under product development and
are not yet classified. This guidance document is also applicable, but is not limited to, devices
regulated under:
•
•
•

Product code QBA (Normothermic machine perfusion system for the preservation of
standard criteria donor lungs prior to transplantation);
Product code PHO (Normothermic preservation system for transplantation of initially
unacceptable donor lungs); and
21 CFR 876.5880 with the product code KDN (System, Perfusion, Kidney).

The recommendations in this guidance document do not apply to devices intended to preserve
organs via cold static storage, including those associated with product codes KDK, PIN, KDL,
and MSB that are regulated as class II devices under 21 CFR 876.5880 (Isolated kidney
perfusion and transport system and accessories). In addition, human cells, tissues, or cellular or
tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) regulated under 21 CFR 1271.3(d)(1) and sections 351 and 361
of the Public Health Service Act, and the devices utilized to preserve and transport these
products, are also outside the scope of this guidance document.

III. Definitions
For purposes of this guidance document, the following definitions apply:
Cold ischemia time: The amount of time that an organ is cold (≈4°C) and not receiving
adequate blood supply.
Cold static storage: The current standard method to preserve most organs. Organs are
submerged in a preservation solution in a closed container that maintains the temperature
at ≈4°C.
Extended criteria organs: Donor organs that are suboptimal for transplant (e.g.,
donation after cardiac death (DCD) donor organs). The criteria may differ depending on
organ type.
Ischemia reperfusion injury: Inflammation and oxidative damage to the tissue caused
by the restoration of blood supply after a period of ischemia.
Machine perfusion: A dynamic method to preserve organs, utilizing a device with a
pump that drives the movement of a perfusate. Devices performing machine perfusion of
organs may also contain oxygenators, heat exchangers, sensors, disposable circuits, and
computer units for processing and displaying hemodynamic and metabolic data. Machine
perfusion can be performed at various temperatures, e.g., ≈4°C (hypothermic), ≈37°C
(normothermic).
Perfusate: The solution that is pumped through the donor organ.
Reperfusion: The restoration of blood supply to an organ.
Warm ischemia time: The amount of time that an organ is at body temperature or room
temperature and not receiving adequate blood supply.

IV. Overview and General Study Design Considerations
FDA recommends a risk-based approach for developing animal study protocols for evaluating
organ preservation devices. In order to determine the specific risks to be evaluated in an animal
study, you should consider the risks inherent to the proposed indications for use and other known
risks of your device identified through literature review, bench testing, exploratory animal
studies, and, where appropriate, perfusion studies using human organs from consented donors for
research. For example, compared to cold static storage, machine perfusion may subject the
organs to additional risks of injuries due to organ manipulation and contamination of the
perfusion circuit. As another example, a device indicated to preserve extended criteria organs
may also subject the organs to different risks than that indicated to preserve standard criteria
organs.

3

After determining the specific risks and their corresponding failure modes, you should develop a
protocol with focused objectives and a priori acceptance criteria. When appropriate, FDA
recommends including the scientific rationales for the chosen acceptance criteria. In addition,
FDA recommends that you provide a rationale for the selection of a particular animal model for
your study, with careful considerations of anatomical, physiological, and immunological
similarities and differences between the animal model and humans.
A typical experimental setup for such animal studies will consist of three phases: organ
procurement, organ preservation, and organ reperfusion (see Figure 1 below).

Figure 1. The Three Phases of a Typical Animal Study for Evaluating Organ Preservation
Devices.
To begin the safety assessment of the organ preservation device, selected organs are procured
from appropriate animal model donors. Then, these organs are preserved using either an
experimental method (e.g., machine perfusion) or a control method (e.g., cold static storage).
Organs from both groups are reperfused in either an in vivo or ex vivo model, to evaluate
reperfusion injury. Due to its complexity, the reperfusion phase will be discussed in detail in
Section V. In the section below, our recommendations focus on general study design
considerations.

A.

Procedure Duration

Procedure duration has a significant effect on the outcome of transplant studies. You should
carefully consider the following recommendations regarding the duration of the experimental
procedures:

• Procurement Phase: FDA recommends specifying warm ischemia time and cold
ischemia time as part of the animal organ procurement protocol. The ischemia time
should reflect the indications for use of the device. For instance, when evaluating a
device indicated to preserve organs from non-heart-beating donors, you should extend the
period of warm ischemia by leaving the organ in situ after inducing cardiac arrest in the
animal.
•

Preservation Phase: Prior to initiating preservation, the time to successfully cannulate
and connect the organ to the device should be evaluated based on a priori acceptance
criteria. The total preservation time should take into consideration the expected maximum
transportation time that is consistent with the indications for use of the device.
Preservation time may vary based on organ type.

• Reperfusion Phase: At the end of the preservation phase, the organ should be coldflushed per standard protocol and exposed to a realistic preparation period prior to the
start of ex vivo reperfusion or in vivo transplant. The duration of reperfusion will be
discussed in detail in Section V.

B.

Contamination

Compared to cold static storage, machine perfusion has a higher risk of contamination due to the
increased complexity of the perfusion circuit and manipulation of the organ. Therefore, FDA
recommends performing bacterial cultures on perfusate samples taken at the end of a perfusion
session.

C.

Transportability

If your organ preservation device is transportable, your animal protocol should assess whether
the device and the organ can withstand the turbulence during transport (e.g., being driven in an
ambulance). Normal handling, such as tilting the device, during transport may jeopardize the
organ support system or cause transient changes in the perfusion parameters. FDA recommends
developing and evaluating strategies that mitigate the risk of organ injury from mechanical
trauma. For instance, if you plan to administer a vasodilator to regulate the spikes in
hemodynamic parameters (e.g., vascular pressure) during transport, you should evaluate whether
the amount of vasodilator administered achieves the intended effect.

V.

Reperfusion Models

After an organ undergoes preservation, the clinical concern centers on the severity of the
reperfusion injury. There are generally two models to assess reperfusion injury: an in vivo model
in which the organ is transplanted into a recipient animal and an ex vivo model in which the
5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
organ is reperfused in an isolated setup. In order to establish a more focused animal study
protocol, it is important to discuss the advantages and limitations of each model, in the context of
recent technological advancements in organ preservation technologies.

A. Ex Vivo Models
The development of new organ preservation technologies (e.g., normothermic machine
perfusion) has unlocked the potential to monitor and assess organs ex vivo prior to
transplantation. Compared to the more traditional ex vivo models (e.g., Langendorff heart
model), ex vivo models utilizing these new technologies are capable of continuously collecting
more detailed hemodynamic, metabolic, and functional data under more relevant physiological
conditions. In addition, compared to their in vivo counterparts, these ex vivo models typically
offer a more controlled study environment with fewer potential confounders (i.e., non-device
related factors that may affect the interpretation of study outcomes). Nevertheless, ex vivo
models have two important limitations:
•

The evaluation of ischemia reperfusion injury attributed to interactions between the
coagulation and inflammatory cascades is hindered by 1) the use of anticoagulants (e.g.,
heparin) in the blood-based perfusates and 2) the lack of whole-body immune response.

•

The association between organ viability and the hemodynamic, metabolic, and functional
data collected in an ex vivo model has not yet been well-established. While the perfusate
can be sampled during ex vivo reperfusion to measure levels of biomarkers for organ
injury and function, some of these biomarkers are considered exploratory and are not
well-accepted as surrogates for organ viability post-transplant.

While some of these limitations are inherent to the ex vivo model, other limitations can be
mitigated through improved study design. FDA has the following recommendations for study
designs in an ex vivo model:
•

Control group: Due to the limitations discussed above, an ex vivo model cannot
determine the absolute extent of ischemia reperfusion injury. Therefore, we recommend
including a control group (e.g., cold static storage) in the study, so that the relative effects
of the injury can be evaluated.

•

Near-physiological conditions: In order to simulate in vivo conditions, ex vivo
reperfusion should be performed under near-physiological conditions (e.g., temperature,
pressure, flow, oxygenation). The performance of critical device components (e.g.,
pumps, sensors, oxygenators) should be validated using exploratory animal studies or
studies using human organs not suitable for transplant.

•

Perfusate and its additives: If your device utilizes a blood-based perfusate, FDA
recommends the use of whole blood. If you plan to supplement your perfusate with
additives (e.g., sodium bicarbonate, vasodilators) through bolus or continuous infusions,
FDA recommends establishing pre-specified conditions for administering these additives
to minimize bias.

•

Reperfusion duration: You should specify the duration of ex vivo reperfusion to allow
adequate assessment of organ function and viability. For instance, if you plan to assess
the ability of a liver to synthesize a coagulation factor post-preservation, you should
consider the half-life of the coagulation factor when specifying the duration of
reperfusion.

•

Biomarkers: Ischemia reperfusion injury may affect several distinct structures and
functions of a single organ; therefore, FDA recommends evaluating a panel of
biomarkers (e.g., molecular, functional, imaging) targeted to assess both organ injury and
organ function. Due to the aforementioned limitations of the ex vivo model, special
consideration should be given to the evaluation of biomarkers for endothelial cell injury
and activation of the inflammatory cascades.

•

Edema: FDA recommends weighing organs before and after reperfusion to assess the
risk of machine perfusion-related edema. Machine perfusion parameters such as
preservation duration, perfusate composition, temperature, pressure, and flow can
contribute to edema, which in turn can adversely affect organ function. Extended
hypothermic machine perfusion of the heart, for instance, is known to induce myocardial
edema, 3,4 which is directly associated with increased ventricular stiffness and diastolic
dysfunction.

•

Histopathology: You should collect tissue biopsies from multiple representative regions
of the organ before and after reperfusion. FDA recommends that a qualified independent
pathologist evaluate the histopathology, with a focus on the integrity of endothelial cells
using appropriate stains (e.g., CD31 immunohistochemistry stains for assessing
sinusoidal endothelial cell integrity in the liver).

B.

In Vivo Models

After an organ undergoes preservation, transplanting the organ in a survival model offers the
most direct method for evaluating the preservation technology. Compared to ex vivo models, in
vivo models rely on the most clinically relevant endpoint—graft survival, instead of biomarkers
for organ injury and function. In addition, in vivo models allow for the whole-body immune
response and the complex interplay between the coagulation and inflammatory cascades, so you
can evaluate the full extent of ischemia reperfusion injury. Despite these advantages, in vivo
models introduce many non-device related variables, which may affect transplant outcomes and
hinder meaningful interpretation of data. To address these challenges, FDA recommends that you
carefully consider the following:
• Confounders in the organ recipient: FDA recommends that you collect baseline
hemodynamic profiles in organ recipients and provide immunosuppressants to limit the
effects of hemodynamic instability and immunologic heterogeneity, respectively, on
transplant outcome.

•

Confounders in the transplant procedure: The animal studies should be conducted in a
highly controlled facility by qualified personnel with extensive experience in surgical
transplants and post-operative care. Standard procedures, including antibiotic and
immunosuppressant regimens and post-operative monitoring and care, should be applied
to both the experimental and control groups. In order to reduce the risk of confounders
such as rejections, FDA recommends a follow up period no longer than one-week posttransplant, with endpoints that evaluate early injury patterns.

C.

Conclusion

In the field of organ preservation, the outlook and utility of ex vivo and in vivo models will
evolve with continued innovation in technology and our improved understanding of basic
science. On one hand, as machine perfusion more closely mimics physiologic conditions and
more biomarkers are accepted as surrogates for organ injury and function, the data collected in ex
vivo models are expected to become increasingly predictive of transplant outcomes and
subsequently reduce the number of animals used in the studies. On the other hand, in vivo models
have the potential to utilize genetically-engineered animals with specific immunologic
deficiencies or ischemic tolerance in order to simulate clinical scenarios.
While FDA understands that the choice of the model may be restricted by many factors including
utilizing animals and other available resources, your study should primarily be based on the
study objectives and the risks of the device. For example, ex vivo models may be sufficient to
support, for example, a device modification or protocol modification of a previously approved
IDE application. In vivo models may be necessary to support an IDE application for a first-of-itskind device or a perfusion solution with multiple novel components. Finally, the two models
should not be regarded as mutually exclusive; the in vivo models can be used to verify findings
from ex vivo models. Recognizing that each scenario is unique and that our understanding of
these devices continues to evolve, FDA recommends that sponsors submit a Pre-Submission to
obtain feedback on proposed animal studies.
