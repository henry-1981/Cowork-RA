Tq: All Manufacturers and Potential Manufacturers of Laser Products

Subject: User Instructions for Industrial Multi-axis Laser Workstations

BACKGROUND:

The multi-axis, robotic medium/high power laser workstations which are not
Class I laser products are of concern to the manufacturer, users, laser
safety officers, and the Agency with respect to installation of such
products and the hazard to personnel during use of these machines.

The capability of such machines to project the working beam in almost any
direction is often a design requirement to permit working on parts having
complex shapes. This requirement is often accompanied by a requirement for
workstations to accommodate all sizes of workpieces which make designing a
Class I protective housing for all possible workpieces infeasible. In
addition, the mobility of the focusing optic introduces the possibility of
the beam being projected or reflected beyond what would be considered a
normal working area.

The combination of extreme flexibility of working beam direction and the
justifiable absence of a Class I protective housing for the workstation

present a significant danger that personnel will be exposed to hazardous
levels of direct, reflected, or scattered laser radiation or collateral

radiation.

Manufacturers of laser products are required by 21 CFR 1040.10(h)(1) to
provide user instructions that include instructions for assembly or
installation of the equipment. These instructions must include adequate
safety precautions and warnings to avoid exposure of the operator or other
persons to levels of radiation greater than Class I. What information, in
addition to that which the manufacturer would normally provide, must be
included in user instructions for this type laser of product to comply with
the laser performance standard?

POLICY:

For the type of laser products of concern here, user instructions

[21 CFR 1040.10(h)(1)] must include an identification of the locations at
which laser radiation levels that exceed Class I may be present.
Specifically, user instructions must include a complete description of the
space surrounding the equipment within which the level of direct,
reflected, or scattered laser radiation can exceed the Class I limits or
the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) of the American National Standard
for the Safe Use of Lasers, Z136.1-1986, while the machine is.in its normal
operational mode.

4 “ Laser Notice #39

Page - 2

In situations where the configuration of the machine or the output pattern
or level of the laser radiation may be varied, the instructions must
include procedures for calculation or measurement of the radiation output.
Boundaries must be designated in the user information (manual) or the user
information must provide instructions on how to determine such boundaries
to assure that the operator and other personnel are not exposed to
hazardous levels of laser radiation.

Further, if operational or maintenance personnel are required to be within
these boundaries to perform their duties, appropriate control measures must
also be specified in the user instructions.

Please note that this guidance is not to be interpreted as a relaxation of
the performance requirements of 21 CFR 1040.10(f)(7) Location of Controls.
This section requires manufacturers to position their product's operations
controls so that exposure in excess of Class I levels is not necessary
during operation of these controls. User information or warnings are
provided in addition to, not in place of, proper positioning or shielding
of controls.

The Center invites comments from the public on this notice. Please address
any comments to the Director, Office of Compliance (HFZ-300), Center for
Devices and Radiological Health, 8757 Georgia Avenue, Silver Spring,
Maryland 20190.
