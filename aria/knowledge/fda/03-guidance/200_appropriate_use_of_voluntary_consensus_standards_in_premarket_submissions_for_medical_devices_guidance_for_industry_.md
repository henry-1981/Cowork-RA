On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.
FDA notes that in particular, the QMSR does not utilize certain terms associated with specific
record types, such as “Design History File (DHF),” “Device Master Record (DMR),” “Device
History Record (DHR),” and “Quality System Record (QSR).” The elements that comprise those
records are largely required to be documented by ISO 13485: 2016, including Clause 4.2 and its
subclauses, and Clause 7 and its subclauses.

Appropriate Use of Voluntary
Consensus Standards in Premarket
Submissions for Medical Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed this document to provide guidance to
industry and FDA staff about the appropriate use of national and international voluntary
consensus standards (referred to as consensus standards) in the preparation and evaluation of
premarket submissions for medical devices.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site at
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Voluntary consensus standards can be a valuable resource for industry and FDA staff. The use of
consensus standards can increase predictability, streamline premarket review, provide clearer
regulatory expectations, and facilitate market entry for safe and effective medical products.
Consensus standards provide a consensus approach to certain aspects of the evaluation of device
safety and effectiveness, such as testing methods, acceptance criteria, and processes to address
areas such as risk management and usability. The use of consensus standards can also promote
international harmonization. For decades, FDA has supported and relied on the development and
1

use of consensus standards to support the Agency’s mission in protecting and promoting the
public health.

A. The National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act
(NTTAA)
In 1996, Congress passed the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA)
(Pub. L. No. 104-113), codifying an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive, Circular
A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and
in Conformity Assessment Activities, that had previously been issued several times, dating back
to the late 1970s. 1 The NTTAA and OMB Circular A-119 established Federal government
policies to improve the internal management of the Executive Branch by directing agencies to use
voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards except where voluntary
consensus standards are inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. 2

B. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act and 21st
Century Cures Act
Congress also enacted the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA)
(Pub. L. No. 105-115) and the 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), which amended section
514(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Section 514(c) states, in part,
that FDA “shall, by publication in the Federal Register . . . recognize all or part of an appropriate
standard established by a nationally or internationally recognized standard development
organization for which a person may submit a declaration of conformity in order to meet a
premarket submission requirement or other requirement,” 21 U.S.C. 360d(c)(1)(A).
The term “recognize” in section 514(c) of the FD&C Act refers to FDA’s formal identification of
a standard after a determination that it is appropriate for manufacturers of products to declare
conformance to meet relevant requirements in the FD&C Act, including premarket submission
requirements.
This guidance refers to voluntary consensus standards recognized by FDA in the Federal Register
in accordance with section 514(c) of the FD&C Act as “FDA-recognized consensus standards.” A
list of consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize is available on the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site. 3 See section IV for more information
about standards that FDA has decided to recognize but for which recognition is still pending.
Use of consensus standards to meet premarket submission requirements can help facilitate the
premarket review process and is not limited to use in Abbreviated Premarket Notifications
(510(k)s), but can also be used for any 510(k), De Novo request, Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) application, Premarket Approval (PMA) application, Product Development
Protocol (PDP), Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application, Investigational New Drug

(IND) Application, or Biologics License Application (BLA) for those devices that are regulated
by CBER as biological products under section 351 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act.
However, in most cases the standards would only satisfy part of the submission requirements. In
addition, submitters may choose to conform to applicable consensus standards or address issues
relevant to approval or clearance in another manner. 4 Regardless of the decision a submitter
ultimately makes about the use of consensus standards, submitters should make sure their
premarket submissions contain all necessary information, as required by the FD&C Act and its
implementing regulations. 5

III. Scope
This guidance describes the appropriate use and documentation of both FDA-recognized and nonrecognized consensus standards for premarket submissions and how FDA staff intends to rely on
consensus standards during the review process. This guidance provides further clarity and
explanation about the regulatory framework, policies, and practices regarding the appropriate
utilization of consensus standards for premarket submissions. This guidance is applicable to all
articles that meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act.
Under section 514(c) of the FD&C Act, conformity with consensus standards can fulfill
requirements other than premarket submission requirements; this use is not discussed in this
guidance. This guidance also does not address the specific content required in a particular
premarket submission. Additionally, this guidance does not address consensus standards that are
incorporated by reference (IBR) into regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 830.10, Incorporation by reference
regarding requirements for a Unique Device Identifier). For additional information, see the
Standards Incorporated by Reference Database Website. 6

IV. Use of Consensus Standards
This section discusses procedures for the appropriate use of consensus standards, the content of a
Declaration of Conformity (DOC) to consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to
recognize, and the general use of standards when the use of a DOC is not appropriate for purposes
of premarket submissions.
The use of consensus standards is not mandatory for medical device premarket submissions
unless the consensus standard has been incorporated by reference into a regulation. A
manufacturer may choose to rely on applicable consensus standards or address issues relevant to
approval or clearance in another manner. As discussed below, if a manufacturer chooses to
submit a DOC under section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, the declaration must be truthful. 7
In the context of this guidance, “submitter” may refer to the holder of a premarket submission, manufacturer,
sponsor, or applicant.

In the case of a device regulated as a biologic under a BLA by CBER, additional information may be required under
the PHS Act.

7
Under section 301(x) of the FD&C Act, the falsification of a Declaration of Conformity submitted under section
514(c) of the FD&C Act is a prohibited act. Under section 501(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, a device is adulterated if,
among other conditions, it is declared to be in conformity with a recognized consensus standard unless the device is
in all respects in conformity with such standard.

It is important for industry and FDA staff to be aware that the use of consensus standards
generally satisfies only a portion of a premarket submission. A submitter’s use of consensus
standards may not on its own provide a sufficient basis for regulatory decisions. For example, a
specific device may raise safety and/or effectiveness questions not addressed by any FDArecognized consensus standard or a specific FDA regulation may require additional information
beyond what the FDA-recognized consensus standard provides. In other words, even when a
premarket submission appropriately demonstrates conformity with one or more consensus
standards, such conformity may not satisfy all requirements under the FD&C Act and its
implementing regulations for marketing or investigating the product in the United States. FDA
evaluates the totality of each submission to determine whether it contains all necessary
information and meets the requirements for marketing or investigating the product in the United
States.
FDA’s experience with premarket submissions indicates that submitters do not always use
consensus standards appropriately. For example, submitters may use a version of a consensus
standard that FDA does not recognize, or they may not realize that only certain aspects—not all—
of a particular consensus standard have been recognized by FDA. 8 In addition, submitters
sometimes attempt to use consensus standards that do not apply to the particular type of device or
testing performed. When submitters do not use consensus standards appropriately, it is often
necessary for FDA staff to request additional information to address the issue(s) the standard was
intended to address.
Appropriate use of consensus standards can be effective in demonstrating individual aspects of
safety, effectiveness, or substantial equivalence in the premarket process. When used
appropriately, consensus standards will typically reduce the amount of documentation that a
submitter needs to provide and may reduce FDA review time.
There are two appropriate uses of consensus standards in the premarket process: Declaration
of Conformity in accordance with section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and general use.
A DOC may refer only to standards for which FDA has assigned a recognition number. Such
standards are those that FDA has recognized by notice published in the Federal Register or that
FDA has decided to recognize but for which recognition is pending (because a periodic notice has
not yet appeared in the Federal Register). A submitter may consult FDA’s online database for
Recognized Consensus Standards to determine whether a DOC may refer to a particular standard.
The database will provide the most up-to-date list of suitable standards because, after FDA has
decided to recognize a standard, we will update our online database to reflect the decision even
before recognition of the standard. The database will include a recognition number and a
Supplemental Information Sheet (SIS) for each decision, including for cases for which
recognition is pending.

FDA recognizes specific versions of a consensus standard, and the recognized version may not always be the most
current or be for all clauses of a standard. Please refer to the consensus standard database Web site,
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm that contains supplementary information.

A DOC to a consensus standard may be used when a submitter certifies that its device conforms
to all of the requirements of a consensus standard that FDA has recognized or decided to
recognize. 9 In a DOC, the submitter may not deviate from the consensus standard that FDA has
recognized or decided to recognize. 10
General use of a consensus standard in premarket submissions refers to situations where a
submitter chooses to conform to a consensus standard, in part or in whole, but does not submit a
DOC. Also, a submitter may not submit a DOC if the submitter chose to rely on a consensus
standard that FDA has not recognized or decided to recognize, or the submitter has deviated from
an FDA-recognized consensus standard.

A.

Use of Declarations of Conformity

The purpose of declaring conformance with a consensus standard that FDA has recognized or
decided to recognize is to use such conformance to meet certain premarket requirements and
reduce the amount of supporting data and information that are submitted to FDA. Thus, under
section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, a submitter who chooses to rely on a consensus standard
in a DOC to meet a premarket submission requirement must at the time of the submission certify
that the device is in conformity with the consensus standard that FDA has recognized or decided
to recognize so that FDA may determine in its review whether the submission meets applicable
premarket requirements. FDA expects that all necessary testing required by the consensus
standard will be performed and conformance to the consensus standard will be met prior to
sending the premarket submission. To certify conformance with a consensus standard, the
submitter must submit a DOC (see section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act). These elements of a
DOC 11 are consistent with ISO/IEC 17050-1 Conformity assessment – Supplier’s declaration of
conformity – Part 1: General requirements and ISO 17050-2 Conformity assessment – Part 2:
Supporting documentation for the general requirements and supporting documentation needed
for the submission of a DOC to a consensus standard.
When submitters are interested in making a DOC to a consensus standard, and the device type is
not included within the scope of that standard and is not listed in the SIS, the submitter should
explain why that consensus standard is appropriate for the device in question. In most
circumstances, the scope of the standard defines what is to be tested, whether that is the device
itself, or an attribute of that device, e.g., the device’s material composition/properties or
packaging. FDA recommends that most testing be conducted on a final finished device.
“Finished device” under 21 CFR 820.3(l) means any device or accessory to any device that is
suitable for use or capable of functioning, whether or not it is packaged, labeled, or sterilized. In
contrast, a final finished device is a device that includes all manufacturing processes for the “to be
marketed” device, including packaging and sterilization, if applicable. If the tested device is not
the final finished device the submitter intends to market, the submitter should provide a
justification for any differences that may impact performance of the tested device compared to the
final finished device to be marketed. The DOC may be based on data or information provided by
See section 514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act.
See sections 301(x) and 501(e)(2) of the FD&C Act.

ISO/IEC Guide 22:1996 General criteria for supplier’s declaration of conformity was revised and replaced
by ISO/IEC 17050-1:2004. See https://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=27569.

the component manufacturer(s), but it is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure the accuracy
of the information. In these instances, FDA recommends that submitters consult with the
appropriate FDA staff prior to initiating testing. Information for requesting feedback may be
found in the guidance titled Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The PreSubmission Program and Meetings with FDA Staff. 12
A submitter may base a DOC on testing and analysis performed in-house or on testing performed
by a third party, such as a testing laboratory or certification body. If a submitter used a third
party, the submitter should provide the name and address of each testing laboratory or
certification body that was involved in determining the conformance of the device with the
applicable consensus standard(s) that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize and reference
any accreditations of those organizations.
Although accompanying test data is not required to be submitted with a DOC, FDA may request,
at any time, the data or information relied on by the submitter to make a DOC to a consensus
standard (see section 514(c)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act). However, these requests should only occur
in certain cases, as described below in sections IV.A(2) and (3) of this guidance. The submitter
must maintain all records that include data and information demonstrating conformity, whether
based upon third-party or in-house testing, to the consensus standard that FDA has recognized or
decided to recognize in accordance with the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR part 820). Such
records are part of the design history file for the device and are subject to inspection in
accordance with 21 CFR 820.180.
Falsifying a DOC to a consensus standard is a prohibited act under section 301(x) of the FD&C
Act. If a DOC to a consensus standard has been falsified, or if the device does not conform to the
standard as declared, purported, or represented, the device would be deemed adulterated under
section 501(e)(2) of the FD&C Act. Also, intentionally or unintentionally falsifying a DOC to
obtain device clearance or approval is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(2) of the FD&C Act.

Elements of a Declaration of Conformity

The elements that should be in a DOC are listed below. A submitter may choose to create a DOC
using the format as described in ISO/IEC 17050-1 Conformity Assessment – Supplier’s
declaration of conformity – Part 1: General requirements. The elements that should be included
are:
a. Name and address of the applicant/sponsor responsible for the DOC
b. Product/device identification, including product codes, device marketing name, model
number and any other unique product identification data specific to the DOC in
question
c. Statement of conformity
d. A list of standards for which the DOC applies including, for each standard, the options
selected, if any
e. The FDA recognition number for each standard

g. Signature, printed name, and function of the sponsor responsible for the DOC
h. Any limitation on the validity of the DOC (e.g., how long the declaration is valid, what
was tested, or concessions made about the testing outcomes)

Supplemental Documentation to Support a Declaration of
Conformity

Not all consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize are appropriate for
DOCs without the submission of supporting documentation that describes how the device
conforms to the consensus standard. It is important to restate that the use of consensus standards
may satisfy only a portion of a premarket submission and conformance to a standard on its own
may not provide a sufficient basis for a regulatory decision. Many consensus standards that FDA
has recognized or decided to recognize, while useful in the premarket process, are too general and
broad in scope for FDA to determine whether conformance to the applicable consensus standard
has been met or whether conformance to the consensus standard alone is sufficient to make a
regulatory decision, unless FDA also reviews the underlying data or supporting documentation.
Types of consensus standards where review of the underlying data may be necessary may include
standards that are horizontal, are process-oriented, or that include choices relating to test methods,
test selection, or have guidelines that apply to a broad range of device types and safety issues. An
example is ISO 14971 Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical devices.
These consensus standards typically do not list all of the detailed acceptance criteria for the
necessary performance tests. In cases where the consensus standard is not well-suited for a DOC
without the submission of supporting documentation, the FDA recommends that submitters
follow ISO/IEC 17050-2 Conformity assessment – Supplier’s declaration of conformity – Part 2:
Supporting documentation. In brief, if a premarket submission contains a DOC to such a
consensus standard, FDA recommends including a summary test report that includes test results.
Similarly, for consensus standards that describe test methods, a process, or consists of guidelines,
but do not provide specific acceptance criteria for all of the necessary performance tests, the
supporting documentation should be submitted, for example, ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2
Medical electrical equipment – Part 1-2: General requirements for basic safety and essential
performance – Collateral standard: Electromagnetic compatibility – Requirements and tests.
Many standards, called “parent” standards, have accompanying consensus standards (e.g., IEC
collateral 13 and particular 14 standards, or standards within a series such as ANSI/AAMI/ISO
80369 Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications series) that provide
acceptance criteria for the testing of specific types of devices (e.g., ANSI/AAMI/ISO 80369-3
Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications – Part 3: Connectors for
An IEC collateral standard is defined as a standard that addresses additional basic safety and essential
performance requirements that are common to a subgroup of medical electrical equipment; or a standard that
addresses additional basic safety and essential performance requirements that deal with characteristics of medical
electrical equipment or medical electrical systems that are not fully covered by the general standard. See
ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1:2005/(R) 2012 and A1 2012, C1:2009/(R) 2012 and A2:2010/(R) 2012 (Consolidated

enteral applications). These accompanying consensus standards, if recognized by FDA, may be
appropriately suited for DOCs without submission of underlying data.

FDA Review of Declarations of Conformity and
Supplemental Documentation

During review of a premarket submission in which a DOC has been submitted, FDA will review
the DOC and determine whether the following have been met:
a. The elements in this guidance, ISO/IEC 17050-1, or equivalent, of a Declaration of
Conformity are present.
b. The standard(s) identified in the DOC has (have) a recognition number. 15
c. There have been no deviations made to the normative part of the consensus standard(s)
identified.
d. The consensus standard(s) identified in the DOC is (are) applicable to the medical device
under review. 16
e. The supportive documentation, if determined to be necessary per ISO/IEC 17050-1, is
provided according to ISO/IEC 17050-2 or equivalent (see Table 1 below).
f. The data or information submitted to support such declaration demonstrates that the
device is in conformity with the normative section of the standard. 17
g. The DOC does not include a promissory statement (See Section VI). 18
If any of the elements above are not met, FDA will review any explanation provided by the
sponsor to determine if it is adequate to support the DOC or will request additional information to
meet the requirements.
As outlined above, there are circumstances when supplemental documentation is necessary to
support a DOC. The type of information a sponsor should submit and the FDA needs to review as
supplemental documentation will vary based on the specific consensus standard; however, the
following general principles should govern the need for and review of supplemental
documentation:
• When the consensus standard includes both a test method or test procedure with a single
set of predefined acceptance criteria, FDA should generally not request the data relating to
the specific consensus standard identified in the DOC.
• When the consensus standard describes a test method or procedure, but does not include
acceptance criteria, the submitter should provide an assessment of the results and how
conformity was determined.
• When the consensus standard includes choices related to, for example, what is to be tested,
which test methods to use, or acceptance criteria to assess conformity, the submitter
should include an explanation for the choices and selections made.

General Use of Consensus Standards

General use of a consensus standard in premarket submissions refers to situations where a
submitter chooses to conform to a consensus standard, in part or in whole, but does not submit a
DOC. Reasons for general use of a consensus standard vary, but may include: (1) the
manufacturer has chosen to use a recognized consensus standard without submitting a DOC; (2)
the manufacturer has made changes to the consensus standard methodology (i.e., deviations),
relative to what FDA has recognized or decided to recognize, to adapt its purpose to test the
device; or, (3) the manufacturer has chosen to use a consensus standard that does not have a
recognition number (e.g., because there is no consensus standard applicable to the device type that
FDA has recognized or decided to recognize). When a manufacturer is citing the general use of a
voluntary consensus standard as discussed above, we recommend that the basis of such use be
included along with the underlying information or data that supports how the standard was used.

Although Table 1 represents FDA’s general approach, consistent with section 514(c)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act, FDA
may request, at any time, the data or information relied on by a person to make a declaration of conformity with
respect to a recognized standard.

As FDA and industry recognize the need to improve device performance or address noted safety
issues, consensus standards may become obsolete or need updating to reflect current knowledge.
FDA recognizes that changes to existing standards may affect the lifecycle of device
development, and the Agency’s recognition of an updated version of an existing consensus
standard or the recognition of a different consensus standard altogether, without an approach to
manage this transition, may delay product development.
When a consensus standard has been replaced by a newly recognized standard, the older version
will be withdrawn following a transition period. The transition period is intended to decrease the
burden of implementing a shift from one version of a consensus standard to a newer version.
Such a transition period allows the submitter to continue using an earlier version of a consensus
standard while preparing to use a newer version of the same consensus standard that may have
significant changes. By providing transition periods, FDA enables the submitter to continue
current product development and testing potentially without having to conduct additional testing
due to a newer version of a consensus standard having been published and recognized. Due to the
differences between standards, a justification for use of the older version of the standard should
be provided when a newer version of the standard raises significant questions that were not
previously addressed.

A.

Where to Find Information on a Transition Period

The transition period will be found within the SIS and will provide the name of the outgoing
version of the consensus standard, the name of the newer version of the consensus standard, and
the date the transition period expires. The length of the transition period will be listed in the SIS
at the time of recognition of the newer consensus standard. An example of a transition period
statement that will be included in the SIS for both standards is:
“FDA recognition of [the outgoing version of the consensus standard] will be
superseded by recognition of [the newer version of the FDA-recognized consensus
standard]. FDA will accept Declarations of Conformity, in support of premarket
submissions, to [the outgoing version of the consensus standard] until [Month,
Date, and Year]. After this transition period, Declarations of Conformity to [the
outgoing version of the consensus standard] will not be accepted.”

B. When Standards Change Prior to Review of a Premarket
Submission
FDA understands that standards may be updated or revised, and the newer version recognized,
during product development. This may present challenges to submitters. FDA values and
encourages early interaction with submitters to ensure scientific issues are addressed prior to the
submission of a marketing application for a device, including a discussion of the changing
standard. The submitter is encouraged to engage the Agency regarding the strategy for addressing
10

the differences between the two versions of the standard and whether those differences
significantly affect the evaluation of safety and effectiveness. This is because it may not be
necessary to comply with all parts of the revised standard, only those parts that significantly affect
the evaluation of safety and effectiveness.

C. When Standards Change During Active Review of a
Premarket Submission
Generally, while a submission is undergoing active review, and in the interim before a consensus
standard is updated or revised and recognized, FDA will continue to review that submission based
on the previously FDA-recognized version. If the updated or revised consensus standard
addresses a new safety or effectiveness issue that is relevant to the final decision of that
submission, FDA may ask the submitter to either meet the portions of the new or updated
standard that address that safety or effectiveness issue, or provide alternative data or information
along with a scientific rationale for why the alternative addresses the issue.

D.

Transition Period Expiration

FDA will withdraw recognition of an outdated consensus standard in accordance with section
514(c)(2) of the FD&C Act at the end of a transition period. Submitters should check the FDA
Recognized Consensus Standards Database Web site often to ensure that their forthcoming
premarket submissions utilize the appropriate version of a consensus standard. If a submission is
submitted to FDA after the transition period has expired, as noted in the SIS, FDA expects that
testing will be completed using a standard with a current recognition number. Statements
declaring conformance to expired or earlier versions of the consensus standard will generally not
be accepted. It is expected that by the transition period expiration date, submitters will be able to
meet the performance specifications of the newer version of the consensus standard.

VI. Promissory Statements
For purposes of this guidance, a “promissory statement” is defined as a statement in which the
submitter indicates that the device is not yet known to be in conformance with a consensus
standard at the time of the premarket submission but will conform to the consensus standard prior
to marketing. FDA believes that in many cases the use of a promissory statement indicating
future conformance with a consensus standard is not appropriate to support a premarket
submission. This is because many standards include general methods with multiple options, and
in some cases, these standards do not include well-defined acceptance criteria or address
assessment of results. Typically, if submitters rely on a consensus standard to support a premarket
submission, FDA expects that conformance to the consensus standard will be met prior to
submission of the application to FDA. However, in some limited cases, a promissory statement
may be acceptable to support a regulatory decision. If it is determined that use of a promissory
statement is appropriate, it should include a statement that the device will not be marketed until
conformance has been confirmed.
Although a promissory statement describes a situation where a submitter states that they will
conform to a consensus standard that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize, submitters
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
may not use a DOC along with a promissory statement. Under section 514(c) of the FD&C Act,
submitters may only use a DOC to a consensus standard if conformance has been met prior to the
submission of the application to FDA. It is important to note that, in cases where FDA accepts
promissory statements, manufacturers must still comply with the obligations under the quality
system regulation in 21 CFR part 820, including design validation, 21 CFR 820.30(g), and
process validation, 21 CFR 820.75(b), by which a manufacturer must also establish and maintain
procedures for validating a device design and monitoring and control of process parameters for
validated processes to ensure that the specified requirements continue to be met.

VII. Limitations of Consensus Standards
A specific device may raise issues not addressed by consensus standards. For example,
submissions for some devices may rely on data from animal testing or clinical studies not
addressed in consensus standards that FDA has recognized or decided to recognize. In other
instances, additional performance specifications may be applicable to the device that is the subject
of the submission. Additional information to support approval or clearance of a device may also
be recommended in guidance documents. When a submission contains a submitter’s DOC with
one or more consensus standards, FDA reviews the premarket submission to ensure that the DOC
is appropriate and that the premarket submission contains all of the other necessary information
for FDA to evaluate the safety and effectiveness or, in the case of a 510(k), the substantial
equivalence of the device.
It is important to note that consensus standards with requirements and/or references to other
normative requirements do not have precedence over existing FDA laws and regulations.

VIII. When Devices or Standards Change After Marketing
Authorization
Just as standards may be revised before submission of an application to FDA, they may also be
revised after marketing authorization is granted. Changes in a recognized consensus standard do
not retroactively affect a product’s clearance or approval status. Furthermore, once a consensus
standard is recognized, recognition of its revisions will not be automatic. In general, FDA
actively assesses the impact of new consensus standards and revisions of existing standards on the
premarket review process and recognizes these standards, as appropriate. As FDA determines
that new or revised standards are appropriate for meeting requirements under the FD&C Act for
medical devices, we will update the standards database on FDA’s website. As explained above,
once we have decided to recognize a standard, we will issue a recognition number and provide
supplemental information in the database. To recognize such standards, we will periodically
publish a recognition list in the Federal Register. FDA usually performs this activity at least
twice annually. Superseded standards that FDA has withdrawn from the list of recognized
standards cannot subsequently be used in DOCs.
If a submitter received clearance or approval based in part on a DOC, but the standard is
withdrawn from recognition, the cleared or approved device remains legally marketed and it
remains eligible (for 510(k)s) as a predicate device. However, any new device citing such a
12

predicate in a 510(k) submission cannot similarly rely on a DOC to the withdrawn standard. In
these circumstances, FDA will likely recommend that the submission use the newer version of the
consensus standard, i.e., the version that has a current recognition number.
