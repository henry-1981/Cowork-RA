Applicability of Certain Requirements
of the Standard to Different Types

of Diagnostic X-Ray Systems

Applicability of Certification for Diagnostic X-Ray
Systems Not Used on Humans

REF :NONE

There are many situations where diagnostic x-ray equipment is installed and is
never used for exposure to living persons. Some examples are veterinary clin-
ies, technologist schools that use only "phantoms," pathology laboratories, and
certain industrial applications.

Components certified to comply with the Performance Standards for Diagnostic
X-Ray Equipment are installed in these situations.

The National Center for Devices and Radiological Health does not require certi-
fication by an assembler who installs certified components in situations where
they will not be used to expose humans for diagnostic or visualization purposes.
Nor is it required that "the type called for by the standard" be installed.

Manufacturers of components specifically designed for nonhuman use are subject
to initial and annual report requirements as specified in 21 CFR Subchapter J.

If the x-ray system contains certified components and is later installed for use

of exposure to humans, all of the certified components must be in compliance and
an assembler's report (Form FD 2579) must be filed.

Instructions for Mobile Mode Installation of CT Scanners

REF :BRH:DOC:MA 340

Since CT scanners used in a transportable mode (truck or trailer installation)
could be subjected to special or accentuated safety problems related to mechan-
ical shock, torsion, vibration, variable electrical supply, temperature and
humidity variations, ete., special instructions for installation or assembly of
CT scanners in a transportable mode might be appropriate or necessary. If such
special instructions are or will be provided with any of your models, a copy of
such instructions should be submitted to the National Center for Devices and
Radiological Health as a supplement to the initial report covering such CT scan-
ner model.

The Office of Health Practices Assessment, through the Assistant Secretary for
Health, makes recommendations to the Health Care Financing Administration regard-
ing reimbursement policy under Federally-funded programs such as Medicare. It

is reasonable to anticipate that any recommendation regarding reimbursement for
mobile CT scanning will reflect the requirements that such CT scanner models be
reported to the Center as being certified by the manufacturer to meet the FDA
performance standard under mobile use conditions and that the assembler's report

specify the assembly or installation of a CT scanner in a mobile mode or facil-
ity.

Supplements to initial reports in the manner indicated offer no guarantee that
the Office of Health Practices Assessment will recommend reimbursement, or that
the Health Care Financing Administration will adopt the recommendation. How-
ever, the report supplements should provide answers to some questions or con-

cerns raised in regard to the equipment safety aspects of the mobile use of CT
scanners.

MANUFACTURERS OF COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) X-RAY SYSTEMS

SUBJECT: "Date of Manufacture" and "Applicability of Requirements" for

CT X-Ray Systems

This letter states the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) position
regarding certain questions which arose after performance standards for
CT systems were published. This letter supersedes the March 25, 1985,
letter on the same subject.

1.

Some people have argued that 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(2), published in the
August 31, 1984, FEDERAL REGISTER, made most of the requirements in
1020.30 which were in effect for CT systems manufactured before
November 29, 1984, inapplicable to CT systems manufactured between
November 29, 1984, and September 3, 1985. This was not the FDA's
intent.

The August 31 publication promulgated requirements which were
incorporated into 1020.30 specifically for CT and exempted CT from

one requirement (i.e., the aluminum equivalence of the tabletops).
These became effective November 29, 1984. The FDA did not intend,
however, to make the applicable 1020.30 requirements in effect before
November 29 inapplicable to CT systems manufactured after that date.
The FDA intends to publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER technical
amendments which will clearly state that all of 1020.30 applies to all
CT systems manufactured after November 29, 1984. The FDA expects CT
manufacturers to fully comply with all 1020.30 requirements applicable
to CT systems. In addition, the dose information required by
1020.33(c)(2) and the information required by 1020.33(c)(1) as it
affects 1020.33(c)(2) must be provided to the purchaser. All of
section 1020.33 applies only to CT systems manufactured after
September 3, 1985.

. The amendments published in the August 31, 1984, FEDERAL REGISTER

specify requirements applicable to CT systems, not to individual
components. However, FDA still expects the major components specified
in 1020.30(a) and used in a CT system to be certified. In addition,
the CT gantry shall be certified and must display both certification
and identification labels. The specified components must be
compatible with the gantry. By issuing this letter, the FDA has now
defined the date of manufacture of the gantry as the date of
manufacture of the CT system. The CT system must meet all applicable
requirements as determined by the date of manufacture of the gantry.
The FDA intends to publish in the FEDERAL REGISTER technical
amendments which clearly require certification of the CT gantry and
state that the date of manufacture of the gantry is the date of
manufacture of the CT system.

. As used in paragraph 2, CT gantry means tube housing assemblies, beam-

limiting devices, detectors, and the supporting structures and frames

18a

Page 2

which hold these components. The proposed technical amendments will
include this definition.

4. Assemblers of CT systems shall use the form FDA 2579. However, for
item 4 e, beam-limiting device, the assembler shall provide the
manufacturer and model number of the CT gantry instead of the beam-
limiting device. The assembler shall also record the date of
manufacture of the CT gantry in the comments section.

December 5, 1983 Ref :MA:DRP:XPB:377
TO: MANUFACTURERS AND ASSEMBLERS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT
SUBJECT: Installation of Digital Image Processing Systems

We are writing this letter to the x-ray industry to state the agency's
position concerning installation of add-on digital image processing systems
and to identify the manufacturer's and assembler's responsibility for any
modification(s) performed on existing x-ray equipment during installation of
these systems.

Previous compliance policy guides state that digital image processors that
do not function as x-ray controls currently are not included in the list of
components to which the standard is applicable; therefore, no assembler
certification is required.

The regulations (21 CFR 1020.30(q)) permit the owner to modify his
equipment, provided the modification does not result in noncompliance with
the performance standard. The following discussion outlines the agency's
position regarding the requirements and responsibilities applicable to
add-on digital image processors which do not require certification by their
manufacturer.

The owner of a piece of x-ray equipment may modify or request any other
person to modify his x-ray equipment (See 21 CFR 1020.30(q)(2)). The
installation of a noncertifiable device, i.e., digital image processor, into
a diagnostic x-ray system constitutes modification of diagnostic x-ray
components and systems under 21 CFR 1020.30(q). The person performing these
modifications must insure that the finished modifications are compliant with
all applicable provisions of the diagnostic x-ray standard. Complete
details of any modification performed and results of the testing must be
documented by or provided to the owner who requested this modification.

This documentation should be included in the user's instructions. The
equipment would be subject to FDA inspection for compliance with the
standard including the required accuracy specifications (original equipment
manfacturers' and the owner-authorized changes, as appropriate).

When the owner or his employee performs these modifications, he must
document and retain the date and details of each modification in the service
record and/or the user's instructions. This documentation must include
appropriate testing to insure that the modified diagnostic x-ray system is
compliant with all applicable provisions of the diagnostic x-ray standard
(21 CFR 1020.30 - 32).

When the owner hires another person to perform these modifications, that
person must document the date and details of the modifications in the
service statement and, when available, the user's instructions. This
documentation must include appropriate testing to insure that the modified
diagnostic x-ray system is compliant with all applicable provisions of the
diagnostic x-ray standard (21 CFR 1020.30 - 32). This documentation must be
provided to the owner of the x-ray system.

18b

M/A Letter 377 Page 2

If the installation of a digital image processor involves a series of
modifications by different persons, each person must document the
modification he performs as described in the preceding paragraphs. The
person who completes the last modification to a certified diagnostic x-ray
system will be held liable for compliance with all applicable requirements
of the diagnostic x-ray standard (21 CFR 1020.30 - 32).

Although most add-on digital image processors do not currently require
certification, we believe that a responsible manufacturer should develop
compatible interfacing packages along with the device. We do have
regulatory alternatives to address those digital image processors or x-ray
system modifications that represent an unreasonable risk to patient and/or
operator.

This letter formally details the procedures for assuring that every phase of
the installation is traceable to the responsible individual—the person who
actually performs the modification.

Manufacturers and/or assemblers must advise purchasers of add-on digital
image processors in writing either prior to or at the time of sale that
they, as the owners, will be required to have any necessary modifications
performed to their x-ray equipment. Purchasers must be warned that these
modifications may void the manufacturer's warranty for the x-ray control.
Purchasers must also be advised of their responsibilities, under the
Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, to record the date
and details of the modification and evidence that the modification does
not result in a failure to comply with the diagnostic x-ray standard

(21 CFR 1020.30 - 32).

Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements
for

Assemblers and Manufacturers

Accidental Radiation Occurrences and Foreign Manufacturers

QUESTION: Referencing paragraph 1002.20, Accidental Radiation Occurrences.
Does this requirement apply to foreign manufacturers?

ANSWER: Yes, if a foreign manufacturer or his designated American-based agent

is subject to reporting requirements, then all the requirements are applicable.
Our interest is in the manufacturing defect of any product that enters into the
commerce of the United States, whether it is produced by a foreign or domestic

manufacturer.

Updating of Initial Reports

Revised Language Ref: BRH:DOC:MA 3736

Since August 1, 1974, some manufacturers have chosen to update initial reports
through the annual report. The National Center for Devices and Radiological
Health strongly recommends that each manufacturer update initial reports through
(1) the submission of a new initial report, or (2) supplements to the affected
initial report.

For proper administration and enforcement of the Performance Standards for
Diagnostic X-ray Equipment, it is necessary that the FDA regional organization
be informed as to the certification status of all affected components of diag-
nostic x-ray systems. The source of this information is the initial report(s)
submitted to NCDRH by each manufacturer. When these initial reports are updated
by methods other than (1) or (2), above, the probability is increased that the
pertinent information concerning certified components may not be disseminated to
regional personnel.

19

Reporting Changes to Specifications

Ref: BRH:DOC:MA 4101

If manufacturers modify the design of certified x-ray equipment in a manner that
affects or potentially affects performance regarding applicable Federal perfor-

mance standards, they must supplement their initial reports of quality control
and testing which describe the modifications and/or any testing program changes
associated with such equipment. Since components are certified by the manufac-
turer to meet the requirements of the performance standard (with the manufactur-—
ing practices in effect at the time of manufacture), the Center considers any
changes to the manufacturing practice of certified equipment to apply only to
equipment manufactured after the effective date of the change.

The Performance Standards for Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment require that certain
information concerning certified equipment be provided to the users. Since the
user information must reflect the specifications at the time of manufacture, any
changes in specifications subject to the standard may not be made arbitrarily.

In the past, manufacturers have made changes to technique factors accuracy, gen-
erator ratings, tube housing ratings, and BLD specifications. Sometimes these
changes are made more than one time on the same model component. Therefore, the
Center must keep several sets of specifications on each component. At present,
the Center can only identify the date of notification for the changes.

This is to emphasize that when any changes are made to the manufacturing prac-
tice that will affect any of the performance standard requirements by changing
component specifications, the manufacturer must indicate the following:

(a) The effective date the change will take place.

(b) The commencing serial number and date of manufacture of the certified
component the new specifications will affect.

(ec) The old values and new values of the parameters affected by the
changes.

(d) The justification as to why these changes should apply to previously
manufactured equipment, if such is desired.

The above information is requested for all manufacturing changes that have been

employed to date on each certified component and which affect any specifications
related to certification according to the standard.

20

Foreign Manufacturers Required to Maintain Records

QUESTION: Paragraphs 1002.30(a)(1) and (2) call for maintaining records of
(1) quality control procedures, and (2) test results. How does this apply to
foreign manufacturers and what does NCDRH expect? That is, are records to be
maintained at the foreign factory?

ANSWER: Since foreign manufacturers have quality control and testing programs,
they will be responsible for generating records. As long as NCDRH knows where
the records are kept it would not matter where they are stored. These records
must be kept for five years. All records must be on call.

Annual Report Submission

QUESTION: Is the importer or the manufacturer of x-ray units responsible for
submitting annual reports?

ANSWER: As defined in Section 355(3) (42 U.S.C. 263c(3)) of the Radiation
Control for Health and Safety Act and 21 CFR 1000.3(f), the importer is legally

considered to be the manufacturer of all x-ray equipment imported from foreign
manufacturers.

As a result, the importer is responsible for the submission of all information
and reports pursuant to 21 CFR Part 1002, including the annual report required
by Section 1002.11. The manufacturer may submit the required information on
behalf of the importer. It cannot be overemphasized, however, that the importer

is held responsible for defects in the products and all other manufacturer obli-
gations as specified in the Act and regulations.

21

Annual Reports and Field X-Ray Tube Reloading

QUESTION: When tube assembly reloading is done in the field, in manufacturer X's
district office shop by an employee of manufacturer X, is the employee or the
district manager now a manufacturer? Does he file an annual report? Assembly

instructions and procedures would be equivalent to those used at headquarters
factory site.

ANSWER: The replacement of an x-ray tube in a used "previously certified" tube
housing constitutes manufacture of a new tube housing assembly. The manufacture
and field reloading operations of previously certified tube housings should be
included in the parent company's annual report. Neither the employee nor dis-

trict manager has to file any records with the Center because it is the res-
ponsibility of the parent manufacturer to do so.

22

May 12, 1983 Ref :ORH:DOC:XPB:372
TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND ASSEMBLERS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT: Simplification of FD 2579, "Report of Assembly of a Diagnostic X-ray
System"

This letter is intended to explain why the Office of Radiological Health
(ORH) no longer requires assemblers to record on the FD 2579 the model and
serial numbers of installed components other than beam limiting devices and
tables.

Several inquiries have been received by ORH from x-ray equipment assemblers
who questioned the absence of space on the FD 2579 to record model and
serial numbers of controls, generators, vertical cassette holders, etc.
These questions are best answered by consideration of the purpose of the

FD 2579, which is to serve as the assembler's certification that he
installed the components according to manufacturer's instructions. The

FD 2579 is not intended to serve as a tracking system for x-ray components.
A dealer or distributor who is also an assembler must fulfill the
recordkeeping requirements of 21 CFR 1002.40 and 1002.41 by maintaining,
separately or in combination with the FD 2579, a record of model and serial
numbers of the components he installs. Space for recording date of
manufacture is not provided because the FD 2579 is used to record the
assembly of certified components only.

Some assemblers have expressed their concern that they may be held
accountable for certified components which could be noncompliant or
defective due to faulty manufacture or installation and which they did not
install. Considering that the FD 2579 is required when a component is
replaced, ORH does not recognize a valid need for including component serial
numbers on the FD 2579. When a noncompliant component is found in an x-ray
system, a review of the FD Forms 2579 maintained by the user will identify
the assembler who performed the most recent installation of the component in
question.

The assembler's record of model and serial numbers of specific components he

has installed will then serve to determine the assembler's responsibility
relative to the installation of the noncompliant component.

TO: MANUFACTURERS, ASSEMBLERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY
SYSTEMS

SUBJECT: Instructions for Completing Form FDA 2579, "Report of Assembly of a
Diagnostic X-Ray System"

Since the introduction of the new format of the Report of Assembly of a
Diagnostic X-Ray System (FDA 2579), we have received several questions
concerning the proper way to complete this report. Although we designed the
new form to simplify the report, we need to clarify certain items.

The Report of Assembly (FDA 2579) is the assembler's certification for the
installation of one or more certified components. The various sheets of the
form must be distributed to the FDA (white sheet), the responsible State
radiation control agency (yellow sheet), and the purchaser (pink sheet)
within 15 days following the completion of the assembly. The assembly is
considered completed when the unit is ready for use on patients. The
assembler must retain his copy (buff sheet) for five years.

Information Required: (See Enclosure)

(A) Enter equipment location; hospital or office address where installed
and telephone number.

(B) Enter assembler information; company name, address, and telephone
number.

(C) 1) Enter a check in the first box of 3a, if a complete fully
certified x-ray system is installed. A complete x-ray system
must contain at least an x-ray control, a tube housing assembly,
a beam-limiting device, and an x-ray generator and may contain
other components.

2) Enter a check in the second box of 3a, if one or more certified
components are installed to replace existing components in a
system.

3) Enter a check in the third box of 3a if one or more certified
components are added to an existing system, as opposed to
replacing existing components.

NOTE: You may enter a check in both the second and third boxes if that
best describes the installation.

(D) Enter a check in the appropriate box(es) for the system's intended
use(s), and whether the system is stationary or mobile. (You may
indicate more than one intended use if this is appropriate.) Also,
provide the room location of the master x-ray control, and the
completion date of the assembly (i.e., when the unit is ready for

_use on patients).

22b

Page 2 - M/A Letter 374

({E) Check the appropriate box regarding the master x-ray control:

A new installation when a new (unused) control is being installed.

Existing (Certified) when the master control is certified and not
being installed or upon reinstallation of a used certified master
control (such as relocation of the system).

Existing (Non-certified) when the master control is not certified
and not being installed or reinstallation of a used uncertified
master control is occurring (such as relocation of the system).

(F) Enter in 4e the manufacturer and model number for each certified
beam-limiting device and x-ray table you install.

(G) Enter in 4f the quantity (number) of other certified components
being installed. Place a number in each appropriate box, not a
check mark or X. For the box labeled "other", the component must be
certified and one not listed in 4e or 4f. Describe this component
in the comments section at the bottom of the form.

(H) Section 5 must be completed by the individual who installs and
calibrates the equipment. He must enter his printed name, his
signature, and the date of his signature.

The new form relaxes some of the reporting requirements for models and
serial numbers of components. It does not, however, change any of the
recordkeeping requirements of the regulations (21 CFR 1002.30 and 1002.40)
which require manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to maintain records
in a form which will enable traceability of model number and serial or other
identification number of their products.

Although the form was designed as a self-mailer, the paper stock is thinner
than expected and a number of forms have been damaged by mail handling
equipment. We recommend that you place the forms in an envelope for mailing
since this will help assure proper receipt and handling of the form,

FORM FDA 2579 (8/82)

Whie Cr ye FC& HEX490 , 5600 Fishers Lone, Rockvitie, MD 20857

April 3, 1984 Ref :0C :DRP: XPB:MA: 381
TO: ALL ASSEMBLERS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY SYSTEMS

SUBJECT: Reporting Assembly of Digital Radiography and C-Arm Fluoroscopy
Systems

The current version of the "Report of Assembly of a Diagnostic X-ray
System", form FDA 2579, does not enable the Center to identify and locate
installations of digital radiographic or C-Arm fluoroscopic equipment. To
assist the Center in identifying such installations which do not conform
with the more conventional equipment designs, assemblers of diagnostic x-ray
equipment are requested to adhere to the following reporting procedures:

(1) When reporting the assembly of a system which utilizes a digital
imaging system, assemblers should check as an intended use of the
system (block 3b) "Any Other" and specify in the "Comments" section
(block 6) the wording "Digital Imaging System."

(2) When reporting the assembly of a C-Arm fluoroscopy system, assemblers
should check as a intended use of the system (block 3b) "Any Other"
and specify in the "Comments" section (block 6) the wording "C-Arm
System."

220

Assembly, Reassembly, and Maintenance

Assembler or Installer

QUESTION: Form FD 2579 will be used to report assembly of diagnostic x-ray
systems. In a case where the purchaser also installs a device in his system,
does he then become the "assembler" or the "installer," as defined in the
regulations?

ANSWER: He is the installer who, by law, now becomes the assembler.

Donating Used Equipment
QUESTION: What will be the status of used equipment that has been donated?

ANSWER: Donated equipment is covered by the regulations in the same way as
purchased equipment.

Multiple Tubes and One Generator

QUESTION: A hospital has three connecting rooms. Room 1 has an x-ray unit, room

3 has an x-ray unit, and room 2 has a generator common to rooms 1 and 3. There
is a certified component in the system in room 1. If a new component is in-

stalled in the system in room 3, must that component also be certified? The gen-
erator is the common link between systems.

ANSWER: The three rooms of equipment would be considered a single x-ray system,
since they are interconnected. All replacements must be made with certified
components, no matter which room is involved.

Only an identical exchange would allow the replacement of a used uncertified
component (21 CFR 1020.30(p)(5)(ii)).

23

Commercially Available

QUESTION: What is “commercially available" and how does an assembler determine
this?

ANSWER: A component is "commercially available" if it can be supplied by any
manufacturer within a reasonable time period. An assembler, in attempting to
determine commercial availability of a component, should, as a minimum, take the
following steps to find a compatible component:

(1) Consult the information supplied by the manufacturer of the certified
component being installed to see if the manufacturer has made a deter-
mination of compatibility regarding the component or an alternate model
for the system in question; if unsuccessful,

(2) consult the manufacturer(s) of the component(s) of the system not
meeting the specification for compatibility to determine if alternate
components exist which would be compatible and perform the intended
functions; if unsuccessful,

(3) consult the FDA Regional/District Offices for assistance in obtaining
a compatible component.

Practitioner's Responsibility

QUESTION: What is the practitioner's responsibility for keeping certified equip-
ment in compliance with the standard?

ANSWER: It is up to the practitioner to have his x-ray equipment maintained
according to the schedule furnished by the manufacturer to ensure compliance
with the standard for the life of the equipment. Failure to follow the manu-
facturer's maintenance instructions could relieve the manufacturer of respons-
ibility for continued compliance. In addition, the practitioner may be required
to comply with State x-ray equipment regulations, which in turn would have to be
compatible with the Federal performance standard.

24

Illegal Installations

QUESTION: User has been provided, in compliance with 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3), state-
ment of maximum line current and range of line voltage regulation, prior to pur-
chase. In addition, he has been provided with suggested conductor sizes for the
estimated conductor lengths.

Upon installation check-out, it is not possible to meet linearity and reproduc-

ibility specifications because line regulation is excessive. How shall this
installation be reported on FD 2579?

ANSWER: The installation as described is illegal. An assembler may not install
a unit on a line that does not meet the manufacturer's specifications.

However, it is acceptable to derate a unit so that the line is adequate for it.
This involves the cooperation of the assembler and the manufacturer to determine
how much to derate the unit. It also requires notification to the National
Center for Devices and Radiological Health and insertion in the user's manual.
Copies of pertinent test data should also be sent to the National Center for
Devices and Radiological Health. When the unit is derated, the inactivated
technique factors must be made physically inoperative and so indicated on the
control panel.

SPECIFIC CLARIFICATION
OF
SECTIONS 21 CFR 1020.30 - 21 CFR 1020.32
OF
THE RADIATION CONTROL REGULATIONS
FOR DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT

Sections 1020.30(a) - 1020.30(n)

SECTION 1020.30(a) - APPLICABILITY

Replacement of Electronic Timers

QUESTION: We would like information regarding the applicability of the Perfor-

mance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment regarding replacement of elec-
tronic timers.

ANSWER: If a manufacturer wishes to enter a product into commerce that is not
expressly listed in paragraph 1020.30(a)(1), but which functionally performs in
a manner consistent with the definitions of one or more of the listed products
(1020.30(b)), then he must certify that product. A timer designed to control
X-ray exposure, although not expressly listed, performs in a manner consistent
with the definition of an x-ray control and, as such, must be certified in
accordance with paragraph 1020.30(c). This assumes, of course, that the timer
is separately manufactured and marketed in its own housing.

Manufacture of Cones

QUESTION: A customer has purchased and installed a new system of certified
components, including a skull unit and a manual collimator. He determines that
he prefers a "double diaphragm" cone such as his technicians had become accus-
tomed to on previous skull units. The manufacturer, however, has discontinued
the cone because he could not certify its compliance with the standard. Can
anyone, such as the owner, the installer, or a local machine shop, legally
fabricate such a cone?

ANSWER: Anyone may manufacture (fabricate) a BLD such as you describe, but it
must be certified and the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health

must have an initial report covering the quality control and testing procedures
used in manufacture.

SECTION 1020.30(b) - DEFINITIONS

Second SID for Chest and Spinal X-Ray Systems

Ref :ORH:DOC: XPB: 368

FDA Compliance Policy Guide 7133.11, with an effective date of October 1, 1980,
permits chiropractic radiography to be performed on non-PBL x-ray systems at a
fixed SID. This policy does not restrict the size(s) of cassette(s) that can be
used at the fixed SID.

The Office of Radiological Health has been informed that a radiographic study in
common use in chiropractic practice requires the provision of two different
SIDs. It is not the intent of the diagnostic x-ray equipment performance stan-
dard to unduly restrict the practice of chiropractic radiography, or to force
practitioners to purchase expensive PBL collimation equipment. It is reasonable
to permit the provision of a second SID, especially if the use of the second SID
is limited by design to a situation in which PBL collimation is not required to
function, if provided.

To this end, paragraph B.4 of the enclosed CPG is being revised by insertion of
a new second sentence, as follows: "Such a system may be provided with a second
SID if operation at the second SID is restricted by design to image receptors
greater than 20 inches in length in the non-tilting vertically-mounted wall
bucky stand or cassette holders." This change has no effect on the use of
hang-on, non-bucky cassette holders, which is a permitted practice in non-PBL

mode whether PBL is provided or not.

Since PBL is not required to function in the case where the image receptor is
more than 20 inches in length, and since PBL is not required in a fixed-SID
system having no x-ray table, two SID positions may be provided. The SID
switches must be interlocked with the wall bucky stand or cassette holder so
that exposure to the inserted film cassette at the longer SID is permitted only

if the cassette length is greater than 20 inches. At the shorter SID, there is
no restriction as to cassette size.

TO: MANUFACTURERS AND ASSEMBLERS OF DIAGNOSTIC X-RAY EQUIPMENT

SUBJECT: Definitions of "General Purpose X-ray System" and "Other Than
General Purpose X-ray System"

Questions continue to arise concerning the definitions of "general purpose”
and "other than general purpose" as they appear in 21 CFR 1020.31(d), (e),
and (f) of the performance standard and the applicability of these sections
to an installed x-ray system.

We are writing this letter to the x-ray industry to revise and restate FDA's
definitions of "general purpose" and "other than general purpose" for the
purposes of 21 CFR 1020.31. Copies of this letter will be sent to ali FDA
District Offices and FDA field x-ray inspectors. This letter incorporates
the original definitions, issued in 1979, and appearing on page 10 of the
Assembler's Guide; the contents of our November 24, 1982, letter in which we
permitted the limited use of a second SID; and our recent change permitting
the limited use of tilting cassette holders.

Definitions: "General Purpose"
"Other Than General Purpose"

A. An x-ray system, designed for and limited by its design for diagnostic
purposes to only one of the following body regions, is classified as
"other than general purpose" for the purposes of 21 CFR 1020.31.

extremities

head or head and neck
thoracic

abdominal

FwWwh-
t

B. An x-ray system, designed for and limited by its design for diagnostic
purposes to only one of the following specialized applications, is
classified as ‘other than general purpose" for the purposes of 21 CFR
1020.31.

1 - System designed for cystographic, urologic, or other specialized
exams of the kidney, bladder, and/or urinary tract.

2 - Dental x-ray system designed for use with intraoral and/or
extraoral image receptors.

3 - Cephalometric x-ray system or dental x-ray system designed for use
with extraoral image receptors whenever special cephalometric
devices are attached.

4 - An x-ray system designed specifically for chest or spinal
radiography when installed:

a. With a single fixed source-to-image-receptor distance (SID)
along the horizontal axis

We)
'

or

b. with two SIDs along the horizontal axis when exposure at
one of the two SIDs is restricted to image receptors
with a dimension greater than 50 centimeters (20
inches).

Either a or b may be installed with a permanently-mounted vertical
cassette holder or Bucky (tilting or non-tilting) but not with a
permanent x-ray table. If installed with a tilting vertical
cassette holder or Bucky, exposure shall not be possible when the
x-ray beam axis is within +3 degrees of the vertical and the image
receptor plane is within +3 degrees of perpendicular to the x-ray
beam axis. Mobile or hang-on cassette holders or mobile tables may
be used without restriction in such systems.

Mammographic x-ray system.

Therapy simulation x-ray system.

System designed for and installed in operating rooms.
Pantomographic x-ray system.

Tomographic x-ray system (when used in the tomographic mode of
operation).

C. Any x-ray system, which by its design is not limited to radiographic
examination of a specific anatomical region and does not meet the
requirements of paragraphs A or B preceding is considered to be "general
purpose" for the purposes of 21 CFR 1020.31.

Radiography/Fluoroscopy Image Processing Systems
Including Digital Systems

REVISED LANGUAGE Ref :BRH:DOC:MA 363

There are two general types of radiography (and/or fluoroscopy) image processing
systems available. The first type incorporates a component that is used only to
electronically process and store the electronic signal from a detector that
transforms x-ray photons into electronic signals. The second type incorporates
similar processing and signal storage, and has the additional capability of
affecting or controlling one or more of the x-ray exposure technique factors;
i.e., tube potential, tube current, and/or exposure time. It may be capable of
exposure initiation and/or termination, independent of the usual exposure
control function.

The first type of image processing system is related to an x-ray system in much
the same way as a film processor is related to a conventional diagnostic x-ray
system. It is used with a diagnostic x-ray system, but does not affect the
compliance of the x-ray system with the Performance Standards for Diagnostic
X-ray Equipment. Therefore, this image processing system is not subject to the
provisions of the standard.

The second type of image processing system meets the regulatory definition of an
x-ray control because it directly affects or controls at least one of the tech-
nique factors. X-ray controls require certification and must be reported to the
National Center for Devices and Radiological Health (NCDRH) as required by

21 CFR 1002.10. The manufacturer of this type of image processing system must
submit an initial report to NCDRH that describes the quality control and testing
program under which the product is manufactured. This initial report must be
submitted before the system can be introduced into commerce and must follow the
reporting guide specified by NCDRH.

Initial reports should be directed to the Director, Office of Compliance

(HFK-100), National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Food and Drug
Administration, 56C0 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.

Both types of radiography (and/or fluoroscopy) image processing systems are
subject to the premarket notification requirements of the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act. Ninety (90) days prior to introduction of a new medical device
into commerce, the manufacturer must file a 510(k) notification with the Food
and Drug Administration. Information submitted in either the initial report or
the premarket notification may be incorporated in one, in detail, and in the
other by reference, without the need of duplication.
