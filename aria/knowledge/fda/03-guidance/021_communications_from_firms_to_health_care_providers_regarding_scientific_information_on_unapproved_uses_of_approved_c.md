Communications From Firms to Health Care Providers Regarding
Scientific Information on Unapproved Uses of
Approved/Cleared Medical Products
Questions and Answers
Guidance for Industry 1
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance describes FDA’s enforcement policy regarding certain firm-initiated
communications of scientific information on unapproved use(s) of the firm’s approved/cleared
medical products to health care providers (HCPs) engaged in prescribing or administering
medical products to individual patients. 2 Under the FDA Authorities, 3 a firm’s communication
about unapproved uses of its approved/cleared medical product could be evidence of the firm’s
intended use for such product, and, depending on the facts and circumstances, may be relevant to
establishing that the firm has distributed a medical product that fails to comply with applicable
premarket requirements or is otherwise misbranded or adulterated. At the same time, in certain
circumstances, HCPs may be interested in scientific information about unapproved uses of
approved/cleared medical products to inform clinical practice decisions for the care and
management of their individual patients.
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide reassurance to firms that, if they choose to provide
communications consistent with the recommendations of this guidance, FDA does not intend to
use the firm’s dissemination of such communication standing alone as evidence of a new
intended use. Additionally, FDA does not expect a firm to submit such a communication to the
Agency at the time the communication is initially shared with HCPs. For the purposes of this
This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion in the Office of Medical Policy in
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research in cooperation with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,
the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for Veterinary Medicine, and the Office of the
Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration.

guidance, we refer to this enforcement policy as “the enforcement policy outlined in this
guidance,” which we explain in greater detail in section IV. We acknowledge that firms
communicate in other ways and with other audiences, and this guidance neither speaks to nor
intends to convey any views on communications that are not within the scope of the enforcement
policy outlined in this guidance. The fact that a communication by a firm does not share all the
characteristics of communications that are within the scope of this enforcement policy does not
alone mean that FDA intends to rely on it to establish a new intended use.
A key tenet underlying this enforcement approach is that, to promote the public health, any
individual firm-initiated communication of scientific information about unapproved use(s) of that
firm’s approved/cleared medical product(s) should be truthful and non-misleading and should
provide and appropriately present all information necessary for HCPs to understand and evaluate
the strengths and weaknesses, validity, and clinical utility of the scientific information on
unapproved use(s) in that specific communication. Accordingly, this guidance provides
recommendations consistent with those principles.
This guidance also describes the characteristics of the specific source publications contained in
firm-initiated communications that fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
Specifically, this guidance provides recommendations for firms initiating the sharing with HCPs
of:
•

Source publications that are:
- Published scientific or medical journal articles (reprints)
- Published clinical reference resources, as follows:
o Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)
o Scientific or medical reference texts (reference texts)
o Materials from digital clinical practice resources

•

Firm-generated presentations of scientific information on unapproved use(s) provided
with a source publication

For the purposes of this guidance, these specific types of firm-initiated communications to HCPs,
in combination with the disclosures recommended in this guidance, are referred to as scientific
information on unapproved use(s) of approved/cleared medical product communications
(hereafter referred to as SIUU communications). 4
This guidance does not apply to a firm’s communications about:

We acknowledge that firms share SIUU communications through different media (e.g., paper, digital). The
recommendations in this guidance apply regardless of the medium of the communication.

•

A use that is an “unapproved use of an approved product” for the purposes of section 564
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and that is an authorized
emergency use under that section (see sections 564(a)(2)(B) and (a)(4)(E) of the FD&C
Act) 5

•

A prohibited extra-label use of a drug in animals

This guidance includes examples to illustrate some of the recommendations and general
considerations for SIUU communications. The examples in this guidance do not describe every
aspect of the SIUU communications.
In developing this guidance, FDA considered feedback from interested parties, including
comments received on the revised draft guidance of the same title (2023 revised draft guidance).
This guidance finalizes the 2023 revised draft guidance.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.
II.

GLOSSARY

The following terms are defined for the purposes of this guidance:
Approved/cleared medical product 6 refers only to certain medical products that may be
introduced into interstate commerce for at least one use under the FDA Authorities (as that term
is defined in this guidance) as a result of having satisfied applicable premarket requirements, as
follows:
•

With respect to a device, the term refers only to a device that is the subject of an
approved premarket application (PMA) in effect under section 515 of the FD&C Act, a
substantial equivalence determination (510(k) clearance) for a premarket notification
under section 510(k), or a De Novo marketing authorization granted under section

In addition, this guidance does not apply to any communications about a medical product that is an unapproved
product as that term is used in section 564 of the FD&C Act, including communications about a use that is an
authorized emergency use under that section. (See sections 564(a)(2)(A) and (a)(4)(D) of the FD&C Act.)

5

This term is chosen for ease of reference within this guidance and its use in this guidance is not intended to
indicate that every medical product covered by this term is referred to as approved or cleared under the language of
the FDA Authorities. For example, nonprescription drugs that satisfy requirements for marketing under section
505G of the FD&C Act are not approved under section 505. The use of the term approved/cleared medical product
also does not convey that the introduction of the medical product into interstate commerce for an unapproved use
would be legal.

513(f)(2); to a device that is licensed under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act
(PHS Act); or to a device that is exempt from premarket notification.
•

With respect to a human drug, the term refers only to a drug with respect to which an
approval of an application under section 505 of the FD&C Act is in effect or a biologics
license under section 351 of the PHS Act is in effect or to a drug that is marketed in
compliance with section 505G of the FD&C Act.

•

With respect to an animal drug, the term refers only to a drug that is the subject of an
approved application in effect under section 512 of the FD&C Act; it does not include a
conditionally approved or indexed animal drug.

Approved use 7 refers to a use that is lawfully included as an indication or use in the FDArequired labeling of an approved/cleared medical product (as that term is defined in this
guidance) as a result of having satisfied applicable premarket requirements.
Clinical practice guideline (CPG) refers to a statement or document from a professional or
academic organization that includes recommendations focused on a specific disease or condition
intended to help health care providers make decisions for individual patient care, including
decisions in circumstances where there are few or no approved/cleared medical products
indicated for the patient’s condition or the approved/cleared medical products have not proven
successful for the individual patient.
Digital clinical practice resource refers to a digital resource that contains medical and scientific
information on a wide range of topics. The information is typically searchable by topic or
keyword and produces materials in response to the HCP’s search terms. 8
FDA Authorities refers, collectively, to the FD&C Act, the PHS Act, and their implementing
regulations. 9
This term is chosen for ease of reference within this guidance. We note that for certain categories of medical
products, the FDA Authorities use terms other than approved to describe satisfaction of applicable premarket
requirements.
7

Examples of digital clinical practice resources include Medscape and UptoDate. FDA does not endorse any
particular digital clinical practice resource.

under section 505 of the FD&C Act, the FDA-approved Drug Facts labeling that meets
the requirements of 21 CFR 201.66

•

For a nonprescription drug that is not the subject of an approved drug application under
section 505 of the FD&C Act but instead is marketed under section 505G of the FD&C
Act, the labeling that must be provided in order for that drug to comply with section
505G

•

For an animal drug, the FDA-approved information for prescription and nonprescription
drugs that meets the requirements of 21 CFR 514.1(b)(3)

•

III.

BACKGROUND

The evolution of medical product regulation in the United States has been shaped by experience
with the real and substantial risks to the public from uses of medical products not shown to be
both safe and effective. Congress developed the premarket review frameworks for medical
products in response to public health tragedies, realizing that (1) safety and effectiveness for
each intended use needs to be appropriately studied, and the resulting information needs to be
submitted by firms to FDA and independently evaluated by FDA before a medical product is
introduced into interstate commerce for that use because the evidence that demonstrates
effectiveness and safety for one use of a product provides no guarantee of the effectiveness or
safety of additional uses; and (2) exclusive reliance on postmarket remedies (e.g., enforcement
actions for false or misleading labeling) is unacceptable as a public health strategy because it
does not prevent consumers from experiencing harm from unsafe and/or ineffective treatments. 13
Accordingly, longstanding FDA Authorities prohibit, among other things, the introduction (or
causing the introduction) into interstate commerce of a medical product that fails to comply with
applicable premarket requirements or is otherwise misbranded or adulterated. 14 This prohibition
includes the introduction (or causing the introduction) into interstate commerce of a medical
product that is intended for a use that has not been approved (an unapproved use), even if that
same medical product is approved by FDA for a different use. 15,16
The intended use of a medical product can be established from, among other things, its label,
labeling, promotional claims, advertising, and any other relevant source. 17 For example, claims
or statements made by or on behalf of a firm that explicitly or implicitly promote a medical
product for a particular use may be taken into account. 18 Accordingly, a firm’s communications
See FDA Memorandum: Public Health Interests and First Amendment Considerations Related to Manufacturer
Communications Regarding Unapproved Uses of Approved or Cleared Medical Products (January 2017
Memorandum) at 1 and 4 (available at https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2016-N-1149-0040).

See 2025 Addendum at 2–9; see generally 2025 Premarket Review and Related Authorities Summary.

The concept of intended use is fundamental to the regulatory approach for medical products embodied in the FDA
Authorities. Intended use is an element in the definitions of drug and device, helping to define the scope of FDA’s
authority over medical products and subjecting the medical products to the drug or device provisions of the FDA
Authorities, as applicable. In addition, intended use may affect the appropriate premarket review pathway for a
medical product and is a separate element in establishing certain violations under the FDA Authorities. (See,
generally, Proposed Rule (NPRM): Regulations Regarding “Intended Uses” (2020 Intended Use NPRM) (85 FR
59718 at 59724, September 23, 2020); Final Rule: Regulations Regarding “Intended Uses” (2021 Intended Use
Final Rule) (86 FR 41383 at 41385, August 2, 2021)).

may be relevant to establishing whether its medical product is subject to the FDA Authorities
and whether particular statutory or regulatory provisions apply to the medical product.
The premarket requirements of the FDA Authorities advance substantial government interests
that include increasing the availability of medical products that have been shown to be safe and
effective for a particular use and preventing direct and indirect harm from uses of medical
products that have not been shown to be safe and effective. Direct harms to health can include
patients experiencing significant adverse side effects in the absence of significant countervailing
benefits. Indirect harms to health can include the use of medical products that are ineffective in
patients and result in the lost opportunity to select an effective intervention against underlying
disease (or the delayed diagnosis of a disease or condition in the context of diagnostic products),
which is a harm that often cannot be fully remedied after it is incurred. Maintaining the
premarket review process for safety and effectiveness of each intended use advances these and
other interests, including protecting against fraud, misrepresentation, and bias, and preventing
the diversion of health care resources toward ineffective treatments.
The premarket requirements of the FDA Authorities advance further substantial government
interests, including motivating the development of robust scientific data on safety and
effectiveness; ensuring that the FDA-required labeling is accurate and informative; protecting the
integrity and reliability of promotional information regarding medical product uses; protecting
human subjects receiving experimental treatments; ensuring informed consent; maintaining
incentives for clinical trial participation; protecting innovation incentives, including statutory
grants of exclusivity; and promoting the development of products for underserved patients. 19
Generally, FDA’s premarket review process focuses on determining whether a medical product
is safe and effective for the specified use(s) in an identified population. However, after the
premarket review process is complete and a product is approved/cleared, questions may arise in
clinical practice relating to the use of the medical product for particular patients.
HCPs generally prescribe and use approved/cleared medical products for unapproved uses when
they judge that the unapproved use is medically appropriate for their particular patient—whose
characteristics and needs may differ from the characteristics of the population(s) reflected in the
approved use(s). 20 This practice may be most common in patients with diseases for which there
is no medical product that is a proven treatment or in patients who have exhausted all medical

19

See January 2017 Memorandum at 3–16.

Some legal authorities may impact prescribing or administration, even of approved/cleared medical products. For
example, the extra-label use of approved veterinary or human drugs in animals is permitted only if it complies with
section 512(a)(4) and (a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a)(4) and 360b(a)(5), and 21 CFR part 530. (This
guidance does not apply to a firm’s communications about prohibited extra-label uses of drugs in animals (see
section I)). Other authorities that may impact prescribing and use include, but are not limited to, section 303(e) of
the FD&C Act, the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), and state medical licensing and practice
requirements.
20

products with approved uses for their disease. 21 In such instances, HCPs may be interested in
information about unapproved uses of approved/cleared medical products. However, patient
harm could result from communicating information about unapproved uses of approved/cleared
medical products to HCPs who are engaged in prescribing or administering those medical
products to individual patients if that information is false, misleading, or fails to provide and
appropriately present all the information necessary for HCPs to understand and evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses, validity, and clinical utility of the scientific information on
unapproved use(s) in the communication.
Cognizant of all these factors, FDA, in implementing the premarket requirements of the FDA
Authorities and, more specifically, in developing this guidance, has sought to strike a careful
balance, supporting HCP interest in scientific information about unapproved uses of
approved/cleared medical products to inform clinical practice decisions for the care and
management of individual patients, but without undermining the other government interests
described elsewhere in this guidance. This includes the government interest in incentivizing the
development of medical products and satisfaction of applicable premarket requirements for those
medical products, which reduces the need to rely on unapproved use(s), and in protecting
patients from medical product uses that have not been shown to be safe and effective.
This guidance represents a continuation of FDA’s ongoing efforts to consider, develop, and
refine its policies and recommendations relating to communications from firms to HCPs
regarding scientific information on unapproved uses of the firms’ approved/cleared medical
products. 22 In 2009, FDA issued the guidance for industry Good Reprint Practices for the
Distribution of Medical Journal Articles and Medical or Scientific Reference Publications on
Unapproved New Uses of Approved Drugs and Approved or Cleared Medical Devices to provide
guidance to firms on distributing journal articles and scientific or medical reference publications.
FDA subsequently issued the 2014 draft guidance Distributing Scientific and Medical
Publications on Unapproved New Uses — Recommended Practices, which provided additional
explanation of the Agency’s policies on communications from a firm to HCPs regarding
scientific information on unapproved uses of the firm’s approved/cleared medical products and
21

See January 2017 Memorandum at 17.

22
These efforts include, for example, the 2016 public hearing FDA held on the topic of “Manufacturer
Communications Regarding Unapproved Uses of Approved or Cleared Medical Products” (2016 public hearing) (81
FR 60299, September 1, 2016). In response to comments at the 2016 public hearing, FDA developed and placed in
the docket (FDA-2016-N-1149-0040) a memorandum to provide additional background on the issues it is
considering as part of its review of its rules and policies relating to communications by a firm regarding unapproved
use(s) of the firm’s approved or cleared medical product(s) (See January 2017 Memorandum, cited at footnote 13 of
this guidance); see also 82 FR 6367, January 19, 2017 (announcing the addition of the January 2017 Memorandum
to the 2016 public hearing docket and extending the comment period). FDA also revised its intended use
regulations, publishing the final rule in 2021. See 2021 Intended Use Final Rule, 86 FR 41383 (August 2, 2021),
codified at 21 CFR 201.128 and 801.4. The preambles to the proposed and final rules address some related topics.
In addition, the guidance for industry Drug and Device Manufacturer Communications With Payors, Formulary
Committees, and Similar Entities: Questions and Answers and subsequent legislation address related topics (see
footnote 12 of this guidance).

added recommendations on a firm’s dissemination of scientific or medical reference texts and
CPGs that include information on unapproved uses of the firm’s approved/cleared medical
products. FDA then issued the 2023 revised draft guidance, which further explained the
Agency’s policies on communications from firms to HCPs regarding scientific information on
unapproved uses of the firm’s approved/cleared medical product(s) and also incorporated
recommendations on firm-generated presentations.
IV.

POLICY

It is critical that SIUU communications be truthful and non-misleading and also provide and
appropriately present all information necessary for HCPs to understand and evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses, validity, and clinical utility of the scientific information on
unapproved use(s) in the SIUU communication. This guidance provides recommendations
addressing all of these considerations. If a firm shares an SIUU communication that is consistent
with the recommendations in this guidance, FDA does not intend to use the firm’s dissemination
of such communication standing alone as evidence of the firm’s new intended use. Additionally,
FDA does not expect a firm to submit that SIUU communication to the Agency at the time the
communication is initially shared with HCPs.
Under the relevant statutory authorities, when a firm chooses to communicate information about
unapproved uses of its approved/cleared medical product, such communication, along with other
factors, could be evidence of its intended use and therefore relevant to establishing that the firm
has distributed a medical product that fails to comply with applicable premarket requirements or
is otherwise misbranded or adulterated. At the same time, in certain circumstances, HCPs may
be interested in scientific information about unapproved uses of approved/cleared medical
products to inform clinical practice decisions for the care and management of their individual
patients, and, as noted, FDA strives to strike a careful balance between these competing public
health interests. 23
SIUU communications that include firm-generated presentations give rise to considerations that
are different in some ways from the considerations that arise from a firm’s distribution of SIUU
communications that consist of source publications and the recommended disclosures in Q2
alone. The source publications that fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance
are generally available from independent publishers and reflect at least some degree of editorial
input by an independent publisher whose business interest is not tied to sales of specific medical
product(s), in contrast to the firm that has chosen to draw attention to that source publication.
These characteristics of a source publication help to explain why a firm’s choice to draw HCP
attention to such a source publication (when done in accordance with the recommendations in
Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 of this guidance) is less likely, on its own, to upset the careful balance of
competing public health interests. By contrast, firm-generated presentations lack that

independence and generally come to an HCP’s attention because of the firm’s initiative to create
and share them. Therefore, because of these differences between SIUU communications that do
and do not include firm-generated presentations, Q5 of this guidance describes the characteristics
of firm-generated presentations that fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance
and includes specific recommendations to preserve the balance of interests identified previously.
This guidance does not describe the only circumstances in which FDA does not intend to rely on
a firm’s dissemination of information about an unapproved use of its approved/cleared medical
product, standing alone, as evidence of the firm’s intent that the medical product be used for an
unapproved use. For example, in a rulemaking completed in 2021, FDA amended its intended
use regulations to clarify that a firm will not be regarded as intending an unapproved use of its
approved product based solely on that firm’s knowledge that the product is being prescribed or
used by HCPs for such use. 24 The preamble further explained that “knowledge in combination
with conduct that falls within an acknowledged FDA ‘safe harbor’ would not be determinative of
intended use.” 25 Accordingly, a firm would not be regarded as intending an unapproved use for
its approved or cleared medical product based solely on the combination of (1) the firm’s
knowledge that such medical product is being prescribed or used by HCPs for an unapproved use
and (2) the firm’s sharing of SIUU communication(s) about that unapproved use consistent with
the recommendations in this guidance. In that same rulemaking, FDA provided several other
examples of evidence that, standing alone, is not determinative of intended use. 26 FDA has also
issued other guidance documents that address circumstances when FDA does not intend to rely
upon a firm’s dissemination of information regarding an unapproved use of its approved/cleared
medical product to establish a new intended use. 27
We note that nothing in this guidance is intended to convey new policy regarding a firm’s
existing obligations under the FDA Authorities to update FDA-required labeling to accurately

FDA has provided recommendations for industry support of scientific or educational activities (such as
Continuing Medical Education programs) without being subject to FDA regulation (see the guidance IndustrySupported Scientific and Educational Activities (December 1997)). FDA issued a draft guidance with
recommendations for firms on responding to unsolicited requests for information about unapproved uses of
approved medical products (see the draft guidance for industry Responding to Unsolicited Requests for Off-Label
Information About Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices (December 2011). When final, that guidance will
represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic). In June 2018, FDA issued a final guidance that provides
recommendations for firms’ communications with payors and similar entities (see the guidance Drug and Device
Manufacturer Communications With Payors, Formulary Committees, and Similar Entities: Questions and Answers
(see footnote 12 of this guidance regarding subsequent legislation)). In addition, it has long been FDA policy not to
consider a firm’s presentation of truthful and non-misleading scientific information about unapproved uses at the
planned sessions and presentations at medical or scientific conferences to be evidence of intended use when the
presentation is made in non-promotional settings and not accompanied by promotional communications. See
January 2017 Memorandum (cited in footnote 13 of this guidance) at 20–21.

labeling is not false or misleading, or for other reasons. 28

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q1.

What should firms consider when determining whether a source publication is
appropriate to be included in an SIUU communication?

Because SIUU communications are firm-initiated communications directed to HCPs engaged in
prescribing or administering medical products to individual patients, it is critical that the source
publications that firms choose to share in their SIUU communications are not likely to lead to
direct or indirect patient harm when HCPs rely upon the communication to inform clinical
decisions. Accordingly, FDA recommends the following:
1. Source publications included by firms in SIUU communications should describe studies
and analyses that are scientifically sound.
•

To be scientifically sound, the studies or analyses should meet generally accepted
design and other methodological standards 29 for the particular type of study or
analysis performed (e.g., provide a clear description of the prespecified hypothesis
stated and tested, acknowledge and account for potential bias, and otherwise meet
generally accepted scientific standards), taking into account established scientific
principles. Statistical rigor is generally necessary, but not sufficient, for a study or
analysis to be scientifically sound. Any study or analysis described in a source
publication should be evaluated in light of its limitations to determine whether the
study or analysis is scientifically sound. In situations where flaws of a study or
analysis render it unreliable, 30 such study or analysis would not meet generally
accepted design and methodological standards and should not be included in an SIUU
communication because even full disclosure of the limitations of such study or
analysis would not permit interpretation of results or attribution of the results to an

See, e.g., section 502(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 201.56(a)(2) (“labeling must be updated when new
information becomes available that causes the labeling to become inaccurate, false, or misleading”), 21 CFR 314.70
and 601.12 (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application, including labeling), 21 CFR
514.8(c) (concerning supplements and other changes to an approved application for a new animal drug, including
labeling), and 21 CFR 814.39 (concerning supplements to an approved PMA for a device).
28

For examples of generally accepted scientific standards, see American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM),
an international standards development organization (see http://www.astm.org/ABOUT/overview.html for more
information); International Council for Harmonisation (ICH), an international standards development organization
(see http://www.ich.org/about/vision.html for more information); and International Organization for Standardization
(IOS), an international standards development organization (see http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html for more
information).
29

For example, studies or analyses would be unreliable if they were based on poorly extracted data or data
transferred with errors, data that were not source verified, or data that were inaccurately collected and documented.

effect of the medical product. Further, disseminating source publications that distort
studies or analyses (e.g., by inaccurately describing or reporting results) or that
include fraudulent data would not be consistent with the enforcement policy outlined
in this guidance and may also violate provisions of the FDA Authorities, such as
section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
•

For human and animal drugs, randomized, double-blind, concurrently controlled
superiority trials are usually regarded as the most rigorous design and therefore the
most likely to provide scientifically sound information. However, other studies may
also be scientifically sound when adequately designed and conducted (e.g., data
sources are reliable and relevant, protocols and statistical analysis plans are finalized
prior to conducting the analyses, data integrity is carefully monitored and
maintained). For example, a scientifically sound study could include an early-phase
randomized, double-blind, parallel assignment clinical study with a prespecified
statistical analysis plan comparing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety,
and immunogenicity of two prescription drug products. Other examples of studies
that could be consistent with this recommendation include meta-analyses, cohort or
case-control studies, open-label studies, single-arm studies, externally controlled
trials, and non-interventional (observational) studies. 31

•

For devices, the types of studies, information, and analyses that are considered valid
scientific evidence are described in 21 CFR 860.7 and may include well-controlled
investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without
matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and
reports of significant human experience with a marketed device. For devices, these
types of studies, information, and analyses are most likely to be scientifically sound.
Additionally, in the case of devices, single-arm studies with comparisons to external
controls, non-interventional studies, meta-analyses testing a specific clinical
hypothesis, and nonclinical research such as well-designed bench or animal studies
may also be scientifically sound. 32

2. Firms should take into account existing scientific knowledge to determine whether a
source publication is appropriate to include in an SIUU communication, both when
initially preparing the communication and at the time of each dissemination of that
communication.

In certain circumstances, real-world data (i.e., data relating to patient health status and/or the delivery of health
care routinely collected from a variety of sources) can be used to generate real-world evidence. For information
about real-world data and real-world evidence, including FDA guidances and publications, see FDA’s Real-World
Evidence web page, available at https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/realworld-evidence.

• A more recent study that generated a different outcome than a previous study does not
necessarily make the previous study obsolete or inappropriate to disseminate.
However, each time a firm considers disseminating an SIUU communication that
includes particular source publication(s), the firm should consider whether existing
scientific knowledge has, for example, refuted a conclusion from a study described in
that source publication or has corrected a long-held misunderstanding 33 that informed
a study described in that source publication. The act of disseminating a
communication based on a source publication that describes such a study would not
fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance. If, for example, a firm
were to disseminate a source publication that predated the scientific knowledge that
Medical Product X causes a severe adverse event in a specific population of women
(e.g., severe birth defects when administered to pregnant women) and the source
publication suggested Medical Product X was an appropriate treatment for all women,
that would not be consistent with this recommendation.
•

In addition, it would not be consistent with this recommendation that firms take into
account existing scientific knowledge if a firm continues to share an SIUU
communication that has been retracted by the publisher because, for example,
findings from the study are no longer trusted due to discovery of scientific
misconduct or error. Additionally, in a case where understanding of a disease has
advanced and shown that certain outcome measures used in studies do not reflect an
effect on the disease, sharing source publications that are based on studies that used
those outcome measures would not be consistent with the recommendation that firms
take into account existing scientific knowledge when determining whether a source
publication should be included in an SIUU communication. 34 Accordingly, when a

For example, at one time there was a widely held belief that treating minor rhythm abnormalities (frequent
ventricular premature beats) with anti-arrhythmics after an acute myocardial infarction would improve survival, in
the absence of well-controlled studies showing this to be true. Sources were published that included
recommendations based on this belief. To test this belief, the National Institutes of Health conducted the Cardiac
Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a well-controlled study which demonstrated that, although the drugs did
indeed treat minor rhythm abnormalities, the patients who took those drugs had a 2 ½ fold increase in mortality.
See, Echt, D.S., Liebson, P.R., Mitchell, L.B. et al. (1991). Mortality and Morbidity in Patients Receiving Encainide,
Flecainide, or Placebo: The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial. New Eng. J. Med., 324(12): 781–88. See also
The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial-II Investigators. (1992). Effect of Antiarrhythmic Agent Moricizine on
Survival After Myocardial Infarction: The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial-II. N Eng. J. Med., 327(4): 227–
233. After the CAST study was published, this assumption about the effect of anti-arrhythmics was understood to
be incorrect. If a firm were to disseminate a source publication that failed to take into account this existing scientific
knowledge about the effect of anti-arrhythmics, that would not be consistent with the recommendations in this
guidance.
33

Of note, scientific data generated in early stages of medical product development can produce results that are not
borne out in later studies, as demonstrated by the failure of some clinical studies to support the use of a medical
product for the treatment of a disease or condition for which the medical product initially appeared promising. For
example, the failure rate during the process of new prescription drug development exceeds 95 percent (see National
Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. New Therapeutic Uses, U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, National Institutes of Health. April 19, 2024. Accessed May 14, 2024. https://ncats.nih.gov/ntu/about).

firm has shared on the internet an SIUU communication that includes a source
publication that is no longer consistent with the recommendation that firms take into
account existing scientific knowledge, and the firm has the ability to remove its SIUU
communication, we recommend the firm remove its SIUU communication. 35
3. Any conclusions articulated in a source publication should align with the prespecified
hypothesis or research question from the described study or analysis and be supported by
the results from that study or analysis. 36
Q2.

What information should firms include as part of SIUU communications?

FDA recommends that firms include all of the following information as part of SIUU
communications: 37
•

A statement that the unapproved use(s) of the medical product has not been approved by
FDA and that the safety and effectiveness of the medical product for the unapproved
use(s) has not been established
- For example, a statement that “[Medical Product X] has not been approved by FDA
for use in [Condition Y], and the safety and effectiveness of [Medical Product X] for
[Condition Y] has not been established.”

•

A statement disclosing the FDA-approved use(s) of the medical product, including any
limitations of use specified in the FDA-required labeling

•

A statement disclosing any limitations, restrictions, cautions, warnings, or precautions
described in the FDA-required labeling about the unapproved use(s)

Similarly, medical devices have a very high failure rate in their first prototype tests, with a reported 90 percent of
medical devices failing in their first prototype tests (see Intertek (2010). The Top 10 Reasons Medical Devices Fail
Product Certification Testing the First Time. Available at https://www.intertek.com/resources/whitepapers/2021/electrical-top-ten-reasons-products-fail/).
35
If a firm chooses to include some discussion of or reference to a source publication containing historical
information, such as to describe the historical context and evolution of clinical knowledge in a subject area, that
would be consistent with the recommendations in this guidance if it makes clear that the information is historical
context only and not reflective of existing scientific knowledge.

See January 2017 Memorandum at 13 (“Marketing activities and communications regarding the safety and
effectiveness of a medical product for a particular use that are not properly supported by scientific evidence may
thus create a false or misleading impression about the safety and efficacy of the medical product for that use, which
can lead to prescribing or use decisions that harm patients”).
36

See item 2 in Q4 of this guidance for information on certain modifications to the recommendations in this section
when firms share SIUU communications that include certain unabridged CPGs or reference texts in their entirety
and do not include firm-generated presentations (as that term is defined in this guidance).
37

15

•

A copy of the most current FDA-required labeling (or a mechanism for obtaining this
labeling, as appropriate)

•

A statement describing any contraindication(s) in the FDA-required labeling for the
medical product

•

A statement describing any serious, life-threatening, or fatal risks posed by the medical
product that are in the FDA-required labeling for the medical product or known by the
firm and that are relevant to the unapproved use(s)
- If a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) has been established under 21
U.S.C. 355-1, the statement should disclose that fact and should describe the goal(s)
of the REMS

•

A statement identifying any authors, editors, or other contributors to publication(s)
included in the SIUU communication who were employees of or consultants to or who
received compensation from the firm 38 at the time of writing, editing, or contributing to
the publication, to the extent a firm acting reasonably would know of such relationship

•

In the case of an SIUU communication that includes one or more source publications
primarily focused on a particular scientific study or studies, 39 for each such study 40 where
the following information is not included in the source publication, provide a description
of: 41
- All material aspects of study design, methodology, and results.

Systematic reviews of studies funded and/or conducted by the firm or its representatives demonstrate bias
favoring a firm’s medical product. See, e.g., Lexchin, J., Bero, L. A., Djulbegovic, B., & Clark, O. (2003).
Pharmaceutical industry sponsorship and research outcome and quality: systematic review. BMJ (Clinical research
ed.), 326(7400), 1167–1170. https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.326.7400.1167 (reviewing 30 studies finding that
“[s]ystematic bias favours products which are made by the company funding the research.”); Lundh, A., Lexchin, J.,
Mintzes, B., Schroll, J. B., & Bero, L. (2017). Industry sponsorship and research outcome. The Cochrane database
of systematic reviews, 2(2), MR000033. https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.MR000033.pub3 (reviewing 48 studies
showing that “[s]ponsorship of drug and device studies by the manufacturing company leads to more favorable
results and conclusions than sponsorship by other sources”).
38

FDA anticipates that most SIUU communications that include only CPGs or reference texts would not be subject
to this recommendation because these types of source publications are not focused primarily on a specific study or
studies.

39

For example, if an SIUU communication includes a reprint that describes two studies in detail, this
recommendation applies to each study, even if the SIUU communication does not address them in identical detail.

presentations of scientific information on unapproved use(s) provided with a source publication.

- All material limitations related to the study design, methodology, and results. 42
- Any conclusions—from other scientifically sound studies that evaluated the same or
similar hypotheses or research questions—that are in conflict with the conclusions
from the studies or analyses described in the source publication(s). The citations for
any such studies should also be included. 43
•
Q3.

The publication date of any referenced or included source publication (if not specified in
the source publication or citation).
What presentational considerations should firms take into account for SIUU
communications?

There are several presentational considerations that can help ensure that SIUU communications
are conveyed in a manner that enhances and does not interfere with HCP understanding and
evaluation of the underlying scientific information, including its limitations. To that end, FDA
recommends the following:
1. SIUU communications should clearly and prominently present the disclosures
recommended in this guidance.
Recommended disclosures should be clearly and prominently presented. This helps to ensure
that HCPs have the information necessary to interpret the scientific information and the SIUU
communication as a whole. Factors FDA considers when determining whether information is
clearly and prominently presented may include type size, font style, layout, contrast, graphic
design, headlines, spacing, volume, articulation, pace, and any other techniques to achieve
emphasis or notice. 44 For SIUU communications that have both audio and visual components, to
help HCPs notice and comprehend the information, FDA recommends that disclosures be
presented in both the audio and in text at the same time using the same words (key terms and
phrases or a full transcript). 45 Note, for SIUU communications that have both audio and visual
components, it would be consistent with the disclosure recommendations of this guidance for
both the audio and visual components to include a statement about how to obtain a copy of the
most current FDA-required labeling for the medical product that is the subject of the SIUU
communication.
42

See Q1 for further discussion of limitations of studies and analyses.

See Q1 for further discussion of scenarios where dissemination of a source publication would not fall within the
enforcement policy outlined in this guidance as a result of failure to take into account existing scientific knowledge
(e.g., in cases where existing scientific knowledge refutes a conclusion from a previous study).
43

44

FDA assesses disclosure clarity and prominence on a case-by-case basis.

For example, if a firm posts a reprint on a web page and also includes a firm-generated video presentation of
scientific information on unapproved use(s) from the reprint (see Q5), the firm should present recommended
disclosures in the video in both the audio and in text at the same time, using the same words.

2. SIUU communications should be separate from promotional communications about
approved uses of medical products.
As set forth in this guidance, the medical products that are discussed in SIUU communications
are approved/cleared for at least one use, and, as such, it is likely that firms disseminate
promotional communications for those approved uses. However, combining approved use and
unapproved use information has the potential to undermine the government interests in the
premarket requirements of the FDA Authorities (see section III of this guidance). Including
information about unapproved uses in or with promotional communications for approved uses of
a medical product can prompt conflation of the information. 46 This conflation may lead HCPs to
conclude that the firm’s medical product has been demonstrated to be safe and effective for all
presented uses, including the unapproved use(s), or to conclude that all presented uses of the
medical product are uses for which it is approved/cleared. Accordingly, to reduce the risk of
HCPs conflating approved and unapproved use information, FDA recommends that SIUU
communications be clearly identified through the clear and prominent presentation of the
disclosures recommended in this guidance and separate from promotional communications about
approved uses.
The following examples illustrate these recommendations:
Example 1: Medical or scientific conferences represent a venue where information about
both approved and unapproved uses of medical products is shared. Although conference
organizers generally select the content to be shared for the planned sessions and
presentations at the conference (e.g., poster sessions), 47 these same conferences also offer
venues (e.g., booths in commercial exhibit halls) where firms can independently select
and share information with conference attendees, which could include both promotional
communications about approved uses of medical products and SIUU communications.
When sharing information in commercial exhibit halls and similar venues where
programming is not selected and determined by the conference organizers, firms should
ensure that SIUU communications are clearly identified through the clear and prominent
presentation of the disclosures recommended in this guidance and are separate from (i.e.,
not attached to or intermingled with) promotional communications about approved
46
Research indicates that combining multiple communications can prompt conflation of the messages conveyed by
each communication. See, e.g., Sullivan, H. W., O’Donoghue, A. C., Rupert, D. J., Willoughby, J. F., Amoozegar,
J. B., & Aikin, K. J. (2016). Are Disease Awareness Links on Prescription Drug Websites Misleading? A
Randomized Study. Journal of health communication, 21(11), 1198–1207; Aikin, K. J., Sullivan, H. W., & Betts, K.
R. (2016). Disease Information in Direct-to-Consumer Prescription Drug Print Ads. Journal of health
communication, 21(2), 228–239.
47
It has long been FDA policy not to consider a firm’s presentation of truthful and non-misleading scientific
information about unapproved uses of its approved/cleared medical product at the planned sessions and
presentations at medical or scientific conferences to be evidence of a new intended use when the presentation is
made in non-promotional settings and is not accompanied by promotional communications. (See January 2017
Memorandum at 21.)

18

uses. 48 For example, in commercial exhibit halls, FDA strongly recommends that firms
divide booth space to allow for a dedicated space where SIUU communications can be
shared, separate from the booth space where promotional communications about
approved uses are shared.
Example 2: If a firm chooses to share information about both the approved and
unapproved uses of its medical products to HCPs online through websites, FDA
recommends that SIUU communications be on a separate web page from the web page
that hosts promotional communications about the approved uses of the medical product
and that the web page for the SIUU communications clearly identifies those
communications through the clear and prominent presentation of the disclosures
recommended in this guidance. FDA also recommends that firms not include direct links
from web pages that host promotional communications about approved uses to web pages
that host SIUU communications.
Example 3: If a firm chooses to share information about both approved and unapproved
uses of its medical products to HCPs through email messages, FDA recommends that
email messages used to share SIUU communications be separate from email messages
used to share promotional communications about approved uses of the medical product
and that the email messages used to share SIUU communications clearly identify those
communications through the clear and prominent presentation of the disclosures
recommended in this guidance.
Example 4: If a firm’s representative delivers an SIUU communication during an inperson visit with an HCP, that SIUU communication should be separate from (i.e., not
attached to or intermingled with) any promotional communications about the approved
use(s) of the firm’s medical product that are also shared during the in-person visit. 49 The
SIUU communication(s) should be clearly identified through the clear and prominent
presentation of the disclosures recommended in this guidance.
3. SIUU communications should be shared through media and via platforms that enable
firms to implement the recommendations in this guidance.
Firms interested in sharing SIUU communications have the choice to use a variety of media
types and platforms, and each medium and platform may prompt unique presentational
This recommendation applies even to those SIUU communications that include the same substantive content as
presented in planned sessions at the conference. Courts have recognized that a different level of First Amendment
scrutiny can apply to the same speech depending on how the speech is communicated. See, e.g., Washington Legal
Foundation v. Friedman, 13 F. Supp. 2d 51, 64 (D.D.C. 1998), vacated in part sub nom. Washington Legal
Foundation v. Henney, 202 F.3d 331, 336-37 (D.C. Cir. 2000).

48

49
FDA recommends that firms ensure that the personnel who are engaged in sharing SIUU communications have
specialized training in providing truthful, non-misleading scientific information about unapproved uses of the firms’
approved medical products. A firm’s personnel who are sharing SIUU communications should also be trained to
handle potential questions that may arise about the information they are sharing or know how to direct the questions
to personnel who are best qualified to respond (e.g., medical or scientific/technical representative or department).

challenges and considerations. For example, certain online platforms may impose characterspace limitations or other presentational limitations that would not enable a firm to include
within their communications on that platform all of the disclosures that are recommended for an
SIUU communication. To be consistent with the recommendations in this guidance, such
platforms should not be used to host SIUU communications but could be used to direct HCPs to
an SIUU communication. For example, it would be consistent with the recommendations in this
guidance for a communication on a character-space limited platform to direct HCPs to an SIUU
communication through a statement that does not mention the name of any specific medical
product, such as “New publication for Health Care Providers—phase 3 trial results for an
investigational treatment for [disease X],” followed by a link to a website where the SIUU
communication appears.
Firms should carefully consider the unique presentational challenges and considerations relevant
to different media types and platforms to ensure that the medium and platform used for sharing
an SIUU communication allows the firm to follow all of the recommendations in this guidance.
Q4.

What additional recommendations apply to reprints, CPGs, reference texts, and
materials from digital clinical practice resources that are included in an SIUU
communication?

This section offers specific recommendations regarding reprints, CPGs, reference texts, and
materials from digital clinical practice resources that are included in an SIUU communication, in
addition to the recommendations outlined in Q1, Q2, and Q3.
1. Reprints:
When firms share SIUU communications that include one or more reprints, the reprints should
be unaltered/unabridged because the sharing of unaltered/unabridged articles is less likely to
introduce bias or result in the omission of material information. Moreover, FDA recommends
that the articles that firms choose to share as reprints have the following characteristics:
•

The article is published in a journal managed by an independent organization that has an
editorial board composed of persons who have demonstrated expertise in the subject of
the articles under review by the organization (through education or experience) and that
has a publicly stated policy regarding the disclosure of conflicts of interest or biases for
all authors, contributors, and editors

•

The article is peer-reviewed by experts in the subject of the article, as established by
education or experience

•

The article is generally available (or the journal from which the article is taken is
generally available) through independent distribution channels (e.g., internet sources,
book retailers, subscriptions, libraries) where periodicals and reprints are sold or are
accessible

20

Articles that misrepresent or overstate findings from a study or analysis in light of the limitations
of such study or analysis would not fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
2. Clinical Reference Resources:
In this guidance, we address the following clinical reference resources:
•
•
•

CPGs
Reference texts
Materials from digital clinical practice resources

These clinical reference resources often contain information about unapproved uses of
approved/cleared medical products. Therefore, when sharing SIUU communications that
include CPGs, reference texts, or materials from digital clinical practice resources, FDA
recommends that firms follow the recommendations in Q1, Q2, and Q3, subject to the following
additions and modifications.
When a firm shares an SIUU communication that includes one or more individual section(s) of
any of these clinical reference resources, the SIUU communication should include all
information from the clinical reference resource necessary for HCPs to interpret the strengths
and weaknesses, validity, and clinical utility of the scientific information on unapproved use(s)
that the clinical reference resource presents. This may involve the sharing of multiple sections
of the clinical reference resource that contain related or linked information. When a firm shares
individual section(s) from these clinical reference resources, those individual section(s) should
be unaltered/unabridged and extracted directly from the clinical reference resource.
Because unabridged CPGs and reference texts in their entirety generally discuss a wide range
of topics and medical products, FDA notes the following modifications to the
recommendations in Q2. When a firm shares an SIUU communication that does not include a
firm-generated presentation, but does include an unabridged CPG or reference text in its
entirety that discusses a wide range of medical products and that discussion is not primarily
focused on one or more of a firm’s medical products, FDA does not expect a firm to include
any of the following:
•

A statement disclosing the FDA-approved use(s), including any limitations of use
specified in the FDA-required labeling, for each of the firm’s medical products
mentioned in the CPG or reference text

•

A statement disclosing any limitations, restrictions, cautions, warnings, or precautions
described in the FDA-required labeling about the unapproved use(s) for each of the
firm’s medical products mentioned in the CPG or reference text

•

A copy of or a mechanism to obtain the FDA-required labeling for each of the firm’s
medical products mentioned in the CPG or reference text

21

Not for Current Implementation—see PRA statement in section VI.
•

A statement describing the contraindications in the FDA-required labeling for each of
the firm’s medical products mentioned in the CPG or reference text

•

A description of the serious, life-threatening, or fatal risks that are in the FDA-required
labeling or are known by the firm and that are relevant to the unapproved use(s) posed
by each of the firm’s medical products mentioned in the CPG or reference text
(including whether a REMS has been established for any of the firm’s medical
products mentioned in the CPG or reference text and a description of the goal(s) of the
REMS)

Instead, FDA recommends that firms include a more general statement in the SIUU
communication, such as, “This [CPG/reference text] describes some uses of medical products
that are not approved by the FDA, and the safety and effectiveness of any unapproved use(s)
have not been established.”
a. Specific Recommendations for CPGs:
CPGs are generally based on a wide range of evidence, with the goal of making treatment
recommendations and describing the different levels of evidence that support those
recommendations. CPGs provide recommendations for care for a disease or condition, in
addition to offering potential alternatives for certain patient subgroups. FDA recommends that
a CPG have all of the following characteristics if a firm chooses to include it in an SIUU
communication:
•

The CPG is based on rigorous reviews of the existing evidence conducted according to
a clear, established procedure and following a transparent process that minimizes biases
and conflicts of interest

•

The CPG includes ratings of the recommendations to reflect the quality and strength of
evidence that supports each recommendation

•

The CPG is revised when important new evidence warrants modifications of current
recommendations

•

The CPG is generally available through independent distribution channels (e.g., internet
sources, book retailers, subscriptions, libraries) where CPGs are sold or are accessible

CPGs that misrepresent or overstate findings from a study or analysis in light of the limitations
of such study or analysis would not fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.

22

One helpful resource when considering whether a particular CPG is appropriate to be included
in an SIUU communication is the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) 50 standards for CPG
“trustworthiness.” 51 CPGs that are consistent with the NAM standards would also be
consistent with the recommendations in this guidance about the characteristics that CPGs
should have. The NAM standards recommend that CPGs (1) be based on a systematic review52
of the existing evidence; (2) be developed by a knowledgeable, multidisciplinary panel of
experts and representatives from key affected groups; (3) consider important patient subgroups
and patient preferences, as appropriate; (4) be based on an explicit and transparent process by
which the CPG is developed and funded that minimizes distortions, 53 biases, and conflicts of
interest; (5) provide a clear explanation of the logical relationships between alternative care
options and health outcomes, provide clearly articulated recommendations in standardized
form, and provide ratings of both quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations;
and (6) be reconsidered and revised when important new evidence warrants modifications of
CPG recommendations.
Numerous professional organizations develop and disseminate CPGs that are pertinent to their
members’ clinical practices. In an era of rapidly increasing amounts of scientific information
about medical products, CPGs can be a tool to manage this information. However, in light of
the proliferation of professional organizations promulgating CPGs and the variations in scope
and evidence used for CPG recommendations by these organizations, it is important that firms
consider the recommendations in this guidance when they assess CPGs in a medical practice
area, including this guidance’s recommendations that CPG recommendations have ratings to

NAM was formerly known as the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and is one of three academies that make up the
National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Through the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, Congress required the Secretary of
Health and Human Services (HHS) to contract with IOM (through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)
to undertake a study that focused on “the best methods used in developing clinical practice guidelines in order to
ensure that organizations developing such guidelines have information on approaches that are objective,
scientifically valid, and consistent” (Public Law 110-275, 122 Stat. 2595). Also, in this legislation, Congress
required IOM to submit a report to the Secretary of HHS and the appropriate committees of Congress containing the
results of the study, together with recommendations for such legislation and administrative action as IOM
determines appropriate. The standards for CPG “trustworthiness,” as referred to in this guidance, are taken directly
from IOM’s study results (as articulated in its report, Robin Graham et al. eds., Institute of Medicine of the National
Academies, Committee on Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines, Clinical Practice
Guidelines We Can Trust (2011)), available at https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/13058/clinical-practiceguidelines-we-can-trust.

The NAM has defined a systematic review as “a scientific investigation that focuses on a specific question and
uses explicit, prespecified scientific methods to identify, select, assess, and summarize the findings of similar but
separate studies.” Institute of Medicine, Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews

reflect the strength and quality of evidence supporting those CPG recommendations and that
any CPG recommendations are updated when new evidence warrants modification.
b. Specific Recommendations for Reference Texts and Materials From Digital
Clinical Practice Resources:
FDA recommends that a reference text or material from a digital clinical practice resource have
all of the following characteristics if a firm chooses to include it in an SIUU communication:
•

It is published by an independent publisher that is in the business of publishing
scientific or medical educational content 54

•

It is published in a manner consistent with current standards for medical content
creation and review that are generally accepted by the medical publishing industry and
in accordance with any specific peer-review procedures of the publisher

•

It is authored, edited, and contributed to by experts who have demonstrated expertise in
the subject area(s) through education or experience

•

It is generally available or sold through independent distribution channels 55 (e.g.,
internet sources, book retailers, subscriptions, libraries) for medical and scientific
educational content

Reference texts or material(s) from digital clinical practice resources that misrepresent or
overstate findings from a study or analysis in light of the limitations of such study or analysis
would not fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
Q5.

What additional recommendations apply to firm-generated presentations of
scientific information on unapproved use(s) provided with a source publication?

In addition to sharing SIUU communications that include one or more source publications, some
firms also develop firm-generated presentations to include in their SIUU communications.
Because the firms themselves are not only choosing to initiate the sharing of these
communications, but also are creating them, these communications present additional
considerations to those applicable to SIUU communications that consist of source publications
and the recommended disclosures alone. Most obviously, firm-generated presentations do not
have the same level of independence in their development and publication as source publications
that meet the recommendations set forth in this guidance. Additionally, firm-generated
presentations are not otherwise generally available, without the firm’s dissemination, in the way
It would be consistent with this recommendation for a firm to fund the production of copies of a reference text or
material from a digital clinical practice resource that is already generally available and to provide those copies to
HCPs.

54

FDA recognizes that individual chapters of reference texts may not be generally available through these channels;
this language is referring to general availability of the complete reference text.
55

24

that source publications are generally available. This section describes the characteristics of
firm-generated presentations that fall within the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
As an initial matter, consistent with the recommendations in this guidance, an SIUU
communication that includes a firm-generated presentation should be truthful and nonmisleading and should provide and appropriately present all information necessary for HCPs to
understand and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses, validity, and clinical utility of the
presented scientific information on unapproved use(s), as further explained in this section.
•

The firm-generated presentation should be limited to the scientific information on
unapproved use(s) from one or more source publications, and the source publication(s)
should be consistent with the recommendations in Q1 and Q4 of this guidance.

•

Firms should provide the source publication(s) with the firm-generated presentation. 56

•

Firms should include all information material to the representations made in the firmgenerated presentation with those representations within the firm-generated presentation.
For example, if a firm-generated presentation includes information about study results,
the firm-generated presentation should include all material aspects of and limitations
related to the study design, methodology, and results necessary to interpret the presented
information directly with the presented information.

•

Firm-generated presentations should include the disclosures recommended in Q2 of this
guidance 57 and should also clearly disclose what portions of the SIUU communication
are firm-generated. For example, a firm-generated presentation could include the
following statement: “This presentation was developed by FIRM X.”

•

Firm-generated presentations should be consistent with the recommendations in this
guidance regarding presentational considerations in Q3.

Additionally, to ensure a firm-generated presentation is truthful and non-misleading, the firmgenerated presentation should not, for example, do any of the following:

In situations where a firm chooses to deliver an in-person or hard-copy version of the firm-generated presentation,
a hard-copy version of the source publication(s) should be delivered with it. Where a firm-generated presentation is
shared electronically, a firm may choose to provide an electronic copy of the source publication(s) or a prominent
direct link to a full-text version of the source publication(s) that the HCP can access free of charge.
56

57
To the extent that recommended disclosures apply to both the firm-generated presentation and the source
publication, FDA does not generally expect that firms repeat the recommended disclosures in both the firmgenerated presentation and separately in an attachment to the source publication. However, the recommended
disclosures that are material to specific representations made in the firm-generated presentation should be, at a
minimum, included with such representations in the firm-generated presentation.

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Not for Current Implementation—see PRA statement in section VI.
•

Imply that the study, analysis, or underlying data or information from the source
publication represents larger or more-general experience with the medical product than it
actually does

•

Include representations or suggestions about the safety or effectiveness of the medical
product for the unapproved use(s) that are not consistent with the source publication

•

Present conclusions or representations about safety or effectiveness for the unapproved
use, even if they are an accurate reflection of the statements in the source publication,
without attributing that statement expressly to the source publication and without
immediately following it with the statement identifying any authors, editors, or other
contributors to the source publication who were employees of or consultants to or who
received compensation from the firm at the time of writing, editing, or contributing to the
source publication 58

•

Present information (e.g., excerpts, quotes, paraphrases, conclusions) from the source
publication out of context

•

Use statistical analyses or techniques to indicate clinical significance or validity of a
finding not supported by the data or information in the source publication

•

Use presentational elements to obscure or distort the scientific content, such as by using
textual features and graphic design elements to emphasize only positive information or
distract attention from unfavorable information, or by using tables or graphs to distort or
misrepresent the relationships, trends, differences, or changes among the outcomes
evaluated in the source publication

Nevertheless, it is consistent with the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance for firmgenerated presentations to use presentational elements and other communication techniques to
help explain or illustrate the scientific content in an accurate way or to help ensure clear and
prominent presentation of the recommended disclosures (see Q3). For instance, a
communication that includes a firm-generated presentation that is otherwise consistent with the
recommendations of this guidance and includes an accurate reproduction of tables or graphs
from a source publication, or otherwise makes use of color, typeface, font style, contrast, and
white space to, for example, ensure a clear and prominent presentation of the recommended
disclosures, would be consistent with the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
In contrast, firm-generated presentations that use communication techniques to encourage the
unapproved use of the medical product based on elements other than the communication’s

scientific content are outside the scope of the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance. 59,60
Furthermore, in FDA’s experience, when the following communication techniques are used, in
most cases, that use is to influence decisions based on elements other than the communication’s
substance: celebrity endorsements, emotional appeals unrelated to the scientific content, 61
gifts, 62 promotional tag lines, 63 jingles, and premium offers. For this reason, the enforcement
policy outlined in this guidance does not extend to firm-generated presentations of scientific
information on unapproved use(s) that use any of the foregoing communication techniques.
Additionally, the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance does not extend to firm-generated
presentations of scientific information about an unapproved use of the firm’s approved/cleared
medical product that include calls to value 64 that pre-judge the benefit(s) of the medical product
for individual patients. Examples of calls to value that pre-judge the benefit(s) of the medical
product for individual patients include “Call FIRM X now for more information on [Medical
product X] — it’s the best option for your difficult-to-treat patients!” and “Click here to start
improving your patients’ lives today.” In contrast, inclusion of a call to value that does not preResearch demonstrates that communication techniques employed in marketing by firms are effective at
influencing attitudes and behaviors of HCPs and that how information is presented can impact HCP impressions of
that information. Such techniques can influence attitudes and behavior, independent of the quality of the
information, even among highly educated medical professionals. See, e.g., Austad, K. E., Avorn, J., Franklin, J. M.,

59

Whether a firm-generated presentation falls outside of the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance for this
reason depends on the specifics of the individual communication.

60

Examples of emotional appeals unrelated to the scientific content include statements such as “Don’t give up hope
for your patients” and inspirational images such as a sunrise, a joyful family gathering, or a basket of puppies.

61

Examples of gifts include note pads and pens. See also IOM (Institute of Medicine). (2009). Conflict of Interest
in Medical Research, Education, and Practice. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press (noting that even
small gifts can result in undue influence, particularly in the context of a sustained relationship).
62

63

An example of a promotional tagline would be “Nothing but the BEST from [Medical product X].”

A call to value is a term of art that refers to a communication technique that includes both a call to action and a
value proposition that tells the audience what this action will translate into for them.

64

judge the benefit(s) of the medical product for individual patients would not alone cause a firmgenerated presentation to fall outside the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance.
Examples of calls to value that do not pre-judge the benefit(s) of the medical product for
individual patients include “Click here to access the full article for free!” or “Read now to learn
more about this new data on Medical product X.”
There are several reasons for defining the scope of the enforcement policy outlined in this
guidance to exclude firm-generated presentations that use (1) communication techniques that
encourage the unapproved use of the firm’s medical product based on elements other than the
communication’s scientific content or (2) calls to value that pre-judge the benefit(s) of the
medical product for individual patients. In general, in the context of any communication from a
firm to an HCP in support of an unapproved use, the firm’s choice to use these communication
techniques suggests an effort to convince the HCP to prescribe or use the product for the
unapproved use, rather than providing the HCP with scientific information to evaluate and make
their own clinical decisions. These efforts to persuade provide particularly clear evidence of the
firm’s intended use for the purposes of relevant requirements of the FDA Authorities. 65
Relatedly, the boundary on the enforcement policy outlined in this guidance regarding
communication techniques in firm-generated presentations helps to preserve the incentives for
firms to develop scientific data and information of the quality and type sufficient to satisfy
premarket requirements for approval/clearance of each intended use and then submit that data
consistent with the premarket review process for each intended use. 66 Without this boundary
regarding communication techniques in firm-generated presentations, there would not be a
meaningful distinction between firm-generated presentations included in SIUU communications
and promotional activities. As with SIUU communications that include firm-generated
presentations, a firm’s promotional communications about approved uses are also firmgenerated, and, particularly when directed to an HCP audience, frequently present scientific
content to encourage use of the medical product. Dissolving this distinction between these types
of communications would undercut the incentives for firms to develop scientific evidence and
engage in the premarket review process in order to promote their medical product.
Finally, because an SIUU communication may be used to inform clinical practice decisions
about whether to expose an individual patient to an unapproved use of a medical product,
without the assurances of safety and effectiveness provided by premarket review, it is critical
that the communication be presented in a manner that is unlikely to lead HCPs to base those
decisions on conclusions about the safety or effectiveness of the unapproved use that are not in
alignment with or that go beyond what is justified by the underlying scientific information.
65

See 21 CFR 201.128 and 801.4 (describing a wide range of evidence available to establish that intended use);
2021 Intended Use Final Rule, 86 FR at 41388 (“Courts have repeatedly held that . . . promotional claims are one
source of evidence of intended use.”).

FDA approval/clearance of each intended use, in turn, helps advance public health benefits, including by assuring
independent examination of the data and helping to ensure that labeling is accurate and conveys information
prescribers and patients need to use the product safely and effectively for each intended use. See January 2017
Memorandum at 3–20.

In summary, this guidance strives to balance (1) HCP interest in scientific information about
unapproved uses of approved/cleared medical products to inform clinical practice decisions for
the care and management of individual patients and (2) the various government interests in
incentivizing the development of and satisfaction of applicable premarket requirements for
medical products. 67 In firm-generated presentations, a firm’s use of communication techniques
to encourage the unapproved use of its medical product based on elements other than the
communication’s scientific content does not appropriately serve the purpose of informing
clinical practice decisions for the care and management of individual patients and therefore does
not counterbalance the important government interests discussed in this guidance. For these
reasons, those communications are outside the scope of the enforcement policy outlined in this
guidance.
