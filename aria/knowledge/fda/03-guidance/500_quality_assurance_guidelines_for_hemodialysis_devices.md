On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Foreword
In October 1982, the Food and Drug Administration established the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) by merging the Bureau of Medical Devices and
the Bureau of Radiological Health.
The Center develops and implements national programs to protect the public health
in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended t o
assure the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling of medical devices, t o control
unnecessary human exposure t o potentially hazardous ionizing and nonionizing radiation,
and t o ensure the safe, efficacious use of such radiation.
The Center publishes the results of i t s work in scientific journals and in its own
technical reports. These reports provide a mechanism for disseminating results of CDRH
and contractor projects. They are sold by the Government Printing Office and/or the
National Technical Information Service.
W e welcome your comments and requests for further information.

Preface
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) mission under the 1976
Medical Device Amendments and the 1990 Safe Medical Devices Act i s t o develop and
implement national programs t o protect the public from unsafe or ineffective medical
devices.
One important aspect of the Center's activities is the development o f
educational programs for health professionals and consumers in the proper use o f
medical devices.
Hemodialysis is a critical care medical technique which sustains the lives of
thousands of patients who suffer from acute o r chronic kidney failure. However, due t o
the inherent complexity and risk of thc technique, a few patients experience adverse
events which are avoidable. Most adverse events are caused b y u s e r . e r r o r o r a
combination of user error and medical device malfunction. A comprehensive device
quality assurance program would help avoid many of these adverse events.
This publication, "Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices," is an
integral part of the Center's educational program in hemodialysis. It discusses quality
assurance for water treatment equipment, equipment used t o evaluate the acceptability
of the dialysate concentrate, dialysate delivery equipment with its associated monitors and
alarms, extracorporeal blood components, dialyzers, dialyzer reprocessing and testing
equipment, and all other equipment associated with the dialysis procedure.
W e hope that this manual will help dialysis facility personnel become more familiar
with quality assurance procedures for dialysis equipment. The manual will assist the
facility i n developing and implementing a facility-specific quality assurance program o r in
refining an existing quality assurance program. Each chapter describes quality assurance
methods and also provides examples of forms which can be adapted for each facility's
specific needs.
In addition t o this manual, the Center has published another manual entitled "A
Manual o n Water Treatment for Hemodialysis" and has produced educational videotapes
o n various aspects of user safety in hemodialysis. The videotapes have been produced as
a cooperative effort among manufacturers, professional associations, and the Center and
were sent free of charge t o each dialysis facility in the United States.

Introduction
Quality Assurance in renal care covers a wide range
of areas and applications. Some of these include:
monitoring appropriateness of therapy; analysis
of resource utilization and pursuing resulting necessary adjustments; assessing patient satisfaction;
measuring morbidity and mortality with the subsequent implementation of attempted solutions; staff
credentialing, and monitoring of technical and clinical processes with suitable modifications when standards are not met.
Since the title of this manual is Quality Assurance Guidelines fir Hemadialysis Devices, the reader
must be aware that only the technical aspects
of hemodialysis are discussed herein. As authors,
we suggest two reasons for this focus.
First, promoting the safe and effective use of medical devices is a mission of the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration-the contracting agency for this manual.
Second--and probably more importantiassuring
the technical safety in hemodialysis continues to
be one of the most critical facets of renal care. A
number of incidents that result in patient injury
continue to occur every year-incidents that could
be prevented with proper user training, conscientious attention to the manufacturers' instructions
for use and common industry practice, and a wellplanned quality assurance program carried out at
the facility level.

A source of basic background information of the
current risks and hazards associated with the
use of certain devices in hemodialysis today. Suggestions are made as to how to minimize those
risks, as well as how to implement quality assurance
measures used to monitor and control the success
of those actions.
A source of easy-to-use forms, monitoring instruments, and other useful tools that can be immediately utilized in the facility-based quality
assurance program.
This manual is not meant to be:

A complete "cookbookn quality assurance program for the dialysis facility. It does contain
many components of the comprehensive, facility-based quality assurance program. A number of monitoring instruments, forms, and other
tools presented in this manual can immediately
be utilized. However, a truly meaninghl QA
prqgram for dialysis facilities must include areas
that are beyond the scope of this document, including patient care, medical, dietary, social services, patient satisfaction and others.

As authors we wish to convey to the readerluser
of this manual our intent regarding what this p u b
lication "isn and what it "is notn meant to be:
This manual is meant to be:

A first step in assisting the facility to develop
and implement a facility-specific quality assurance approach (or to refine one, if already in
place).

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

A training manual for the technical aspects of
dialysis. Again, this publication does contain
materials that will help train personnel; but much
more in-depth knowledge of each of these technical areas is essential for most dialysis staff
members. An annotated bibliography appears
a t the end of the manual to assist the facility
in finding other resources needed to complete
that training.
Standards of technical practice for hemodialysis. This manual refers to various "standards"
and "guidelines" that are already in existence.
Some are voluntary standards, others are regulations. This manual should not be construed
as a new set of standards to be followed by the

facility. The facility's own policies and procedures are the basic standards by which its QA
program should be built and functions judged
and monitored. In accordance with Quality Improvement principles, those &cility standards (Policies and Procedures) should continuously be scrutinized and improved upon.
The authors would like to express their gratitude
to all those who have assisted in the preparation
of this manual who are, literally, too numerous to
name individually: the manufacturers who s u p

plied materials and reviewed drafts of individual
sections; dialysis facilities that provided infonnation on their quality assurance programs; physicians, nurses, administrators, and technicians who
provided personal experiences; the regulatory agencies, networks, and other governmental entities that
provided input; and the professional organizations
and voluntary standards associations.
It is our hope that this manual will provide a means
to assist all dialysis facilitiesin improving the quality
of renal care.

Background

Chapter 1

GENERAL
The ultimate purpose of this publication-Quality
Assurance Guidelines for H e d i a l y s i s Devices-is
to provide generic quality assurance and quality
control procedures for each type of equipment used
in an End Stage Renal Disease facility.
The US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
a history of encouraging the development of quality assurance (QA) programs in facilities that use
medical devices. Wherever medical devices are used,
QA profla& should be established to ensure that
the devices are properly used and maintained.
Incorporating effective QA programs into hemodialysis facilities helps assure safe and effective therapy.

Quality assurance may be defined as those actions that provide adequate confidence that a
facility will administer consistently high-quality
policies, procedures, and practices.

In 1984, the FDA awarded four contracts to study
the practice of hemodialysis. The contractors were
the Health Departments of Ohio, California, Massachusetts, and District of Columbia. Results from
these studies and data from the FDA's Device Experience Network (DEN) system suggest that the
quality of dialysis treatment could be improved by
increasing the utilization of quality assurance in
several areas:
the treatment of water and in the design, operation, and maintenance of water systems;
the handling and dilution of concentrates;
the reuse of disposable components
the operation and maintenance of dialysis delivery systems;
the practice of Universal Precautions to control
the spread of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV);

Quality control, as it relates to medical devices, comprises monitoring, testing, and maintenance.

other areas including patient care, patient education (including home dialysis patients), personnel training, and adequate record keeping.

Qualityadministration comprises management
actions taken to guarantee that quality control
procedures are performed properly, their results
analyzed, and appropriate corrective measures
taken.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH&a component of the FDA-has had an
educational program geared toward the safe and
effective use of medical devices in hemodialysis facilities. CDRH believes that the overall safety and
effectiveness of the hemodialysis process will be
improved if facilities voluntarily establish and implement QA programs.

Hemodialysis, a therapeutic process in which several medical devices are used, has been an area of
focus for the FDA for many years. In 1978, the
FDA began a study of the problems associated with
dialysis devices, resulting in a report that discussed
the problems associated with all aspects of the system. The FDA's interest continued with active participation in the Association for the Advancement
ofMedica1 Instrumentation (AAMI), Renal Disease
and Detoxification Committee, resulting in voluntary American National Standards for hemodialysis devices.

Assurance Guidelines

The CDRH contracted to have this publicationQuality Assurance Guidelinesfor Hernodialysis Devices-developed and written as guidelines for establishing quality assurance programs in hemodialysis facilities. These guidelines can be helpful in
optimizing patient care and controlling the spread
of infectious diseases in dialysis facilities. This
publication covers the information required to ensure that appropriate equipment is specified, pur-

Hernodialysis Devices

chased, operated, calibrated, and maintained prop
erly, and that administrative controls are effedively
exearted,the&ycmsminga&and~h~
process.
In a typical hemodialysis facility, the various pieces
ofequipment can be grouped accordingto use,namely:

L Water treatment equipment;

2 Equipment to monitor operation of the water
treatment system;
3. Equipment to evaluate the acceptability of the
dialysate concentrate;
4. Dialysate delivery equipment with its associated
monitors and alarms;

5. Extracorporeal blood components (including blood
access, blood tubing, blood pumps (if appropriate), infusion pumps, and airRoam detectors);

7. Dialyzer reprocessing and testing equipment;

8. Any other equipment associated with the dialysis procedure.
Each piece of equipment requires written quality
control procedures that include maintenance and
calibration procedures. The procedures should include:
1. Selecting appropriate parameters to monitor;

2. Selecting and specifying measurement techniques
(electronic, or manual);

3. Determining appropriate intervals a t which to
monitor (continuous or periodic).
These procedures need to be accomplished periodically to ensure that equipment operates in accordance with the manufacturers' specifications. Some
of the necessary written procedures, particularly
for maintenance and calibration, may accompany
the equipment when it is received from the manufacturer. However, these may need to be modified
and additional procedures may have to be developed for a particular hemodialysis facility. Specific
facility procedures may be needed because:
1. The circumstance of use of the equipment are
unusual (application or type of patient);

2. The equipment is used in conjunction with other
equipment from another manufacturer;
3. Qualifications, credentialling, or training of personnel differ from facility to facility;
4. The original accompanying procedures may be
inadequate (unclear, not detailed enough, too
detailed, etc.).

OWRVIEW OF RECENT
ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPANTS
IN QUALITY ASSURANCE
Over the years, there have been a number of Quality Assurance and Quality Control activities undertaken. Among the entities involved are: the
manufacturers, the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations (JCAHO), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA), the ESRD Networks, and
the facilities themselves. Briefly, the contribution
of each:

Manufacturers
The manufacturers are responsible for complying
with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations enforced by the FDA These regulations include: written procedures, validation of procedures,
monitoring of performance, documentation of results, review of records, and action implementation. The GMP regulation is intended to assure
that the manufacturer produces devices that are
safe and effective and otherwise compliant with
the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The
GMP regulation is described in the Code of Federal
Regulations, Title 21, Part 820, Good Manufacturing Practice for Medical Devices. The GMP is intended to ensure that devices are fit for their intended use. The device GMP is primarily concerned
with the quality of conformance of a device; that is,
the extent to which a device conforms with its design specifications.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Association for the Advancement of
Medical Instrumentation ( A m )

Food and Drug Administration

AAMI, a volunteer organization, also assisted significantly in improving the quality assurance and
quality control of dialysis facilities. Since 1980,
AAMI has introduced and published.

The FDA has also been extremely active in assisting, investigating, and ensuring the safety of medical devices through several programs.

The American National Standards for Hemodialysis Systems, which includes standards for concentrate for hemodialysis, hemodialysis systems
equipment, water treatment equipment, dialysate supply systems, and monitors of the blood
circuit.
The AAMI Recommended Practice for Reuse of
Hemodialyzers (incorporated by reference into
the Code of Federal Regulations in 1987).
Standards for First Use Hemodialyzers.
Standards for Hemodialyzer Blood Tubing.
AAMI continues to update and r e h e these standards on an ongoing basis. AAMI also provides a
variety of educational resource materials, training
sessions, technology analysis and review sessions,
and workshops several times yearly. For the past
several years, AAMI has, a t least once per year,
provided courses on hemodialyzer reuse and on water
quality for hemodialysis.

Joint Commission on Accreditation

(JCAHO)

(FDA)

The Investigation of Risks and Hazards Associated with Medical Devices. This report
is a result of a study performed under contract
by the Fkgional Kidney Disease Program in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Published in 1980, this
study reviewed water purification, concentrate
used for dialysate preparation, dialysate delivery systems, access to recirculation, blood tubing and accessories,blood pumps, infusion pumps
for anticoagulation, airifoam detectors, dialyze n , and the reuse of dialyzers.
Hemodialysis System Investigation Reports:.
As noted earlier, in late 1984, the FDA issued
contracts which resulted in Hemodialysis System Investigation Reports from California, the
District of Columbia, Massachusetts, and Ohio.
These contractors reported that serious problems existed in various areas of current hemodialysis practice: water treatment systems; dialysate delivery systems and dialysate concentrate;
dialyzers; extracorporeal blood circuits; reuse of
disposables;orientation training programs of staff;
qualification and experience of patient care s W ,
manufacturers' literature; and home dialysis
patients. The recommendations were comprehensive for each area studied.

J C A H 0 - a non-governmental organization primarily involved with accreditation of hospitals--has also
had impact on dialysis facilities in that all dialysis
facilities who are a department of hospitals have
been inspected according to JCAHO "Special Care
Unitsncriteria. Additionally, JCAHO has begun to
require implementation of, and to insped for, incorporation of the "10-Step Process" for quality assurance programs in dialysis facilities, as well as in
other specialty areas within hospitals. Chapter
Two, The Basics of Quality Assurance, provides
the reader with details of this process.

Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

Educational Projects. Over the past several
years, the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health Office of Training and Assistance has,
with the assistance of the manufacturers and
several other professional groups, produced educational materials and video tapes including Human
Factors in Hemodiulysis, Water Treatment in
Hemodialysis, Infection Control for Hemodialysis, and Repmssing of Hemodialyzers. Facilities have enthusiastically received these materials, and the importance of the issues handled
therein certainly have been underscored. The
Office of Training and Assistance also published
A Manual on Water Treatment for Hemodialysis
early in 1990.

Other FDA Activities: The FDA also gathers
information through other programs such as the
Problem Reporting Program (PRP) and the Medical Device Reporting Program (MDR). The FDA
is also able to provide important feedback through
the Device Experience Network regarding all of
the device related problems mentioned above.

Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
Since the early 1970's, the CDC has conducted surveillance of hepatitis in hernodialysis centers. Through
a cooperative effort with HCFA, the CDC has been
able to determine and report the frequency with
which hepatitis and other infectious diseases occur
over time, factors associated with the occurrence
of these diseases, and the effect various infection
control measures have had in preventing transmission of disease in hemodialysis.

As a result of these surveillance efforts, the CDC
established initial recommendations for control
measures for hepatitis-B (HBV) in dialysis centers.
Issued in November, 1977, the measures focused
on: serologic testing, record keeping, staff and patient education, control and prevention, housekeep
ing and sterilization, and disinfection. These recommendations have been continuously updated and
revised to reflect current technological practice and
new problems.
The CDC's approach has been to educate and monitor, reporting their findings, each year to the nephrology community. Networks and other organizations adopted the CDC recommendations as standards encouraging facility compliance. As a result,
these precautions, when employed, have demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence of
HBV infection.
The CDC has M h e r developed their infection control
recommendations to include HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Utilizing lessons learned from
the dialysis field, the CDC issued the current Universal Precautions for all areas of health care. Because use of serologic testing for HIV is not universally employed, the CDC has focused on the education of all health care workers in the application of
Universal Precautions.

Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA)
By definition, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) administers the Medicare funds
for reimbursement of End Stage Renal Disease treatc
ment. An important aspect of that function is assuring quality and appropriateness of care associated with that treatment.

In the final rulemaking for the End Stage Renal
Disease (ESRD) program, the June 3, 1976, Federal Register described the further conditions of
coverage of suppliers of ESRD services:
These Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) regulations (Part 405 of Chapter N of
Title 42 Subpart U) established the initial standards by which facilities would be allowed to provide services to ESRD patients: network membership; compliance with federal, state, and local laws
and regulations; governing body and management;
patient care planning (long term and short term);
patient rights and responsibilities;medical records;
physical environment; director and staff qualifications; and minimal service requirements.
These conditions of coverage, as interpreted by
HCFA, are used by the state and federal surveyors to evaluate dialysis facilities. These federal standards have been the only guide for all subsequent
quality assurance activities undertaken.

Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA)
During the past three years OSHA regulationshave
also had a direct impact on dialysis facilities:
In December of 1987 OSHA published a Final Rule
on Occupational Exposure to Formaldehyde which
includes exposure limits, required monitoring, regulated areas, emergency procedures, medical surveillance, special record keeping requirements, communications with and training of employees, and
other actions.
Additionally, OSHA has published a Notice of Proposed Rule Making regarding Occupational Expo-

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

sure to HIV and HBV. The final rule is to be published in the very near future.
OSHA's Hazard CommunicationStandardalsorecphs
employers to provide information to their employees
about hazardous chemicals used in the work place.

End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
Networks
In June, 1976, the final ESRD regulations included
a mandate to the Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW) to regulate health care being
provided to persons with ESRD. In order to monitor and regulate the care provided to these patients, the ESRD Networks were established with
the mandate that each Network was to organize its
own medical review program. Some changes have
occurred since that time, but the Network functions established by HCFA are primarily to:

End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
Facilities
As the reader will note from the above, dialysis facilities have had to not only learn and grow with
the technological advancements in the field, but
also comprehend and apply the various standards,
guidelines, and recommendations put forth.

Facilities tend to be eager for information, forms,
models andlor programs that will help them with
all aspects of quality assurance. It is the intention
of this manual, Quality Assurance Guidelines for
Hernodialysis Devices, to fill some of that need.

Develop Network goals for placing patients in
settings for selfcare and transplantation;

OVERVIEW OF PROBLEMS
AND INCIDENTS

Encourage the use of medically appropriatetreati
ment settings most compatible with patient rehabilitation;

The past few years have seen an increase in the
concern that quality of care be maintained as the
basic cornerstone of dialysis delivery.

Develop criteria and standards relating to the
quality and appropriateness of patient care;

Events that have seriously jeopardized patient safety
in several different dialysis facilities have occurred
during the past three to four years. These incidents have focused attention on the absolute necessity of completely competent, well-trained, medical, nursing, and technical staffs, and on well-designed use of today's technology and diligent quality assurance programs. Occasionally,incidents have
occurred during this time that have received national media (newspapers, magazines, national television) exposure:

Evaluate the procedures used by facilitiesin assessing patients for placement in appropriate treatment modalities;
Make recommendations to member facilities as
needed to achieve Network goals;
Conduct on-site reviews of facilities as necessary;
I.

cific QA programs. This effort continues to be a
priority for Networks.

Collect, validate, and analyze data.

Each Network has functioned independently of the
. others allowing considerable autonomy and creativity to best meet the HCFA requirements as well
as community need. A significant amount of focus
for the Networks has been those technical aspects
attracting national attention; i.e., water treatment,
infection control, dialyzer reuse, et cetera.

In late September 1987,44 patients in one facility were treated for hemolysis due to chloramine
contamination of dialysate. It was later found
that facility staff lacked adequate information
regarding water treatment and water treatment
system planning. Furthermore, inadequate staff
monitoring, and an overall lack of ongoing performance appraisal contributed to this incident.

In 1984, the HCFA specified that each Network
would encourage the development of facility spe-

A few months later, a serious incident occurred
where injectable lidocaine was confksed with

mannitol. In this incident, one patient died and
another was seriously injured. Proper storage
and labeling techniques, as well a s protocols for
administration of medication, among other issues, were implicated
In early 1989, patient injury occurred when a
germicide and preservative (sodium azide) was
not completely removed tiom a component of a
water beatrnent system (ultrafilter). In this case,
again, improper design and use, as well as inadequate training and monitoring were involved.
In mid-1989,36+ patients were treated for metabolic acidosis in a dialysis facility when acid dialysate concentrate was used with dialysis delivery systems in the acetate mode. The machines were all functioning according to specifications, but the pre-dialysis safety checks specified by the manufacturer were not performed,
and other gaps in quality assurance and quality
control contributed to this incident.
During these periods, the Centers for Disease Control and other federal agencies investigated scores
of other similar incidents which did not appear in
the media: bacterial contamination of water treatment systems, pyrogen reactions, HIV and HBV
exposure, problems with improper use of dialysate
concentrate, other contaminations of water treatment systems and water storage. The list is long

and serious. Further, during this same period of
time, the controversy regarding the reuse of
hemodialyzers continued, and this has been reviewed often in the media.
Appendix A provides the reader the opportunity
to review the hundreds of other incidents that
have occurred in recent years related to device
malfunction. More oRen than not, these were
related to improper use, improper user training,
improper preventative maintenance, and other
issues normally monitored and corrected by a
quality assurance program.
The combination of all of these factors has drawn
significant national attention from the public, legislature, regulatory agencies, and even dialysis
facilities, and health care professionals. The importance of strong and effective quality assurance
programs in an effort to enhance safety and reduce the risk of these sorts of incidents is on
everyone's mind.
Please note that most of the following chaptirs in
this manual, Quality Assurance Guidelines for
Hemodialysis Devices, contain a section on adverse incidents--both pre-1980, as well a s incidents found in the FDA's Medical Device Reporting files. These are offered to the readers as
background for consideration as to whether or
not such incidents could occur in their facility.

Chapter 2

The Basics of
Quality Assurance

DEFINITION

gates the responsibility of conducting the QA activities to a committee.

Quality assurance is a cyclical process by which
problems and opportunities for improvement are
identified and analyzed, solutions are developed and
implemented, and reassessment occurs. If the cycle
is not completed, that is, if only the assessment
component takes place, quality assurance (QA) will
not occur (see Figure 1).

2. Form a oommittee. Committee members should

include the dialysis unit's medical director, head
nurse, chief technician, dietitian, and social worker.
If the unit is very large and has multiple shifts,
the charge nurses responsible for each shift must
be included. When a QA coordinator is employed
or a staff nurse is assigned the position on a
part-time basis, that person should be involved
and attend each QA committee meeting.

QUALITY ASSURANCE METHODS
Many hemodialysis facilities have successfidly developed and implemented quality assurance programs. Some use quality assurance methods that
they have developed themselves, modifying various
models and plans; some use the Joint Commission
on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' tenstep process for monitoring and evaluation; while a
few use specific models developed by other people,
including Carolyn Smith-Marker's, "Unit-Based Quality Assurance Model."
In this manual, the quality assurance cycle previously described, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' (JCAHO) ten
step process for monitoring and evaluation, the SmithMarker model for quality assurance, and Deming's
continuous improvement concepts are offered to facilitate a comprehensive examination of quality for
the hemodialysis facility. It is recommended that
the references listed at the end of this chapter be
used to provide more comprehensive assistance with
QA programming.

Committee members must be those individuals
that have the authority to make decisions and
implement the necessary actions to assure correction of a problem. A chairperson for the committee must be elected or appointed. The position is usually assigned to the head nurse or
someone who can carry out the various coordinating activities involved.
3. Develop a plan. A plan must describe the
facility's QA program purpose and goals. The
plan should include the scope of the QA program, how to achieve the purpose and goals that
are outlined, and the mechanisms to be used.

The plan also delineates the organization, responsibility and authority of the QA program:
who is to be involved in the QA program, committee membership, the reporting mechanism,
and the ultimate authority responsible for the
QA program for the facility (see Figure 2).
4. Organize and meet. The committee must or-

ganize itself and educate members who are not
familiar with the QA process. The appropriate
resources need to be provided, such as articles,
books, and educational programs.

JCAHO 10-Step Process for
Monitoring and Evaluation

Once organized and prepared, the committee must
meet. To assure a continuous monitoring process and commitment to improving quality, the
committee should meet on a monthly basis.

A Getting Started
1. Assign responsibility, The governing body of
the facility is the ultimate authority responsible
for the QA program. The governing body dele-

5. Minutes. Minutes of all QA committee meetings must be written and handled in a confiden-

Quality Assumnce Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

tial manner and should be maintained in a file
that is not within public access. It is highly recommended that each QA committee review their
specific state statute pertaining to the confidentiality of the QA committee minutes.

B. Define Scope of Care
In the first step, critical indicators of care are developed d e h i n g the scope of care provided by the
facility. Table 1provides an example list describing the scope of care in a hemodialysis unit This
list was developed by using the brainstorming technique to answer a number of questions:
1. lSpes of patients served. What are the characteristics of the patient population, such as age,
residence, ethnicity, length of time on dialysis,
or other unique characteristics?
2 Conditions and diagnoses treated. Are specific types of renal diseases treated? Are the
patients' conditions medically complex? Are the
patients all paraplegic? Diabetics? Hepatitis
positive? Do the patients have multiple healthcare problems?

3. Services provided. What treatments or activities are performed in the dialysis unit? All of
the activities that go into the hemodialysis p m ess should be listed: patient orientation, vascular access care, venipuncture, heparinization,
equipment maintenance, reuse, water treatment,
infection control, environmental control, environmental safety, et cetera.
4 The types of practitioners providing care.
Who are the people involved in the care of the
end stage renal disease patient in the dialysis
unit?

5. Sites where the care is provided. Is this an
outpatient facility? An in-hospital facility? Or
an outpatient clinic associated with the hospital? Is it a freestanding facility? Or is it home
dialysis?
6. Times when
is provided. Are there different shifts available for patients?

C. Identify Important Aspects of Care
The next step is to identify the important aspects
of care. These are the things that we do that are
most important. Consider these three aspects:

1. The aspect occum frequently or affects a
large number of patients. In a facility this
particular factor is very important There are a
number of things done that affect large numbers
of patients. Examples include: the hemodialysis
procedure itself; water treatment; reuse; and
venipuncture.

2. .Patientsa m at risk of serious consequences
or a m deprived of substantial benefit if the
care is not provided comtly, in a timely
fashion or as properly indicated. In other
words, if the hemodialysis treatment is not provided adequately or properly the patients may
suffer the serious consequences of uremia or be
put a t risk for other injury.
3. The aspect of care has tended in the past

to produce problems for staff and patients.
In the hemodialysis unit this may include infection control, water treatment, venipuncture, et
cetera. HBV and HIV pose numerous problems
for both staff and patients. Venipuncture is another aspect of care that has produced problems
for both patients and s t . .
High volume, high risk and problem prone areas
that have been identified must be considered the
most important aspects of care and require ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

D. Identzfy Indicators
Indicators are chosen directly from those aspects of
care that have been identified as being most important. Using these indicators, important aspects can then be monitored and evaluated on an
ongoing basis.
Among the indicators that are finally chosen, the
most current standards and regulations, as outlined in Table 2, must be included. Rather than
monitoring each specific entity of a regulation or
standard, only those that are most important and
have direct impact upon a patient should be selected. The monitoring process should be both broad
and selective to provide an overview of the entire
scope of facility operations.

An indicator may also come from the unit's policy
and procedure manual. Policies and procedures that
are current with regulations and standards and
are up-to-date with all the equipment and supplies
used in the unit, can serve as an immediate resource for developing indicators.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

2-2

To be comprehensive in this process, the QA committee should monitor a mix of structure, process,
and outcome indicators.
staructure is that which holds the organization

together; i.e., policies, building structure, equipment.

process is that which is performed or provided
by the facility; i.e., the performance of procedures; and,

outcome,the end result of what has been done.
All staff, if not directly involved in the identification of indicators, must be informed and have an
opportunity for input. Monitoring instruments will
be most successll if all staff participate in the
development of and are aware of indicator expectations. Examples of monitoring instruments designed according to these guidelines and the additional information presented below are included in
many of the chapters in this manual, Quality Assumnce Guidelines for H e d i a l y s i s Devices.

E. Establish Thresholds for
Compliance
As indicators are identified and monitoring instruments are developed, the committee must establish thresholds by which the compliance level is
expected. A threshold is simply that percentage of
compliance with the indicators that you expect to
find when monitoring the activities of your facility.
It is recommended that a threshold for action begin at 85%. While highly desirable, a 10Wo threshold is not recommended a t first. Compliance of
100% is not necessarily achievable in the beginning stages of monitoring. Begin at 85% and work
towards continuous improvement.

F. Collect and Analyze the Data
After the indicators have been identified, thresholds established and the monitoring instrument
has been developed, the sources of information that
will be needed should be identified. Table 3 desrribes where a variety of information might be
found. It is important to keep in mind that the
SOUmes must match the required data and that
there are multiple sources already available in the
dialysis unit.

The collection process is also very important. Data
~llectionor the gathering of information must be

conducted in an accurate and speedy manner. The
collection process includes the identification of the
indicator to be monitored, an assignment of the
staff person to do that monitoring, and the appropriate space and time provided. The staff person
should not try to care for a patient at the same
time heishe is reviewing activities of their coworkers or trying to conduct a chart audit.
Once the monitoring activity has been completed
and the data collected, it must be displayed in such
a way as to ensure that the QA committee can read
i t and accurately interpret the findings. Displaying the data is another difficult task to complete;
the Problem Tracking Form shown in Figure 3 can
accurately track problems over time and display
the results of the QA monitoring activities.

G. Evaluate the Results
Problems identified by the monitoring activities (ie.,
failure to achieve expected compliance threshold)
must be analyzed. In some cases, there may not be
a clearly defined problem It is important, however, to assure that areas for improvement are acted
upon. There may be problems that are readily solved.
These actions should be implemented quickly. Some
problems may be extremely complex and long term
in resolution. Decision making must focus on those
pieces of the problem that will have a direct impact upon patient safety. A threat to patient safety
must be tackled swiftly. When time permits, the
oommittee must carefully review the remainingpieces
of the problem.

As problems are identified through monitoring, it
is important that the QA committee document or
"track" the identified problems. One method is
the use of a Problem Tracking Form (Figure 3). By
noting the problems on a tracking form, the committee will be able to track a specific problem, the
activities required, and the person responsible for
assuring that the solution is implemented. Each
time the QA committee reviews the status of a
problem, a notation of the review date should be
made on the form. The detailed committee discussion relating to the problem can be noted in the
minutes. Until the problem is resolved, the committee should make similar notations on the form
a t each meeting. When the problem is finally resolved, the problem can be removed from the form.
Note, however, that the past forms should be retained in the minutes of the QA committee meetings.

H. Develop Solutions to Problems and
Take Action
Analysis of the problems or areas for improvement
will generate solutions. It is important to consider
the best solution. What is its value? Is it cost
effective? Is it feasible to implement? Are resources readily available to implement this solution? And, will the solution be accepted by staff
and patients alike? StafF and patient involvement
must be considered in the development of solutions.

A plan of action must be developed by identifying
the steps involved in implementing the solution. A
target date for implementation and reevaluation
must also be determined. The person responsible
for implementing that solution must be aware of
the expectations, responsibility, and authority required to carry out the plan. The plan must then
be implemented. If the solution is not implemented
and if all activity stops at this point, the problem
will not be resolved and the assurance of quality
will not occur.

I. Reassess
Reassessment and documentation of improvement
is required to "bring the QA loop to a closen (see
Figure 1). This occurs &r the solution has been
given enough time to make a change or to correct a
problem The reassessment monitoring instrument
should not be significantly different from the one
used to identi@ the original problem. Through follow-up monitoring activity, the QA committee will
be able to determine if the problem has been solved.
The monitoring process should be continued over a
period of time to assure sustained resolution.

J. Communicate
The results of all QA activities need to be communicated to all dialysis staff. It is not enough that
the head nurse, the medical director and the chief
technician and possibly the administrator decide
what to do about certain problems that they have
identified. Further, when problems are resolved
andlor improvement opportunities are acted upon
and resolved, the staff must be made aware of the
outcome and they must be congratulated on a job
well done.

The process described for monitoring and evaluation includes the assignment of responsibility, dehing
scope of care, identifying important aspects of care,
identifyng key indicators, establishing thresholds
for evaluation, collecting and organizing data, evaluating care, taking action, assessing and documenting improvement, and communicating relevant information.

Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Program: The Smith-Marker"UnitBased Quality Assurance Model"
A comprehensive QA program involves all aspects
of unit activity and integrates each under one
"umbrellan. A comprehensive QA program includes
nine activities: development of standards, staff eredentialing, performance appraisal, risk management,
utilization review, concurrent monitoring, continuous and focused monitoring, active problem identification, and continuing education.

A Development of Standards
This includes the use of the professional standards
of practice for medicine, nephrology nursing, social
workers, renal dietitians, and technicians. Federal
and state regulations also form the standards for
many of the technical activities and structural aspects in the dialysis unit.

B. Staff Credentialing
Staff credentialing, by either a professional license
or certification, is an important means of screening
personnel. It provides an assurance that the individual is capable of providing a recognized level of
skill and expertise. This means that for all staff,
where licensure or certification are appropriate, the
dialysis unit administration must assure that the
documentation is current and maintained according to state laws.
Other types of certification renewal or credentialling
are also important to validate and maintain on file.
For example, all direct patient care stafF should be
certified for cardiopulmonaryresuscitation, continu-

~ualib
Assurance Guidelines for Henodialysis Devices

ing education requirements, preventive back care
orientation, hazardous materials communication,
and other programs required by facility policy.

G. Retrospective monitoring

Performance appraisal must flow from the role description and the QA program. Standards of practice, the role description and the performance appraisal process must tie together and create one
unified method of evaluating professional employee
behavior.

Monitoring retrospectively focuses on that which
has already occurred.Information found in the medical record is most commonly used for retrospective
monitoring. Infection control, special problem focused studies, kinetic modeling, outcome monitoring, mortality review, infections, vascular access
problems, and technical audits can all be performed
retrospectively. There are a number of retrospective monitoring instruments included throughout
this manual.

D. Risk management

H. Active problem identification

Risk management is focused on financial liability
awareness. Risk management activities include
disaster planning, infection surveillance and control, the use of universal precautions, facility structural aspeds such as handrails on the walls and
non-skid floors in the unit. The informed consent
process is also a risk management activity, along
with patient relations, incident reporting, adverse
occurrence reporting, safety and hazardous materials education, and a grievance process for the facility.

Active problem identification flows from the results
of monitoring activities: staff credentialing, performance appraisal, risk management, utilization review, concurrent monitoring, and retrospective monitoring, with the addition of comments and prob
lems presented by patients, s t . , and management
personnel.

C. Performance appraisal

An up-to-date policy and procedure manual is also
an important component of risk management. A
well written manual ensures that the policies and
procedures expected to be used in the delivery of
services follow all current standards, guidelines,
and regulations.

I. Continuing education
Continuing education should focus on the problems
that are identified. Continuing education should
come from and focus on those problems or opportunities for improvement that have been identified
through the ongoing monitoring and evaluation
process.

E. Utilization review

Quality Control

When examining utilization factors related to the
dialysis facility, the QA committee may focus on
repeat dialyses, unscheduled acutes, emergency room
visits, blood utilization, and medication administration.

Control is the process of regulating an adivity to
verify its conformance to a standard. Quality control (QC) is the process for those activities that
measure a product's performance. Quality control
is an important component of quality assurance.

F. Concurrent monitoring

In the hemodialysis unit, the purpose of QC is to
assure that the equipment/devices used are safe
and effective. This goal is met by the application of
a cyclic process; that is, by establishing standards,
measuring performance, and correcting deviations.

Concurrent monitoring is the process of observing
what is happening at the time of its occurence. Examples of this include: observing staff or patients
perform procedures; querying patient satisfaction
or a patient's sense of quality of life; reviewing
treatment and care outcomes, especially functional
*tuS. There are a number of concurrent monitoring instruments included throughout this manual.

A major aspect of quality control is reliability. Rt+
liability is the ability of the product to perform its
intended function over a period of time. A product
that "worksn as it is designed, without mechanical

failure or errors, for a long period of time is a reliable one.
There are four aspects of reliability:
1. The device will not fail during a particular time;
i.e., during dialysis.
2. The device is able to perform those applications
for which it has been designed and as it is expected to perform, i.e., accurately prepare, monitor and deliver dialysate.

3. The device's W e expectancy" is known, and the
device lasts as long as expected.

4. The device will function in an appropriate environment.

Maintenance of all equipment has an important
role in assuring reliability. When maintenance is
performed according to the manufacturer's guide
lines or facility policies and procedures it may save
the dialysis unit substantial dollars in costly repair
or replacement work. Preventative maintenance
also assures a safe and adequate dialytic therapy.
Periodic monitoring and evaluation are required
for prevention programs. They are essential to determine whether or not the equipment is operating
satisfactorily. These periodic monitoring activities
simply review the operation of the device in much
the same manner as monitoring the medical record
or personnel performance. They should be scheduled and performed by the technical personnel who
know how to operate the equipment. The results
of the monitoring activity are, of course, written
and circulated within the dialysis program.

C. Correcting Deviations
Each measurement taken must be evaluated against
an existing standard. These standards may be
found in the manufacturer's literaturdrecornmendations for use or other sources as described in
Table 2. When a deviation from the standard OCcurs,the problem must be analyzed and corrected.

Throughout this manual a number of quality control instruments, procedures and measures will be
described. It is important that quality control be
incorporated into the facility's quality assurance
PW-.

Continuous Improvement Concepts:
Deming's Principles
"Quality must be built into a product or service, it
cannot be inspected in." (Deming, 1982). The t h e
ory of continuous improvement is crucial for successful dialysis unit operations. The following is
offered for consideration in the development of a
facility QA program.
Key points for improving quality:
Top to bottom organizational consistency of purpose towards improvement of senrice.
Find problems. It is our job to work continually
on the system--towardscontinual improvement.
Eliminatk inspections and substitute meaningful measures of quality.
Take immediate action to remove barriers to gualih
service.

A. Establishing Standards
Throughout this manual, standards that are pertinent to the components or devices discussed in each
chapter have been identified. In relatively few cases
do dialysis personnel need to develop new standards. The vast number and scope of standards
and regulations that already exist must be used
(See Table 2).

Institute long-rangeplanning, cease focus on shortterm profits.

B. Measuring Performance

Make use of practical statistical techniques and
tools (control charts, flow diagrams, run charts,
etc.) to facilitate learning and action.

Equipmentldevice performance measurements are
performed pre-dialysis (pH, conductivity, dialysate
flow rate, temperature), during dialysis (blood flow
rate, heparin infusion rate, volumetric controlled
fluid removal rate), and during maintenance and
repair procedures (ohms, volts, amps, flow rates).

Eliminate barriers between staff groups; substitute team work.
Introduce modem training methods.

Recognize achievement.
The careful integration and implementation of various models and methods of quality assurance will
promote and enhance the high quality of care.

fkmsingonpl.c331emsthatomuredwitheachcomponent

Prior to the 1970ts,chronichemodiaysiswas performed
using tap water to prepare the dialysate. In these
early days, medical instability of the chronic renal
failure patient in combination with the multiple
problems related to other components of the dialysis
therapy tended to mask problems that may have
been due to impurities in the tap water.

As the practice of hemodialysis progressed and the
equipment and other apparatusinvolved in the therapy
improved, it became apparent that various chemical
and microbiological contaminants present in tap
water were indeed responsible for a number of the
deleterious effects seen in the chronic hemodialysis
population. Table 1A presents a list of the most
common contaminantsfound in tap water, and Table
1B presents the clinical effects related to these
contaminants.
Today, virtually all chronic hemodialysis facilities
in the United States employ some type of water
treatment system to purify water before using it to
produce dialysate.
Water treatment systems are a combination of a
variety of components, each with varying roles and
effectiveness in removing contaminants commonly
present in drinking water. Table 2 briefly reviews
the most common water treatment system components
used for producing purified water for hemodialysis.
In 1989 the FDA produced and released a videotape
entitled Water Treatment in Hemdialysis and in
1990 a manual entitled A Manual on Water Treatment for Hemdialysis Both have been distributed
to all dialysis facilities in the United States.

Literature review from 1980 through 1989 and the
more recent MDR files indicate the followingadditional
incidenwproblem areas:
Inadequate removal of aluminum in the water
purification process for dialysis, resulting in
aluminum-inducedfracturing osteodystrophy and
dialysis dementia.

2. The second set of guidelines is contained in the

American National Standards for Hemodialysis
Systems (AAMI: RD5-1981). In this document
the standards are related to the manufacturer
and to the user. A summary of the standards
for the manufacturers is found in Table 3 and a
summary of the standardsfor the user is contained
in Table 4. Recommendations to enable users to
achieve the standards are summarized in Table
5.

Bacteremia and pyrogen reactions, resulting from
improper placement of water heater "downstreamn
of reverse osmosis.
Contamination of water used for the reuse of
dialyzers with non-tuberculous micobacterium,
due to inadequate design andlor disinfection of
water treatment system and distribution piping.
Ethylene glycol intoxication, due to accidental
attachment of air conditioning system to dialysis
water treatment system.
Nitrate induced anemia in a home dialysis patient,
due to inadequate water treatment (sohner only).
Metabolic acidosis, due to improper water bwdment
and low pH of purified water.
Pseudomonas stutzeri bacteremia and pyrogen
reactions, due to contamination of deionizers.
Generation of dimethylnitmsamine (a carcinogen)
in mixed-bed deionizer, due to non-use of precarbon filter.

3. The third standard, in the Code of Federal Regulations 42 CFR Part 405.2150, is related to reuse
of hemodialyzers and other dialysis supplies.
This section adopts, by reference, the AAMI
Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers. Table 6 summarizes this standard.

4. The fourth guideline is the Safety Alert issued
by the Food and Drug Administration (FDASthat
issued recommendations regarding chloramines
and their removal (February 19, 1988). This
document states that the use of granular activated
filters for removal of chloramines should include
the following

Accidental over-fluoridation of municipal (tap)
water combined with inadequate monitoring of
deionization, resulting in use of exhausted tanks
and subsequent toxic patient reactions (including
death) from fluoride contamination.
Many ofthe incidents could have been avoided through
routine testing, observations, a more thorough
understanding of water treatment, proper system
design, and quality control procedures. Although
only a few of these incidents resulted in patient
death, almost all had the potential to cause death.

m T I N G GUIDELINES
There are four standards/guidelines pertaining to
water for dialysis purposes:
1. The Code of Federal Regulations 42 CFR Subpart
U, Part 405.2140 (a) (5) states that Water used
for dialysis purposes is analyzed periodically and

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

a Whenever a change is made in the exisiting
water treatment system, ascertain the capacity
of the carbon filter to cope with that change
by consulting with a water treatment engineer,
contractor, or consultant who is experienced
in the operation of hernodialysis water treatment
systems. This is to assure that the maximum
expected level of chloramines from the municipal
water supply can be effectively removed with
the carbon filter being used.
b. Use charcoal filters containinggranular activated
carbon (GAC) and replace rather than regenerate
the filters when exhausted. It is recommended
( W o m i a law requires) that the water treatment
system contain two carbon filters in series.
c. Test the water for chloramines as it exits the

first filter at least once per patient shift. If
the level of chloramines exceeds the 0.1 ppm
standard, there should be an immediate test
for the chloramine level in the water used to
prepare dialysate.

3-2

d. Establish a systematic plan for replacing the
filters as they become exhausted. With the
filters in series, the exhausted first filter can
be replaced with the second, and a new carbon
placed in the second position.
e. Whenever a carbon filter is replaced, disinfect

and thoroughly rinse the filter housing before
the new filter is installed.

QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR
WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS

Policies and Procedures
An essential facility quality assurance activity is
the development, writing, implementation, and evaluation of policies and procedures for the water treatment
system. All standards previously described must
be incorporated into these policies and procedures.
Specifically, the policies and procedures must address
the scope oftreatment, components and related equip
ment and monitors, and testing expectations.
Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationships of each component
of the water treatment system, as well as the various
related components, such as the dialyzer, delivery
system and patient. The risks involved must be
clearly identified and considered, and appropriate
safety measures and preventative systems developed.
Policies and procedures must also address safe and
effective operation of the water treatment system,
including
basic technical operation
use of the equipment
safety checks
preventative maintenance
cleaning and disinfection
scheduled monitoring
troubleshooting and repair
record keeping
patient monitoring.

Asswrance Guidelines

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should include all personnel
responsibilities for water treatment: supplies and
equipment, testingand monitoring, and other similar
responsibilities. Each responsibility should stem
from a specific policy or procedure.
StafFtraining should be a well-defined and organized
process. Content should be clearly defined for the
learner and be based on behavioral objectives. The
behavioral objectives can be used to accurately and
objectively measure learning. At the end of the
didactic session(s), the instructor should confirm
by a written test andlor return demonstration that
learning has occurred and that the learner is able
to perform the procedure(s) independently without
error. Documentation of testing results should be
placed in personnel files.

Comprehension of the purpose and function of each
component of the water treatment system requires
a basic understanding of normal physiological
concepts, as well as responses associated with uremia
and the hemodialysis therapy. Content should include
principles of dialysis and water treatment, patient
response to therapy and related complications, and
monitoring and evaluation. The interrelationships
of each system component, the delivery system,
dialysate, dialyzer, etc. must be incorporated into
the training process.
Need for further education, such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions, can be determined
from the routine quality assurance monitoring process
(see Form 1,'Water Treatment System Monitoring
Form", used for concurrent quality assurance
monitoring) and the ongoing staff performance
appraisal process. When problems are identified,
staff should be made aware of the problems and be
involved in their resolution. This nearly always
includes problem-specific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
verify that the individual has successfblly completed
the initial education and training program. The
medical director is also responsible for assuring that
an annualperformance evaluation has been performed.

Hernodialysis Devices

Monitoring and Evaluation

firms that water being delivered from the softener
is at acceptable limits at that time. Some experts
recommend, however, that post sohner hardness
also be tested a t the end of the treatment day in
order to confirm proper softener sizing and
regeneration protocols.

A Daily Monitoring
To continually confirm that water produced by the
system is suitable for hemodialysis purposes as well
as to confirm the integrity and proper functioning
of all system components, an aggressive monitoring
process must be followed. Form 2, Water Treatment
System hg,"provides a useable format 61-the mrding
of these data:

(Please note that this form is provided as a model

only; actuul content may need to be altered to f l the

specific system of the individual facility.)
1. Temperature: Daily confirmationof temperature
should be performed.

2. Pressure Monitoring: Monitoring of pressure levels
and pressure drops across components assures
proper operating conditions.
3. Softener timer check: In installations where a
timer is used to actuate automatic regeneration
of the water softener, a daily check of clock set
time should be performed.
4. Reverse osmosis feed flow and permeate flow:
Substantial reduction in product flow rate is an
indication that there may be problems with a
pretreatment component or the reverse osmosis
membrane may be degrading due to scaling or
other types of membrane failure associated with
inadequate pretreatment.

5. Feed water total dissolved solids CTDS), product
water TDS, percent rejection: AAMI Standards
state that (for new RO. systems) "percent rejection
should be continuouslymonitored." This provides
an indication of the condition of the RO. membranes
as well as helping monitor against any catastrophic
compromise in membrane integrity.

7. Chloraminestesting:Testingfor chlorarnines should
granularbe performed as the water exits the
activated carbon filter. Using the recommended
DPD (N. Ndiethyl-pphenylene diamine)method,
results should always be less than O.lmg;/L. If
chloramine levels exiting the first tank exceed
O.lmg/liter, a test of the effluent of the second
tank should be immediately performed. Dialysis
should not proceed if the water used for production
of dialysate contains more than 0.1 m&

8. Audit: The reader will note the final line a t the
bottom of the Water Treatment Log" indicates
"Auditn On a daily basis, someonewho is knowledge
able about the tests, measurements, and limits
for the water treatment monitoring, as well as
the acceptable limits set forth in the facility's
policies and procedures for each one of those
measurements, should review the results. The
person performing the tests should be aware of
the acceptable limits and should have performed
proper notification and taken appropriate action
if the testdmeasurements performed indicated
results outside of acceptable limits.

B. Monthly monitoring
1. Conductivity meters require recalibration monthly,
following the manufacturers recommendations.

2. Microbiological testing of system components and
the distribution system must be performed monthly
in the following manner:

The performance shall be such that the salt passage
rate (100% minus the rejection rate) does not
exceed two times the salt passage rate of the
equipment a t the time of its initial qualification.
Calculate the salt rejection by the following formula:

6. Post water softener hardness: The AAMI American
National Standard for Hemodialysis Systems also

recommends that post waters oftener hardness
be checked daily before dialysis begins. This con-

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

a Post cadmn filhtkm AAMI (American National
Standardsfor Hemsystems)recommends
that "carbon tanks be monitored for excess
bacterial levels." Although there is no standard
for bacterial levels exiting a carbon tank, very
high levels may indicate a load so high that
domtxeam components are unable to adequately
remove them.

b. Post reverse osmosis: If a reverse osmosis
system is used as a primary method for attaining
microbiologically acceptable water, bacterial
levels should be assessed immediately aRer
the R.O. to ascertain that this goal is being
achieved.

3-4

c Post storage tank:If a storage tank is used
in the water treatment system, bacterial levels
should be cultured directly from this tank in
order to ascertain proper tank design and
disinfection protocols.

d. Post deionize= If the deionizer is used without
reverse osmosis, or placed post reverse osmosis
without any downstream bacterial or endotoxin
protection (an ukdlter), midological integrity
of the effluent must be confirmed.
e. Post ultrafilter: If an ultrafilter is used as a

final bacteriaVendotoxin filter, integrity and
proper disinfection of the ultrafilter must also
be confirmed.

f End of "return loop": A sample should be
performed a t the end of the "return loop," if
used, a s a final measurement of bacterial
colonization anywhere in the system.

3. Any incident related to the water treatment system
should be handled immediately, and should be
included in monthly quality assurance meetings.

C. Patient Monitoring
The following monitoring activities relate to patient
response as it pertains to water treatment:
1. Routine blood chemistries may indicate improper
inorganic chemical concentrations or organic chemical contaminates.

2. Normal intra-dialytic monitoring of patients and
patient symptomology during the dialysis session
can also provide indications of chemical water
contamination. Symptoms seen with improper
water treatment are presented in Table lA

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient,
home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed by
the medical director, as appropriate.

E. Other Monitoring
' h e following water treatment system monitoring
should be performed on a t least a quarterly basis:
1. Safety supplies. All safety supplies related to
personnel handling of chemical toxins or biological
contaminants should be inspected.
I

2 Trend analysis. A trend analysis comparing
microbial monitoring and system fhction should

be performed. A tool for assisting the facility in
this activity is shown as Form 3.

F. Prevention
1. Audit recordkeeping procedures semiannually.

2. Policies and procedures related to water treatment
and water treatment equipment should be reviewed
annually.
3. Facility standards related to the water treatment
system should be reviewed annually.
4. Maintenance and repair logs related to the water
treatment system should be reviewed annually.

5. Any utility (water, drain, electricity)requirements
related to the water treatment system should be
reviewed annually.

G. Purchasing Guidelines
1. Establish quality specifications for all equipment

used.
2. Estimate quantity requirements; allow for future
growth and possible membrane degradation.

3. Cite applicable standards.

4. Require system validation by the vendor to assure
specifications are met.
5. Require the vendor to test for andfor disclose
adverse conditions/substancesthat may effed the
membrane.

6. R a p & a detailed manual for operation,maintenance,
monitoring, disinfection, and safety.

7. Evaluate need for service contract.
As mmmended by the Food and Drug Administration
in the February 19, 1988 Safety Alert, a qualified
water engineer or consultant familiar with the special
needs of dialysis facilities should be consulted when
designing or installing a new water treatment system
or changing an existing one. Whenever changes
are made, it is essential to re-evaluate the design
of the water system as a whole in order to be certain
that it is adequate. The engineer or consultant,
along with the facility, should be familiar with pertinent chemical and bacteriological standards such
as the A M standard andor local, state, and federal
requirements.
Additionally, the design and specification guidelines
contained in the FDA publication, A Manual on
Water llZaQtment@ HernodiaEysis, should be reviewed.

Blending Valve

Mixes hot and cold water to a fixed
predetermined temperature to
achieve optimal performance from
the reverse osmosis device.

Water temperature downstream
of blending valve should be monitored at least daily to maintain
optimum R.O. output, and to protect
R.O. membrane and patients from
excess temperature.

Bed Filter

Sand, multi-media, or diatomaceous
earth filter used to remove suspended matter or colloidal material
before downstream components.

Filter should be backwashed at
frequent intewals. Pressure drop
across filter should be monitored at
least daily.

Carbon Absorption

Activated carbon in tanks used to
remove chlorine, chloramine, and
some organics. Two tanks, each
containing granular activated
carbon in series, are recommended.
Each tank should have an empty
bed contact time of 3 to 5 minutes.
Carbon tanks should be followed by
particle filters to remove carbon
fines from tank effluent. Do not
install bypass piping.

Test water for chloramines after the
first tank before every patient dialysis shift. If chlorarnines are > 0.1
mg/L (AAMI Standard), immediately
test water exiting the second tank.
If these levels exceed AAMl limits,
dialysis should not proceed. When
chloramine levels reach AAMl limit
after first tank, replace carbon tank.
Monitor bacterial levels.

Water Softener

A tank containing insoluble spheres
or beads, called "resin." The resin
exchanges cations (positively
charged sodium ions) to remove
calcium and magnesium from incoming hard water. Most facilities
use "permanent" softeners which
incorporate a brine tank containing
concentrated sodium chloride
solution and a control system to
regenerate the softener at preset
intervals.

Test upstream for baseline. Maintain volume of salt in brine tank.
Test post-softener water for hardness at least once daily. Check
timer from proper setting at least
once daily.

Reverse Osmosis

A membrane separation process for
removing solvent from a solution;
this system pressurizes feedwater
on one side of a membrane. By
creating a pressure high enough to
exceed osmotic pressure, reverse
osmotic flow of water occurs across
a semipermeable membrane, giving
"product water" essentially free of
dissolved solids, microorganisms,
and endoxin.

Periodic and validated disinfection
and cleaning should be performed to
protect the R.O. membrane from
scale deposition, particulate and
colloidal fouling, and bacterial
growth. Feed and product water
pressures, flow rates, and ionic
content (conductivity) should be
monitored according to the manufacturer's recommendations, but
at least daily. Post-R.O. bacterial
levels should be measured at least

a number of facilities have been
able to successfully use storage
tanks that are properly designed
and effectively disinfected at
validated intervals.

Confirm proper tank design: airtight

achieved via "recirculating loop"
pipe materials which do not
degrade the chemical or microbiological quality of the water
a minimum flow velocity in piping
of 1.5 ftlsec to discourage bacterial colonization
avoidance of any dead-ends in
piping.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

At least monthly monitor bacterial
levels in distribution piping at point
where dialysis delivery systems
connect. Disinfect distribution

PROCEDURE FOR
WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM
MONITORING FORM (FORM 1)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures,
compliance should be very high.

Perform the Audit

Before the Audit

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.

1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment
for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,
auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.

2. Read each indicator carefully.

4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no ifindicator is not met,
or N/A for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Donen
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform
the test exactly according to the instructions
for use of the test manufacturer and record the
results as per facility policy.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.

4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel
(head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).

5. Make copies of the audit for each auditor1
observer.
6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:

Employee A:
B:

C.

Glenn Close
Tom Hanks
William Hurt
etc.

7. Determine how many staff are to be observed.
It is recommend that one auditor should observe
no more than three to four staff a t one time.
8. Define the length of time for observation. I t is

recommended that the audit be conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staff member completely perform the listed activity.
9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.

Auditor should not be assigned to other
responsibilities during the audit.

rlity Assurance Guidelines

5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure that each indicator has one
response.

After the Audit
1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.
2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

3. Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
4. For each indicator, calculate compliance per-

centage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.
5. Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andlor recommendations.

Dialysis Delivery
System

TECHNICAL DESCEUPTION OF
DEVICE

Appropriate dilutionlproportioning of concentrate.

The dialysis delivery system (delivery system) s u p
plies dialysate to the hemodialyzer, maintaining
proper concentration, temperature, pressures, and
flow in the dialysate circuit. The delivery system
also monitors various functions related to the dialysate compartment and the blood compartment:
dialysate pressure, ultrafiltration rate, blood leaks
into the dialysate, changes in the pressure of the
blood circuit, air or air foam in the blood, and other
parameters.

Continuous monitoring of conductivity (and in
some machines pH) and interruption of dialysate flow to the dialyzer if these parameters differ
from preset limits.

Single patient, single pass systems discharge dialysate to drain after one passage through the dialyzer and are used to deliver dialysate to one patient a t a time. Dialysate is produced from proportioning dialysate concentrate and water. Normally,
single patient systems, also called "negative pressure systems," maintain a subatmospheric ("negative") dialysate pressure in order to accomplish fluid
removal.

Pumping the blood from the patient through the
dialyzer and back to the patient.

The central delivery system maintains a single
"centralndialysate proportioner which prepares dialysate for a number of bedside consoles or bedside
stations. Both the single patient/single pass systems and the multi-patient/single pass systems require a continuous supply of purified water and a
continuous source of concentrate. "Spent," or "exhausted" dialysate is discarded to the drain after it
has made a single pass through the dialyzer.

Interrupting power to the blood pump in such
situations as blood leaks, incorrectly heated dialysate, incorrect dialysate pressures, incorrect
blood compartment pressures, air in the blood.

The sorbent or regenerative dialysis system involves
reprocessing dial~satethrough a cartridge to remove toxins from the spent dialysate, as well as
adjusting electrolytes to the desired level. The standard volume used in regenerative dialysis is approximately 6 liters. This process does not require
a continuous supply of water or concentrate and
does not drain spent dialysate.
' h e basic functions of a dialysate delivery system

are summarized below:

Heating dialysate to physiological range.

P e a s i n g the dialyzer's dialysate compartment
a t a desired flow rate.
Monitoring desired dialysate circuit pressures.
Controlling andlor monitoring ultrafiltration rate.

Monitoring pressure in the extracorporeal blood
circuit.
Monitoring for blood in the effluent dialysate.
Monitoring for appearance of air in the blood
circuit.

Table 1 provides a Iummary of dialysis delivery
system components.

RISKS AND HAZARDS
The literature prior to 1980 contains a large number of reports of patient complications attributed to
problems with dialysis delivery systems. Included
are those that contributed to serious patient injury
or death:
Dialysate mixing errors
Improper settinghesetting of alarm limits

Proportioning pump failure
Conductivity monitor failue
Temperature alarm failure
Dialysate pressure alarm failure
Blood circuit dysfunction
Incidents reported in the literature or through the
Medical Device Reporting Program since 1980 are
summarized in Appendix A A total of 160 incidents were reported. Sixteen were related to central delivery systems and 144 were related to single
patient delivery systems.
Ofthe 160 incidents, 77 were related to user error.
Of the remaining, 70 included some component of
user error in addition to malfunction of the equip
ment itsew. Unfortunately, some of these problems
resulted in patient death.

Machine operated in bypass mode without attaching concentrate, resulting in hemolysis.
Hemolysis, due to empty concentrate jug concurrent with no alarm or by-pass.

Adverse reaction, due to improper pH, alarm
improperly set or disabled.
Hypercalcemia, due to improperly proportioned
concentrate.
Improper concentrateused concumn@ with h a p
propriately adjusted conductivity circuit, resulting in hyponatrernia and hemolysis.
Hypernatremia, due to high dialysate sodium
(248mEqA) caused by facility personnel reversing plumbing inside of machine.
Hemolysis, due to the machine in bypass during
dialysis and technically altered so water flowed
through dialyzer.

Incidents related to user error, or combination of
user error and machine malfunction included:

Patient death due to hypernatremia after staff
member responded to conductivity alarm by recalibrating c&ductivity circuit while patient was
dialyzing.

Blood Circuit
Blood line clamp not completely occluding blood
line; air introduction into blood circuit, resulting
in air embolism.

Todc Chemicals
Formaldehyde back-siphoned from one machine
to another (one machine set with high negative
pressure while the next machine, not in operation, yet in line on the water distribution system
still contained formaldehyde);resulted in patient
toxic chemical exposure.

Patient injury or death from air embolism, due
to an unarmed or bypassed air/foam detector.
Uncontrolled blood pump operation, resulting in
vascular damage and/or excessive extracorporeal
circuit pressures.

Toxic reactions due to patient exposure to germicide used for disinfectant in delivery system.

Patient bleeding, caused by excess heparin administration due to lack of heparin pump preventative maintenance.

of the delivery system, as well as the various related components, such as dialysate, the dialyzer,
blood lines, and transducer protectors. The risks
involved must be clearly identified, considered, and
appropriate safety measures and preventative systems developed.
Policies and procedures must also address safe and
effective operation of the delivery system:

EXISTING GUIDELINES
The American National Standards for Hemodialysis
Systems were developed by the Association for-the
Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)
and approved by the American National Standards
Institute in May 1982 (see Table 2).
The most complete guideline for the operation of
dialysis delivery systems, however, comes from the
manufacturer's instructions for use. These instructions should be incorporated into the facility's policies and procedures.

patient monitoring.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should include all personnel r e
sponsibilities for operation and use of the delivery
system including preventative maintenance, troubleshooting and repairs, daily or per-treatment safety
and other system checks and recordkeeping. Each
responsibility should stem from a specific policy or
procedure.

Staff training should be a well-defined and organ-

QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR
DIALYSIS DELIVERY SYSTEMS

Policies and Procedures

i
s

An essential step in designing the facility's quality
a~suranceprogram is the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and procedures for
dialysis delivery systems. All standards previously
described must be incorporated into these policies
and procedures. Specifically, the policies and prod-s
must address the scope of care and theraWtic choices, equipment, disposables, and s u p
plies used in the dialysis facility.
Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationships of each component

ized program. Content should be clearly defined
for the learner and based on behavioral objectives.
The behavioral objectives can be used to accurately
and objectively measure learning. At the end of
the sessiods), the instructor must confirm by a
written test andlor return demonstration that learning has occurred and that the learner is able to
perform the procedure(s) independently without error.
Documentation of test results should be recorded
in the personnel file.
Comprehension of the purpose and h c t i o n of the
dialysis delivery system requires a basic understanding of kidney disease, fluids and electrolytes,
principles of dialysis, infection control, and complications of the hemodialysis treatment. Content
should include theory of operation, pre and post

lity Assurance Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

operational procedures, parameters of safety, cleaning and disinfection, electrical safety, emergency
procedures, troubleshooting, and water treatment.
Need for further education, such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions, can be determined
from the ongoing quality monitoring process and
the continuous staff performance appraisal process. When problems are identified, staff should be
made aware of the problem and involved in its
resolution. This nearly always includes problem
specific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
ascertain that the individual has successfully completed the initial education and training program.
The medical diredor is also responsible for assuring that an annual performance appraisal has been
performed.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The following section provides a summary of recommendations for monitoring that should be performed to enhance safety and reduce the level of
risk of patient injury due to incidents related to
malfunction andlor improper use of dialysis delivery systems:

A. Daily Monitoring
1. Conductivity of the final dialysate being delivered to the dialyzer should be checked before
every treatment. When used, the pH of bicarbonate dialysate should also be confirmed before
each treatment. Conductivity must be within
the manufacturer's stated specifics. If the pH is
below 6.5 or above 7.5, dialysis should not be
started, even when conductivity is within acceptable limits.

2. Temperature should also be within the manufacturer's specifications. Temperature may be
checked with an independent reference meter or
with a reference thermometer. As with pH and
conductivity, the actual numerical readings should
be recorded on the patient's daily dialysis record
and initials of the person performing the test
noted (see Form 1).
3. Absence of residual germicide should be verified
on all delivery systems connected to a single water
treatment qoop" before dialysis begins. Such
testing must be performed with an assay known
to detect the minimum standard level. The test
results should be documented on the patient's
daily dialysis record. The actual result should
be recorded and initials of the person performing the test noted (see Form 1).
4. A test of proper functioning of the airKoam detector should be performed before dialysis is initiated. This test should be a direct test of function of the alarm, causing interruption of the
blood pump and actuation of the blood line clamp,
either by introducing air into the venous level
detector or by removing the tubing so that air is
sensed by the detector-as recommended by the
device manufacturer. Test results should be
documented on the patient's daily dialysis record. The actual result should be recorded and
initials of the person performing the test noted
(see Form 1).

5. The blood detector must be checked for proper
armed status according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. Test result should
be documented on the patient's daily dialysis record. The actual result should be recorded and
initials of the person performing the test noted
(see Form 1).

According to manufacturers' instructions, the
conductivity should be checked with an independent reference meter which is known to be
properly calibrated. The pH can be checked with
a similar meter or pH paper.

6. If the delivery system employed is equipped with
ultrafiltration control, the user should perform
applicable tests of the ultrafiltration control system as prescribed by the manufacturer. Documentation of that testing should be performed
(see Form 1).

These readings should be documented on the
patient's daily dialysis record. The actual numerical readings should be recorded and initials
of the person performing the test should be noted
(see Form 1 for sample recording format).

7. All other alarms must be tested according to the
manufacturer's instructions for use before every
treatment including low and high conductivity
alarm, low and high temperature alarm, dialysate pressure alarm, water pressure alarm, etc.

Quality ~ssuranceGuidelines for Hernodialysis Deuices

Documentation of that testing should be performed (see Form 1).
If the particular delivery system is equipped with
a "self-alarm checkn mode, it is important that
the user understand that, most o h n , it is a
check of the electronic circuitry, and not a confirmation of some of the vital h c t i o n s of specific alarms.

8. Observation of dialysate flow should be made
while the machine is in a "dialyzingf mode. A b
sence of dialysate flow should be confirmed when
the machine is in "bypassn mode actuated by
both manual setting of the machine to bypass or
via any of the alarm functions that will cause
the machine to enter a bypass mode.

(Pm:

3. Preventative Maintenance
Monitoring documentation of all PM should be performed
to assure that it is completed within the scheduled time frame and performed according to the
manufacturer's recommendations (see Form 3).

C. Patient Monitoring
1. Routine intradialytic monitoring of patient's
physiological parameters and symptoms during
the dialysis treatment can provide indications of
improper delivery system function. A few primary types of symptoms seen are:

B. Monthly Monitoring
1. Micmbiological testing: In accordance with
the AAMI American National Standard for Heme
dialysis Systems and in keeping with accepted
industry standards, water for production of dialysate and actual dialysate proportioned and
exiting the dialyzer should be monitored for bacterial levels on no less than a monthly basis.
Microbiological monitoring is performed to establish ongoing validation of proper disinfection
protocols.

Regular monitoring of a representative sample
of delivery systems will sate once protocols
are validated.

As indicated in the American National Standard for Hemodialysis Systems, the samphg should
be done "at the termination of dialysis a t the
point where dialysate exits the dialyze?. Results for total microbial counts shall not exceed

Nausea, vomiting, and headache may be
related to incorrect electrolyte composition of
the dialysate due to an incorrect dialysate or
improper proportioning of the delivery system.

Hypotension or hypertension may be related to improper ultrafiltration either through
failure of the ultrafiltration controller or improper blood or dialysate circuit pressure.
Pyrogen reaction (shaking chills, increase
in patient temperature of more than 1°C during treatment) or septicemia (identified through
blood cultures) may occur from patient exposure to endotoxin or bacteria due to improper
disinfection of the dialysate circuit.
Hemolysis (cherry red blood in venous blood
tubing, chest pain, dyspnea, hypotension, increased serum potassium, decreased hematocrit) may occur due to improper dialysate composition, machine malfunction resulting in water only in the dialysate circuit, or very high
dialysate temperature.

2,000 colony forming units per ml. The facility
must assure that the American National Standard for Hemodialysis Systems assay protocol is
followed.

Acute blood loss (obvious source of blood
spill, shock, vomiting, convulsions) may r e
sult from extreme pressures in the blood circuit causing line separation.

2 Assessing trends: Pertinent information, i.e.,
bacterial levels, conductivity and pH readings,
etc., should be logged on a chart across a page so
that readings can be examined and compared
over an extended period of time. This tool makes
it possible to compare current readings to those
taken during the past several daydweeks/months.
Any untoward trends thus become immediately

obvious (see ~ o r m

Air embolism (evidence of air in blood lines,

ity Assurance Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

chest pain, dyspnea, coughing, cyanosis, visual problems, confusion, coma, etc.) may result from air entering the blood circuit due to
failure of the air detectiodine clamping system.

Altered mental status (confusion, convulsions, and coma) may occur due to improper
dialysate concentration.

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient,
home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed by
the medical director, as appropriate.

E. Other Monitoring
L At the prescribed recommendations of the manufacturer, or at least quarterly, dialysate flow rate,
blood D
- U ~- Pflow rate. and Drooer calibration of
the heparin pump should be tested d i d Y . Actual
flow rate should be measured over a prescribed
time using precise volume measurements.
An annual review of all policies and procedures
related to dialysis delivery systems should be
performed.
All incidents or adverse occurrences related to
didysis delivery systems should be documented
and reported a t the monthly quality assurance
meetings.
Quarterly monitoring of actual implementation
of dialysis delivery system procedures should be
performed (see Form 4 for sample Pre-dialysis
Checks Monitors and Form 5 for sample Technical Equipment Audit).

F. Prevention
1. Maintenance: Chapter 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, $405.2140(a)(2) requires that
"All electrical and other equipment used in the
facility is maintained free of defects that could
be a potential hazard to patients or personnel.
There is established a planned program of preventative maintenance of equipment used in dialysis
and related procedures in the facility."

when preventative maintenance is required (see
Form 3 for sample Master Preventative Maintenance Schedule).
A history file of all repairs and maintenance for
each piece of equipment should be maintained
in a separate file. This file describes all technical operations performed on the equipment, including date, parts used, actions taken, tests performed to assure proper functioning before and
&r maintenandrepair, and person performing maintenancdrepair.

A log of all maintenancehepair work for each
piece of equipment should be kept a t the front of
the "history file." This log includes a very brief
description of the maintenancehepair (e.g., "500
h r maintenancen or "adjusted conductivity" or
"repaired inoperable blood pump," etc.), date, and
person performing action. Such a log provides a
trend analysis of any problems related to the delivery system, as well as a quick confirmation of
maintenance being performed according to schedule.
3. Repair & Troubleshooting:Even when dialysis delivery systems are properly designed, monitored, and maintained, the entire system may
unexpectedly fail or a component of the system
mav fail. Althoueh these failures cannot be foreseen and occur very infrequently, when they do
occur, it is important that patients are not a t
risk. The most important aspect of system failure is to have an established and agreed upon
plan of action. This plan should be approved by
the medical director and communicated to all
facility staff.

Each manufacturer provides comprehensive directions pertaining to preventative maintenance
requirements for the entire dialysis delivery system. Maximum time intemals--either in number of hours of operation of the system or in
calendar days-between preventative maintenance
procedures are also specified. The schedules and
procedures established must be followed.
2. Recordkeeping:A master schedule of all preventative maintenance should be developed. Such
a master schedule will list every machine by
serid number or other identifier and identify

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

-

Repair and maintenance on a delivery system
should be performed by "qualified personnel."
The definition of "qualified personneln may differ from facility to facility, and that definition is
the final responsibility of the medical director.
Consider the following recommendations:
a Facility personnel trained by another facility
personnel member who has been certified by
the manufacturer as competent to perform
such training, or
b. Facility technical personnel who have successMly completed (certified) the manufacturer's
technical training program, or
c. Manufacturer's technical service personnel.

46

G. Purchasing Guidelines
The following is a list of pertinent questions to ask
when purchasing a delivery system:

What are the electrical, water flow, pressure,
and drain requirements?

Has the system proved safe and reliable in other
facilities? Seek and ve* references.
Does the manufacturer provide complete clinical

training in use of the device?
Does the manufacurer provide acceptable technical maintenance and repair? Does the manufacturer provide technical maintenance and r e
pair training to facility personnel?

Does the system comply with existing standards,
i.e., AAMI?
After finding the answers to these questions the
facility should:

1. Choose the two or three different manufacturers'
systems best suited to the facility's current and
future needs and desires, and
2. Request one of the chosen systems from each

3. Obtain subjective opinion from the technical and
patient care staff, as well as from the patients,
and
4. Obtain objective information from the patient
care and technical staff. Using a form such as
the one included at the end of this chapter may
be helpll (Form 6).

This process will enhance the likelihood of selecting a delivery system which suits the needs of the
medical, clinical, and technical staffs. It also helps
to assure a system that is safe and effective in the
facility's hands.

PROCEDURE FOR CONCURRENT
MONITORING FORM:
PREDIALYSIS TECHNICAL
CHECKS (FORM4)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures,
compliance should be very high.

Perform the Audit

Before the Audit

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.

1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,
auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.
2. Read each indicator carefully.

4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no if indicator is not met,
or NfA for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Done"
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform
the test exactly according to the instructions
for use of the test manufacturer and record the
results as per facility policy.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.

4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel
(head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).
5. Make copies of the audit for each auditorfobserver.

6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:
Employee A:
B:
C.

Glenn Close
Tom Hanks
William Hurt
etc.

7. Determine how many staff are to be observed.
I t is recommend that one auditor should observe no more than three to four staff a t one
time;
8. Define the length of time for observation. It is
recommended that the audit be conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staff member completely perform the listed activity.
9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.

Auditor should not be assigned to other responsibilities during the audit.

5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure that each indicator has one
response.

After the Audit
1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.
2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

3. Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
4. For each indicator, calculate compliance percentage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.

5. Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andlor recommendations.

Dialysate and
Dialysate Concentrate

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF
DEVICE

Briefly, the problems related to manufacturers included:

Dialysate, or dialysis fluid, is a non-sterile aqueous
solution with an electrolyte composition near that
of normal extracellular fluid. Its electrolyte composition is designed to correct the metabolic imbalance that occurs as a result of uremia.

Mimbial growth in liquid bicarbonate concentrate.

Electrolyte content of dialysate includes sodium,
potassium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, glucose
(optional), and either acetate or bicarbonate as a
buffer. Concentration of these electrolytes in dialysate fluid is shown in Table 1. Dialysate contains
none of the solutes that are eliminated from the
blood during dialysis (urea, creatinine, and other
waste products of nitrogen metabolism).

High levels of aluminum contaminating acetate
concentrate.

Actual electrolyte content of the concentrate was
different than described on the label.
Foreign matter in liquid bicarbonate concentrate.

Incidents related to user error, or machine malb c t i o n include:
Improper sodium concentrations due to miscalibration of or improper proportioning by the dialysis
delivery systems.

Dialysate concentrate is a preparation of salts which,
when diluted with water, yields dialysate for use in
dialysis. Dialysate concentrates are manufactured
commercially in liquid or powder form.
The chemicals present in the dialysate have access, via the dialyzer, to the bloodstream of patients undergoing the dialysis. Therefore, the proper
concentration of all of these chemicals as well as
the quality of the concentrate and the water used
to dilute the concentrate is critical.

The literature prior to 1980contained only one report
of patient complications attributed to concentrate:
a case of hypermagnesemia due to the use of commercially prepared concentrate with a magnesium
concentration ten times greater than specifications.
Incidents reported in the literature and through
the Medical Device Reporting program since 1980
are summarized in Appendix A Of note, 50% of
the 18incidents reported involved problems related
to the concentrate when delivered from the manufacturer. The remaining 50% were related to user
error or machine malfirnctions.

Use of wrong concentrates or improper mixing of
concentrates due to staff misreading labels.

Bacterial problems related to improper disinfection
of storage containers or use of water containing
excess bacteria.
Many ofthe incidents could have been avoided through
fairly simple tests, observations, or quality control
procedures implemented in the dialysis facilities.
Further, although only a few of these incidents resulted in patient death, almost all had the potential to cause death.

EXISTING GUIDELINES
Guidelines currently available regarding dialysate,
or dialysate concentrate, are found in the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) document, the American National Standards for Hemodialysis Systems (RD5-1981). These
standards can be separated into two areas: (1)
those related primarily to manufacturers' labeling
and literature and manufacturers' specificationsfor
concentrate, and (2) those dealing with microbiological suitability of final, proportioned dialysate.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

5- 1

Table 2 summarizes these standards.
In the absence of federal, local, or other voluntary
standards, well accepted "industry" standards, that
is, accepted technique for handling of dialysate and
dialysate concentrate, are available. In 1983 the
Emergency Care Research Institute (ECRI) summarized these and recommended the following steps
as the appeared in Health Devices (1983):
1. Check the actualpH and conductivity ofthe ddysah
with an external meter.
2. Check the conductivity, pH, and temperature alarm
system before each dialysis treatment.

3. Assure that all personnel in the dialysis unit are
well informed of the types of concentrates available,
even if you presently use only one type.
4. Whenever possible, develop and use a system of
labeling,connector types,and matching containers
that prevent or minimize cross-connections or
use of mismatched concentrates.

5. Store and dispense dialysate concentrates as though
they were drugs. Develop a policy for inventory
management and storage system that will
effectively control the mixing and dispensing of
all concentrates. Storing concentrates according
to type, composition, and proportioning ratios
should reduce the risks ofmismatchedconcentrates.
Prohibit access to storage areas and allow only
authorized, specially trained personnel to mix
and dispense concentrates.

therapy must be developed, written, implemented
and evaluated. All standards previously described
must be incorporated into these policies and procedures.
Specifically, the policies and procedures should address the different therapeutic prescriptions available in the facility, i.e., high-flux dialysis, high efficiency dialysis, and conventional dialysis. Each of
these differing therapeutic modalities may require
different types of dialysate; for example, sodium
modeling, bicarbonate dialysis, acetate dialysis,
ultrafiltration, or individual patient prescription.
Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationships of each component
of the dialysate as well as the dialysis delivery
systems. The risks involved must be clearly identified, considered, and appropriate safety measures
and preventative systems developed.
Policies and procedures must also address safe and
effective dialysate handling:

6. Verify and record actual dialysate composition
on the patient's records to assure that what is
being delivered is appropriate for what has been
prescribed by the physician (see Form 1).

7. Do not dispense concentratesfrom large containers
into smaller ones without a "keyed" dispensing
system. Such a system should include labeling
of the smaller containers as well as color-coded
or key-coded (shape) connections between caps
of containers and uptake tubing on machines.
8. Always dispose of concentrates remaining from
the previous treatment. Do not pour remaining
concentrate into another container or use in the
next treatment. Replace empty or partially full
containers with full ones. Whenever possible,
standardize equipment so that only one bicarbonate
concentrate system is used.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education

A. Daily Monitoring

Role descriptions should include personnel responsibilities for handling and testing of concentrate,
ordering, confirmation of proper labeling, testing
and monitoring, and other similar responsibilities.
Each ~sponsibilityshould stem from a specific policy
or procedure.

Staff training should be a well-defined and organized process. Content should be clearly defined for
the learner and based on behavioral objectives. The
behavioral objectives can be used to accurately and
objectively measure learning. At the end of the
sessiods), the instructor should confirm by a written test andlor return demonstration that learning
has occurred and that the learner is able to perform the procedure(s) independently without error.
Test results should be documented and placed in
employee's personnel file.
Comprehension of the purpose and function of dialysate and dialysate concentrate requires a basic
understanding of normal physiological concepts, as
well as responses associated with uremia and the
hemodialysis therapy. Content should include dialysate fluid composition, h c t i o n , preparation,
conductivity and pH, and potential complications
with improper mixes of dialysate.
Need for further education, such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions, can be determined
from the routine quality assurance monitoring p m ess and the ongoing staff performance appraisal
process. When problems are identified, all staff
should be made aware of the problem and be involved in its solution. This nearly always includes
problem specific continuing education.
The medical diredor of the dialysis facility must
ascertain that the individual has successhlly completed the initial education and training program.
The medical director is also responsible for assuring that an annual review has been performed.

Monitoring and Evaluation
To prevent patient injury associated with the use
of improper concentrates, concentrate mix-ups, miscalibrated dialysis delivery systems, and improper
function of the dialysate delivery systems proportioning or conductivity circuit, the following monitoring activities are recommended:

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Conductivity of the final dialysate being delivered
to the dialyzer should be checked before every
tmatment The pH and temperakneofthe ddysate
should also be confirmed before each treatment
Conductivity should be within the manufacturel's
stated specifications. If the pH is below 6.5 or
above 7.5 dialysis should not be initiated, even if
the conductivity is within acceptable limits.
Conductivity should be checked with a independent
reference meter which is known to be properly
calibrated. The pH can be checked with a similar
meter, or with pH paper.

Becausetemperaturecan alter conductivityIleading,
the temperature should also be within the
manufacturel's specifications. Temperature may
be checked with a reference meter or with a
reference thermometer.

AU three of these readings should be documented
on the patient's daily dialysis record. The actual
numerical readings should be recorded, not simply
a "check markn or "0.k." Initials of the person
performing the test should also be included (see
Form 1for sample recording format).
Before initiating treatment, confirmation that the
prescribed concentrate is being used and that all
manufacturer's safety devices and features are
being employed should be done. This should
include reading the label on all concentrate containers, correct use of any color-coding andlor
any keycoding, and use of the proper facilitydesignated concentrate containers. This safety
check shouldbe documented on the patients dialysis
treatment record. Dialysis may be initiated when
all of these checks correspond to established
parameters.
If concentrates are mixed from powder in a large
container and then distributed into smaller "jugs,"
each jug should be labeled with the following
information (see Form 2 for sample labeling
formats):
Contents, i.e., A concentrate, B concentrate,
acetate concentrate, etc., plus proportioning
ratio.
Time the solution was mixed and initials of
person(s) mixing the solution.
Time the solution was dispensed and identification of person(s) performing this procedure.

5-3

confirm that the sanitization and handling
procedures for these jugs are also valid.

Other special additives inserted into the
concentrate (i.e., potassium, a potassium "spike,"
calcium, etc.). This information should also
be recorded on the label by the person pexforming
the addition. (Many facilities require that at
least two individuals watch this procedure and
initial the container.)
4. A monitoring andlor coding system should also
be included
the daily ior&ring of rinsing,
sanitizing, or disinfecting procedures for the
bicarbonate mixing tank or "concentrate jugs";
for example:

A daily log for sanitization and rinsing of the
mixing tank should include time performed
and initials of person(s) performing the task.
A daily log might also include proper recording
of any procedures required on "concentrate
jugs". This can more easily be performed if
each jug is identitied with a serial number
(see below for more information on coding of
concentrate jugs).
The daily log should also include results of
any test performed to verify adequate rinsing
(absence) of the disinfectantfgermicide used
so as to prevent any introduction of toxic
substances into the patient.

B. Monthly Monitoring

A culture sampling of the dialysis delivery
systems for dialysate as described in the AAMI
American National Standardsfor Hemodialysis
Systems provides an overview of the efficacy
of all systems for maintaining microbiological
standards.
3. To assesstrends,pertinent infonnation, ia,bacterial

levels, conductivity, pH readings, etc., should be
logged on a chart across a page so that readings
can be examined and compared over an extended
period of time. This makes it possible to compare
current readings to those taken during the past
several days/week&nonths. Any untoward trends
thus become immediately obvious (see Form 3
for sample trend chart).

C. Patient Monitoring
The following patient monitoring aspects have relationships to dialysate and dialysate concentrate
handling:
1. Routineblood chemisbiesmay provide an indication
of improper use of concentrates. These are further
explained below.
2. Routine intradialytic monitoring and patient
symptoms during the dialysis treatment can also
provide indicationsfor improperly used concentrates

L On at least a monthly basis, calibration of any
reference meters used to perform daily or other
conductivity,pH, and other monitoring of dialysate
should be performed using a reliable Standard
Solution (see Chapter 7 for more information on
use of Standard Solution). Manufacturers may
recommend more frequent confirmation of proper
calibration. Be sure to follow the recommendations of the device manufacturer.

or~.Afewoftheprimarytypesofsym~
seen with incorrect use of concentrates are
summarized below:

Hyponatremia induced by low sodium content
in the dialysak,may result in hemolysis, nausea
and vomiting, and death.
0

2. On at least a monthly basis, validate the handling
and disinfection procedures to prevent microbiological contamination. To do this, the following
is recommended:

Obtain a sample of the bicarbonate concentrate
from any mixing tank. This should be done
on a "worse case" basis, i.e., draw the sample
after the ' --st period since the last disinfection1
sanitization, and after the longest storage time
for concentrate in that container.

A random sample of the concentrate fiom
concentrate jugs should also be performed to

apparent by respiratory problems, nausea and
vomiting, headaches, seizures, and death.

Hyperkalemia induced by high potassium
content in dialysate; may result in death.

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient

~ualitj
Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

5-4

and home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed
by the medical diredor as appropriate.

E. Other Monitoring
Other monitoring includes assuring proper use and
outcome related to dialysate and dialysate concentrate handling:
1. An incoming materials log should be maintained.
Included in this log should be the identification
of the product, delivery date, lot number, and
person receiving the products. Dialysate should
be received, inspected, and released for use only
by authorized personnel who are trained in the
use and expected specifications of the product.
Confirmation that the product is properly labeled
as ordered should be performed. Any product
with labelsthatare not intact or thatare incorrectly
labeled should not be accepted.
2. An annual review of all policies and procedures
related to dialysate and dialysate concentrate
handling should be performed.

should be perfbrmed (seeForm 4 for sample dhlysd~
concentrate safety monitor).

F. Prevention
Follow exactly all of the manufacturer's instnrctions
for use.
Test conductivityand pH with a properly cabakd
independentrefmce meter before every treatment
If final proportioned dialysate is determined to
be not ofthe proper chemical concentration(im&
conductivity, incomct pH, particulate contamination, etc.), do not initiate dialysis.
If a determination is made that the chemical
c o n c e n m is improper after a patient is connected
to a machine, verify that the delivery system is
in bypass mode. Troubleshoot the problem with
the dialysate hoses disconneded from the dialyzer.
Confirm presence or absence of delivery system
malfunction. If the equipment malfunction is
confirmed, the patient should be immediately
disconnected.

3. All incidents or adverse occurrences related to
dialysate or dialysate concentrate handling should
be documented and reported at the monthly quality
assurance meetings.

4. Quarterly monitoring of actual implementation
of dialysate and dialysate concentrate procedures

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

Maintain a well-validated system of sanitization1
disinfection of all components of the concentrate
andlor dialysate handling system (water treatment
system, dialysis delivery system, mixing tank,

PROCEDURE FOR CONCURRENT
MONITORING FORM:
DIALYSATE CONCENTRATE
SAFETY MOMTOR (FORM 4)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures, compliance should be very high.

Before the Audit
1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all componentsassociated with water treatment
for dialysis.

2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

Perform the Audit
1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,
auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.
2. Read each indicator carefully.

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.
4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no if indicator is not met,
or N/A for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Done"
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform
the test exactly according to the instructions
for use of the test manufacturer a n d record the
results a s per facility policy.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.
4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel
(head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).

5. Make copies of the audit for each auditor1
observer.

6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:
Employee A:
B:
C.

Glenn Close
Tom Hanks
William Hurt
etc.

Determine how many staff are to be observed.
It is recommend that one auditor should observe
no more than three to four staff a t one time.

5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure t h a t each indicator has one
response.

After the Audit
1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.
2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

Define the length of time for observation. It is
recommended that the audit be conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staff member completely perform the listed activity.

9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.
Auditor shouldnotbe assigned to otherresponsibilities during the audit.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
For each indicator, calculate compliance percentage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.
Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andlor recommendations.

Hernodialyzers

Note: Information specific to reuse of hemodialyzers, as well as some other general discussion regarding dialyzers may also be found in Chapter 12,
Hemodialyzer Reuse.

Ultmfiltmtion is the simultaneoustransfer of a solvent,
with the small amount of solutes that it contains,
across a membrane.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF
DEVICE
The hemodiulyzer (dialyzer) is a device that permits electrolyte metabolic and fluid exchange between the blood and the dialysis fluid. A semi-permeable membrane separates two compartments;
the patient's blood flows through one and the dialysis fluid, or dialysate, flows through the other.
The solute and fluid removal capabilities of a dialyzer are referred to as performance characteristics.
Other characteristics such as materials of construction, priming volume and compliance, residual blood
volume, fluid dynamic parameters, etc. are referred
to as design characteristics.
Several of these basic characteristics of the dialyzer are described below:

Mass Transfer. Mass transfer is used to calcu-

The rate of ultrafiltration depends on the effective
surface area and the hydraulic permeability of the
membrane, as well as transmembrane hydrostatic
pressure.
In practical terms, solute removal (incorporating
both diffusion and ultrafiltration) from the blood to
the dialysate is most often defined as clearance .

Dialysance describes dialyzer efficiency when solute concentration in the dialysate is not zero, or
the volume of blood cleared of that solute per minute, if the dialysate concentration was zero (see
Table 3).

Dialyzer Membranes
There are three basic membrane types:
1. The conventional cellulosic membrane (Cuprophanq saponified cellulose ester, regenerated
cellulose, cuprammonium rayon, etc.)

late the amount of solute transfer across the semipermeable membrane. Mass solute transfer is the
quantity of a solute transferred from the blood into
the dialysis fluid (or vice-versa) per unit of time.

2. Cellulose acetate, and

Mass transfer across a semi-permeable membrane
includes two basic mechanisms, difiswn and dtrafiltration .

k o m a quality assurance perspective, membranes
must be evaluated prior to use based on their solute transport characteristics, biocompatibility, water removal, reuse, clotting, and membrane integ-

Diftcusion is the passive transfer of solutes across a
membrane in the absence of net solvent transfer.
The amount of solute crossing a membrane by diffusion depends on three factors: (a) the mean concentration ingredient of the solute on either side of
the membrane, (b) the effective dialysis surface
area available for diffiion, and (c) the total dialyzer permeability coefficient.

3. Noncellulosic and high flux (polysulfone, polyacrylonitrile, polymethylmethacrylate,polyamide,
polycarbonate, etc.)

rity.

Design Characteristics
Dialyzer design characteristics may also influence
the facility's selection of a specific dialyzer for a
given patient. These characteristics include the
priming volume and the compliance of the blood

compartment, blood and dialysate compartment
hydraulic pressure drops, the residual blood volume, the uniformity of flow distribution in blood
and dialysate compartments, as well as more subjective characteristics such as size, weight, shape,
etc.

hemodialyzers and their characteristics.

to clotting, due to inappropriate anticoagulant

RISKS AND HAZARDS
The literature prior to 1980 contains a large number of reports and patient complications attributed
to problems with dialyzers. These include problems with the structural design ofthe dialyzer, patient
allergic responses to the membrane material andl
or the chemical used to make or sterilize the membrane, and human errors.
Incidents reported in the literature and through
the Medical Device Reporting system since 1980
are summarized in Appendix A

A total 342 incidents were reported; apparent dialyzer hypersensitivity reactions comprised 205 of
these. Of the remaining incidents, many included
some component malfunction of the device, due to
manufacturer quality control error.
Incidents related to user error or a combination of
user error and device malfunction included:
F'yrogen reaction and sepsis, indicating bacterial contamination of dialyzer due to poor setup technique.
Dialyzer hypersensitivityreaction when dialyzer
was not primed according to manufacturer's recommendations.
Extreme blood loss, due to broken blood port on
dialyzer, blood line separation, cracked dialyzer
header, or fiber rupture with no blood detector
alarm.

Membrane leaks on dialyzm secon* to damaged
dialyzer housing, &r a case of dialyzers was
dropped without being reported.
Large plate dialyzer membrane leak secondary
administration and monitoring.
Many of the incidentscould have been avoided thrugh
fairly simple tests, observations, or quality control
procedures as specified in the manufacturer's instructions for use. Further, although only a few of
these incidents resulted in patient death, almost
all had the potential to cause death.

EXISTING GUIDELINES
Guidelines currently relavent to dialyzers are the
International organization for Standardization (IS01
Document 8637, International Standard for Hemodialyzers, Hemofilters, and Hemoconcentrators, and
the American National Standard for First Use
Hemodialyzers (ANSUMMI: RD16-1984) developed by the Association for the Advancement of
Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Both of these
documents are, primarily voluntary standards for
manufacturers of hemodialyzers.
Table 2 summarizes AAMI's American National
Standards for First Use Hernodialyzers.

QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR
DIALYZERS

Policies and Procedures

Air embolus, due to improper blood linddialyzer
connection.

An essential step in designing a facility's quality
assurance program is the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and procedures
for hemodialyzers. All standards previously described must be incorporated into these policies and
procedures. Specifically, the policies and procedures must address the scope of care and therapeutic choices, equipment, disposables, and s u p
plies used in the dialysis facility.

Inadequate dialyzer clearance, associated with
poor priming technique and incomplete removal
of air.

Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationship of each component of
the hemodialyzer, as well as the various related

Clotting of extracorporealcircuit, due to improper
anticoagulation monitoring.

components, such as the dialysate, delivery system, blood lines and transducer protectors. The
risks involved must be clearly identified and considered, and appropriate safety measures and preventative systems developed.
Policies and procedures must also address the safe
and effectivehandling and use of the hemodialyzer:
1. Storage conditions
2. Inspection of dialyzer before use

3. Priming of blood and dialysate path
4. Intra-dialytic monitoring of blood circuit pressure

5. Intra-dialytic monitoring of dialysate pressure

complications management and troubleshooting,
patient monitoring, and documentation.
Need for further education such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions can be determined
from the ongoing quality monitoring process and
the continuous staff performance appraisal process. When problems are identified, all staff should
be made aware of the problem and be involved in
its solution; this nearly always includes problem
specific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
ascertain that an individual has successfblly completed the initial education and training program.
The medical director is also responsible for assuring that an annual performance appraisal process
has been performed.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should include all personnel responsibilities for general handling and use of the
hemodialyzer, treatment safety and record keep
ing.

Staff training should be a well-defined, organized
program with content clearly defined for the learner
based on behavioral objectives. The behavioral
objectives can be used to accurately and objectively
monitor and measure learning. At the end of the
session(s), the instructor must confirm by a written
test andor return demonstration that learning has
occurred and that the learner is able to perform
the procedure(s) independently without error.
Comprehension of the purpose and function of the
hemodialyzer requires a basic understanding of
kidney disease, fluids and electrolytes, principles of
dialysis, infection control, and complications of the
hernodialysis treatment. Content should include
dialyzer principles and function, dialyzer related
procedures, aseptic technique, parameters of safety,

Monitoring and Evaluation
The following section provides a summary of recommendations for monitoring that should be performed to enhance safety and reduce the level of
risk of patient injury. These recommendations will
also ensure that the dialysis being received by the
patient is as prescribed by the physician.

A. Daily Monitoring
1. Physical inspection of the dialyzer for appropri-

ate labeling, undamaged packaging, intact caps,
and any other obvious defects should be performed.
2. Confirm that the dialyzer prescribed by the physician for the patient's treatment is being used.

3. Confirm that the dialysate flow rate and blood
flow rate prescribed by the physician are actual
delivery rates. Clarify that equipment settings
conform with prescription. Any reduction in
blood or dialysate flow rate must be documented
with rationale (see Form 1).
4. Confirm that actual dialysis duration is that
prescribed by the physician. Any departure from
the prescribed treatment time (in minutes) should
be explained on the record.

5. Test and document results of all components of
the dialysis delivery system, including:

the ultrafiltration control system
the blood leak detector

arterialhenous pressure alarms; setting
limits

blood cultures), from patient exposure to an
improperly sterilized dialyzer or a break in
aseptic technique.
Acute blood loss, which may be the result of
extreme pressures in the blood circuit, causing dialyzer membrane rupture, blood leaking through the actual dialyzer housing, or
bloodline separation from the dialyzer.

6. Blood flow through the dialyzer as well as dialysate distribution and flow through the dialyzer should be observed a t the beginning and
throughout the treatment.

7. Monitoring and recording of anticoagulation
therapy must be performed to assure that the
delivery rate is as prescribed.

8. Special events such as blood leaks, pyrogen reactions, cracked dialyzers or other complications
should be recorded on the patient's record.

The performance of the above tests and observations should be recorded on a daily patient dialysis
record. The initials of the person performing the
test and the specific machine number should a p
pear on that record (see Form 1).

B. Monthly Monitoring

3. Routine monitoring and evaluation of anticoagulation therapy needs to be conduded for both
patient and dialyzer clotting times. Real andlor
potential complications related to anticoagulation need to be addressed and documented in
the patient record.
4. When treatment delivery is not as prescribed, it
is recommended that the patient's vascular access be evaluated for recirculation.

5. First Use Syndrome signs and symptoms include chest pain, anxiety, shortness of breath,
and back pain.
Any case of First Use Syndrome (FUS),or Dialyzer Hypersensitivity Reaction, should be addressed immediately. Signs and symptoms of
these reactions include asthmatic reaction, respiratory arrest, pruritis, urticaria, erythema, peripheral and facial edema, hypertension, hypotension, and cardiac arrythmia. The reactions
range from very mild to very severe, including
death. The following should be done in the case
of a suspected FUS reaction:

An essential component of assuring adequacy of
the dialysis treatment is to confirm that the dialyzers and the way the dialyzers are being used are in
compliance with facility expectations and national
standards. A welldesigned urea kinetics program
will enable the facility to monitor adequacy of treatment The patient should have one or more of the
following measured on, at least, a quarterly basis:
pdpost BUN reduction

KTN urea (delivered or actual)

Immediately discontinue dialysis on the patient without returning the contents of the
extracorporeal circuit. Provide medical treatment for any resulting symptoms.

prdpost creatinine reduction
Individual characterization of the dialyzers may also
be performed.

Many experts recommend that the same dialyzer type not be used on the patient, if possible. If the same dialyzer must be used, be
sure to rinse diligently according to the manufacturer's recommendations prior to use.

C. Patient Monitoring
1. Routine monitoring of BUN as described above.
2. Routine intradialytic monitoring of the patient's
physiological parametersand symptomscan provide
indications of improper dialyzer function. A few
of the symptoms seen are:

Hypotension or hypertension, related to gross
dialyzer performance error, especially in the
absence of an ultrafiltration controller.
F'yrogen reaction (shaking, chills, increase in
patient temperature of more than 1°C during
treatment) or septicemia (identified through

Note: A positive history of hypersensitivity reaction is an indication for careful monitoring for
such signs and symptoms during dialysis.

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient,
home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed by
the medical director, as appropriate.

entire dialysis delivery system. The established
schedules and procedures must be followed.

1. Using the prescribed recommendations of the
manufacturer, dialysate flow rate, blood pump
flow rate and proper calibration of the heparin
pump should be tested directly. Actual flow
rates should be measured over a prescribed time
using precise volume measurements.

2. Water and dialysate must be tested and evaluated to assure at least minimum compliance
with AAMI standards.

2. An annual review of all policies and procedures

G. Purchasing Guidelines

related to hemodialyzers should be performed.
Assure that current standards andfor regulations are incorporated as appropriate.

The following is a list of pertinent questions to ask
when purchasing hemodialyzers.
Does the dialyzer meet the facility's definition
of adequacy?

3. All incidents or adverse occurrences related to
hemodialyzers should be documented and reported a t the monthly quality assurance meetings. To assess trends that may compromise
patient safety, adverse occurrences associated
with the dialyzer should be recorded on a "flow
chart" so that the information can be examined, analyzed, and compared over an extended
period of time by the quality assurance committee. Any trends thus become immediately
obvious and appropriate action can be taken.
See Form 2 for a sample trend analysis format.

What are the performance characteristics of the
dialyzer? How do these performance characteristics fit in with the facility's and physician's
therapeutic intent?
What are the specific equipment needs related
to the use of this dialyzer?

4. Quarterly monitoring of actual implementation

What are the graphic representations of "in-vim"
expectations of performance according to the
therapeutic parameters that will be used in the

See Form 3 for sample "Dialyzer Usen monitoring instrument.

Has the specific dialyzer been proven safe, reliable and effective in other facilities?

F. Prevention
1. Each manufacturer provides comprehensive directions for the preventative maintenance of the

These questions will enhance the likelihood of selecting a hemodialyzer that best suits the need of
the patient. It will also help to assure a treatment
that is safe and effective.

PROCEDUREFORCONCURRENT
MONITORING FORM:
DIALYZER USE MONITOR
(FORM 3)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures, compliance should be very high.

Perform the Audit

Before the Audit

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.

1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,
auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.

2. Read each indicator carefully.

4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no ifindicator is not met,
or N/A for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Done"
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform the test exactly according to the instructions for use of the test manufacturer and
record the results as per facility policy.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.

4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel (head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).
5. Make copies of the audit for each auditor1
observer.

5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure that each indicator has one
response.

6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:

After the Audit

Employee A:
B:
C.

Glenn Close
Tom Hanks
William Hurt
etc.

7. Determine how many staff are to be observed.
I t is recommend that one auditor should
observe no more than three to four staff a t one
time.
8. Define the length of time for observation. It is
recommended that the auditbe conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staffmembercompletely perform the listed activity.

9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.
Auditor should not be assigned to other responsibilities during the audit.

1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.
2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

3. Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
4. For each indicator, calculate compliance percentage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.
5. Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andlor recommendations.

Ancillary Devices
and Equipment

Blood Tubing'
Blood tubing is the conduit through which blood is
taken from the patient, delivered to the dialyzer,
and returned to the patient during dialysis therapy. Blood tubing sets include various combinations of special purpose components in addition to
the tubing itself Common components of a blood
tubing set may include:
Patient Connectors. Both arterial and venous
end pieces of the blood tubing are used to conned
the tubing to the fistula needle, catheter, etc. These
connectors include both simple h e r connectors as
well as h e r locking connectors.
Dialyzer C o ~ e c t o r s . The connection between
the arterial and venous blood lines and the dialyzer itself may be a "soR connector" made of pliable plastic or a "rigid h e r connector."
Other C o ~ e c t o r s .Various other connectors may
be attached to the blood tubing including: heparin
line, pressure monitoring lines, solution administration lines, and other ports. As with the dialyzer connectors and the patient connectors, these
"service line connectors" can either be straight h e r s
or "her lock connectors."
Injection Sites. Also called "access ports," these
are comprised of a "sleeve" around the tubing itself
(composed of latex or a similar material) or a small
similar port attached to another primary component of the blood tubing, such as a bubble trapldrip
chamber. A needle can be directly inserted for the
purpose of administering medications, fluids, obtaining a blood sample, or other purposes. Most
injection sites are (and should be) equipped with
Some sort of hard plastic protection device to guard
against accidental needle sticks to the patient care
staffwhen inserting needles through the injection
site.

Q&irr Assurance Guidelinesfor Hernodialysis Devices

Drip Chambers o r Bubble Traps. These components are used primarily for removing any air
that may have inadvertently entered the extracorporeal circulation. Most dialysis delivery systems
also monitor for air andfor foam in the blood at the
'Genous bubble trap." This is accomplished by ultrasonic or optical sensors which are placed at or
near the bottom of the bubble trap to alert the user
if bubbles are present.
Bubble traps also serve the purpose of "pressure
buffers" in the extracorporeal blood circuit since
there always is some air near the top of these components. Wide pressure variations in the extracorporeal circuit due to variability in vascular access,
the blood pump, or single needle dialysis can be
minimized as compression and expansion of the air
at the tops of these bubble traps occurs.
Blood Pump Segment. The blood bump segment is a short piece of the arterial blood tubing
that is inserted into the roller section of the blood
pump. It is generally made of durable material
(most often polyvinyl chloride (WC) but in some
cases silicone) in order to withstand the constant
mechanical stress placed upon it.

Clamps. Some blood lines are equipped with their
own dedicated clamping devices on the arterial and
venous tubii, heparin administration lines, solution administration lines, monitoring service lines,
and other areas.

Service Tubing. A variety of "service lines" or
"accessory tubing" also appears on most blood tubing sets. These are used for such h c t i o n s as administration of heparin or heparin infusion, solution administration, pressure monitoring, and other
functions.
BIood Tubing. Finally, the tubing itself acts as
the primary conduit of the blood from the patient
to the dialyzer and back to the patient.

Transducer Protectors
The purpose of these devices is to isolate the interior of the blood tubing and protect the pressure
sensor within the dialysis delivery system. Pressure monitoring creates a direct and open channel
between the sterile internal surfaces of the blood
tubing and the non-sterile components of the dialysis delivery system. An impermeable flexible diaphragm or a submicron filter must be placed at
this interface.

Single Needle Devices
"Single needle systemsn accomplish hemodialysis
with only one venipuncture, the flow through the
needle alternating between flow from the patient
to the dialyzer (arterial or fill phase) and flow from
the dialyzer back to the patient (venous or return
phase). While this can also be accomplished with
"dual lumen" catheters, the following discussion is
limited to single lumen, single needle systems.
Single needle systems are comprised of:
a single, intermittently operated blood pump
and a single clamp (venous) or
a single, continuously operatingblood pump and
two clamps (arterial and venous) or
two intermittently operating blood pumps with
no clamps, with pump occlusion providing the
necessary clamping action with the pump off.

Conductivity Meter (Independent Reference Test Meter).
Basically, the independent reference conductivity
meter operates under the same principle as the
conductivity measurement system in the dialysis
delivery system. A variety of such meters are currently available in the United States, however, not
all of these meters are temperature compensated,
which may present measuring problems for the user.
The principle of checking mechanical dilution of
concentrate is an indirect one which depends upon
the specific conductivity of the total ionic content of
the dialysis fluid. Temperature changes influence
measurement by about 1.7% per OC in the range of
38°C. Two electrodes are immersed in the dialysis

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

fluid and an alternating current of high frequency
pulses through the fluid. When changes in temperature are compensated, the only variable will
be the electrical resistance of the dialysis fluid which
will cause an alteration in the current passing between the electrodes which may be read on a meter.
Many of these independent reference conductivity
meters also enable the user to measure other parameters with relation to the dialysate, including
temperature, pressure, and pH.

RISKS AND HAZARDS
Literature prior to 1980 contains a number of reports of patient complications attributed to prob
lems with blood tubing, transducer protectors, single
needle devices, and conductivity meters. Problems
are usually related to manufacturer.'^ error in product design or manufacturing quality control, inappropriately calibrated equipment, user error in ham
dling the devices, or a combination of user error
and design/operation malfunction.
Incidents reported in the literature between 1980
and 1989 are summarized in Appendix A Many
of these incidents could have been avoided by strict
adherence to the manufacturer.'^ instructions for
use, preventative maintenance, repair protocols, as
well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation activities.

Blood lines. There are three guidelines that address blood lines.
The first two, the Association for the Advancement
of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) American National Standard for Hemodialyzer Blood Tubing
(RD17-1984) and the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) Standard for Blood Tub
ing and Dialyzer Connectors, both are directed to
the manufacturers of blood tubing.
A third standard is the HCFA Final Rule: Medicare Program: Protocol for the Reuse of Dialysis
Blood Lines (42 CFR Part 405, Federal Register,
May 2,1990, VoL 55, No. 85, p. 18331-18335). This
rule requires that if a facility reuses blood lines, it
must reuse only a blood line for which the FDA
7-2

has accepted the manufacturer's protocol for reuse
of that particular blood line. Additionally, the facility must reuse blood lines only in accordance
with that protocol.
In the absence of any other standards of practice or
use for dialysis facilities and personnel, we will disCUSS proper use and handling later in this chapter.
Manufacturers' instructions for use serve as the
best standard.
Transducer protedors. Manufacturers' instructions for use will serve as the best standard. The
Centers for Disease Control and Health Care F'inancing Administration stipulate that transducer
protectors should not be reused.
Single needle control. Single needle control
devices are included in the AAMI American National Standard for Hemodialysis Systems as well
as in the IS0 Standard for Hemodialysis Systems.
Manufacturers' instructions for use may serve as
the best standard to follow.
Independent reference meters. Two standards
refer to conductivity reference standards including:
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (N.I.S.T.); and the Organization of Legal Metrology (a European bureau similar to the N.I.S.T.).
The standards relate to specific aqueous electrolytic conductance.

QUALITY ASSURANCE

Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures concerning ancillary equip
ment and supplies as they relate to the hemodialysis therapy must be developed, written, implemented
and evaluated. All standards previously described
must be incorporated into these policies and procedures.
Specifically,the policies and procedures should address
purpose and function of each device, use, maintenance, safety factors, troubleshooting and repair,
and related documentation. The risks involved must
be clearly identified and considered, and appropriate safety measures and preventative systems developed. Specifically, the procedures must address

storage and inventory control, usehandling, disposal, complication management, and repair.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should describe all personnel responsibilities for handling and use of ancillary s u p
plies and equipment, ordering, confirmation of proper
labeling, testing and monitoring, and other similar
responsibilities. Each responsibility should stem
from a specific policy or procedure.
Staff training should be a well defined and organized process. Content should be clearly defined for
the learner and based on behavioral objectives. The
behavioral objectives can be used to accurately and
objectively measure learning. At the end of the
sessiods), the instructor should confirm by a written test andlor return demonstration that learning
has occurred and that the learner is able to perform the procedure(s) independently without error.
Testing results should be documented and placed
in the employee's personnel file.
Comprehension of the purpose and function of each
piece of equipment or supply requires a basic understanding of normal physiological concepts, as
well as responses associated with uremia and the
hemodialysis therapy. Content should include principles of dialysis, patient response to therapy and
related complications, aseptic technique and inventory control. The interrelationships of each device
and the delivery system, dialysate, dialyzer, etc.
must be incorporated into the training process.
Need for W h e r education, such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions, can be determined
from the routine quality assurance monitoring process and the ongoing staff performance appraisal
process. When problems are identified, all staff
should be made aware of the problem and be involved in its solution. This nearly always includes
problem specific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
authorize that the individual has successfidly completed the initial education and training program.
The medical director is also responsible for assuring that an annual performance evaluation has been
performed.

Monitoring and Evaluation
To assure patient safety through the proper use of
ancillary equipment and supplies as well as test
instruments, the following monitoring activities are
recommended.

Blood Tubing
A. Daily Monitoring
On a per-treatment basis, patient care staff should
confirm that the blood lines are compatible with
the delivery system and dialyzer, and that packaging and all caps on the blood tubing sets are intact,
ensuring that the manufacturer's intent for a sterile, non-pyrogenic extracorporeal circuit is maintained.

A physical check of all blood line connectors (dialyzer, accessory ports, heparin syringe, etc.) should
be confirmed before attachment to the patient and
starting the blood pump. Arterial and venous pressure alarms should be appropriately set to detect
excess pressures that could cause line separation.

A pyrogen reaction (shaking chills, increase in
patient temperature of more than 1°C during
treatment) or septicemia (identified through blood
cultures) may be the result of an improperly
sterilized blood line.
Air embolism (evidence of air in blood lines and
.entering patients, chest pain, dyspnea, coughing, cyanosis, visual problems, confusion, coma)
that may be the result of the disconnection of
specific connectors in the blood line set or air
entering through a damaged component.

C. Other Monitoring
An incoming materials log should be maintained.
Included in this log should be the identification of
the product, delivery date, lot number, and person
receiving the products. Confirmation that the product is labeled as ordered should be performed. Any
product with labels not intact or incorrectly labeled
should not be accepted.

An annual review of all policies and procedures
related to blood tubing handling should be performed.

All incidents or adverse occurrences related to blood
A visual inspection of the blood tubing and blood
tubing connectors for damage, leaks, and whole or
partial occlusions, etc., should be performed.
Assure that the aidfoam detector is in the proper
position and armed.

tubing should be documented and reported at the
monthly quality assurance meetings.

D. Prevention
Follow exactly all of the manufacturer's instructions for use.

At the time of setup, all connectors and lines should
be inspected by the staff member to ensure absence of kinks, partial occlusions, or other physical
damage.

Transducer Protectors

All connections should be double checked for secure fitting.

A Daily Monitoring

B. Patient Monitoring

Visually confirm that the packaging and caps are
intact before use.

The following should be part of regular intradialytic monitoring and may be related to malfunction
or improper use of blood lines:

Visually confirm that the transducer protector does
not contain water or blood a t the beginning of treatment and periodically throughout treatment.

Acute blood loss (obvious source of blood spill,
shock, vomiting, convulsions) that may be the
result of extreme pressures in the blood circuit
or poor connections, resulting in disconnection
of connectors or other leaking from the blood
lines.

Assure that the transducer protectors are compatible with specific dialysis delivery systems.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Henodialysis Devices

Double check that connections of the transducer
protector to the dialysis delivery system and to pressure monitoring tubing of the blood tubing set are
secure.

Before use, the staff member setting up the system
should confirm that the transducer pmtedor does
not have occluded ports, cracks, or any other physical damage-

B. Other Monitoring
An incorning materials log should be maintained.
This log should include the idenacation of the
delivery date, lot number, and person remiving the product, confirmation that the product
is labeled as ordered should be performed. Any
products with labels that are not intact or that are
incorrectly labeled should not be accepted.
An annual review of d l policies and procedures
related to transducer protectors should be performed.
All incidents or adverse occurrences related to transducer protectors should be documented and reported
at the monthly quality assurance meetings.

ing function, patient safety, and treatment effectiveness.

Conductivity Meters (Independent
Reference Meters)
A. Daily Monitoring
Most conductivity meters include a "self-test" function of electronic circuitry and battery. If the user's
meter is equipped with this fimction, the "self-test"
should be performed before every use.
Before using a meter to recalibrate a dialysis delivery system, the conductivity meter should be checked,
according to manufacturer's instructions, with a
standard conductivity solution. That conductivity
should be entered on a regular conductivity meter
log (see Form 1a t the end of this chapter).

C. Prevention

Manufacturers of some conductivity meters recommend that proper calibration of the meter be confirmed with standard solution daily.

Follow exactly all of the manufacturer's instructions for use.

B. Monthly Monitoring

SingleNeedle Equipment
A Daily Monitoring
During setup, check that the blood clamp andlor
blood pump occludes tubing and interrupts flow.
Confirmation that pressure alarms are set according to manufacturer's specifications.
Calculate the stroke volume at the beginning of
treatment and confirm that the stroke volume fits
within the prescription and the manufacturer's recommendations.

On no less than a monthly basis, conductivity meter calibration should be confirmed using a Standard Conductivity Solution following manufacture&

Guidelines for Hemodialysis Devices

Chapter 8

Anticoagulation

BACKGROUND
Hemodialysistreatment is dependent upon the
free flowof blood over the dialysis membrane and

through the arterial and venous blood tubing.
Blood, however, has a normal tendency to clot
when it comes in contact with a foreign surface
such as the extracorporeal circuit of the artificial
kidney. It is necessary to prevent this clotting
during dialysis. The purpose of anticoagulation
duringhemodialysis is to prevent blood clottingin
the extracorporeal circuit.
There are a variety of anticoagulation techniques
that are employed for hemodialysis:
Systemic: Systemic heparinization prolongs the
patient's clotting time, preventing thrombus formation in the extracorporeal circuit. This is
achieved by continuous or intermittent infusion of
heparin throughout the dialysis treatment. A
heparin loading dose, or bolus, is usually given
prior to the initiation of dialysis. During dialysis,
heparin is injected into the arterial blood line
using either an infusion pump to deliver a continuous amount of heparin throughout the dialysis, or periodic intermittent injections of heparin
into the extracorporeal circuit.
Regional Heparinization: This method of anticoagulation is used when the patient is a t risk for
hemorrhage or where systemic anticoagulation is
contraindicated by the patient's condition. Regional heparinization is the continuous infusion
of heparin into the the arterial bloodline assuring
anticoagulation of the extracorporeal circuit. At
the same time, protamine sulfate solution is infused into the venous bloodline. This neutralizes
the effectofheparin before the blood is returnedto
the patient. l%sadvantages associated with regional heparinization include the difficulty of
simultaneous dosage determination for both
heparin and the protamine sulfate as well a s the
potential for post-therapy heparin-rebound,
resulting in hypercoagulability.

Quality h s ~ r n w eGuidelines for Hernodialysis Dovices

Low Dose Heparinization: An alternative to
regional heparinization is minimal, controlled,
tight or low dose heparinization. The objective is
to administer, either continuously or intermittently, just enough heparin systemicallyto slightly
elevate the patient's clotting time so that the
dialyzer does not clot. This requires close monitoring by frequent clotting time measurements.
R e g i o n a l C i t r a t e A n t i c o a g u l a t i o n : This
method of anticoagulation infuses sodium citrate
into the arterial bloodline to complex calcium and
prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit.
Calcium is infused into the venous bloodline to
restore serum calcium to normal limits. The
dialysate used must be calcium-free. The patient
must be closely monitored for hypocalcemia and
citrate toxicity.
Heparin-free: Using high blood flow rates and
intermittent saline flushes of the dialyzer throughout dialysis, dialysis can be achieved using no
heparin or other anticoagulant.
There are also a variety of techniques for monitoring anticoagulation. They are:
Activated clotting time (ACT)
Lee-White clotting time (LWCT)
Whole blood activated partial thromboplastin
time (WBFTT)
Plasma partial thromboplastin time ~P'I"l')
To determine an effective anticoagulation regimen for the patient, three key patient parameters
must be assessed: normal or baseline clotting
time, response and sensitivity to heparin, and
elimination rate of heparin.

RISKS AND HAZARDS
The most common complication reported in the
literature pertinent to anticoagulation therapy is
hemorrhage. The incidence of post dialysis bleed-

ing secondary to dialysis-related heparinization
h a s been reported to be a s high as 21%.
The risk of hemorrhage is so significant that heparin infusion is contraindicated in patients with
pre-existing bleeding tendencies such a s hemophilia, jaundice, post-operative oozing, threatened abortion, bacterial endocarditis, suspected
intracranial hemorrhage, inaccessible ulcerative
lesions especially of the gastrointestinal tract,
heparin hypersensitivity, and shock.

Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationships of anticoagulation,
the patient, and the dialyzer. The risks involved
mustbe clearly identified and considered, and ap
propriate safety measures and preventative systems developed.

Several factors such as fever, drugs like digitalis
and tetracycline, nicotine, and antihistamines
affect the activity of heparin. One might even
expect that the same patient may react differently
a t different times to the same dose ofheparin. The
variables inherent in the drug also effect patient
response including commercial source, molecular
weight, and potency from lot to lot. The effectiveness of heparin can be altered when in contact
with pH levels (dialysate) exceeding a normal
range. It has also been reported that heparin
tolerance varies not only in different individuals,
but in the same individual during surgical procedures.

Policies and procedures must also address safe
and effective operation of the equipment used to
deliver and monitor anticoagulation during dialysis:

patient education

The best guidelines to follow must be those of the
manufacturer's instructions for use. This includes instructions for use of the drugs as well as
the equipment related to drug administration and
anticoagulation monitoring. Current literature,
including anticoagulation research, must be reviewed and facility policies and procedures updated accordingly.

QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR
ANTICOAGULATION
Policies and Procedures
An essential step in designing the facility's quality assurance program is the development, implementation, and evaluation of policies and procedures for hemodialysis anticoagulation. All
standards previously described must be incorporated into these policies and procedures. Specifically, the policies and procedures must address
the scope of care and therapeutic choices, equipment, disposables, and supplies.
Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should include all personnel responsibilities for handling and use of anticoagulants, infusion pumps, monitoring devices, daily
or per-treatment safety and other system checks,
recordkeeping pertinent to anticoagulation, and
other similar responsibilities.
Staff training should be a well-defined and organized program. Content should be clearly defined
for the learner and based on behavioral objectives.
The behavioral objectives can be used to accurately and objectively measure learning. At the
end of the session(s), the instructor should confirm by a written test and/or return demonstration that Ieaminghas occurred and that the learner
is able to perform the pmcedure(s) independently
without error. The results of the testing process
shouldbe documented and placed in the ernplo~@*~
personnel file.

comprehension of the purpose and function of
anticoagulationrequires a basic understanding of
normal
concepts, a s well a s responses
a s w c i a t d with uremia and the hemodialysis
therapy. Content should include principles of
dialysis, patient response to therapy and related
mmplicati~n~,
aseptic technique, monitoring, care
and patient education.
Need for further education such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions can be determined
from the ongoing quality monitoring process and
the continuous staff performance appraisal process. When problems are identified, all staff should
be made aware of the problem and be involved in
its solution; this nearly always includes problemspecific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
authorize that the individual has successfully
the initial education and training program. The medical director is also responsible for
assuring that an annual review has been performed.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The following section provides a summary of recommendations for monitoring that should be performed to enhance safety and reduce the level of
risk of patient injury due to incidents related to
malfunction andlor improper use of equipment
related to anticoagulation:

A. Daily Monitoring
1. Confirm anticoagulation goals as prescribed.
2. Confirm vial contents and strength.
3. Confirm the use of aseptic technique in han-

dling the device.
4. Inspect syringes and connectors for damage,

6. Monitor the anticoagulation level until stabilized. After stabilization, monitor a s per physician directive or whenever problems are
suspected.

B. Monthly Monitoring
1. Confirm proper calibration of the monitoring
device using standard provided by the manufacturer.
2. Confirm proper calibration of infusion pumps
following the manufacturer's recommendations.

3. Complete monitoring documentation ofall preventative maintenance to assure that it is
performed within the scheduled timeframe
and according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

C . Patient Monitoring
The anticoagulation regimen should be based on
the clotting time results, patient's condition, patency of the extracorporeal circuit, and response to
previous anticoagulation. The patient should be
assessed by reviewing hematocrit, clotting studies, and history of complications per facility policy. Anticoagulant administered and results of
monitoringshouldbe documented on the patient's
daily dialysis record (see Form 1).

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient,
home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed by
the medical director a s appropriate.

E. Other Monitoring
1. Trend monitoring and analysis of various
complications, including incidents or adverse
occurrences related to anticoagulation should
be conducted.

leaks, and whole or partial occlusions. All connections should be double checked for secure
fit.

2. Trend monitoring and analysis of monitoring
equipment can be documented using Form 2.

5. Administer the drug within the time frame
specified by the manufacturer or as close to
syringe preparation as possible. The individual preparing the drug for infusion must administer the drug.

The patient should be advised as to the side effects
of heparin therapy and should be encouraged to
report any unusual changes prior to the initiation
of each dialysis. The patient should also be informed of how to prevent hemorrhaging or bleed-

Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Chapter 9

Vascular access, for purposes of hemodialysis, is
the patient's life-line. I t has been stated that
each time there is a real or potential threat to
the patient's access, the patient experiences a
sense of impending death. (Lundin, 1989). For
patients with multiple vascular access problems,
this experience can be extraordinarily stressful,
limiting the sense of well being, quality of life,
and certainly rehabilitation.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF
DEVICES
To perform long-term hemodialysis, reliable access to the blood circulation is required. A fully
functional and patent access is imperative.
Access can be achieved in a number of ways.
For each of the following accesses, there are various modifications, types and brands.

External Arteriovenous Shunt. This consists
of two rigid Teflon@ tips implanted in an artery
and a vein with Silastica tubing attached to
the Teflon tips in the vessels. Each piece of the
Silastic tubing is brought to the outside of the
skin and connected together for continuous blood
flow. When used for hemodialysis, the two Silastic tubings are separated and attached to the
two bloodlines leading to and from the dialyzer.
Although not commonly used today, the shunt
can be used a s a temporary access while the
patient is awaiting maturation of an internal
fistula, or for acute or reversible renal failure.

Internal Arteriovenous Fistula. The fistula
is created with a surgical anastamosis between
an artery and a vein. This allows increased blood
flow through the vein, causing engorgement and
enlargement. When the vein has had an opportunity to mature, large bore needles are inserted
into the vein to provide blood access for hemodialysis. The fistula is the ideal access for longterm hemodialysis.

Vascular Access
Internal Arteriovenous Graft. This is the
surgical implant of a biologic or artificial graft.
The ends of the graft are surgically attached to
an artery and a vein. Large bore needles are inserted into the graft to provide blood access. The
graft can be used for long-term hemodialysis.
There are various configurations of the surgical
anastomoses.
Temporary Access. A catheter can be used on
a short term or temporary basis for vascular access. It is frequently used while a more permanent access can be created or when the patient
may be waiting for a different type of renal replacement therapy such as transplantation.
Long-term use of the temporary access is not
uncommon today. The locations for placement
of these catheters are usually the subclavian
vein, the femoral vein, and occasionally the jugular vein.

RISKS AND HAZARDS
The literature has reported several problems associated with vascular access types and devices.
It has been noted that the primary reason for
hospitalization of the hemodialysis patient is
related to the vascular access.
The risks and hazards identified in the literature can be classified into the following categories:

MechaniCaYtechnique. These are the incidents
which pertain to the cannulation or venipuncture techniques used and the reports regarding
performance of the various devices used for access, including flow and long term durability.
Infectious complications. There are numerous incidents related to various microbiological
organisms that have resulted in serious infections and are related to surgical techniques, venipuncture or handling techniques.

Qmlity Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

In the manufacturer's literature and the medical device reporting system, the incidents related to vascular access devices can be divided
into three categories:

Mechanical. Reports pertaining to mechanical
risks or hazards are related to hubs, lines andl
or connectors separating from each other before,
during, and after treatment. These unexpected
disconnections create numerous problems with
bleeding, excess vessel trauma, and even death.
Also reported are cracks in connectors or tubing, causing blood loss or air inhsion leading to
air embolus. Other incidents are reported that
pertain to kinking of tubing, faulty packaging,
etc.
Infection. There are numerous reports of various organisms that have caused patient morbidity or access failure. These organisms were analyzed and found to be due to improper technique
in either the handling or use of the device.
Physiological complications. Incidents include aneurysms, thrombus, hemothorax, pneumothorax, infection and sepsis, fibrin deposition,
dermatitis from the device material, excessive
bleeding around the access site (during and after dialysis), and injury and loss of access due to
inappropriate administration of drugs.

EXISTING GUIDELINES
The best guidelines to follow are the manufacturer's instructions for use. Current research
related to each particular vascular access device
in use within the facility must be reviewed and
evaluated for use a s a new or modified facility
standard.

QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR
VASCULAR ACCESS DEVICES
Policies and Procedures
Policies a n d procedures concerning vascular
access devices and supplies as they relate to the
hemodialysis therapy must be developed, written, implemented and evaluated. All standards
previously described must be incorporated into
these policies and procedures.

The policies and procedures should address the
purpose and function, use, safety factors, monitoring, preventive measures, patient education,
and related documentation. The risks involved
must be clearly identified and considered, and
appropriate safety measures and preventative
systems developed. Specifically, the procedures
must address storage and inventory control, use/
handling, complication management, anticoagulation therapy, and care post operatively, as well
a s before, during and after the dialysis treatment.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should describe all personnel
responsibilities for handling and use of vascular
access devices. Each responsibility should stem
from a specific policy or procedure.
Staff training should be a well-defined and organized process. Content should be clearly defined for the learner and based on behavioral
objectives. The behavioral objectives can be used
to accurately and objectively measure learning.
At the end of the session(s), the instructor should
confirm by written test andlor return demonstration that learning has occurred and that the
learner is able to perform the procedure(s) independently without error. Test results should be
documented and placed in employee's personnel
file.
There needs to be comprehension of the purpose
and function of each vascular access device being
used within the facility and a basic understanding of normal physiological concepts, as well as
responses associated with uremia and the hemodialysis therapy. Content should include principles of dialysis, patient response to therapy and
related complications, aseptic technique, and, for
each access device type, indications for use, advantages and disadvantages, monitoring, care,
complications, anticoagulation, patient education
and venipuncturehandling technique. The interrelationships of each device and the delivery
system, dialysate, dialyzer, etc. must be incorporated into the training process.
Need for further education such as inservices or
intensive educational sessions can be determined

from the routine quality assurance monitoring
process and the ongoing staff performance appraisal process. When problems are identified,
all staff should be made aware of the problem
and be involved in its solution; this nearly always includes problem specific continuing education.

Recirculation may be calculated by direct measurement according to the following formula:

The medical director of the dialysis facility must
authorize that the individual has successfully
completed the initial education and training
program. The medical director is also responsible for assuring that a n annual performance
evaluation has been performed.

A = sample from arterial blood line (BUN)

Monitoring and Evaluation
To assure patient safety and device effectiveness, the following monitoring activities are recommended:

A. Daily Monitoring

% recirculation =

P

where,

P = peripheral concentration (BUN)
V = sample from venous bloodline (BUN)

B. Monthly Monitoring
1. Complications associated with venipuncture.

2. Hospitalizations associated with vascular access infections, revisions, or other related
complications.

C. Patient Monitoring
Continuous assessment for signs and symptoms
of vascular access complications:
1. Occlusion, mechanical failure

1. Inspect the device and connectors for damage, leaks, and whole or partial occlusions,
etc. All connections should be double checked
for secure fitting.

2. Thrombosis

2. Verifj. access patency and flow direction.

4. Skin erosion

3. Confirm the use of aseptic technique in handling the access device.

5. Dislodgement

4. Monitor anticoagulation therapy until stabilized.

7. Aneurysm; psuedoaneurysm

5. Monitor arterial and venous pressures.
6. Monitor blood flow rate.

7. Assess for signs and symptoms of complications.

8. It may become apparent that the prescribed
treatment is not being delivered as evidenced
by:
.a. Increase in patient's blood chemistries such

as BUN, creatinine, potassium, etc.
b. Percent reduction in urea significantly less
than prescribed.
c. Apparent change in flow andfor pressure.

In such a case the patient's vascular access
should be evaluated for recirculation.

3. Infection

6. Hemorrhage

8. Arterial insufficiency, steal syndrome

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
All of the monitoring procedures described above
should be performed by the home dialysis patient, home dialysis support personnel, and reviewed by the medical director as appropriate.

E. Other Monitoring
1. Trend monitoring and analysis of various
complications, including incidents or adverse
occurrences related to venipuncture.
2. Trend monitoring and analysis of hospitalizations due to vascular access devices.

3. Trend monitoring and analysis of the reliability of a vascular access device.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF
PROCESS
Hemodialyzer reuse is the practice of using the
same dialyzer for multiple dialyses without replacement of membranes or other surfaces in contact
with blood. This is accomplished utilizing restoration techniques including cleaning the blood surfaces, followed by disinfection or sterilization.
Dialyzer reprocessing can be performed manually
or through use of an automated, c o m m e d l y available "reprocessing system." Most automated reprocessing systems automatically rinse the dialyzer
of residual blood and blood products, perform some
manner of "cleaning" process, test the dialyzer for
leaks and performance parameters, and fill the dialyzer with an appropriate concentration of a germicide. Some automated systems also provide data
storage and labeling functions automatically.

A variety of materials are commonly used in dialyzer reprocessing including cleaning agents, germicidal agents, and purified water used to dilute
both of the above. Commonly used cleaning agents
include hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, reverse ultratiltration of water from the dialysate compartment into the blood compartment and out through
the blood ports, and pressurized water. Germicides used for the high level disinfection required
for dialyzer reuse include formaldehyde, peroxyacetic acid (trade name Renalinq, glutaraldehyde
(trade names Sporicidin@,Nephre*, Cide*) and
others.
In 1990 the FDA produced and released a vide
otape entitled Reprocessing $HemOdialyzers which
has been distributed to all U.S. dialysis facilities.

RISKS AND HAZARDS
The literature prior to 1980 includes reports of patient
complications attributed to problems with dialyzer
Ruse. The problems were due to user error with

Hemodialyzer
Reuse
an established procedure or the use of an inappropriate procedure. The literature describes patient
experiences with pyrogen reactions, boluses of toxic
chemicals, decreased adequacy of dialysis,blood loss,
and potential immunological problems.
The 20 incidents that have been reported since 1980
are summarized in Appendix A
Fifteen incidents were related to pyrogen reactions andlor bacteremia, due to inappropriate
water treatment. The causes included use of
endotoxin-contaminated water and too low a
concentration of germicide used to disinfect the
dialyzers.
Four incidents involved patient reactions to residual germicide.
One case was related to excessive ultrdltration rate.
Many of the incidents could have been avoided through
simple tests, observations, and/or quality control
procedures implemented in the dialysis facilities.

EXISTING GUIDELINES
Unlike many other technical areas of hemodialysis,
hemodialyzer reuse has comprehensive standards
of practice. The practice is regulated by HCFA according to 42 Part 405.2150. The regulation, incorporating the Association for the Advancement of
Medical Instnunentation(AAMI)Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers, contains standards
and conditions for safe and effective hemodialyzer
reuse and reprocessing, enforceable as conditions
of Medicare coverage.
Table 1reviews the AAMI Recommended Practice
for Reuse of Hemodialyzers. The Recommended
Practice addresses facility requirements, reuse equip
ment, cleaning and disinfection methods, labeling,
preparation for multiple use, controls, and patient
aspects.

Several states, including California, Colorado, Georgia, and Washington DC,also have regulations pertinent to the reuse of hemodialyzers.

QUALITY ASSURANCE

Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures concerning the reuse of
hemodialyzers must be developed, written, implemented, and evaluated. All standards and regulations previously described must be incorporated into
these policies and procedures. Spedcally, the policies and procedures must address disposables, equip
ment, personnel, practice, and the patient
Comprehensive policies and procedures must also
address the interrelationships of reuse, the dialyzer,
and the delivery system. The risks involved must
be clearly identified and considered, and appropriate safety measures and preventative systems developed and incorporated.
Specifically, policies and procedures must assure
the safe and effective operation of a reuse program:
Reprocessing Equipment:
Equipment operation
Basic technical operation
Setup and use of the equipment and related
components
Safety checks
Preventive maintenance
Cleaning and disinfection
Troubleshooting and repair
Mixing and storage of cleaning agents and germicides.
Testing for presence or absence of germicide;
effectiveness of germicide.
Labeling.
Recordkeeping.
Storage of reprocessed dialyzers.

H Dialyzer performance validation.
I. Patient monitoring.

Staff Training and Continuing
Education
Role descriptions should include all personnel responsibilities for the operation, preventative maintenance, repairs of reprocessing equipment, daily
safety andlor system checks, appropriate recordkeep
ing, acceptance of incoming supplies and inventory
control, performance and safety checks of reprocessed dialyzers, and other similar responsibilities.
Each responsibility should stem from a specificpolicy
or procedure.
Staff training should be a well-defined and organized process. Content should be clearly defined for
the learner and based on behavioral objectives. These
objectives can be used to accurately and objectively
measure learning. At the end of the session(s), the
instructor should confirm by written test andlor
return demonstration that learning has occurred
and that the learner is able to perform the procedure(s)
independently without error. Test results should
be documented and placed in employee's personnel
file.
Comprehension of reuse principles and practices
requires a basic understanding of normal physiological concepts, as well as the basic principles of
hemodialysis therapy. Content should include the
facility's specific reprocessing procedures, documentation requirements, aseptic technique, collection
and handling of specimens, risks and hazards of
multiple use, consequences of not performing tasks
correctly, risks and hazards associated with toxic
substances used in the reprocessing procedure,
emergency actions, and principles of infection control.
Need for fiuther education such as inservices or intensive educational sessions can be determined from
the routine quality assurance monitoring process
and the ongoing staff performance appraisal process (see Forms 1, 2, and 3). When need for improvement or problems are identified, all staff should
be made aware of the problem and be involved in
solution identification and implementation. This
nearly always includes problem specific continuing
education.

Preparation of the reprocessed dialyzer for use.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

The medical director must approve the written
curriculum for training. The medical director of
the facility, or his or her designee, must verify
that the individual has successfXly completed the
initial education and the training program. The
medical director is also responsible for assuring
that an annual performance appraisal has been
performed.

Verify by the time and date the dialyzer was
filled with germicide, noted on the dialyzer label, that the "dwell time" for the germicide has
been a t least the minimum recommended by
the manufacturer (see Form 5).
Prior to initiating dialysis, staff, and the patient when possible, should confirm that the
dialyzer about to be used is the patient's dialyzer. This can be accomplished by comparing
patient name and medical record number (or
other secondary identification) on the dialyzer
label with the same information on the patient's
chart (see Form 5).

Monitoring and Evaluation
This section provides a summary of recommendations for monitoring and evaluation that should be
performed to enhance the safety and reduce the
level of risk of patient injury due to incidents related to the reuse of hemodialyzers, and to assure
the efficacy of dialyzers that have been reprocessed.

StafF should test that the level of residual germicide (absence of germicide) aRer "rinse out"
and before clinical use of the dialyzer is a t or
below acceptable levels (see Form 5).

Any tests recommended by the manufacturer to
confirm proper functioning of the reuse system
must be performed (see Form 1).

k Daily Monitoring
Dialyzer performance must be validated during
the reprocessing procedure by total cell volume
0
andor membrane resistance as determined
by in vitro ultrafiltration rate. Alternatively, if
the facility performs urea kinetic modeling the
"actual dialyzer clearance" data from the kinetic modeling program may be correlated with
TCV. Documentation of the information/test
results is required (see Form 4).

B. Monthly Monitoring
1. Confirm that all water used in the reprocessing

program (dialyzer rinsing and cleaning, dilution of germicides and cleaning chemicals) meets
AAMI microbiological requirements. Not more
than 200 colony-forming units per ml of water
andlor not more than 1ndml bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin), as measured by Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (LAL), should be
present.

2. A test of membrane integrity (leak rate) for each
dialyzer need be done only if the leak rate of
the reprocessed dialyzers is greater than the
leak rate of new dialyzers. If the reprocessing
equipment includes such a test, it should certainly be a routine monitoring activity (see Form
4).

3. The person performing the dialyzer reprocessing, the staff member setting up a reprocessed
dialyzer and, when possible, the patient, should
verify that the dialyzer does not appear to be
physically damaged, the reuse label on the dialyzer is complete and legible, the headers ofthe
dialyzer do not contain any large quantities of
dotted blood or other materials, and that the
hollow fibers appear to be relatively free of any
blood product (see Forms 4 and 5).
4. A statistically significant number of dialyzers

should be checked for concentration of germicide adequate for effective high level disinfection before "rinse out" prior to clinical use (see
Form 5).

It should be noted that the choice as to which
test (bacterial counts or LAL) to perform is one
that should be carellly evaluated. For example,
with certain water treatment system configurations, performing only bacterial counts may yield
acceptableresults, while utilizing concurrent LAL
testing would indicate a potential problem. The
simpler bacterial count methodology may not
always identify a problem, and could place patients at risk.
2. If formaldehyde is used in the dialyzer reprocessing program, formaldehyde vapors should be
monitored a t least monthly and whenever indicated by discomfort of personnel or patients.

Additionally, OSHA has set mandatory maximum
formaldehyde levels:

Qmlity Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

8-hour time weighted average CrWA) exposure
limit = 1ppm

Trend analysis, performed by the quality assurance committee, should include patient adverse
reactions such as fever, chills, improper ultrafiltration, unexpected changesin BUN and matinine,
incident reports, small molecule clearances, levels of toxic chemicals, other dialyzer failures
(leaks, structural damage, etc.), equipment maintenance, and repair logs (see Form 6).

15 minute short-term exposure limit (STEL) =
2 PPm
Action level (AL) = 0.5 ppm in 8 hour TWA
See Chapter 12 for a hrther dicsucssion on OSHA
Regulations.

C. Patient Monitoring
1. Routine blood chemistries may provide an indi-

cation of the effectiveness of the reuse procedure and subsequent dialyzer performance.
2. Routine intradialytic monitoring of the patient's
physiological parameters and symptomotology
during the dialysis treatment can provide indications of adverse events related to reuse. A
few of the symptoms seen are:
a Hypotension or hypertension, related to improper ultrafiltration due to change in dialyzer performance characteristics.
b. Pymgen reaction (shaking chills, increase in
patient temperature of more than 1°C during
treatment) or septicemia (identified through
blood cultures), from improper disinfection of
the dialyzer or endotoxin in the dialyzer.
c. Acute blood loss (obvious source of blood spill,

shock, vomiting, convulsions),from membrane
damage related to dialyzer reprocessing
d Pain around vascular access site, respiratory
symptoms, and other indications of toxic or
allergic reaction, caused by incomplete removal
of the germicide from the dialyzer before use.
e. Increase in the patient's requirements for

anticoagulation, related to excess clotting in
reused dialyzers.

D. Home Dialysis Monitoring
When reuse is performed at home, all of the monitoring procedures described above should be performed by the home dialysis patient, home dialysis
support personnel, and reviewed by the medical
director.

3. ~e;formanceappraisal of all personnel participating in the reuse program should be performed.
4. An annual review of facility policies and procedures for applicability to current best practices
and current standards and regulations must be
completed.

F. Prevention
All equipment must be free of defects that may be
a potential hazard to patients or personnel. An established preventative maintenance program must
be implemented and evaluated.
Before equipment is placed back in use (following
maintenance or repair), confirmation must assure
that all aspects of the device are functioning according to manufacturers' specificationsand procedures.
Water quality for all aspects of the reuse process
must be tested and evaluated to assure compliance
with AAML standard and federal regulation.
All components of the reprocessing equipment must
be tested and safety parameters set prior to use.

G. Purchasing Guidelines
Any dialyzer reprocessing system being considered
for use should comply with the federal regulations.
which incorporate the AAMI Recommended Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers. Any state or local
regulations which apply for the specificfacility should
also be met.
1. Equipment

E. Other Monitoring
1. All safety equipment and supplies (protective
equipment and clothing, emergency equipment,
spill control supplies, etc.) should be inspected
to confirm usability and proper condition (see
Form 4).

~uality
Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Complete instructions for use must be available.
Instructions for preventative maintenance and
repair of the equipment are required.
Training for facility personnel in equipment use
is essential.

The system should be equipped with indicators
that show proper function.
Specifications for utilities must be met, including water pressure, flow rate, chemical quality,
bacterial and pyrogenic quality, electrical and
drain requirements.

that are included in the Material Safety Data
Sheet (MSDS) for the particular chemical.
b. Germicides

Design of the reprocessing system should assure ease of disinfection.
Upon installation and prior to clinical use, validation of dialyzer performance test methods and
tests of concentration of germicide must be performed.
The system should be designed to minimize any
exposure to potentially toxic substances, i-e.,
closed exhaust system for venting toxic fumes,
systems to minimize skin or eye contact with
toxic liquids, etc.
2. Chemicals

Two types of chemicals are commonly purchased
for dialyzer reprocessing, cleaning agents and germicides.
a Cleaning Agents
The facility should validate that a specificcleaning agent does not substantially alter the performance or safety characteristics of the dialyzer.
All cleaning agents must be compatible with
the membrane, the potting material, and the
casing of the dialyzer, as well as with all components of the automated dialyzer reprocessing system or manual reprocessing system.
The facility should obtain or establish, for all
cleaning agents used, safe handling practices

Guidelines

Hernodialysis Devices

The facility should assure that the germicide,
when used according to the manufacturer's
instructions, is a t least as effective in killing
microbial contaminants as 4% formaldehyde
with a minimum contact time of 24 hours
and a temperature of at least 20°C.
The germicide used should be shown to be
compatible with the dialyzer membrane, the
dialyzer potting material, and the casing, as
well as all components of the manual or automated dialper reprocessing system.
The manufacturer of the germicide should provide andlor the facility should develop policies and procedures for minimizing risk related to airborne toxicity, as well as direct
skin or eye contact. The Material Safety Data
Sheet for the chemical should be obtained.
Instructions should be obtained for inspection
of the chemical upon receipt to assure that it
is being delivered in a manner that will render it effective for its intended use.
Storage and environmentalrequirements should
be specified.
Information regarding compatibilitywith other
chemicals (other germicides, cleaning agents,
etc.) should be obtained.
Appropriate tests or test kits for determining
the concentration of the germicide in solution, as well as the relative presence of the
germicide and absence of the germicide, should
be developed or secured.

When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures, compliance should be very high.

Before the Audit
1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the

changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staffmember completely perform the listed activity.
9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.
Auditor should not be assigned to other responsibilities during the audit.

Perform the Audit
1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,

auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),

2. Read each indicator carefully.

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.
4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, Nfor no ifindicator is not met,
or NIA for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Done"
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform the test exactly according to the instructions for use of the test manufacturer and
record the results a s per facility policy.

Infection Control

BACKGROUND

H e d i a l y s i s which has been distributed to all dialysis facilities in the United States.

Infection control is a mechanism by which the adherence, colonization, or invasion of an infectious
organism is prevented. Infection control is used in
dialysis units to prevent patients from acquiring
infections specific to the dialysis unit. The purpose
of infection control is to ensure the prevention of infections through appropriately applied policies and
procedures. Continuous surveillance and other monitoring and evaluation activities assist in identi@ing factors that may influence the occurrence of infections.
Although the risk to patients and staff in a hemodialysis unit for contact with viral and bacterial infections is quite high, the use and monitoring of
carefully developed procedures can significantly limit
the degree of risk involved. The Center for Disease
Control (CDC) has reported that from 1980 to 1985
attention to infection control has systematicallydecreased the incidence of Hepatitis B among dialysis
patients and staff alike. Infection control procedures in hemodialysis today require isolation of HBV
patients. The CDC notes that isolation of HIV patients is not necessary.
Further, the CDC has noted that infections due to
contaminated water, dialysate, andlor dialyzers have
been significantly reduced as a result of appropriately applied surveillance and control efforts. Infection control-oriented procedures for vascular access
venipuncture and other direct invasions to the patients
circulatory system have been shown to successfully
Protect the patient from exposure to infection.
Each manufacturer describes the infection control
strategies that are to be employed for their particular medical device in the directions for use. Within
this manual, infection control is addressed for each
Of these devices in the respective chapters. This
Particular chapter will focus on the control of bloodborne infections.

In D ~ m b e rof 1989 the FDA produced and re-

& a videotape entitled Infection Control for

EXISTING GUIDELINES
Throughout the years the CDC has issued and u p
dated blood-borne infection control strategies and
precautions (including universal precautions) for the
renal dialysis community as well as other health
care agencies. The dialysis community has complied with the CDC recommendations over the years
as a voluntary standard. Now the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)has regulations that would enforce the use of universal precautions as well as other infection control s t r a k
gies for all of health care.
Federal OSHA Regulation, Subpart Z of 29CFR
Part 1910.1030, addresses control of blood-borne
pathogens. The regulation specifies facility infection control strategies as follows.

1. Written Plan
It is expected that each employer having employees whose anticipated duties may result in occupational exposure to infectious agents shall establish
a written infection control plan designed to minimize or eliminate employee exposure. The plan
shall include a determination of that exposure, and
the schedule for and method of implementation for
each of the following requirements. The plan shall
be reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect
significant changes in tasks or procedures. The
plan shall be made available for inspection by federal and state surveyors.
a Universal precautions shall be followed

b. Certain control measures shall be examined and
maintained or replaced on a regular schedule to
ensure effectiveness. For example, employees
shall wash their hands immediately or as soon
as possible after the removal of gloves or other
personal protective equipment and after hand
contact with blood.

when visibly soiled, torn, or punctured. They
shall not be washed or disinfected for reuse.
Utility gloves may be disinfected for reuse if
the integrity of the glove is not compromised.

c. All personal protective equipment and clothing shall be removed immediately upon leaving the work area and shall be disposed in an
appropriately designated area or container for
storage, washing, decontamination or disposal.

Masks, eye protection and face shields shall be
worn whenever splashes, sprays, droplets or
aerosol of blood or other potentially infectious
materials may be generated and there is a potential for eye, ear, nose or mouth contamination. Gowns, aprons, and other body clothing
shall be worn when the employee has a potential for occupational exposure. The gowns,
coats or aprons shallbe worn if there is a potential for soiling of clothes with blood or other
infectious materials. Fluid-resistant clothing
shall be worn if there is a potential for splashing or spraying of blood or other potentially infectious materials.

d. Used needles and other sharps shall not be

QUALITY ASSURANCE

Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures pertaining to infection control must be developed, written, implemented, and
evaluated. All standards and regulations previously described must be incorporated into the policies and procedures.
Comprehensive policies and procedures must address the interrelationships of the equipment, the
people involved and the environment. The risks
must be clearly defined and considered, and preventative systems developed and incorporated.
Policies and procedures must assure safe and effective practices:
Universal precautions

Housekeeping practices
Infectious waste disposal

Laundry disposition
Medical recordkeeping
Employee records

Staff Training and Continuing

Education
Role descriptions should describe all personnel responsibilities for infection control practices. Each
responsibility should stem from a specific policy or
pmedure.
Staff training should be a well-defined and organized process. Content should be clearly defined for
the learner and based on behavioral objectives. The
objectives can be used to accurately and objectively
measure learning, At the end of the sessioxds), the
instrudor should confirm by a written test a d o r
return demonstration that learning has occurred
and that the leamer is able to perform the p d u r e ( s )
independently without error. Test results should
be documented and placed in personnel file.

Comprehension of the purpose and function of infection control principles and procedures requires a
basic understanding of normal physiological concepts, as well as responses associated with uremia
and the hemodialysis therapy. Content should include the specific areas spelled out in the OSHA
regulation previously described.
Need for further education such as inservices or intensive educational sessions can be determined from
the routine quality assurance monitoring process
and the ongoing staff performance appraisal process. When problems are identified, all s t -should
be made aware of the problem and be involved in
its solution; this nearly always includes problem
specific continuing education.
The medical director of the dialysis facility must
verify that the individual has successhlly completed
the initial education and training program. The
medical director is also responsible for assuring that
an annual review has been performed.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Monitoring and Evaluation
On a periodic basis, quality assurance monitoring
of facility personnel's compliance with policies and
procedures should be perfonned A concurrent monibring instrument may be used for this purpose
(see Form 1).

Guidelines

All policies and procedures must be reviewed and
updated annually to reflect changes in regulations
andlor standards.
Trend analysis, performed by the quality assurance

PROCEDURE FOR CONCURRENT
AUDIT:
UNIVERSAL PRECAUTIONS
MONITOR (FORM 1)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures, compliance should be very high.

Before the Audit
1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the
concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.

Perform the Audit
1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,
auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.

2. Read each indicator carefully.

3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor
should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.
4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no if indicator is not met,
or NIA for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Donen
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done a n d perform the test exactly according to the instructions for use of the test manufacturer and
record the results a s per facility policy.

3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.
4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel (head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).

5. Make copies of the audit for each auditor1
observer.

5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure that each indicator has one
response.

6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:

After the Audit

Employee A:

B:
C.

Glenn Close
TomHanks
William Hurt
etc.

7. Determine how many staff are to be observed.
It is recommend that one auditor should
observe no more than three to four staff a t one
time.

8. Define the length of time for observation. I t is
recommended that the audit be conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staffmember completely perform the listed activity.
9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.

1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.
2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

3. Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
4. For each indicator, calculate compliance percentage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.

5. Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andfor recommendations.

Auditor should not be assigned to other responsibilities during the audit.

Handling of
Toxic Chemicals
Formaldehyde
Glutaraldehyde
Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach)
Hydrogen Peroxide
Povidone Iodine Solution
Chlorhexidine Gluconate
Hexachlorophene
Ethyl Alcohol
Ethyl Chloride
Benzalkonium Chloride

BACKGROUND
The average dialysis unit has a number of toxic
or hazardous chemicals present. They are used
a s cleaning and disinfecting agents, janitorial
supplies, and for other purposes. A list of the
common chemicals present in a dialysis facility
include, but are not limited to:
Acids
BasesICaustics
Cleaning Agents
Degreasing Agents
Disinfectants
Flammables
Greases
Paints
Solvents
Surfactants
Water Treatment Agents
Sterilants
Bactericidal Agents
Janitorial Supplies
Although i t is impossible to avoid all risk associated with use of these toxic chemicals, the facility can significantly reduce that risk by following some practical quality assurance measures. The first step is to be aware of the chemicals found in the unit. A chemical that meets
the criteria of a hazardous substance may be:
Corrosive to living tissues; carcinogenic; toxic
when administered orally, cutaneously, or
through inhalation; irritant; sensitizer; toxic to
target organs including the liver, kidney, central nervous system, blood, lung, reproductive
system, or eyes. Some of the chemicals that
meet this definition that are commonly found in
the dialysis facility include:
Acetic Acid
-* Peracetic Acid
Chlorine Dioxide

EXISTING STANDARDS
Three Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards are especially relevant to the dialysis community and must be incorporated into policies and procedures and clinical practice:
1. hazard communication
2. occupational exposure to formaldehyde, and

3. occupational exposure to blood borne pathogens.
A separate chapter in this manual, Chapter 11,
entitled Infection Control, discusses the occupational exposure to blood-borne pathogens standard.

Hazard Communication Standard
This standard requires employers to provide information to their employees about the hazardous chemicals used in the work place through
the development and the implementation of a
"hazard communication program."
Compliance with this rule can be achieved
through a four step process as described below.

@ Amwance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Step 1 List the hazardous chemicals in the facility. In general, these chemicals will have a
label warning of a potential hazard such a s eye
irritation.
Step 2. Obtain the Material Safety Data Sheets
(MSDS) for all chemicals identified. The MSDS,
prepared and supplied by the manufacturer of
the chemical, contains information including:
identification (trade name, chemical name,
chemical family, formula);
hazardous ingredients (components, specific
chemical identity, common name);
physicaVchemica1 characteristics (boiling
point, vapor pressure, vapor density, solubility in water, appearance and odor, specific
gravity, melting point, evaporation rate);
fire and explosion hazard data (flash point,
extinguishing media; special fire fighting procedures, flammable limits, unusual fire and
explosion hazards);
reactivity data (stability, conditions to avoid,
incompatibilities, materials to avoid);

Additionally, a list of all toxic chemicals used in
the facility and all of the MSDS's should be in
one file. This file must be available to all employees. Finally, the facility is required to provide a copy of a MSDS upon the request of any
employee, designated representatives of employees, emergency personnel, and to OSHA
Step 3. All toxic chemical containers must be
appropriately labeled. The label must contain
the product name, a s well as appropriate warnings regarding use. Upon delivery of these
chemicals, proper labeling should be confirmed
and employees should be instructed not to remove labels under any circumstances. Empty
containers from toxic chemicals should be immediately discarded and not reused for other
purposes.
Step 4. A written hazard communications program must be developed and implemented. Such
a program should be included in the initial training of all staff members, and during annual
review. The program should include a t least
the following.

hazardous decomposition or bioproducts (hazardous polymerization); health hazard data
(routes of entry: inhalation, skin, ingestion);
health hazards (acute and chronic) carcinogenicity, signs and symptoms of hazardous
exposure, medical conditions generally aggravated by hazardous exposure, and emergency
first aid procedures;
precautions for safe handling and use (steps
to be taken in case the material is released
or spilled, waste disposal method, precautions
to be taken in handling and storing, other
precautions);
control measures (respiratory protection), ventilation (total exhaust, special, etc.), protective gloves, eye protection, other protective
clothing or equipment, and workhygienic
practices.
The MSDS for specific chemicals should be
posted in any area where that chemical is used.
This is done to assure the staff direct access to
information about the risks involved with the
chemicals, proper handling procedures, and information required in case of an emergency.

A review of emergency procedures including
specific duties or assignments of each employee in the event of a hazardous chemical
emergency.
Whenever a new hazardous chemical is introduced, training must be understaken and completed.
Upon completion of the training program, the
employer should verify and document employee
comprehension. This should be repeated on an
annual basis and be incorporated into the performance appraisal process. I t is recommended
that documentation of successful completion of
the program be included in the employee's personnel file.
The facility should also have written policies
regarding hazard communication for any outside contractors. Should any outside contractor
bring hazardous materials into the dialysis facility, that contractor should provide the facility
with an MSDS along with written procedures as
to how the material will be used, monitored,
and eliminated. An example may be a water
treatment vendor bringing materials to disinfect or clean water treatment system components.
The facility is required to complete and maintain OSHA Form 200 reporting all occupational
injuries and illness. The form must be recorded
within six months of occurrence. A copy of the
total number of occupational injuries and illnesses must be posted in each facility in a place
where employee notices are posted on an annual basis.
To obtain a copy of the OSHA hazard communication standard, specify Federal Register 52
(163): 31852-31886, August 4, 1987.
Certain states and territories have "approvedn
Programs that meet the requirements of the
federal regulation but also have additional laws
a d regulations. These states and territories
include:
Alaska
Arizona

New Mexico
New York

North Carolina
Puerto Rico
South Carolina
Tennessee

Utah
Vermont
Virgin Islands
Virginia
Washington
Wyoming

If your facility is located in a state with a OSHAapproved plan, you must comply with the Hazards Communications Requirements of that
state.

Occupational Exposure to
Formaldehyde
The OSHA standard for Occupational Exposure
to Formaldehyde stipulates:

A. Exposure Limits
1. Permissible exposure limit: the employer

shall ensure that no employee is exposed to
an airborne concentration of formaldehyde
that exceeds one part formaldehyde per million parts of air (1 ppm), a s an.8 hour timeweighted average (TWA).
2. Short term exposure limit: the employer shall
ensure that no employee is exposed to an air
borne concentration of formaldehyde which
exceeds two parts formaldehyde per million
parts air as a 15 minute short term exposure
limit (STEL).

3. Action level equals 0.5 parts per million (ppm)
in a 8 hour time-weighted average (TWA).

B . Required Monitoring
1. Initial monitoring shall identify all employ-

ees who may be exposed a t or above the action level or above the short term exposure
limit and accurately determine the exposure
of each employee so identified.
2. Unless the employer chooses to measure the
exposure of each employee potentially exposed
to formaldehyde, the employer shall develop
a representative sampling strategy and measure sufficient exposures within each job clas-

Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

sification of each work shift. The purpose of
this is to correctly characterize and not underestimate the exposure of any employee
within each exposure group.

4. Employees have the right to observe monitoring procedures.

3. The initial monitoring process shall be repeated each time there is a change in production, the equipment process, personnel,
or control measures which may result in new
or additional exposure to formaldehyde.

These are areas where airborne formaldehyde
exceeds 8 hour time weighted average or short
term exposure limit.

C. Periodic Monitoring

1. A notice regarding the danger and hazard
must be posted.

1. The employer shall periodically measure and
accurately determine exposure to formaldehyde for employees shown by initial monitoring to be exposed at or above the action level
or a t or above the short term exposure limit.
2. If the last monitoring results reveal employ-

ees exposure a t or above the action level, the
employer shall repeat monitoring of the employees a t least every six months.
3. If the last monitoring results reveal employee
exposure a t or above the short term exposure limit, the employer shall repeat monitoring of the employees a t least once a year
under worst conditions.

D. Termination of Monitoring
The employer may discontinue periodic monitoring for employees if results from two consecutive samples, taken a t least seven days apart,
demonstrate that the employee exposure is below the action level and the short term exposure
limits. This must be a statistically significant
sample.

E. Other Monitoring Information
1. Monitoring shall be accurate a t the 95% confidence level to within plus or minus 25% of
airborne formaldehyde concentration a t timeweighted exposure and short term exposure
limits and to within plus or minus 35% for
action level.
2. Monitored employees must receive the results
of the monitoring within 15 days.

3. If employee exposure exceeds the 8 hour time
weighted average or the short term exposure
limit, the employer shall develop and implement a written plan to reduce employee exposure to or below either (both) and give written notice to employees.

F. Regulated Areas

In these areas:

2. Access to these areas must be restricted to

authorized personnel who have been trained
as described earlier.
3. Respiratory protection must be provided
(permanently) if engineering or workplace
practice cannot reduce employee exposure to
acceptable limits, or temporarily in the interval until feasible engineering or workplace
practice changes are made to correct exposure levels.
4, Protective clothing must be worn and work

practices performed.
5. Employee training programs in hazards and
proper handling must be provided.
6. Proper housekeeping (preventative maintenance, proper storage, spill contingency plans)
must be implemented and practiced.

G. Emergency Procedures
For all areas where there is a possibility of an
emergency involving formaldehyde, the facility
must assure that appropriate procedures are
adopted to minimize injury. Appropriate procedures must be implemented in the event of any
such emergency.

H. Medical Surveillance
The facility must institute a medical surveillance
program for all employees exposed to formaldehyde a t concentrations equal to, or exceeding,
the action level. Also medical surveillance must
be performed when concentrations exceed the
short term exposure limits, as well as for any
employee developing signs or symptoms of formaldehyde overexposure. Such surveillance and
any examinations must be performed by or under the supervision of a physician and provided
without cost, loss of pay, and a t a reasonable
time and place.

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

12-4

The facility must also administer a medical disease questionnaire to any employee prior to being
assigned to a job where formaldehyde exposure
is a t or above the action level or above the short
term exposure limit including: work history,
smoking history, any evidence of eye, nose or
throat irritation, chronic airway problems, hydroactive airway disease, allergic skin conditions,
dermatitis, respiratory problems. This questionnaire must be administered annually. I t should
also be given to employees experiencing signs
and symptoms indicative of possible over exposure to formaldehyde. Assuming that the facility has already instituted all possible engineering control measures, the physician must determine on the basis of this questionnaire, his examination, and other information whether the
employees are required to wear respirators to
reduce exposure to formaldehyde.

I. Medical Examinations
Medical examinations are to be given to any employee if the physician feels, based on information in the medical disease questionnaire, the
employee may be a t risk from hazardous exposure to formaldehyde. This requirement for
physical examination also pertains to employees exposed during an emergency situation. The
physician's opinion must be documented.

J. Employee Training and Information
1. Training must be provided to all employees
assigned to work places with a health hazard.
2. Training must be provided a t the time of initial assignment and whenever new hazards
from formaldehyde are introduced into the
work place.

3. Training must be provided a t least annually
for all employees a t or above the action level
or the short term exposure limit.
4. The training program shall be conducted in
a manner that all employees are able to understand and must include:

Proper formaldehyde handling
Proper use of protective equipment
Spill contingency plans
Use of engineering environmental controls
Emergency procedures
Proper use of each type of eyewash station
in facility.
5. All employees must be informed of the location of the written training materials. These
must be available to the employees a t no cost.

K. Recordkeeping
Recordkeeping must include:
1. Results of all scheduled and unscheduled airborne formaldehyde exposure measurements.

2. Objective documentation if the employer has
determined that no measurements are necessary (no employee is exposed to formaldehyde a t or above the action level).
3. An accurate record of each employee who is
subject to medical surveillance under this
standard.

4. Records regarding fit testing of all respirators.
5. All records must be retained for 30 years after employment ends and all records must
be available for OSHA inspection (Federal
Register, December 4, 1987, 29 CFR Parts
1910 and 1926, Volume 52, Number 233,
Pages 46168 to 46312).

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

PROCEDUREFORCONCURRENT
MONITORING FORM:
TOXIC CHEMICAL HANDLING
(FORM 2)
The purpose of this audit is to monitor technical
staff compliance with standard practices and procedures related to the water treatment system.
When staff are aware of the importance of the
policies and well trained in the procedures, compliance should be very high.

9. Assign a staff member to perform the audit.
Auditor should not be assigned to other responsibilities during the audit.

Perform the Audit
1. On the actual audit sheet, write in the date,

auditor's name, patient shift (or time of day),
and standard.
2. Read each indicator carefully.
3. Observe staff for actual performance. Auditor

should not interfere with staff activities, be
obtrusive, or preceptibly obvious.

Before the Audit
1. Provide adequate and appropriate inservice to
assure total staff awareness and education of
all components associated with water treatment for dialysis.
2. Assure staff awareness of all elements of the

concurrent audit and how performance will be
observed and evaluated.
3. The QA committee specifies the standard (expected percentage compliance) desired for the
audit; begin not lower than 85%.
4. Schedule the audit with appropriate personnel (head nurse, charge nurse, chief technician).

4. Under each staff code letter, write Y for yes if
indicator is met, N for no if indicator is not met,
or NIA for not applicable, not observed.

To achieve a Y (yes, indicator was met), staff
should be observed with complete compliance
for each encounter. For example, for a Y to
appear in the "Post-Softener Hardness Done"
box, the staff member must perform the test
before any patient dialysis is done and perform the test exactly according to the instructions for use of the test manufacturer and
record the results as per facility policy.
5. Complete all observations within timeframe
specified. Assure that each indicator has one
response.

5. Make copies of the audit for each auditor1
observer.

After the Audit

6. Assign code letters for each staff member to be
observed; for example:

1. Under each employee code letter, add total
number of Ys and Ns; do not count NAs.

Employee A:
B:
C.

Glenn Close
Tom Hanks
William Hurt
etc.

7. Determine how many staff are to be observed.
It is recommend that one auditor should
observe no more than three to four staff a t one
time.
8. Define the length of time for observation. It is

recommended that the audit be conducted during peak activity times (daily start-up, shift
changeovers, etc.). The time frame should be
long enough to observe each staffmember completely perform the listed activity.

2. For each employee, calculate compliance percentage by dividing the total Ys by the total
observations; again, do not count NAs.

3. Calculate total compliance percentage for the
audit by dividing total Ys (all employee Ys) by
the total observations; do not count NAs.
4. For each indicator, calculate compliance percentage by using the same method as above;
again, do not count NAs.

5. Report results to QA committee and clinical
management team with additional comments
andlor recommendations.

Medical Device
Reporting

In Appendix A the reader will find a complete analysis of all Medical Device Reporting (MDR) files pertaining to hemodialysis devices for the period from
January 1,1980 through December 31,1989.

2. The "Medical Device Reporting" regulation,

3. The Medical Device Amendments of 1976, as
amended by the Safe Medical Devices Act of
1990, and
4. Manufacturers' Complaint investigation files.

BACKGROUND
As has been noted elsewhere in this manual, a
large number of these incidents are related to user
error or to inappropriate or inadequate maintenance

Medical Device and Laboratory
Problem Reporting Program

and repair of the devices. Other incidents may
have been less severe had the user acted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Another large segment of these incidents involves some
degree of device or equipment malfunction.

The Problem Reporting Program, or PRP, is f i ~ d e d
by the Food and Drug Administration, Center for
Devices and Radiological Health, and coordinated
by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). One of
the USPs objectives is to improve product quality
and to inform industry and government about the
health hazards caused by medical devices. The
PRP provides healthcare practitioners and other
medical device users with an effective and expedient way to report problems related to the safety
and efficacy of medical devices.

The primary protection that providers and patients
have to ensure that unsafe or ineffective devices do
not remain on the market is provided by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDAI. The FDA performs routine inspections of manufacturers' facilities and recordkeeping systems to ensure compliance with "Good Manufacturing Practices."
Another method by which safety is maintained is
by the FDA's investigation of problems reported in
the use of the devices. Thus, the absolute importance of all users reporting any problemdincidents
related to use of the devices is underscored. Essentially, if dialysis personnel do not inform the FDA
of problems related to devices, it may take longer
to become aware that a device may be unsafe or
ineffective.

A Guidelines for Reporting
The PRP encourages users to report incidents of:
Death,
Serious injury, or
Malhctions that could result in hazards or
injuries.
Problems with medical devices, in-vitro diagnostic
equipment, and radiological health products should
also be reported:

PROBtERl REPORTING

mere are basically four mechanisms by which prob
lems related to hemodialysis can be reported:

Reporting Program,"

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

When there is user error. It is important to
determine if the design of the device contributes to user error or if incomplete labeling
may have contributed to the event.
When a decision is made to no longer use a
piece of equipment due to a malfunction which
has occurred or recurred It is better to report the event rather than just discard the

such as the Biomedical Engineering, Purchasing, or Risk Management departments, may
be helpful before deciding not to report an
isolated occurrence.

device, place it in storage, or return it to the
manufacturer.
When repeated repairs do not solve the problem.
When a manufacturer's design or repair changes
to the product adversely affect the performance, safety, or efficacy in the opinion of the
practitioner.
When the problem indicates poor quality control by the manufacturer.
When a problem of incompatibility between
devices of differentmanufacturers results in a
serious hazard or injury.

C. Required Information for Reporting
Reporters are encouraged to supply as much information as possible when reporting. A copy of the
Product Problem Reporting Program Form is included at the end of this chapter. The report can
be submitted in writing or by telephoning a tollfree number: 1-800-638-6725(in Maryland call coll e d 301-881-0256).

When a malfunction results in medical treatment, hospitalization, repeat surgical procedures, or readmission.

When reporting, it would be helpful to include the
following.

Even when a problem has occurred only once, if
the practitioner believes that the possibility for recurrence may exist, the problem should be reported.
The USP informs both the manufacturer and the
FDA Analyses of other "isolated incidentsn that
may have occurred and a trend analysis are then
performed. It is possible that a single problem
reported from one facility may be seen to fit into a
pattern of incidents reported by many facilities and
therefore be more significant than might first a p
pear.

Identification numbers (lot number, model number, serial number, etc.). These numbers can
help to identify if problems are recurring in
one particular lot or involve one particular
model and enable the FDA and the manufacturer to rapidly solve the problems.

B. Guidelines for Not Reporting

Whether it is a disposable device that has
been reused.

If the device involved does not have the potential to
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, it
probably should not be reported. These include:
Changes to a product that are only cosmetic
in nature and do not affect, or have the potential to affect, the performance, safety, or
efficacy of the device. This includes personal
preference for a device.
Normal wear and tear of a device or routine
service complaints where no performance prob
lems exist such as consumer senrice complaints,
nonresponsiveness of the firm, unavailable service
manuals, or parts and replacements not readily supplied.
Isolated occurrences where the problems occur only once, the chance of recurrence is, in
the practitioner's opinion, either zero or highly
unlikely, and there is no potential for death
or injury. If interested in determining if oth-

Quality Assurance Guidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

Complete name of the device and the manufacturer name that appears on the label.
Whether the same firm or another firm is
identified as the distributor and/or manufacturer.

If the directions for use were properly followed; if not, could the directions have been
improved.
Indicate whether a sample of the device(s)
has been retained. If possible and practical,
it is important to retain a sample of the device, as well as other devices that may have
been related to the particular problem.
Identify the location of the event (i.e., hospital, clinic, home, transport, etc.).
Include the title or practice specialty of the
practitioner (physician,nurse, technician, etc.)
who was using the device when the problem
occurred.
Include a complete description of the problem
including any actual or potential adverse effects upon the patient or practitioner. Include any results of physical examinations or

13-2

laboratory tests performed in conjunction with
the problem in assistance or treatment of diagnosis or that can otherwise assist in understanding the problem

D. How the Program Works
USP is an independent, nongovernmental body
composed of approximately 300 representativesfrom
associations and colleges of pharmacy, nursing and
medicine. Once the PRP is notified by submitting
the problem on the reporting form or by calling the
toll-free telephone number, copies of the report are
forwarded to the FDA on the day that it is received. The USP also sends a copy to the manufacturer so that it is aware of the problem and your
concern. The USP will acknowledge receipt of the
report and provide additional reporting materials
for future use.
Reports submitted to the USP are subject to the
Privacy Act. The USP will delete the reporter's
name on the manufacturer and/or FDA copy of the
report if requested. However, it should be noted
that the manufacturer and the FDA may be limited in the amount of follow-up that can be done if
the reporter's name is not available. In addition,
FDA will delete the hospital, patient, and physician names (or any other data that can be used to
identi& them) prior to public release of s report
under the Freedom of Information Act.
If a name is given, the reporter may be contacted
by the FDA, the manufacturer, or both for additional information or to inform the reporter about
their evaluatibn of the report. Manufacturers have
other responsibilities regarding the investigation,
evaluation, and reporting of device-related problems ("complaint investigations" according to Good
Manufacturing Practices, Medical Device Reporting regulations, etc.).

The PRP form (see Form 2) a t the end of this chap
ter summarizes actions for the problem reporting
program. It is recommended that this form be phe
tocopied and posted in a prominent place in the dialysis center, head nurse's office,medical director's
office, and chief technician's office.

Medical Device Reporting
Regulation
Note: The following information on the Medical
Device Reporting rule applies to manufacturers of medical devices only. It is included
in this manual solely for informational purposes.
The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) final rule,
dated December 13, 1984, requires manufacturers
to report information to the FDA when one of their
devices may have caused or contributed to a death
or serious injury or when a malfunction may contribute to death or serious injury. The MDR regulation is intended to ensure that the FDA is informed promptly of all serious or potentially serious problems associated with marketed medical devices.
Under the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)
regulations, a manufacturer is required to review,
evaluate, investigate, and maintain a failure record of its devices.
The MDR regulation requires the manufacturer to
notify the FDA as follows:

Although the primary purpose of the PRP system
is to improve the products utilized in healthcare, it
is also a vital means of quickly bringing health
hazards to the attention of officials in government
and industry. In this way, appropriate action may
be taken, either in the f o m of product improvements or recalls.

%Y ~ s u r a n c eGuidelines for Hernodialysis Devices

In case of a death, the manufacturer must
submit the report to the FDA by telephone as
soon as possible, but no later than five calendar days of receipt of the information and must
file a written report within 15 days of receipt
of the information.
In the case of serious injury or a malfunction
that is likely to cause or contribute to a serious injury or death if it recurs, a report should
be made to the FDA as soon as the necessary
information for making the report is obtained,
but no later than 15 working days after initial receipt of the information. The manufacturer must report to the FDA each time it
becomes aware of a reportable event or malfunction.

Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990
On November 28,1990, President Bush signed into
law the "Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990," which
amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
Several of the provisions of this new legislation have
an impact on the requirements of reporting medical
device problems. The new law will impose reporting
requirements on users for the first time. Certain
device user facilities, including hospitals, nursing
homes, ambulatory surgicalfacilities,and outpatient
treatment facilities that are not physician's offices,
will be required to report deaths related to medical
devices to the FDA They are also required to submit
reports of serious illnesses or injuries related to
devices to the manufacturer or to the FDA if the
manufacturer is not known. These provisions of the
law will go into effect upon publication of the h a 1
regulations or 12months from the date of enactment
(November 28, 1991), whichever is earlier.
Other provisions ofthis law include that distributors
of medical devices will be required to provide copies
ofMDRreportsto the manufacturer ofthe device and
that manufacturers, importers, and distributors who
make MDR reports will be required to certify the
number of reports submitted to the FDA in a year.
Also, manufacturers of permanently implantable or
life-sustainingandlife-supportingdevicesused outside a device user facilityand that are reasonably
likely to have serious adverse health consequences
will be required to establish tracking systems for
these devices.

A FACILITY'S RESPONSIBILITY
FOR REPORTING
In the event of a death or serious injury related to
the use of a medical device or in the event of a malfhction of a medical device that is likely to cause
or contribute to death or serious injury if it recurs
the facility may report to the manufacturer as well
as the PRP. Once the new law goes into effect (no
later than November 28, 1991), facilities will be
required to report deaths to the FDA and serious
injurylserious illness to the manufacturer or the
FDA if the manufacturer is not known. These are
important reporting mechanisms for the swveillance of products by both the manufacturer and
the FDA It is only through such reporting that
serious product defects or other problems can be
discovered, investigated, and resolved.
Reportable events also include improper labeling,
defective components, performance that does not
meet the specificationsof the product, poor packaging, incomplete or confusing instructions, and erroneous information. This information may be filed
as a complaint with the manufacturer as well as
with the PRP.
All facility staff members should be trained in the
problem reporting process. This should be a component of the initial training of new employees and
reviewed annually.

Trend Analysis

Recommendations that trend analysis be performed
on various aspects oftechnical data have been included
in several sections throughout this manual. Trend
analyses can be performed in a variety of different
ways, using many formats. To assist the reader in
understanding how to perform and use trend analysis
as a quality assurance tool the following case history is presented.
It is recommended that all hemodialysis facilities
perform certain ba&riological monitoring on a monthly
basis. These should include at least water bacterial levels and dialysate bacterial levels to confirm
compliance with AAMI Standards.
Most hemodialysis facilities draw cultures monthly;
and, when results are received back from the laboratory, many stack the actual lab reports in a threering binder or drawer &r checking that the results are within AAMI limits.
Although such a practice gives the facility some
assurance that the water and dialysate are microbiologically acceptable for dialysis, a few additional
actions will provide more helpful information. They
may also prevent problems, long before they occur.

In addition to simply looking at the laboratory report
form and filing it, the facility should also record the
results on a spreadsheet.

Sample Case History
Trend Analysis of Delivery System Dialysate
Bacterial Levels
An anecdote about an actual occurence reported in
a hernodialysis facility indicates the value of such
a recordkeeping system. The name and location of
the facility has been changed.

Mt. Evans Dialysis Facility in Conifer, Colorado
contacted the authors in November 1989 complain-

k that two of their patients were experiencing
W g e n reactions. Upon interview with facility
Personnel, it was found that one delivery system's

bacterial culture results showed > 30,000 colonies1
ml in Odober.
The facility had not been charting bacterial levels,
but simply filing the lab slips in a manner similar
to that described above. To investigate and solve
the problem, the initial step taken was to array all
culture results obtained in 1989, for all six of the
facility's machines on one spreadsheet. The results
are presented in Figure 1.
Using a line chart further enhances the visibility of
trends. In Figure 2 the constantly increasing level
of bacterial colonization in machine #2 is obvious.

A simple rule of thumb is that any value which
shows three consecutive increases or decreases in
such a line chart indicates a trend. Thus, if the
Mt. Evans Dialysis Facility had been using a line
chart, they would have realized that an unacceptable trend was occuring when they charted the
July results on machine #2. July was the third
consecutive month with a significant increase in
colony count. Since no changes had been made in
disinfection protocols, or any other policies or procedures that would affect bacterial growth, they
could have anticipated that the month-to-month
increase in colony count would continue.
In the end, the problem was determined to be a
buildup of biofilm in the inlet water line of the
machine. This part of the system was not subject
to the routine disinfection performed at the Mt.
Evans facility.
Thorough disinfection and cleaning, through the
water distribution loop eliminated the problem. No
permanent patient injury occurred.
The purpose of the anecdote is to illustrate the usefulness of trend analysis in anticipating problems,
and in solving them before serious consequences do
occur. Tools and methods such as those described
in this appendix section should be used in any of
the areas discussed in this manual where trend
analysis is recommended.

Appendix C

Glossary of Terms

Automated hemodialyzer reprocessing system: A device that automatically rinses the
dialyzer of residual blood and blood products,
performs some manner of "cleaning" process,
tests the dialyzer for leaks and performance
parameters, and fills the dialyzer with an appropriate concentration of a germicide.

Depth filter (or sand filter or multi-media
filter or diatomaceous earth filter): A tanktype filter, usually including a backflushing system, which is used as a first stage treatment to
remove suspended matter, colloidal material or
silt from the water before introduction to other
downstream water treatment components.

Blending valve: A device, generally a t the beginning of the "pre-treatment," that mixes warm
and cold water to achieve an optimum temperature for operation of the reverse osmosis membranes.

Dialysance: Describes dialyzer efficiency when
solute concentration in the dialysate is not zero
(such a s recirculating dialysate delivery systems); the volume of blood cleared of that solute
per minute if the dialysate concentration is zero.

Carbon filter (or granular activated carbon filter): A cylindrical tank containing an
activated carbon filter medium with a central
drainage core. This type of filter is used primarily to remove chlorine and chloramine, as
well as some organics.

Dialysate (or dialysis fluid ): A non-sterile
aqueous solution with an electrolyte composition near that of normal extra cellular fluid.

Central dialysate delivery system: A system that utilizes a single "centraln dialysate proportioner which prepares dialysate for a number of bedside consoles or bedside stations.
Clearance: Describes the performance of the
dialyzer for solute removal; the amount of blood
completely cleared of a solute by the dialyzer
per minute expressed in ml/min.
Concurrent monitoring: The process of observing or measuring something a t the time it
is occuring.
Deionizer (or deionization tank or DI): A
tank of insoluble spheres or beads, called resin,
which exchanges all types of cations and anions
and replaces them with hydrogen and hydroxide ions which combine to form water. Deionizers may be categorized as "mixed bedn, containing both cation and anion resin in a single vessel, or "dual bedn, where each resin type is in a
Separate vessel.

Dialysate concentrate: A preparation of salts
which, when diluted with water, yields dialysate for use in dialysis. These concentrates are
manufactured commercially in liquid or powder
form.
Dialysis delivery system: A device that delivers dialysate to the hemodialyzer maintaining proper concentration, temperature, pressures, and flow in the dialysate circuit. The
dialysis delivery system (delivery system) also
monitors various functions related to the dialysate compartment and the blood compartment:
dialysate pressure, ultrafiltration rate, blood
leaks into the dialysate, changes in the pressure
of the blood circuit, air or air foam in the blood.
Dialyzer: The device where the exchange between blood and the dialysis fluid takes place; a
semi-permeable membrane separates two compartments, one in which flows the patient's blood,
and the other the dialysis fluid, or dialysate.
Diffusion (or conductive transfer): The passive transport of solutes across a membrane in
the absence of net solvent transfer.

Sediment filter: A cylindrical cartridge filter
used to remove particulates.
Servo-controlled proportioning systems: A
delivery system that uses a control sensor to
monitor the conductivity of the dialysate and
regulate the flow of the dialysate concentrate

be regulated using variable speed pumps, variable orifice values, or other mechanisms.
Servo-feedback ultrafiltration control system: A delivery system where dialysate inflow
(Q,) and outflow (Q,) are measured constantly,
using sensitive flow meters. By subtracting Q,
from Q, the system measures ultrafiltration flow
rate (Q,).
Once that value is known, the microprocessor (in which a desired Q, has been
programmed by the user) automatically adjusts
the machine's TMP so that desired Q,,
- equals
measured Q.,

between the specialist who headed the service and
the director of the clinic. This dispute eventually
involved the patients, who felt that the quality of care
was a t stake. Their 'therapy strike', as exceptionalas
it is in the world of illness, brings to mind forms of
action used by the consumer movement or by labour
unions. The reasons that this small group ofpatients
interrupted treatment are analysed in terms of their
relations to medicine and their conceptions of illness.

Based on the hypothesisthat rapid correctionsofpH,

during efficient haemodialysis (HD), a 14 compartment model has been designed for dynamic analysis
oftheinduced fluid shifts and the resultinghaemodynamic reactions. The model reactions correlated remarkably with clinical findings and indicatehow far
a patient's haemodynamic compensation can prevent circulatory collapse and hypovolaemia, mainly
through lowering the mean pressure in a major
portion of the capillaries. Steady weight dialysis
causes reduction of blood volume up to 65 percent
before circulatory collapse occurs.

1,453patients treated between 1972 and 1978in 33
French dialysis centers and prospectively followed
up in the computerized Diaphane Dialysis Registry;
198 deaths (overall mortality (OM) were registered,
of which 87 (43%) were secondary to cardiovascular
complications(cardiov8SCUIarmortality=CVM)).Risk
factors for OM and CVM (p values less than 0.05)
were age, male sex, nephroangiosclerosis or diabetic
nephropathy as the primary renal disease, elevated
systolic and diastolicblood pressure and two weekly
dialysis rather then three. In contrast with the
results observed for the general population, a high
body mass index and elevated cholesterol, triglycerides and uric acid were not found to be associated
with significantly increased CVM or OM. On the
contrary, low body mass index (less than 20 kg/m2),
low cholesterol (less than 4.5 mmoV1) and low mean
predialysis blood urea (less than 4.6 mmoV1) were
associated with increased OM and CVM, and more
especially with high stroke mortality. Results for
urea but not for cholesterol remain significant &r
adjustment for age, sex, weekly dialysisscheduleand
body mass index. They suggest that, in addition to
elevatedblood pressure, apoor nutritional state and,
or low protein intake may be important factors for
explaining the high cardiovascular mortality, particularly for strokes, observed in dialyzed patients.

Water Treatment

Effect of water deionisers on 'fracturing osteodystrophy'anddialysisencephalopathyinPlymouth.Leather,
H.M.,Lewin, I.G., Calder, E., Braybrooke,J.and Cox,
RR Nephron, 29 (1-21,pp. 80-4 (1981). When water
deionisers were not used routinely, a bone disease
with multiple fractures, 'fracturing osteodystrophy,'
and dialysisencephalopathyoccurredin a sign5cant
number of patients. When water deionisers were
used commonly, fracturing osteodystrophy and dialysis encephalopathy occurred extremely infiequently. Duration of dialysis without a water deioniser appeared to be the most important factor in the
development of these two conditions. The use of
water deionisersusually led to healing of fractures in
patients with fracturing osteodystrophyand also led
to improvement in 4 of the 11patients with dialysis
encephalopathy. Neither condition has occurred in
any patient using a water deioniser from the first
dialysis. Water deionisers, therefore, appeared to be
effective in both the treatment and prevention of
fracturing osteodystrophyand dialysisencephalopa-

apalyzed by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry in serum specimens from 22 healthy
hospital workers and 30 patients with end-stage
renal disease treated by extracorporeal hemodialysis, who resided in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, a city
with extensivenickel mines and smelters. This study
confirms the presence ofhypernickelemiainhemodialysis patients, but does not suggest thathemodidysispatients have sigdicantly increasedrisk ofnickel

the high nickel concentrationsin Sudbury tap water.
The outcome is attributed to the efficient deionization of water used to prepare hemodialysis solutions

Abreo, K, Brown, S.T., Sella,M. Am JKitEney Dis, 13
(61, pp. 465-8 (Jun 1989). A higher prevalence of
aluminum-associatedmicrocytic anemia was noted
in hemodialysis unit A (n=67) compared to unit B
(n=39). This h d i n g could not be explained by differences in the aluminum content of reverse osmosis
(RO) water or intake of antacids containing aluminum by patients in the two units. Because contamination was missed in spite of water testing a t the RO
site, these findings underscore the importance of
measuring water aluminum and TDS content a t the
dialysis stations. Frequent water testing a t dialysis
stations, familiarity with the design of water treatment facilities, and recognition of aluminum overload can lead to early detection and correction if
similar types of aluminum contamination should
occur.

were also found in dialysis fluid because they were

Aluminium and fluoride in the water supply and

Drury, P.J., Harston, G.A, Ineson, P.R. Sci Total
Environ,76 (l),pp. 19-28( Sep 15,1988). Aluminium
and fluoride in the water supply and their removal
for haemodialysis were investigated in the Trent
Region, U.K, and wide variations noted. A comparison ofnew andolderwatertreatment systemsshowed
that there is a deteriorationin performance with use.
However, some cases poor removal may be due to the
installation of unsuitable equipment or, more probably, due to a change in the waters used to supply the
different homes. Thus, adequate maintenance of
equipment and frequent sampling of both untreated
and treated waters are required in order to maintain
the provision of waters suitable for the preparation of
dialysate.

content of aluminum appears to be the major etiological factor in the development of a neurological syndrome called either "dialysis encephalopathy" or
"dialysis dementia," an increased bone content, causing a specific form of osteomalacia. An excessof aluminum also appears to be an etiological factor in a

those whose water supplyhadahigh aluminium concentration (greater than 80 microgramdL). Reverse
osmosis treatment satisfactorily removes aluminium and many other substances from water. Its
application had a beneficial effect on 7 of 9 patients
previously exposed to dialysate prepared from water

units using softened water, which has a higher aluminium content, than in the deionized water unit.
The patients dialysed on soRened water also have
significantly higher serum calcium and phosphorus
levels. It is suggested that in Johannesburg, water
softeningalone is inadequate, and that the high aluminium levels in our water may be responsiblefor accelerated osteomalacidosteopenia.

and after dialysis a t plasma nickel concentrations of
approximately 3 m&. Symptomsincluded nausea,
vomiting, weakness, headache, and palpitation. Remission of symptoms occurred spontaneously, generally 3 to 1 3 hours after cessation of dialysis. The
evidence indicated that the nickel became bound in
the plasmaafter crossingthemembrane, resultingin
a higher concentration in the plasma than in the
dialysate and preventing its removal by dialysis.

JHosp Infect, 1 3(21,pp. 109-15(Feb 1989). Bacteriological investigations and endotoxin (El') determinations were performed during a routine haemodialysis session for six patients. Inspection of the
dialyzermachinesrevealed that air-trapsandheaterunit for the incoming (untreated) tap water before
mixing with the dialysate concentrate were the only
sites where high bacterial release was feasible, as
this part of the machine escaped disinfection due to
the construction of these devices. Regular disinfection is recommended of all parts of a dialyzer machine, including heating units, air traps and valves.

Abreo, K , Brown, S.T. and SellaM. Am JKidneyDk,

aluminum-associated microcytic anemia was noted
in hemodialysis unit A (n=67) compared to unit B
(n=39). This finding could not be explained by differences in the aluminum content of reverse osmosis
(RO) water or intake of antacids containing aluminum by patients in the two units. Because contamination was missed in spite of water testing at the RO
site, these findings underscore the importance of
measuring water aluminum andTDS content a t the
dialysis stations. Frequent water testing at dialysis
stations, familiarity with the design of water treatment facilities, and recognition of aluminum overload can lead to early detection and correction if similar types of aluminum contamination should occur.

VanDeKerkhove, KM., Kunkel, S.L. and Huger,
M.J. Am JKidney Dis, 10(2), pp. 118-22(Aug1987).
Authors conclude that IL-1 is produced during clinical HD and that endotoxin or its fragments play a
role in the stimulation of IL-1 production, probably
through monocytes adhering to the dialysis membrane. In addition to this dialysate factor, IL-1 production appears also to be stimulated by a bloodmembrane interaction.
Aluminum in the dialysisfluid. Rahman, H., Channon, S.M., Parkinson, I.S., Skillen,AW., Ward, M.K
and Ken, D.N. Clin Nephml, 24 Suppl 1, pp. S78-83
(1985). DocumentType: Review (44refs.) The major
source of aluminum in patients with chronic renal
failure treated by hemodialysis is the hemodialysis
fluid. The aluminum is derived from both the water
and the chemicalconcentrateused in the preparation
of the hemodialysis fluid. Due to the complex physico-chemistry of aluminum in water and dialysis
fluid,both the total aluminum concentration and the
proportion of aluminum species able to cross the
hemodialysis membrane may vary from water supply to water supply and from day to day within a
supply. A "safe" level of aluminum in dialysis fluid,
which will prevent aluminum transfer from dialysis
fluid to blood, and promotes aluminum removal from
blood, has yet to be determined.
Effect of an optimum dialysis fluid calcium concentration on calcium mass transfer during maintenance hemodialysis. Carney, S.L. and Gillies, AH.

(1.625mmoM) on calciummass transfer from dialysis

between the mass transfer of calcium and the dialysis
fluid calcium concentration (e0.834, p less than
0.01) which was found to vary by at least 5%. This

variation was due to a manufacturing variation and
not due to inaccurate dilution of the dialysis fluid
concentrate. These data suggests that such a manufacturingvariationmay exposemaintenancehemodialysis patients to periods of excessive calcium loss or
gain and thereby favor renal osteodystrophy or soft
tissue calcification.
Sodium modeling during hemodialysis: a new approach. Petitclerc, T., Man,N.K and Funck-Brentano, J.L. Artif Organs, 8 (4), pp. 418-22 (Nov 1984).
Sodium volume modeling during hemodialysis encounters severaldifficulties. First, the actual sodium
distributionvolume isthe extracellularwater, whereas
the ultrafiltration flow reflects the variation of total
body water. Thus, a two-pool model must be considered. This will complicate the model by increasing
the number of parameters and boundary conditions.
An alternative is to consider the total body water as
the apparent distribution volume of loaded or removed sodium, which leads to a single-pool model.
Second, convective sodium transfer induced by ultrafiltration is not negligiblecompared with difbive
sodium transfer. Therefore, sodium transfer modeling must simultaneously take into account the diffusive and the convective part, with the coupling part
related to both processes. Third, the Donnan effect,
due to nondiffusible anionic plasma proteins, modifies the sodium transfer through the membrane.
Pseudomonas stutzeri bacteremia associated with
hemodialysis. Goetz, A , Yu,V.L., Hanchett, J.E. and

in six patients undergoing hemodialysis. Fever,
shaking chills, nausea, and vomiting were observed.
All patients recovered, although only two received
specific antibiotic therapy. The infections occurred
sporadically over a period of nine months. Pseudomonas stutzeri was subsequently isolated from the
dialysate. The ultimate source was the deionized
water. The emphasis on handwashing, strict compliancewith disinfection procedures,and eliminationof
prolonged sitting times for the filled machine after
disinfection resulted in no firrther cases of P stutzeri

Secondary factors affecting arterial PO2 were the
slight improvement in ventilation-perfusion relationships, tending to increase it, and the decrease in
cardiac output tending to decrease it. There was no
evidencefor diffusion impairment because the measured VA/Q inequality accounted for the degree of
hypoxemia.

Acetate dialysate versus bicarbonate dialysate: a
continuing controversy. Diamond, S.M. and Henrich, W.L.Am JKidney Dis, 9(1),pp.3-11(Jan1987).
Document Type: Review (91 refs.). The use of bicarbonate dialysate as thebdfer during routine dialysis
is growing. This discussion reviews several of the
comparativetrials in which bicarbonate and acetate
buffers have been tested. Patients who seem most
likely to benefit from bicarbonate dialysate include
those with a reduced muscle mass in whom a high
sodium dialysate has not prevented hypotension.

Nephrd, 5 (5), pp. 366-71(1985). The present study
is an investigation of the role of acetate metabolism
in dialysis-induced hypoxemia and of the relative
roles of acetate metabolism, bicarbonate loss, and
C02 gas (g)loss in causation of hypoxemia. The
results indicate that acetate metabolism can lead to
reduction in respiratory exchange ratio and hypoxe

Effects ofhigh sodium dialysate during maintenance
hemodialysis. Cybulsky, AV., Matni, A. and Hollomby, D.J. Nephron, 41 (I), pp. 57-61 (1985). The
effects of high sodium 144 mmoVl (mEqA) dialysate
were studied in normotensive, hypertensive and
anephric chronic hemodialysis patients. High sodium dialysate is beneficial for normotensive and
anephric patients in reducing dialysis-inducedhypotension and was not associated with any deleterious
effects on long-term blood pressure control. In hypertensive patients, the benefit is less clear, and
hypertension may increase.

mostsatisfactoryfromthe patient's point ofview with
regard to dialysis-associated symptoms. Careful
choice of dialysate sodium concentration appears to
be important in lessening dialysis side-effects. Substitution of bicarbonate for acetate in chronic stable
dialysispatients has comparatively little benefit and
the choice can legitimately be made on the basis of
cost and technical considerations.
Effect ofvariations in dialysate temperature on blood
pressure duringhemodialysis.Sherman,RA,Faustino,
E.F., Bernholc, AS. and Eisinger, RP. Am JKidney

alteration in dialysate temperature was studied in
150 hemodialysis treatments in 17 patients using a
randomized, double-blind protocol. Each patient was
treatedusingdialysateat 35.6"C, 36.7"C, and37B°C.
Dialysate cooler than that routinely employedhas a
beneficial effect while warmer dialysate has a detrimental one on intradialytic BP. The use of dialysate
at least 1°C cooler than "isothermic" levels may be
appropriate.

osmolality and, more recently, temperature Q of
dialysate have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Our hemodynamic study confirms the
important role played by T on intradialytic vascular
stability and may explain the better control observed

when the fall in serum osmolality during dialysis is
significant. If the fall in serum osmolality is blunted
either with a high-sodium dialysate or mannitol
f i s i o n s , there is little difference between acetate
and bicarbonate. From a practical viewpoint, highsodium dialysis is technically less complex and expensive than bicarbonate dialysis.

results in hypoventilation and is the major cause of
hypoxemia (92 refs.).

not produced, several other metabolic changes must
occur to maintain the euglycemic state. This study
looks at patients on chronic hemodialysis usingboth

In addition, the rate of fall of mean BP during

Studies were performed in patients on maintenance

processes involved in the removal of carbon dioxide

suggest that multiple factors related to the removal

(1984). The major reason for hypoxemia during
acetate dialysis is a decrease in alveolar oxygen
tension due to changesin metabolism and a decrease
in pulmonary C02 excretion when C 0 2 is lost from
the dialyzer. The increasing pH may contribute to
the metabolic change during acetate dialysis and the
hypoventilation during bicarbonate dialysis. There
is little evidence to support an effect of pulmonary
capillary obstruction or changes in oxy-hemoglobin
associationonthe decreasein arterial oxygen tension

Danger of haemodialysis using acetate dialysate in
combinationwithalatge surfaceareadialyser. Viljoen,
M. and Gold, C.H. SAfr Med 4 56 (5),pp. 170-2(Aug
4,1979). Large surface area, high mass transfer dialysers have recently come into widespread use,and
it has been shown that they promote the loss of large
amounts of bicarbonate when acetate is used in the
dialysate. In the chronic dialysis patient in a steady
state, these effectsmay be inconsequentialbut, in an
acutelyill patient, the combinationofa dialysate containing acetate and a high-efficiencydialyser may be
extremelyhazardous. Areturn to the use ofbicarbonate as the source of base would avoid such hazards
and would promote the more physiologicalcorrection
of the metabolic acidosis of renal failure.

and after dialysis a t plasma nickel concentrations of
approximately 3 m&. Symptomsincluded nausea,
vomiting, weakness, headache, and palpitation. Remission of symptomsoccurred spontaneously,generally 3 to 13 hours after cessation of dialysis. The
evidence indicated that the nickel became bound in
the plasma aftercrossingthe membrane, resultingin
a higher concentration in the plasma than in the

gand, C.F., Davin,T.D., Raij,L. and Kjellstrand, C.M.
Arch Intern Med 141(2), pp. 167-7O(Feb1981). During dialysis, it is assumed that the serum electrolyte
levels asymptoticallyapproach the concentration in
the dialysate. In five patients, we observed an average 20% fall in serum potassium level, although the
dialysate contained 42% more potassium than the
predialysis serum. The cause of the hypokalemia
was a rapid shift of potassium from the extracellular
to the intracellular space secondary to correction of
acidosis. All patients entered dialysis with a h i s m
suggestingprolonged potassium loss, marked acidosis, and moderate hypokalemia; thus, the dialysate
potassium concentration should be higher than normal, and frequent determinations of the serum potassium level should be performed. Therapy resulting in rapid correction of acidosis in uremic patients
undergoinghemodialysismay cause large transcompartmental shifts of potassium. Potassium transfer
across the dialysis membrane may be inadequate to
compensate for such shifts, and life-threatening
hypokalemia may occur.

Dinarello, C A Kidng, Int, 33 (I), pp. 29-35 ( Jan

hemodialysis (HD)circuitwas challenged with E, coli
microfiltrate containing500ngfmlendotoh. These
studies demonstrate that: (a) in the presence of
plasma, 1Ll-inducing factors pass into the blood
compartment of a dialysis system challenged with
bacterial pyrogen; and (b)MNC production of IL-1 is
enhanced in the presence of plasma.
Foreign particles contaminatinghemodialyzers and

1987,46(41, pp. 343-6. Foreign particles contaminating hemodialyzers constitute a risk of rnicroembolism and allergic reactions in hemodialysis patients. Authors investigated the size distribution of
particles, and the efTects of strikingheadersof dialyzers and flow rates ofrinsing saline on the elimination
offoreign particles from dialyzers. To rinse dialyzers
effectively, at least 1,000 ml of saline are necessary,
and strikingthe headers of dialyzers throughout the

safety of high-flux polysulfone dialyzers, an in-vitro

Acute anaphylactoid reactions during hemodialysis .
in France. Foret, M., Kuentz, F., Meftahi, H., Milongo, R, Hachache, T., Elsener, M., Dechelette, Eand
Cordonnier, D. Artif Organs, 11(2), pp. 168-72(Apr
1987). A retrospective survey of anaphylactoidreactions during dialysis in France was conducted. The
presence of cellulose-derivedparticles in the rinsing
fluid of such dialyzers and the possible increased incidence of reactions &r the long (weekend) interdialytic interval suggest that allergy to cellulosederived particles eluted from cellulosic dialyzers
may contribute to dialyzer hypersensitivity reactions.
Effect of dialyzer reprocessing methods on complement activation and hemodialyzer-related symptoms. Dumler, F., Zasuwa, G. and Levin, N.W. Artif
Organs, 11(2), pp. 128-31 (Apr 1987). The effects of
differentdialyzerprocessingmethods and ofreuse on
complement activation and dialyzer-related symp
toms were studied in 96 maintenance hemodialysis
patients. The percentage of patients without symp
toms during dialysis was significantly greater with
reused dialyzersthan with new dialyzers. The severity oftotalsymptomscorrelated signifimntly(p=0.0004)
with complement activation. The results suggest
that total symptoms during dialysis are correlated
with the degree of complement activation. However,
trends in the data pertaining to chest pain suggest
that factors other than complement activation may
be important in the pathogenesis of some dialyzerrelated symptoms.

Role of dialyzer contaminants in the allergic epiphenomena ofhemodialysis. Ward, R.A, Feldhoff, P.W.

carbohycontaminants includingl,2,3-propanetriol,
drates, Limulus amebocyte lysate-reactivematerial,
and particulates. In a clinical study, the role of these
substances in the allergic-typeresponse seen in some
hemodialysispatients was examined. Dialyzerpreparation had no effect on predialysis eosinophil counts
or IgE levels. All patients demonstrated transient
leukopeniaand complement activation during dialysis, the magnitudes of which were unaffected by the
type of dialyzer preparation. At the levels found in
the dialyzers studied, it was questioned whether
water-soluble extractables or particulates play any
role in the allergic epiphenomena of hemodialysis.
Anaphylactoid reactionsduetohaemodialysis,haemofiltration, or membrane plasma separation. Nicholls,
AJ. andPlatts,M.M. BrMed J[Clin Resl,285 (63551,
pp. 1607-9( Dec 4,1982). A previously undescribed
anaphylactoid reaction to haemodialysis, haemofiltration, or membrane plasma separation occurred in
15 patients receiving regular dialysis. The illness
varied in severity from urticaria, sneezing, and watering ofthe eyes to severebronchospasm and cardiovascular collapse, and began within aminute ofblood
being returned from the dialyser or filtration device
to the patient. Reactions developed only when a
dialyser sterilised with ethylene oxide was used for
the first time and never after sterilisation with formalin. Several patients had more than one reaction
while three had a reaction each time a new dialyser
was used. Incorrect priming of the dialysers maybe
a partial explanation of these attacks, but the exact
reason for their occurrence is unknown.

Nephrd, 37, pp. 78-82 (1984). The newer cellulose
acetate membranes show lower degree of complement activation and a smaller drop in neutrophil
count during the first 30 minutes of dialysis than do
the cuprophan dialyzers. It is suggested that patients with intradialytic symptoms related to membrane biocompatibility will tolerate the procedure
better on these newer membranes.

Neutrophil behavior during hemodialysis. Role of

oxygen radical productionandchemotaxisofdialyzed
neutrophils isolated simultaneously from the arterial and venous sites during dialysis with cuprophane, polycarbonate, polysulfone, and polyacrilonitrile membranes was studied. Cells remaining in
circulation aRer 15minutes of dialysis showed defective responses only when collected at the venous site
of the cuprophane dialyzer, in spite of a similar
leukopeniaa t the venous and arterial sites. With the
other membranes tested, no defects in neutrophil
h c t i o n s were evidenced. These results suggestthat
down-regulationoccurs within the dialyzer and that,
besides complementactivation,the membrane plays
an additional role.
First-use syndrome in patients treated with hollowfiber dialyzers. Villarroel, F. B l d Purif, 5 (2-3),pp.
112-4 (1987). A two-year survey on first-use syndrome (FUS) in hemodialysis showed that there
were an average of 181 FUS reactions per year.
Nearly 39% of the patients who experienced a FUS
reaction had experienced previous FUS reactions. A
strong correlation was found with respect to the age
and race of the patients. The fact that a patient
recently starteddialysistreatmentorhasbeentreated
with dialysis for some time appears to have no
bearing in the risk of experiencing a FUS reaction.
Hypersensitivity to hemodialysis: the United Kingdom experience. Nicholls, AJ. Artif Organs, 11(21,
pp. 87-9 (Apr 1987). A survey of all U.K hemodialysis centers was conducted to investigate the prevalence ofhypersensitivityin the first use of disposable

reactions were identified, suggestingthat 1in 20 to 1

dialyzers were used. All symptoms, considered together, occurred 1.3 times more frequently during
the initial than during the subsequent use of the
dialyzer. No symptom occurred more frequently in
the second or subsequent use ofthe dialyzer. Concurrent chest and back pain were 41 times more frequent when the dialyzer was used for the first time.

Melin, J.P., Lavaud, S. and Toupance, 0. Artif
Organs, 6 (3),pp. 261-6 (Augl982). Afive-year study
of short-term dialysis using highly permeable polyacrylonitrilemembrane AN 69 was started in March
1973to compare the &eds of AN 69 and Cuprophan
membrane (CM). The dialysis sessions were significantly better tolerated with AN 69 than with CM,
however, the main advantage of using AN 69 is the
shortening of dialysis time. The duration of dialysis
was 9.5 k0.2 hours per week with AN69 andl6.4kO.2
hours per week with CM. Shortening of dialysistime
permits better social rehabilitation of the patients.
The shorter dialysis was not associatedwith any recognizable side effects that could be demonstrated by
routine clinical and biological analysis.

the main causes of dialyzer-associated hypersensitivity reactions. The authors results suggest that the
dose of ETO administered to the patient at the outset
of dialysis can be minimized by rinsing the dialyzer
with 2 L offluid at 37°C and by avoiding administration of rinsing fluid that has been allowed to remain
in contact with the dialyzer for more than several
minutes. Use of a long storage interval and use of
dialyzers containing reduced amounts of potting
material will also reduce the ETO load.
Mediation of hypersensitivity reactions during
hemodialysis by IgE antibodies against ethylene
oxide. Lernke, H.D. Artif Organs, 11(21, pp. 104-10
(Apr 1987). We conclude that ETO causes most
severe hypersensitivity reactions by an IgE-mediated mechanism. On the other hand, the pathogene
sis of mild (type I)reactions is less clearly associated
with ETO allergy. The results also suggestthat other
potentially allergenic substances in dialyzers (e.g.,
IPM, 2-chloroethanol) rarely induce specific IgE
antibodies in dialysis patients.
Extractable ethylene oxide from cuprammonium
cellulose plate dialyzers: importance of potting compound. Ing, T.S. and Daugirdas, J.T. ASMO k s ,

that ethylene oxide retention aRer sterilizationis increased in cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers
containingpotting compound. In contrast, cuprammonium cellulose plate dialyzers without potting
compound were characterized by a rapid disappearance of retained ethylene oxide after sterilization.
Whether these findings explain the low incidence of

that do not contain potting material is a matter for
continued study and experimentation.

hypersensitivity syndrome presents as an acute anaphylactoid reaction, the symptoms of which may
range from mild to life-threatening in severity. The
cause of this syndrome is unknown, but affected patients appear to have a high incidence of positive
radioallergosorbent tests to a conjugate of human
serum albumin and ethylene oxide, suggestingthat
ethylene oxide, a substance used to dry sterilize artificial kidneys, may be an offending allergen.
Severe reactions duringhemodialysis. Rault, R and

agitation, pruritus, and alterations in BP were the
dominant clinical findings, and one patient suffered

in the sterilizationprocedure, to the membrane itself,
or to substances that leach out of the potting compound or membrane. Hypersensitivity reaction
during hemodialysis has been reported to be very
severe or even fatal. Personnel delivering direct
patient care should be aware of the symptoms and
react quickly with proper treatment. Patients suspected to have this reaction should be changed to a

classical regenerated cellulose (Cuprophan). The
efficacy of the modified cellulosic membrane with
respect to urea and creatinine clearance was shown
to be comparable to that of regenerated cellulose and
celldoseacetate. However,modified celluloseshowed
an increased clearance for inorganic phosphate, significantly different from that demonstrated by both
regenerated cellulose and cellulose acetate. Demonstrated that in comparison to regenerated cellulose,
modified cellulose resulted in significantlyless complement activation and WBC reduction, and appears
to be due to the substitution of hydroxyl groups of
regenerated cellulose.

A study on hemodialysis leukopenia using various
dialyzers. Shin,J.,Matsuo, M., Shinko,S., Fujita,Y.,
Inoue, S., Sakai, R and Nishioka, M. JDial, 4 (I), pp.
51-62 (1980). Hemodialysis leukopenia was studied
using various dialyzers and membranes. The authors found that dialyzerswith cellulosicmembranes
caused marked leukopenia, but in recentlydeveloped
non-cellulosic membranes, its occurrence was significantly less. Additionally, the results showed a
newly developed cellulose acetate membrane to correlate well with the non-cellulose membranes r e

cellulose.
Absence ofbacteremia and endotoxemiadespite contaminated dialyzate. Bernick, J.J. and Port, F.K.
ClinNephrd, 14(1), pp. 13-7(Jul1980). Feversassociated with hemodialysishave been attributed to the
transfer of relatively large endotoxin molecules andl
or bacteria from contaminated dialyzate across the
dialyzingmembrane. In this study, due to amalfunction, dialysisfluids containedbacteria and endotoxin
a t levels previously reported to be associated with
pyrogenic reactions. Neither endotoxin nor bacteria
was detected; venous and arterial blood specimens
were collected a t the termination of hemodialysis.
Temperature elevations did not occur. In an extended study, 20 dialyzers were collected aRer single
patient use and the dialyzate compartment wasfilled
with highly contaminated dialyzate, while the blood
compartment was filled with sterile pyrogen-free
saline. Following 5 to 7 days incubation, bacteria
were present in the blood compartments of4 of 20 dialyzers, probably due to contamination during dialyzer handling. However, the much smaller endotoxin molecule could not be detectedin the absence
of bacterial contamination. These results indicate
that the intact cellophane membrane is an effective
barrier to endotoxin and bacteria under clinical conditions.
Comparison of solute permeability and rejection

Eberle, K. P m Eur Dial Transplant Assoc, 16, pp.
198-204 (1979). Permeability and rejection properties of new, high flux cellulose membranes and fibres
have been compared with Cuprophan. The greater
solute and water flux is explained in terms of larger
"pores," which permit greater transport of large
molecules.

Bacterial and endotoxin permeability of hemodialysis membranes. Bernick, J.J., Port, F.K, Favero,
M.S. and Brown, D.G. Kidney Int, 16 (4), pp. 491-6
(Oct 1979). Dialysis fluids containing at least l a 7 1
bacteria per milliliter and as much as 12,500ngofendotoxin equivalents per milliliter were dialyzed and
ultrafiltered with three types of disposablehemodialyzers. Neither bacteria nor endotoxin, as measured
by the Limulus lysate assay, was detected in the
sterile compartment despite ultrafiltration. Under
these favorable conditionsfor endotoxin transfer, the
maximum transfer rate was calculated to be less
than 3.5 ngofendotoxinequivalents per hour. At this
rate, it is unlikely that pyrexia during hemodialysis
is due to the transfer of endotoxin across an intact
dialyzing membrane. Provided that the integrity of
the dialyzingmembrane is maintained, this investigation indicates that the risk of endotoxemia or
bacteremia associated with the use of contaminated
dialysis fluids is negligible.

Artif Organs, 5 (3),pp. 131-5(May 1982). Exact control of ultrafiltration (UF) is a prerequisite for high
flux dialysis and hemodiafiltration. Volumetric dialysate balancing is the best current method for the
use of dialyzers with high water permeabilities. The
precision of UF control by volumetric dialysate balancing is in agreement with all medical requirements. A positive influence of volumetric UF control
on patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis can be
shown by the frequencies of dialysis side effects.
Volumetric UF control is only a first step towards an
intelligent UF module to correlate water removal,
solute removal and sodium balance.
Dialyzer ultrafiltration coefficients: comparison between in-vitro and in-vivo values. Keshaviah, P.R.,

Artif Organs, 6 (I), pp. 23-6 (Feb 1982). This study
describes a simple, convenientmethod for the in-vivo
measurementoftheultrafiltrationcoe£licientofhemodialyzers. The method is based on a scheme of isolated
ultrafiltration, i.e., ultrafiltration without dialysate
flow through the dialyzer. Results with this method
indicate that it is more accurate than the conventional bed scale technique. Measurements on three
different dialyzers demonstrate that the in-vivo
ultrafiltration coefficientisonlybetween l%and 10%
lower than the correspondingin-vitro value. This is
in contrast to the rule of thumb used by some manufacturers that in-vivocoefficientsare 30%lower than
in-vitro values. The deviation of the in-vivo value
from the in-vitro one seems to be higher with higher
dialyzer ultrafiltration coefficients. Based on these
results it is recommended that to estimate ultrafiltration rates in the clinical setting, the in-vitro ultrafiltration coefficientbeused, transmembrane pressures being correctedforthe colloid osmoticpressure

Hemodialysishypoxemia: evaluationof mechanisms
utilizing sequential ultrafiltration-dialysis. Brautbar, N., Shinaberger, J.H., Miller, J.H. and Nachman, M. Nephron, 26 (2), pp. 96-9 (1980). The
authors studied the role ofblood-dialyzer-membrane
interactions in hemodialysis-inducedhypoxemia by
measuring Pa02 and white blood cell counts during
isolated ultrafiltration (UF)compared to hemodialysis (HD, utilizing the same dialyzer and membrane).
Patients in the UF period displayed no hypoxemia
and rather a slight increase in Pa02; on contrast,
these patientsdisplayed significanthypoxemiawhen
HD was imposed. The authors suggest that the
hypoxemia characteristic of HD initiation is not
solely dependent on blood-dialyzer-membraneinteractions, but also requires blood-dialysate interactions.

Outbreak of pyrogenic reactions at a dialysis center.
Association with infusion of heparinized saline solution. Kantor, R.J., Carson, L A , Graham, D.R, Petersen, N.J. and Favero, M.S. Am J Med, 74 (31, pp.
449-56 (Mar 1983). An epidemiologicand laboratory
investigation documented that reactions occurred
only in patients who had anticoagulation with a
dilute solution of heparin. Analyses of heparinized
saline solution used during the outbreak revealed a
bacterial count of 7.4 X 10(5)/ml and a bacterial
endotoxin level of 1,300 ng/ml. Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. Iwoffi was isolated from the solution.
Dilutedheparin solution was prepared at the dialysis
centerbyaddingcommenziallysuppliedsodiumheparin
to 0.9 percent sodium chloride infusion fluid. Bacteria and endotoxin were not detected in vials of stock
heparin and bags of unopened 0.9 percent sodium
chloride infusion fluid. The authors conclude that
contaminationofthe solution occurred a t the dialysis
center. ARer changes in the preparation and use of
heparin were instituted on December 4, 1978, no

heparin. A significantcomplication, defined as complete clotting of the artificial kidney with or without
clottingin the lines occurred in eight dialyses(5.13%
of the total) and resulted in an average blood loss of
150 ml. Partial clotting of the dialyzer did not interrupt the procedure and occurred nine times (5.8% of

Soc Artif Intern Organs, 29, pp. 414-8 (1983). The
pronounced leukopenia caused by cuprophane dialyzer membranes was significantlybluntedby citrate
regional anticoagulation.Cellulose acetate produced
less leukopenia than the cuprophane, regardless of
anticoagulant. The p02 response to the initiation of
hemodialysiswas not affectedby dialyzer membrane
or anticoagulant choice. The authors conclude that
citrate anticoagulationreduces dialyzer-inducedleukopenia. Citrate anticoagulation does not, however,
change the hypoxemia present with acetate dialysis.
The dissociation of leukopenia and hypoxemia with

Port, F.K Kidney Int, 16 (4), pp. 513-8 (Oct 1979).
Hemodialysis in patients with increased risk for
hemorrhage can be accomplished with either a regional or a low total dose of heparin. The incidence
of hemorrhage correlated with the estimated degree
of bleeding risk both a t expected and a t occult bleeding sites, and was the same or higher with regional
heparin in all categories. Hemorrhage was not correlated with preexisting coagulation abnormalities,
concurrent anticoagulant drugs, level of azotemia, or
ability to successllly limit systemic heparinization
during dialysis. The incidence of partial clotting of
the dialyzer was 3% to 5% with both heparin protocols. The authors conclude that regional heparinization has no clinical or practical advantage over lowtotaldose heparin in preventing bleeding associated
with hemodialysis.

tientsusing3 differentheparin regimens: (1)intravenousloadingdose only;(2)primingofthe dialyzer and
continuousinfusion of heparin for two hours; and (3)
intravenous loading dose and continuous infusion of
heparin based on anticoagulationkinetics. The anticoagulation kinetic regimen offered no advantage
over the single loading dose regimen with regard to
the formation and deposition of fibrin in the dialyzers.
Measurement of fibrinopeptideAin the evaluationof
heparin activity and fibrin formationduringhemodialysis. Wilhelmsson, S., Asaba, H., Gunnarsson, B.,
Kudryk, B., Robinson, D. and Bergstrom, J . Clin
Nephrol, 15 (5), pp. 252-8 (May 1981). In order to
monitor heparin activity during hemodialysis, they
evaluatedthree commonlyused methods: whole blood
activated coagulation time (WBACT), whole blood
thrombin time (WBTT), and heparin concentration
in plasma, determined with a chromogenic substrate. They three different heparin regimens: a
single intravenous loading dose only, priming of the
dialyzer with heparin followedby a heparin infusion
and a pharmaco-kinetic model. Good correlations
were found between WBACT, WBTT and heparin
concentration. Heparin activity during a dialysis
may be monitored with any of these three methods
with equal reliability. However, from a practical
point of view, WBACT appears most attractive because of its simplicity. FPAgeneration, frequency of
visible clots in the dialyzer and hemorrhagic manifestations were essentially the same for each of the
heparin dose regimens. The simple administration of
a single loading dose was as safe as the more complicated infusion technique.
Hemodialysis using prostacyclin instead of heparin
as the sole antithrombotic agent. Zusman, RM.,
Rubin, R.H., Cato, AE., Cocchetto, D.M., Crow, J.W.
and Tolkoff-Rubin, N. N Engl J Med, 304 (16), pp.
934-9(Apr16,1981). Anticoagulationduringhemodialysis is necessary to prevent clottingof the blood on
contact with the dialysis membrane. Heparin is the
usual anticoagulant used, but systemic anticoagulation may persist for hours, and hemorrhage is common. The authors successfully used an infusion of
prostacyclin,whichhas an in-vitrohalf-lifeofthree to
five minutes, as the sole anticoagulant on long-term
hemodialysis. Prostacyclin caused no clinically
important changes in the intrinsic clotting system,
and there were no hemorrhages or clotting of the coil.
The authors conclude that prostacyclin can safely
replace heparin as the sole antithrombotic agent
duringhemodialysis and maybe more advantageous
if anticoagulation is contraindicated.

positive alternative to conventional methods of anticoagulation during hemodialysis. For the patient a t
moderate to high risk of bleeding, as well as those
patients with active bleeding at the time of dialysis,
regional citrate anticoagulation can be a safe, effective approach, when performed properly. One of the
major disadvantages, excessive cost, can be reduced
to an acceptable level.

Discussion of gaining and maintaining access to the
A-V fistula for hemodialysis in order to obain maximum effects while creating the minimum of trauma
to the fistula. The paper notes that there is a lack of
research on this subject, but that there is strong
evidence that good needling technique contributesto
fitula survival. Evidence suggests that constant site
insersion in an antegrade direction should be the
method of choice. Needles and tubing sets shouldbe
chosen carefully (sideholes are important, and internal diameter and length areimportantin minimizing
pressure drop).

experience indicates that percutaneous subclavian
vein catheterization is safe and provides quick access
for hemodialysis with no morbidity and mortality if
done correctly, patiently, and meticulously. The

ClinNephrd, 26 (5),pp. 235-8 (Nov1986).Subclavian
vein cannulation was suggested as a temporary vascular access for hemodialysis since one of its advantages was considered to be no damage to blood vessels. As they observed six patients with symptomatic

The authors conclude that the subclavian vein cannulation leads to significant damages of the vessels,

Beraud,J.J., Joyeux,H. and Mion C. Nephron, 43 (2),
pp. 133-8 (1986). Subclavian vein cannulation, although a major progress in temporary vascular access, was associatedwith a significantmorbidity and

this period, 6 sepsies occurred in 19 catheters (other
periods: 7 sepsiedl16 catheters, p less than 0.01). Six

Failures of Cimino fistulae usually occurred early in
the postoperative period, secondary to attempts to
use inadequate veins. Thrombosis caused the majority of PTFE graft failures and was generally the
result of venous stenosis. Correction of such venous
stenosis is mandatory to restore graft patency and
can result in prolonged graR survival.

In-vivo measurement of blood recirculation during

without separate venapuncture, which has the same
urea and creatinine composition as systemic venous
blood during hemodialysis. Using this technique, recirculation in-vivo during "Y" type single needle
dialysis, measured in 20 bovine fistulas, ranged from
6.9% to 56.5% and averaged 19.4%. These results .
suggest that fistula puncture methods and devices
that eliminate recirculation in the ex-vivo blood

of topical thrombin in 12patients treated with hemodialysis. This procedure can, therefore, save patient
and staff time, minimize recurrent blood loss with
each dialysis, and prolong the life of vascular access
by diminishing the length of potentially hazardous
compression needed for proper hemostasis.

clinical problems. Venographyin 36 cases,however,
revealed subclavian stenosis in 18 (50%), of whom 5
developed clinical problems. The incidence of subclavian-vein stenosis was related to the duration of

Adequacy studies of fistula single-needle dialysis.
Vanholder, R, Hoenich, N. and Ringoir, S. Am J

and other parameters of dialysis adequacy indicate
that the efficiency ofthe single-needletechnique is a t
least as good as that obtained in the more currently
used two-needle technique. Fistula survival was
higher, and hospitalization rate and mortality not
different from two-needle dialysis. Subsequently,
the current reluctancetowards single-needle dialysis
as a routine procedure in chronic renal failure, a p
pears to be unjustified.

Recent advances in dialytic technology are probably

In flow time and recirculation in single-needle
hemodialysis. Blurnenthal, S.S., Ortiz, M.A, Meinman, J.G. and Piering, W.F. Am J Kidney Dis, 8 (31,
pp. 202-6 (Sep 1986). The recirculation of previously
dialyzed blood in the lumen of the single-needle
catheter reduces dialysisefficiency andis a drawback
of single-needle dialysis. Maximizing the inflow
volume is essential for minimizing recirculation in
single-needle hemodialysis. Clinically insignificant
recirculation ensues when inflow time is maintained
between three to five seconds and time-time singleneedle devices are used, even in patients dialyzed
with single-lumen subclavian catheters.

that membrane permeability to small solutes (urea,

R. Kidney Int, 19 (5), pp. 728-38 (May 1981). The
practice of multiple use of dialyzers was examined
over a 15-month period on all 104 patients in a
chronic maintenance hemodialysis facility. The
incidence of complicationsduring dialysis, of complicationsthat might be related to infection,and the rate
ofhospitalization was not greater in the unit practicing multiple use as compared with the rates in the
unit practicingsingleuse. Events possibly associated
with infection did not occur more frequently during
dialysesin which the dialyzerhad been usedbetween
2 and 20 times than they did with the initial use ofthe
dialyzer. With successive dialyzer use, there was no
signzcant change in the ability to remove fluid or in
the dialysance of urea and creatinine. The neutropenia that characteristicallyoccurs early in dialysis was substantially less with reused dialyzersthan
with their initial use. Under the operatingconditions
described,theauthors concludethatmultiple dialyzer
use over a 15-month period is safe, efficacious, and is
not associated with an increased rate of infection, of
morbidity, or of mortality.

patients. The percentage of patients without symptoms during dialysis was sigdicantly greater with
reused dialyzersthan with new dialyzers. The severity of total symptoms correlated significantly
(p=0.0004)with complement activation. The results
suggest that total symptoms during dialysis are
correlatedwith the degree of complementactivation.
However, trends in the data pertaining to chest pain
suggest that factors other than complement activation may be important in the pathogenesis of some
