Questions and Answers
Guidance for Institutional Review Boards, Investigators, and
Sponsors1
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Office for Human Research Protections
(OHRP) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on this topic. It does not establish any
rights for any person and is not binding on OHRP, FDA, or the public. You can use an
alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To
discuss an alternative approach, contact OHRP or the FDA office responsible for this guidance
as listed on the title page.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance has been prepared jointly by the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). This guidance is intended for institutional review boards (IRBs), investigators, and
sponsors engaged in or responsible for oversight of human subject research under HHS and/or
FDA regulations.
This guidance provides recommendations on the use of electronic systems and processes that
may employ multiple electronic media to obtain informed consent for both HHS-regulated
human subject research and FDA-regulated clinical investigations of medical products, including
human drug and biological products, medical devices, and combinations thereof. FDA’s
requirements for electronic records/electronic signatures, informed consent, and IRBs are set
forth in 21 CFR parts 11, 50, and 56, respectively. HHS requirements regarding the protection of
human subjects are set forth in 45 CFR part 46. The information presented to the subject,
processes used for obtaining informed consent, and documentation of the electronic informed
consent (eIC) must meet the requirements of these and other applicable regulations.
If the study is conducted or supported by HHS and involves an FDA-regulated product, the study
is subject to both 45 CFR part 46 and 21 CFR parts 50 and 56, meaning that both sets of
regulations must be followed. Where the regulations differ, the regulations that offer the greater
protection to human subjects should be followed. Research not subject to 21 CFR parts 50 and

This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Medical Policy in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
and the Office of Good Clinical Practice in the Office of Medical Products and Tobacco in coordination with the
Center for Biologics Evaluation Research and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health at the Food and Drug
Administration. This guidance was developed jointly with the Department for Health and Human Services Office
for Human Research Protections.

56 is also not generally subject to 21 CFR part 11 (FDA regulations regarding electronic records
and electronic signatures).
For the purposes of this guidance, electronic informed consent refers to the use of electronic
systems and processes that may employ multiple electronic media, including text, graphics,
audio, video, podcasts, passive and interactive Web sites, biological recognition devices, and
card readers, to convey information related to the study and to obtain and document informed
consent.
This guidance clarifies that when implementing an eIC, a variety of approaches may be used to
fulfill HHS and FDA regulatory requirements for informed consent and IRB review (45 CFR
part 46 and 21 CFR parts 50 and 56) and FDA regulations for electronic records and electronic
signatures (21 CFR part 11).
This guidance provides recommendations on procedures that may be followed when using an
eIC to help:


Ensure protection of the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects



Facilitate the subject’s comprehension of the information presented during the eIC
process



Ensure that appropriate documentation of consent is obtained when electronic systems
and processes that may employ multiple electronic media are used to obtain informed
consent2



Ensure the quality and integrity of eIC data3 included in FDA applications and made
available to FDA during inspections

Although both OHRP and FDA affirm that the informed consent process begins with subject
recruitment,4 recommendations on using electronic media and processes for subject recruitment
are outside the scope of this guidance.
2

Investigators are required to prepare and maintain records as described in 21 CFR 312.62 and 812.140(a).
Similarly, sponsors are required to maintain records relating to an investigation as described in 21 CFR 312.57 and
812.140(b).

3

For the purposes of this guidance, eIC data includes the template and site-specific versions of eIC, materials
submitted to IRBs for review and approval, all amendments to the template and site-specific eICs, required informed
consent elements presented to the subject during the eIC process, and the electronic signature of the subject,
including the date when the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative (LAR) signed the eIC.

For additional information on subject recruitment, see the guidance for institutional review boards and clinical
investigators Recruiting Study Subjects – Information Sheet, available at
http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126428.htm. We update guidances periodically. To

In general, OHRP and FDA guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in guidances means that something is suggested or recommended,
but not required.
To enhance human subject protection and reduce regulatory burden, OHRP and FDA have been
actively working to harmonize the Agencies’ regulatory requirements and guidance for human
subject research. This guidance document was developed as a part of these efforts.

II.

BACKGROUND

The term informed consent is often mistakenly viewed as synonymous with obtaining a
handwritten signature from the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative (LAR)5
on a written informed consent form. However, obtaining a subject’s oral or written informed
consent is only part of the overall informed consent process. Informed consent involves
providing a potential subject with adequate information about the research to allow for an
informed decision about the subject’s voluntary participation in a research study. Informed
consent must include a process that facilitates the subject’s comprehension of the information
and allows adequate opportunity for the subject to ask questions and consider whether or not to
participate (45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20). Furthermore, this process often continues
beyond obtaining the subject’s initial consent at the time of enrollment and may involve
providing additional information as the research progresses or as the subject or situation
requires.6 The elements of informed consent for human subjects and the requirements for
documentation of informed consent are discussed in 45 CFR 46.116 and 46.117 and 21 CFR
50.25 and 50.27, respectively.
The research community is showing increasing interest in using electronic media to supplement
or replace paper-based informed consent processes. An eIC may be used to provide information
usually contained within the written informed consent document, evaluate the subject’s
comprehension of the information presented, and document the consent of the subject or the
subject’s LAR. Electronic processes to obtain informed consent may use an interactive interface,
which may facilitate the subject’s ability to retain and comprehend the information.
Furthermore, these electronic processes may allow for rapid notification to the subjects of any
amendments pertaining to the informed consent that may affect their willingness to continue to
participate. Electronic processes may also promote timely entry of any eIC data into a study
5

Legally authorized representative (LAR) means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable
law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to the subject’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the
research (45 CFR 46.102(c) and 21 CFR 50.3(l)).

database and allow for timely collection of the subject’s informed consent data from remote
locations.

III.

INSTITUTING AN ELECTRONIC INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q1.

How should information in the eIC be presented to the subject?

The eIC must contain all elements of informed consent required by HHS and/or FDA regulations
(45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.25). The information must be in language understandable to the
potential subject or the subject’s LAR and conveyed in a manner that minimizes the possibility
of coercion or undue influence regarding the subject’s decision to participate in a study (45 CFR
46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20).7 Understandable means that the information presented to subjects is
in a language and at a level the subject can comprehend, including an explanation of scientific
and medical terms. To ensure that the eIC is presented appropriately and that subjects will have
enough time to dedicate to the eIC process, the subjects should be informed of approximately
how long the process will take and what information will be presented to them.
Any eIC should be easy to navigate, allowing the user to proceed forward or backward within the
system and to stop and continue at a later time. Hyperlinks may be provided where helpful. The
eIC may also incorporate electronic strategies to encourage subjects to access all of the consent
material before documenting their consent.
Electronic informed consent may be used to either supplement or replace paper-based informed
consent processes in order to best address the subject’s needs throughout the course of the study.
For example, some subjects may prefer one method over another. Other subjects may have
difficulty navigating or using electronic systems because of, for example, a lack of familiarity
with electronic systems, poor eyesight, or impaired motor skills. In such cases, the eIC process
may not be appropriate for these subjects.8 Therefore, subjects should have the option to use
paper-based or electronic informed consent methods completely or partially throughout the
informed consent process. Moreover, in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for
investigators or study personnel to assist subjects in using the eIC technology. For example,
study personnel may help the subject navigate the consent by clicking on links for the subject.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Q2.

How and where may the eIC process be conducted?

The investigator is responsible for ensuring that legally effective informed consent is obtained
before that subject takes part in the study (see 45 CFR 46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20, 312.60, and
812.100). If the investigator delegates this responsibility, the responsibility should be delegated
to an individual qualified by education, training, and experience to perform this activity.9
Whether part or all of the eIC process takes place on-site or remotely, the responsibility for
obtaining informed consent remains with the investigator and the study personnel to which
responsibility has been appropriately delegated. The investigator cannot delegate authority to
obtain informed consent to the electronic system.
The consent process may take place at the study site when both the investigator and subject are at
the same location, or it may take place remotely (e.g., at the subject’s home or another
convenient venue) where the subject reviews the consent document in the absence of the
investigator. The eIC materials may be provided for both on-site and remote access.
If the entire process takes place at the study site, the study personnel can personally verify the
subject’s identification, review the eIC content, answer questions about the material, have
follow-up discussions, and witness the signing of the eIC.
If any or all of the consent process takes place remotely and is not personally witnessed by study
personnel, the electronic system must include a method to ensure that the person electronically
signing the informed consent is the subject who will be participating in the research study or is
the subject’s LAR (see 21 CFR 11.100(b)). Examples of various methods that could be used
include verification of a state-issued identification or other identifying documents or use of
personal questions, biometric methods, or visual methods (see Q7).
For Research Under the Sole Authority of 45 CFR Part 46
OHRP recognizes that it may not be possible or necessary for all types of research covered by 45
CFR part 46 to verify that the person signing the informed consent is the subject or the subject’s
LAR who will be participating in the research study. OHRP encourages investigators to apply a
risk-based approach to the consideration of subject identity. For example, social behavioral
minimal risk research will not typically warrant such verification. In addition, informed consent
may be waived for minimal risk research meeting the requirements at 45 CFR 46.116(d).

Q3.

How and when should questions from subjects be answered?

Whether the eIC is obtained from the subject on-site or remotely, the eIC process must provide
sufficient opportunity for the subject to consider whether to participate (see 45 CFR 46.116 and
21 CFR 50.20). The investigator should have methods in place to ensure that the eIC process
allows subjects the opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and to ask questions

See the guidance for industry Investigator Responsibilities – Protecting the Rights, Safety, and Welfare of Study
Subjects (available at http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm122046.htm).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
about the study before signing consent as well as at any time during the subject’s involvement in
the research. This may be accomplished by in-person discussions with study personnel or
through a combination of electronic messaging, telephone calls, video conferencing, or a live
chat with a remotely located investigator or study personnel. When live chat or video
conferencing is used during the eIC process, investigators and study personnel should remind
subjects to conduct the eIC discussion in a private location to help ensure privacy and
confidentiality.
Subjects should be given a description of how and when they will receive answers to their
questions, and they must be provided information on how to contact an appropriate individual for
pertinent questions about the research and their rights and whom to contact in the event that they
sustain a research-related injury (see 45 CFR 46.116(a)(7) and 21 CFR 50.25(a)(7)).

Q4.

What steps may be taken to facilitate the subject’s understanding of the
information being presented?

To assist the subject in understanding the material, the eIC may use interactive electronic-based
technology, which may include diagrams, images, graphics, videos, and narration. The eIC
should be appropriate for the intended audience, taking into consideration the subject’s age,
language, and comprehension level.
The eIC may contain various methods to help an investigator assess the subject’s understanding
of the information being presented during the eIC process. For example, the eIC may include
optional questions at any time during the eIC discussion that can be used to help educate the
subject about the information presented, as well as assess the subject’s understanding of the
informed consent materials. Such optional questions and other methods may be used as tools to
gauge subject comprehension of key study elements and highlight areas where the subject might
need further explanation and discussion before signing the informed consent to enter the study.

Q5.

What steps may be taken to convey additional information, including
significant new findings, to the subject during the course of the research?

When appropriate, the eIC must contain a statement that significant new findings developed
during the course of the research that may affect to the subject’s willingness to continue
participation will be provided to the subject or the subject’s LAR (see 45 CFR 46.116(b)(5) and
21 CFR 50.25(b)(5)). If an update or amendment to an eIC is necessary and could affect the
subject’s willingness to continue participation in the study, the eIC process must provide
sufficient opportunity for the subject to consider whether to continue participation (see 45 CFR
46.116 and 21 CFR 50.20). If the eIC is updated or amended, the subject should be given
sufficient opportunity to ask questions about the amended contents (see Q3). In such cases, the
subject or the subject’s LAR must sign the amended eIC before the subject continues in the study
(see 45 CFR 46.117(a) and 21 CFR 50.27). OHRP and FDA regulations permit the flexibility of
using electronic and paper informed consent methods independently or in combination
throughout the course of the study. Thus, amendments to the eIC do not need to be electronic in

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
nature and can instead rely on more traditional means, such as paper-based amendments or postal
mail, for conveying and transmitting the information to the subject (see Q1).

Q6.

How can electronic signatures be used to document eIC?

The procedure for eIC may include an electronic method to capture the signature of the subject
or the subject’s LAR. OHRP and FDA regulations permit the use of electronic signatures when
written informed consent is required. OHRP permits electronic signatures if such signatures are
legally valid within the jurisdiction where the research is to be conducted.
For FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations
FDA regulations found at 21 CFR part 11 set forth the criteria under which FDA considers
electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten signatures executed to electronic
records to be trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to a handwritten signature executed
on paper (see 21 CFR 11.1(a)). In order to be considered equivalent to full handwritten
signatures, electronic signatures must comply with all applicable requirements under 21 CFR
part 11.10 The electronic system must also capture and record the date that the subject or
subject’s LAR provides consent (see 21 CFR 50.27(a)).
The regulations found at 21 CFR part 11 permit a wide variety of methods to create electronic
signatures, including using computer-readable ID cards, biometrics,11 digital signatures,12 and
user name and password combinations. FDA does not mandate or specify any particular
methods for electronic signatures, including any particular biometric method upon which an
electronic signature may be based.
Electronic signatures based on biometrics must be designed to ensure that they cannot be used by
anyone other than their genuine owners (21 CFR 11.200(b)). Therefore, suitable biometrics
should be uniquely identified with the individual and should not change with time. In addition,
electronic signatures based upon biometrics are accepted provided they meet the requirements
found in 21 CFR part 11 (i.e., they must contain pertinent information associated with the
signing (see 21 CFR 11.50(a)); they are subject to the same controls as electronic records and
must be included as part of any human readable form of the electronic record (see 21 CFR
11.50(b)); and they must be linked to their respective electronic records (see 21 CFR 11.70).
10

See 21 CFR part 11. For additional information, see the guidance for industry Part 11, Electronic Records;
Electronic Signatures – Scope and Application, available at
http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm125067.htm.
11

Biometrics means a method of verifying an individual’s identity based on measurements of the individual’s
physical feature(s) or repeatable action(s) where those features and/or actions are both unique to that individual and
measurable (21 CFR 11.3(b)(3)).

12

Digital signature means an electronic signature based upon cryptographic methods of originator authentication,
computed by using a set of rules and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the
data can be verified (21 CFR 11.3(b)(5)).

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
IRBs, investigators, and sponsors should consider such issues as how the electronic signature is
created and whether the informed consent or permission document can be produced in hard copy
for review by the subject upon request. IRBs, investigators, and sponsors may rely on a
statement from the vendor of the electronic system used for obtaining the electronic signature
that describes how the signature is created and that the system meets the relevant requirements
contained in 21 CFR part 11.
A copy of the informed consent must be provided to the person signing the form (see 21
CFR 50.27(a)) (see Q9).

Q7.

What methods may be used to verify the identity of the subject who will be
electronically signing an eIC for FDA-regulated clinical investigations?

Compliance with the requirements in Part 11 is meant in part to prevent fraudulent use.
Therefore, the regulations found at 21 CFR part 11 require that an organization verify the
identity of an individual before it establishes, assigns, certifies, or otherwise sanctions an
individual’s electronic signature or any element of such electronic signature (see 21 CFR
11.100(b)).
FDA regulations do not specify any particular method for verifying the identity of an individual
and accepts many different methods. For example, verifying someone’s identity can be done by
using information from some form of official identification, such as a birth certificate,
government-issued passport, or a driver’s license. In addition, use of security questions to
confirm an individual’s identity can also be considered.

Q8.

What special considerations should be given to the use of eIC for pediatric
studies?

The eIC process can be used to obtain assent from pediatric subjects (when required) and
parental permission from their parent(s) or guardian. The general requirements for informed
consent, found in 45 CFR 46.116 and 46.117 and 21 CFR 50.20, 50.25, and 50.27, apply to
parental permission, in addition to the requirements for permission by parents or guardians and
for assent by children found at 45 CFR 46.408 and 21 CFR 50.55.13 Therefore, parental
permission may be obtained and documented using the same eIC procedures as would be used
for informed consent.
Absent a waiver of the assent requirement (see 45 CFR 46.408(a) and 21 CFR 50.55(d)), or a
determination that assent is not necessary (see 45 CFR 46.408(a) and 21 CFR 50.55(c)), the IRB
13

We note that while 45 CFR 46.408(c) permits a waiver of parental permission under certain circumstances, 21
CFR part 50 does not contain such a waiver provision. There may, however, be certain circumstances under which
parental permission is not required by 21 CFR part 50 for research conducted in mature or emancipated minors
because those minors do not meet the definition of children found at 21 CFR 50.3(o). See 78 FR 12937 at 12945

and 12946.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
must determine that there are adequate provisions for soliciting the assent of children when, in
the IRB’s judgment, the children are capable of providing assent (see 45 CFR 46.408(a) and 21
CFR 50.55(a)). When approving an eIC assent process, an IRB should consider whether the
capability of a child to assent may be affected by the method used to obtain and/or document
child assent. For example, if assent would otherwise be required, the method used to obtain eIC
assent should not impede the child’s capability to provide assent. The language and presentation
of information must be understandable to the child. In addition, when the IRB determines that
assent is required, it must also determine whether and how assent must be documented (see 45
CFR 46.408(e) and 21 CFR 50.55(g)).
For FDA-Regulated Clinical Investigations
Depending on the method of identity verification used to satisfy the regulations in 21 CFR part
11 for electronic signatures in FDA-regulated clinical investigations, a child may lack the
documentation necessary to verify their identity for the purposes of preventing fraudulent use of
electronic signatures (e.g., driver’s license) (see Q7). If so, depending on the clinical
investigation, it may be reasonable for the parent to initially document the child’s assent, which
can then be verified when the investigator first sees the child.

Q9.

Should subjects receive a copy of their eIC and have easy access to the
materials and information presented to them in their eIC?

Yes. HHS and FDA regulations require that the person signing the informed consent (i.e., the
subject or the subject’s LAR or the parents or guardians of subjects who are children) be given a
copy of the written informed consent form (45 CFR 46.117(a) and 21 CFR 50.27(a)), unless the
requirement for documentation of informed consent has been waived under 45 CFR 46.117(c)
and 21 CFR 56.109(c)). Although FDA regulations do not require that the subject’s copy
include a signature, FDA recommends that a copy of the signed informed consent form that
includes the date when the eIC was signed be provided to the subject.
The copy provided to the subject can be paper or electronic and may be provided on an
electronic storage device or via email. If the copy provided includes one or more hyperlinks to
information on the Internet, the hyperlinks should be maintained and information should be
accessible until study completion. Note that if the eIC uses hyperlinks or other Web sites or
podcasts to convey information specifically related to the research, the information in these
hyperlinks should be included in any printed paper copy, if one is provided.
Q10. What steps can be taken to help ensure privacy, security, and confidentiality
of the eIC information?
For FDA-regulated clinical investigations, the electronic system that supports the eIC must be
secure with restricted access (see 21 CFR 11.10 and 11.30) and should include methods to ensure

confidentiality regarding the subject’s identity, study participation, and personal information
after informed consent has been obtained.14
If the entity holding the subject’s personal information is a covered entity under the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Public Law No. 104-191)15 or
acting as a business associate of a HIPAA-covered entity, the requirements in the HIPAA
Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules apply (see 45 CFR parts 160 and 164). For
example, the subject’s information within an electronic system must be encrypted, unless the
entity documents why encryption is not reasonable and appropriate in their specific
circumstances and implements a reasonable and appropriate equivalent measure.

Q11. Can HIPAA authorizations for research, which are frequently combined
with informed consent documents, be obtained electronically?16
Yes. HIPAA authorizations may be obtained electronically, provided that the signature of the
subject (or the subject’s personal representative) is a valid electronic signature under applicable
laws and regulations.17 The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESign Act) (Public Law 106-229) addresses what constitutes a valid electronic signature and
provides that a signature may not be denied legal effect because it is in electronic form.
The HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that when a covered entity seeks an authorization from a
subject (or a subject’s personal representative), the covered entity must provide the individual
with a copy of the signed authorization; this requirement also applies where a HIPAA
authorization is obtained electronically.18

The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) administers and enforces the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which protects the
privacy of individually identifiable health information and establishes an array of individual rights with respect to
health information; the Security Rule, which sets national standards for protecting the security of electronic
protected health information; and the Breach Notification Rule, which requires covered entities and business
associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information. Additional
information about the HIPAA Rules is available on OCR’s Web site at: http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/.

Q12. What eIC materials should the investigator submit to the IRB?
The investigator should submit to the IRB copies of all forms (electronic and paper forms) and
informational materials, including any videos and Web-based presentations, which the subject
will receive and view during the eIC process. The investigator must obtain IRB approval for any
subsequent modifications to the study-related information, whether electronic or in hard copy
(see 45 CFR 46.109 and 21 CFR 56.109). OHRP and FDA recommend that an investigator
discuss plans for using eIC with the IRB before finalizing development of the eIC to ensure that
the IRB agrees that such a format may be used for the applicable research for obtaining informed
consent.

Q13. What are the IRB’s responsibilities in the eIC process?
HHS and FDA regulations require that an IRB review and have authority to approve, require
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research activities covered by the
applicable regulations (see 45 CFR 46.109(a) and 21 CFR 56.109(a)). A critical part of this
responsibility is for the IRB to ensure there is an adequate informed consent process that protects
the rights and welfare of subjects participating in HHS-regulated research and FDA-regulated
clinical investigations (see 45 CFR 46.109(b) and 21 CFR 56.109(b) and 56.111(a)(4)).
Therefore, the IRB must review and approve the eIC and any amendments to the eIC that the
subject will receive and view (see 45 CFR 46.109(a) and 21 CFR 56.109(a)). The IRBs must
maintain and retain copies of materials that have been reviewed in accordance with 45 CFR
46.115 and 21 CFR 56.115.
The IRBs should also review any optional questions or methods used to gauge subject
comprehension of key study elements. The IRB should also review the usability of the eIC
materials to ensure that they are easy to navigate. If the program uses hyperlinks to convey
study-related information, IRBs should review the contents to which subjects are referred in
order to determine if the study-related information that has been supplied is accurate and
appropriate. Because Web sites are often modified over time, IRBs must maintain the version of
the Web site information that contains the study-related information that the IRB reviews and
approves, either electronically or as a hard copy (see 45 CFR 46.115 and 21 CFR 56.115).

Q14. What eIC documentation does FDA require for submission with
applications?
Investigational new drug application (IND) regulations do not specifically require submission of
informed consent documents to FDA as part of an IND application; however, the Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER) may request submission of the informed consent form for review19 under certain
circumstances (e.g., when unusual known clinical toxicity is associated with the study drug or
class of drugs; when the study population is particularly vulnerable; when the clinical
19

investigation has significant potential for serious risks to human subjects; or for a postmarket
safety clinical trial, required under section 505(o) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FD&C Act)20 to assess a serious risk).21 Although all informed consent documents used in
FDA-regulated clinical investigations must be reviewed by an IRB (see 21 CFR 56.103), there
are situations in which CDER and CBER review of an informed consent in addition to IRB
review is particularly important to determine whether a clinical investigation may safely proceed
under 21 CFR part 312.
Investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations state that IDE applications must include
copies of all forms and informational materials to be provided to subjects to obtain informed
consent (see 21 CFR 812.20(b)(11)). When FDA approval of an IDE application is required, a
sponsor must not begin an investigation until the IDE application and informed consent materials
have been reviewed and approved by FDA (see 21 CFR 812.20(a) and (b)).
The sponsor should submit to FDA the same eIC materials that will be presented to subjects to
obtain eIC for their participation in the clinical investigation. For example, as part of an
electronic submission to FDA, the sponsor should submit copies of all forms and informational
materials including any videos, Web-based presentations, hyperlinks or other Web sites or
podcasts that are used to convey information specifically related to the investigation. The
sponsor should also submit any written information related to the clinical investigation that is
provided to the subject on paper. Hyperlinks or other Web sites or podcasts containing
incidental information not related to the clinical investigation need not be submitted to FDA.
The eIC materials should be provided in an electronic format acceptable to FDA, on an
electronic storage device, or as a link to the eIC Web page that is accessible to FDA for viewing
these eIC materials.22

Q15. What steps can be taken to ensure the system archives the eIC materials
appropriately for FDA-regulated clinical investigations?
FDA regulations do not specify a preferred method for archiving documents; however, the eIC
process should incorporate procedures to ensure that electronic documents can be archived
appropriately and that all versions of the IRB-approved eIC can be retrieved easily. All
procedures must be in compliance with applicable FDA regulations for electronic records.23

Q16. What materials or documents will FDA require during an inspection?
During inspections of clinical investigation sites,24 FDA regulations require that FDA be granted
access to records and reports made by the investigator, including site-specific versions of the
eIC, the materials submitted to IRBs for review and approval, all amendments to the site-specific
eICs, and all subject-specific signed eICs.25 These should be available at the site either in
electronic or paper form. FDA reserves the right to review the content of the eIC program or
informed consent document and the corresponding informed consent of the subject or the
subject’s LAR and the signature of a witness, where applicable, along with the date that the eIC
was signed. Any updates to the documentation should also be available for review.

Under the FD&C Act, FDA may inspect and copy all records relating to a clinical investigation (21 U.S.C.
374(a)(1)). See also 21 CFR 312.58, 312.68, and 812.145(b).
