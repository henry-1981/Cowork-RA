On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Sterilized Convenience Kits for Clinical
and Surgical Use.

This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the
public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal
requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those
requirements. However, if you believe that the information requested in the guidance is not
relevant to the decision-making process or that an alternative approach would be less
burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your
written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH
Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways t o contact
him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/resolvingdisputes/ombudsman.html.

Medical Device Kit Assembler / Manufacturer1
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) continues to have concerns about
finished device components that are assembled into clinical or surgical convenience kits and the kit
is then sterilized. In some cases, the finished device is actually being sterilized for a second time.
Some components may be adversely affected by further processing i n the sterilization process. For
the purposes of this guidance, a finished device component in a convenience kit is a device in
finished form held for sale to an end user that is suitable for use or capable of functioning, whether
For concerns regarding drug products, please review the last paragraph of this document and
contact the appropriate office in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

or not it is packaged, la beled or sterilized. Please ensure that your sterilization process does not
adversely affect the finished components in your kits.
There are five areas that, at a minimum, you should cover to ensure that the sterilization process
does not adversely affect the finished components in your convenience kits. Those areas include
the following:
--Sterilization Process
- Sterilant Residuals
- Labeling
- Premarket Notification
- General Controls
A sterilization process may pose the following issues that you need to address:
1. Effects of the sterilization process - Does exposure to heat during the sterilization process cause the material in a
device to degrade before the labeled expiration date?
- Does the sterilization process (e.g., vacuum effects, radiation) affect the form, fit
or function of device components? The device kit repackers should ensure that
the sterilization process does not adversely affect the functionality of the device
components. For example, it is known that irradiation can effect certain polym ers,
resulting in a loss of strength. The device component manufacturer would have
information or recommendations on the effects of the sterilization processes.
- Does the sterilization process affect the package integrity for devices? For
example, the package integrity of all device components should remain in tact for
any sterilization cycle that may be designated for the convenience kits.
2. Labeling - The convenience kit should provide instructions for appropriate storage conditions
and contain an expir ation date supported by stability data. The expiration dates for
device components should be revised based on data from your process validation
studies for devices. The expiration date should not be longer than the shortest
expiration date of any component in the kit.
For example, what is the impact on a kit's components when stored for one year
at room temperature at 30 degrees centigrade? (See ICH, Q1A Stability Testing
of New Substances and Products.) If you determine that the shortest expiration
date is 3 months from the date of sterilization, that establishes the sterility
expiration date for the entire kit.

- There is no specific policy in place with respect to labeling for device kits.
3. Premarket Notification - Is a 510(k) or PMA needed for the kit?
As a manufacturer of convenience kits, you should determine whether the
sterilization of the convenience kit significantly affects the safety or effectiveness of
any of the kit's components. If your sterilization process looks like it significa ntly
affects the safety or effectiveness of any of the kit's medical device components,
you may need to submit a premarket notification to our Office of Device
Evaluation (ODE) in the Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
In making this determinatio n, we recommend that you review the interim guidance
for convenience kits entitled:
"Convenience Kits Interim Regulatory Guidance," issued by ODE.
The guidance can be accessed on the Internet at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/convkit.html.
You may also need to review the procedures described in related guidance
document entitled:
"Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for Change to an Existing Device,"
which may be accessed on the Internet at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/510kmod.html
Part of our premarket review of convenience kits focuses on the impact that
sterilization has on individual kit components. This guidance is intended to help
you address questions that can ensure that the components are not adversely
affected by the reprocessing procedures and that the kit can be used for its
labeled indications.
4. General Controls - You are required to comply with general controls, such as manuf acturing,
labeling controls, and postmarket reporting of adverse events or any
corrections and removals of product that present a risk to health. Because the
assembly and sterilization of your convenience kit is considered a
manufacturing operation subject to good manufacturing practice requirements,
it is necessary for you to document that the device components are not
adversely affected by further processing and that the labeling is correct. You
3

should be sure that expiration dates on labeling are valid. (See Title 21 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820 for Good Manufacturing Practices
(GMPs).) The agency may review those records.
Additional information regarding manufacturing regulations that apply to the
sterilization of medical devices is available in the document entitled
"Application of the Device Good Manufacturing Practice Regulation to the
Manufacture of Sterile Devices." The document can be accessed on FDA's
Internet site at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/267.pdf. In order to receive this
guidance via a fax machine, call the CDRH Facts -on-Demand (FOD) system
at (800) 899-0381 or (301) 827-0111 from a touch-tone telephone. At the
first voice prompt press 1 to access the FOD option, at the second voice
prompt press 2, and then enter the document number 267 followed by the
pound sign. Then follow the remaining voice prompts to complete your
request.

In summary, you should address the following issues related to the manufacture of your
convenience kits:
1. How does your sterilization process affect the various device components in your
kit?
2. What are the sterilant residuals of your sterilization process?
3. Does the labeling of the kit include validated storage instructions?
- Is the expiration dating for the kits appropriate?
4. Is a 510(k) or PMA submission needed?
5. Do you meet the general manufacturing, labeling, and postmarket reporting
requirements, i.e., adverse events and recalls (corrections and removals for
devices (21 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 820, 803 and 806.))?
