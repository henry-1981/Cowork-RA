TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT : Applicability of Viewing Optics Performance Requirements
to a Sighting Telescope of a Surveying Laser Product,
21 CFR 1040.10(f) (8)

BACKGROUND AND QUESTION: A manufacturer of a surveying laser product
incorporates into the product a sighting telescope that is intended to
be used to aim the product and to view the laser light diffusely reflected
from a target. When used as intended by the manufacturer the maximum
level of laser radiation accessible through the telescope is well below
the maximum accessible level for viewing optics despite emission from
the laser product being well in excess of this level. The manufacturer
is aware that users may employ retroreflective or specular mirror targets
with the product, in which case the level of laser radiation accessible
through the telescope may approach the level of the laser itself. The
manufacturer is reluctant to utilize a lower power laser so that the
product could be Class I since viewing of the reflected laser light from
a diffuse target under normal daylight background conditions would be
impossible. The manufacturer asks whether it is the intent to consider
such sighting telescopes as viewing optics under 21 CFR 1040.10 and
1040.11.

RESPONSE: The telescope is intended for viewing the reflection of the
laser light. Therefore the function of the telescope and the target is
that of a viewing optic, and the performance of the unit must conform to
21 CFR 1040.10(f) (8).

If the manufacturer supplies or specifically recommends a diffusely
reflecting target for use with the laser product, and provides instruc-
tions and warnings to use only that target, then if the viewing optic
attenuates the beam reflected from the target to the level of Class I
under all possible uses, the product would be compliant with the require-
ments of 21 CFR 1040.10(f) (8). The target in this case may be considered
an integral part of the viewing optics system and of the laser product.

A specific warning not to use a target which would give a specular
reflection or a retroreflection would be required in the instructions as
being necessary for adequate safety information. A supplemental warning
not to view the radiation in conjunction with mirror-like targets may be
added to the warning logotype required to be on the exterior of the
laser product pursuant to 21 CFR 1040.10(g)(2) and (3).
