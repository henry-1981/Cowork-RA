Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff
Blood Lancet Labeling

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This guidance recommends changes in the labeling of blood lancet (e.g., fingerstick) devices
(21 CFR 878.4800) (included under manual surgical instruments for general use). FDA is
concerned about the risk of transmission of hepatitis and other bloodborne pathogens when
blood lancets are used to obtain blood from more than one patient. FDA is recommending
that all blood lancets designed to be used more than once (for example, when a blade
attached to a reusable base device is changed) be labeled for use only on a single patient
obtaining personal blood samples. Manufacturers of blood lancets should clearly state in
their labeling that blood lancets are intended only for single use or, in the case of lancet
devices designed to be used more than once, for multiple uses in only a single patient.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Scope
This guidance document applies to all blood lancet devices (21 CFR 878.4800).
FDA is issuing this guidance with labeling recommendations for single patient use only of
blood lancets. FDA has concerns that both healthcare providers and patients may not be
aware of the serious adverse health risks associated with the use of a blood lancet device for
the assisted withdrawal of blood from more than one patient and when sharing the same
device, including among family members, even when the lancet blade is changed for each
blood draw. FDA is also recommending labeling changes for single use only blood lancets.

Background
On August 26, 2010, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
issued communications warning that the use of blood lancets to obtain blood from more than
one patient poses a risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens. The FDA and CDC
recommend that blood lancet devices should never be used to obtain blood samples from
more than one person. Additionally, on August 27, 2010, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a Survey and Certification Memorandum for Point of Care
Devices and Infection Control in Nursing Homes identifying the use of lancet devices for
more than one patient as an infection control standards deficiency.
FDA and CDC are concerned about the risk of transmitting hepatitis and other bloodborne
pathogens resulting from the use of blood lancet devices in multiple patients in various
healthcare provision settings. These include acute care hospitals, long term care facilities,
assisted living facilities, and non-residential care settings. CDC has noted increasing reports
of outbreaks of hepatitis B transmission due to the use of blood lancet devices on multiple
patients.
Blood lancet devices may be unsafe when used to draw blood from more than one patient for
several reasons. Improper device design, device malfunction or user error may leave the
blood from one patient on the reusable lancet device base and in a position to contaminate a
new lancet blade. Healthcare users of blood lancets may have difficulty ensuring that all
blood contamination has been successfully removed from a reusable lancet base device. The
cleaning and disinfection instructions provided with reusable lancet devices may not be
adequately validated for efficacy or may not be followed in their entirety by healthcare users.
In addition, single use only lancets, which minimize the risk of transmitting bloodborne
pathogens arising from multiple patient use, should contain language in the labeling
identifying the device as “single use only” and instructing for their safe disposal.

Recommended Blood Lancet Device Labeling
FDA recommends that all blood lancet devices be labeled for use only on a single patient. A
statement limiting use to a single patient should appear on the labeling attached to the device,
if possible.
The device labeling, including the Instructions for Use, for all blood lancet devices should
clearly and prominently state that the device is intended for “single patient use only.” We
recommend that all written, printed, and graphic matter that accompanies the blood lancet
device also contain the same language.
Recommendations for Multiple Use-Capable Blood Lancets
For a blood lancet device designed to be used multiple times, the reusable base portion of the
device should carry labeling with the limitation, “single patient use only.”
In addition, the Instructions for Use of these devices should contain language that multiple
use devices should not be used for assisted blood draws by healthcare providers or at
healthcare provision sites * , and should never be shared with anyone else, even a family
member.

Blood lancet devices designed for multiple use also should provide manufacturer-validated
user instructions5 for the cleaning and the disinfection of the reusable lancet device base after
every use by the individual patient. Manufacturers of blood lancets with a reusable device
base and single use lancet blades should include in the labeling, including the Instructions for
Use and the written, printed, and graphic matter that accompanies the blood lancet device,
instructions for the safe disposal of the single use lancet blades.

Recommendations for Single Use Only Blood Lancets
*

Any setting where fingerstick procedures are performed, including assisted living or residential care facilities,
skilled nursing facilities, clinics, health fairs, shelters, detention facilities, senior centers, schools, and camps.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Single use only, disposable blood lancets minimize the risk of transmitting bloodborne
pathogens. The labeling of single use disposable blood lancets, which may include a selfdisabling feature, should include language that only single use disposable blood lancets
should be used for assisted blood draws by healthcare providers or at healthcare provision
sites. These devices should be clearly labeled as “single use only”. Manufacturers of single
use disposable blood lancets should include in the labeling, including the Instructions for Use
and the written, printed, and graphic matter that accompanies the blood lancet device,
instructions for the safe disposal of these blood-contaminated devices. If the device contains
a sharps safety/self-disabling feature, the Instructions for Use should include a description of
its use.
