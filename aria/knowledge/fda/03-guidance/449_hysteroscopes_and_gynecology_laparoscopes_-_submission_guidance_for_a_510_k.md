Page 1 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
Introduction 
This document outlines the information to be submitted in a 510(k) premarket notification for 
hysteroscopes and gynecologic laparoscopes. For devices that differ significantly from those 
already on the market, FDA may require additional information specific to those differences. 
This document is intended as a companion to the Substantial Equivalence Comparison Chart 
released in April 1995 (see Appendix A), and it replaces our previous March 25, 1994, 
“Hysteroscopes & Laparoscopes, Insufflators & Other Related Instrumentation: Submission 
Requirements for a 510(k).” 
Due to the diversity in their design and intended use, hysteroscopic/laparoscopic accessories (such 
as forceps, electrodes, insufflators, light sources, etc.), are not specifically addressed in this 
guidance document. However, many of the non-electrical accessories are suitable for Tier-1 
review (see Appendix B). For more information on the Tier-1 policy, contact the Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health's Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) at 
(800) 638-2041 or (301) 443-6597. Information about premarket notification requirements for 
insufflators may be found in “Hysteroscopic and Laparoscopic Insufflators: Submission Guidance 
for a 510(k),” also available from DSMA.

Device Description, Intended Use, and Directions for Use 
This section identifies the information necessary to evaluate the 
hysteroscope/laparoscope’s technological characteristics. Additional information may be 
required depending on the individual design and function of the device. 
In order to permit an equivalence determination, all of the device characteristics 
and performance data presented in the premarket notification should be compared 
with a legally marketed device whenever possible.  (See the “Substantial Equivalence 
Comparison Chart for Laparoscopes,” Appendix A). 
A. 
Intended Use 
The 510(k) must provide a clear statement of the device's intended use, including 
the indications for use. Generic intended use statements are listed below: 
Hysteroscope - used to permit direct viewing of the cervical canal and the 
uterine cavity for the purpose of performing diagnostic and surgical 
procedures. 


Page 3 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
Laparoscope - used to permit direct viewing of the organs within the 
peritoneal cavity for the purpose of performing diagnostic and surgical 
procedures. 
B. 
Device Description 
1. 
System Block Diagram (if applicable) 
2. 
Schematics and Diagrams 
Provide diagrams of the hysteroscope or laparoscope, with all key 
dimensions and component materials well marked. Multiple diagrams may 
be necessary to show adequate detail, including key cross-sectional 
diagrams at distal and proximal ends. 
3. 
Materials 
A table listing all patient-contacting materials should be provided. The 
results of biocompatibility testing performed on the finished device, or 
certification that identical materials are used in a legally marketed device 
with a similar intended use, is also required. 
For additional information on biocompatibility, please refer to the Blue 
Book Memorandum “Use of International Standard ISO-10993, 
‘Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and 
Testing’,” available from the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance. 
Hysteroscopes are considered limited duration surface devices contacting a 
mucosal membrane or compromised surface. Laparoscopes are considered 
limited duration external communicating devices contacting 
tissue/bone/dentin. 
C. 
Safety Requirements 
1. 
Thermal Safety 
Due to the use of high-intensity light sources, temperatures at the distal 
ends of many endoscopes can reach tissue damaging levels. Please provide 
bench data showing that the device will not present a thermal hazard to the 
patient. This should consist of plots of temperature versus times for several 
key locations on the outside of the endoscope, including the tip. Testing 
should last at least two hours, and should be conducted in room air with 
the light source set at its maximum intensity setting. 


Page 4 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
The temperature at any patient-contacting part of the endoscope should not 
exceed 41°C, except for the distal tip, which should not exceed 50°C. If 
the temperature at the distal tip exceeds 41°C, the labeling should include a 
statement warning the user of the potential for thermal injury. See part 42 
of the draft standard “Particular requirements for the safety of endoscopic 
equipment,” IEC 601-2-18 (September 1994) for additional details. 
2.  
Electrical Safety 
Hysteroscopes and laparoscopes intended to be used with electrosurgical 
equipment should meet the interconnection test and capacitively coupled 
HF current requirements (part 42.101) of IEC 601-2-18. 
Hysteroscopes and laparoscopes that include an electronic component 
(e.g., video, signal-processing unit) should also comply with the electrical 
shock hazard requirements of IEC 601-2-18. 
3.  
Electromagnetic Compatibility (if applicable) 
Provide either: 
• 	
Certification that the device complies with applicable standards for 
Immunity and Emissions (such as CISPR 11, IEC 601-1-2); or

Page 8 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
H  
Sterilization 
1.  
Background 
Hysteroscopes and laparoscopes that are intended to contact or enter 
sterile tissue are considered critical devices and, therefore, require 
sterilization before use. 
2.  
Required Information 
Provide detailed instructions for reprocessing (cleaning and sterilizing) the 
device, including instructions necessary for any assembly/disassembly. 
Also, include a warning that the device should be thoroughly cleaned and 
sterilized according to validated infection control procedures before 
use/reuse. 
a.  
The cleaning instructions should describe careful, manual cleaning 
and rinsing of both the hysteroscope/laparoscope’s exterior surface 
and interior channels using a brush and detergent/ enzymatic 
solution to dissolve and loosen proteinaceous materials immediately 
after use. (Flexible hysteroscopes/laparoscopes require cleaning of 
the suction/biopsy channel in the insertion tube, umbilical cord and 
control head while rigid instruments require careful cleaning of the 
external surface and any internal channels.) The cleaning 
instructions should identify compatible cleaning solutions by generic 
names (e.g., enzymatic cleaning solutions, protein binding agents, 
etc.) and any areas of the device that are particularly difficult to 
clean, as well as any specified methods and necessary accessories 
(e.g., brushes). 
b.  
The rinsing instructions should include purging of all internal 
channels (if applicable) alternately with air and water. 
c.  
Leak testing before immersion of the control head of flexible 
hysteroscopes/laparoscopes should be described. This may be 
either a dry test using a pressure gauge or a wet test that relies on 
evidence of air bubbles when the inflated portion is submerged in 
water. 
d.  
Any liquid steriliants used must be identified and cleared by FDA. 
General reference to a class of germicides, e.g., 2% glutaraldehyde, 
is currently acceptable. Instructions should recommend that the 
entire endoscope be exposed to the liquid chemical germicide 
according to the labeling of the germicide (appropriate time and 


Page 9 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
temperature). Liquid sterilization may be manual or automated, 
and, if automated, instructions must identify suitable adapters for all 
interior channels of the hysteroscope/laparoscope. 
e.  
Thorough post process drying instructions should be recommended, 
as needed, in order to reduce recontamination before reuse. 
Instructions should include a step where air is forced through all 
channels following either manual or automated reprocessing to 
remove residual rinse water. 
f.  
Specify at least one validated method for sterilization and identify 
the specific parameters (e.g., cycle parameters, aeration, specific 
liquid chemical germicide, loading of sterilizer, etc.) which should 
be used. If the labeling lists a generic type of sterilization process 
with no specifics on cycle parameters, then the applicant must 
validate all forms of the listed generic process, e.g., "steam 
sterilization." 
g.  
Provide information to help the user identify any circumstances or 
conditions when the device may be adversely affected by 
reprocessing. This information should address the material 
compatibility with the immersion fluid. 
h.  
Provide a certification regarding validation of the reprocessing 
instructions signed by the applicant, its agent, or other legally 
responsible individual. 
For important additional information on reprocessing, please refer to the 
draft "Labeling Reusable Medical Devices Reprocessing in Health Care 
Facilities: FDA Reviewer Guidance" (March 1995). A copy of this 
guidance may be obtained from DSMA.

Endometrial Ablation 
You may wish to modify this list of indications, particularly for narrow-
gauge hysteroscopes intended to be used in an office setting. The choice of 
location for hysteroscopy (i.e., office setting vs. hospital) may be altered by 
medical disease, cervical stenosis, and pelvic infection. 
Contraindications for use 
· 
acute pelvic inflammatory disease 
Hysteroscopy may be contraindicated by the following conditions, 
depending on their severity or extent: 
· 
inability to distend the uterus 
· 
cervical stenosis 
· 
cervical/vaginal infection 
· 
uterine bleeding or menses 
· 
known pregnancy 
· 
invasive carcinoma of the cervix 
· 
recent uterine perforation 
· 
medical contraindication or intolerance to anesthesia. 
Contraindications to Endometrial Ablation 
Hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, whether by laser or electrosurgery, 
should not be undertaken without adequate training, preceptorship, and 
clinical experience. Additionally, endometrial biopsy should be performed 
prior to any ablation. The following are clinical conditions that can 
significantly complicate hysteroscopic endometrial ablation: 
- Adenomatous Endometrial Hyperplasia 
- Uterine Leiomyoma 


Page 11 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
- Severe Adenomyosis 
- Pelvic Pain (Subtle PID) 
- Uterine anomalies 
Contraindications to Hysteroscopic Myomectomy 
Hysteroscopic myomectomy should not be undertaken without adequate 
training, preceptorship, and clinical experience. The following are clinical 
conditions that can significantly complicate hysteroscopic myomectomy: 
· 
Severe anemia 
· 
Inability to circumnavigate a myoma due to myoma size.
 (e.g., predominantly intramural myomas with small submucous 
components). 
Warnings 
· 
For use only by physicians trained in hysteroscopy. 
· 
Suspicion of pregnancy should suggest a pregnancy test before the 
performance of diagnostic hysteroscopy. 
For Continuous Flow Hysteroscopy: 
If a liquid distention medium is used, strict fluid intake and output 
surveillance should be maintained. Intrauterine instillation 
exceeding 1 liter should be followed with great care to the 
possibility of fluid overload. 
Potential Complications of Continuous Flow Hysteroscopy: 
· 
Hyponatremia 
· 
Hypothermia 
· 
Uterine perforation resulting in possible injury to bowel, 
bladder, major blood vessels, and ureter. 
· 
Pulmonary edema 
· 
Cerebral edema 


Page 12 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
Precautions 
·  
Vaginal ultrasonography before hysteroscopy may identify clinical 
conditions that will alter patient management. 
·  
Intrauterine distension can usually be accomplished with pressures 
in the range of 35-75 mmHg.  Unless the systemic blood pressure is 
excessive, it is seldom necessary to use pressures greater than 
75-80 mmHg.

Laparoscopes 
Indications for Use (Gynecologic Surgery) 
Note: Laparoscopes are used as tools for access to the abdomen and are 
not, in and of themselves, a method of surgery. 
· 
Unexplained pelvic pain (acute, chronic) 
· 
Infertility Work-up 
· 
Tubal sterilization 
· 
Diagnosis and/or treatment of ectopic pregnancy 
· 
Evaluation, diagnosis and/or treatment of pelvic tumors, including 
myomata (less than 16 weeks gestational size) 
· 
Evaluation of congenital anomalies of the pelvic organs 
· 
Retrieval of foreign bodies 
· 
Determination of the presence and extent of pelvic endometriosis 
· 
Determination of the presence and extent of pelvic inflammatory 
disease (if not in acute stage) 
· 
Access to abdomen for surgical procedures such as LAVH 
· 
Visualization, diagnosis and/or treatment of perforate abdominal 
(pelvic) organs 
You may wish to modify this list based on the particular characteristics of 
your laparoscope, particularly for narrow-gauge laparoscopes intended to 
be used in an office setting. For a more exhaustive list of indications and 
contraindications for gynecologic laparoscopy, refer to the Manual of 
Endoscopy, prepared by the American Association of Gynecologic 


Page 13 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
Laparoscopists (AAGL), as well as other credentialed sources 
Contraindications for Use 
Laparoscopy may be contraindicated by pregnancy greater than 16 weeks 
gestation or abdominal mass of comparable size. 
Laparoscopy may also be contraindicated by the following conditions, 
depending on their severity or extent: 
· 
Class IV cardiac decompensation 
· 
Bowel obstruction 
· 
Ileus 
· 
Cardiac disease 
· 
Intraperitoneal hemorrhage 
· 
Diaphragmatic hernia 
· 
Infection with acute peritonitis 
· 
Previous abdominal surgery 
· 
Obesity 
· 
Thin nulliparous patient 
· 
Chronic obstructive lung disease 
· 
Liver failure with established collateral vessels 
Warnings 
·  
For use only by clinicians trained in laparoscopy. 
Precautions 
·  
Ultrasonography before laparoscopy may identify clinical conditions 
that will alter patient management. 
·  
Abdominal puncture sites 7 mm or greater (for the introduction of 
auxiliary instrumentation) may be a source of herniation. 
·  
Lasers and electrosurgical probes should not be activated 
simultaneously. Further, when one is activated, the tip of the other 
should be completely retracted. This avoids deflection of the 
energy to the other tip. 
·  
The abdomen can be adequately distended by pressure in the range 
of 15-20 mmHg.  It is seldom necessary to use an abdominal 
pressure greater than 20 mmHg. 


Page 14 - Hysteroscope and Laparoscope Guidance 
·  
During unipolar electrosurgery, inadvertent burns can occur when 
the appropriate patient return path is obstructed or as a result of 
capacitive coupling. An important maxim: 
Avoid combinations of devices made of both conducting 
and insulating materials, especially metal trocars with 
nonconductive trocar anchors, screws, etc. That is: "Use 
like with like."
