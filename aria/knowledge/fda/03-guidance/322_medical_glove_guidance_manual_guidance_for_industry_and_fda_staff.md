On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.
On December 19, 2016, the FDA published a final rule banning powdered gloves based on the
unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury to individuals exposed to the powdered
gloves (https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/19/2016-30382/banned-devicespowdered-surgeons-gloves-powdered-patient-examination-gloves-and-absorbable-powder). This
guidance document has not been updated to reflect the ban. FDA is assessing how to revise this
guidance to represent our current thinking on medical gloves.

Medical Glove Guidance Manual
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This manual provides FDA’s recommendations for Premarket Notification (510(k))
submissions for medical gloves. It also provides our recommendations on how to comply
with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR part 820). Previous revisions of this manual
were entitled “Guidance for Medical Gloves: A Workshop Manual.” This edition, the
“Medical Glove Guidance Manual” (manual), supersedes all earlier revisions and explains
FDA’s current thinking on the requirements and recommendations for medical gloves that
are marketed in the United States (U.S.).
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

BACKGROUND
Introduction
Medical gloves, including surgeon’s and patient examination gloves, are used to prevent
transmission of a wide variety of diseases to both patients and health care personnel. This
manual contains information on the regulatory requirements for patient examination gloves
and surgeon's gloves, as well as FDA’s recommendations for meeting those requirements.
General Controls
Medical gloves are class I reserved devices and are subject to general controls (section
513(a)(1)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act); 21 U.S.C. 360c(a)(1)(A)),
which include:
Establishment Registration
Device Listing
Premarket Notification 510(k)
Labeling
Quality System
Medical Device Reporting (MDR) – reporting of adverse events associated with a
medical device.
In addition, foreign firms must name a U.S. Agent (21 CFR 807.40). You can find additional
information on medical device regulatory requirements on FDA’s Device Advice website at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/.

PATIENT EXAMINATION GLOVES
21 CFR 880.6250 Patient examination glove.

(a)
(b)

Identification. A patient examination glove is a disposable device intended for
medical purposes that is worn on the examiner’s hand or finger to prevent
contamination between patient and examiner.
Classification. Class I (general controls).

The subcategories of gloves described in Table 1.1 are all special forms of the category
“patient examination glove.” These gloves should meet the requirements for a patient
examination glove, as well as additional 510(k) and labeling recommendations described in
the following paragraphs:
Specialty/Chemotherapy Labeling Claim. Medical gloves cleared for marketing with
chemotherapy labeling claims (often referred to as chemotherapy gloves) are specialty
patient examination gloves. These gloves should meet the current FDA-recognized
consensus standard for patient examination gloves or an equivalent test method.
We recommend that you follow the 510(k) format for examination gloves outlined in Chapter
6 for chemotherapy glove 510(k) submissions. The 510(k) submission should also include
permeation and penetration data based on actual testing with chemotherapeutic drugs.
For additional information, refer to Chemotherapy Labeling Claim in Chapter 4.
Dental Patient Examination Gloves. Gloves worn during dental cleaning, filling, and other
dental procedures are patient examination gloves. These gloves should meet the
requirements for patient examination gloves. You may use the term "dental" in the labeling
of gloves intended for dentistry. The term “dental” should always be used with, and does not
replace, the term “patient examination glove.”
SURGEON’S GLOVES
21 CFR 878.4460 Surgeon’s glove.
(a)

Identification. A surgeon’s glove is a device made of natural or synthetic rubber
intended to be worn by operating room personnel to protect a surgical wound from
contamination. This excludes the lubricating or dusting powder used in the glove.

3

(b)

Classification. Class I (general controls).

Surgeon’s gloves are subject to the design control requirements of the Quality System
regulation (21 CFR 820.30(a)(2)(ii)).
Surgeon’s gloves should be sterile when offered for sale to end users, such as hospitals,
clinics, and surgeons. FDA has not cleared any 510(k)’s for non-sterile surgeon’s gloves. A
510(k) submission for surgeon’s gloves should include information about the sterilization
method and cycle. The provisions in 21 CFR 801.150(e) regulate the shipment of medical
gloves to and from a contract sterilizer. See Chapter 8 for additional information.

The subcategories of gloves described in Table 1.2 are all special forms of the category
“surgeon’s glove.” These gloves should meet the requirements for a surgeon’s glove as well
as additional 510(k) and labeling recommendations described in the following paragraphs:
Dental Surgeon’s Glove. You may use the term "dental" in the labeling of gloves intended
for dental surgery. Gloves for dental surgery may be thicker than standard surgeon’s gloves.
The labeling may include the measured thickness of the gloves, but you should not use
ambiguous terms such as "extra thick."
Microsurgery Glove. Microsurgery gloves are carefully processed to have decreased
thickness in certain areas, particularly at the fingertips. To date FDA has not cleared any
510(k) submissions for microsurgery gloves that are thinner than the specifications in the
FDA-recognized consensus standard for surgeon’s gloves. As with all surgeon’s gloves,
testing should demonstrate safety and effectiveness for its indications for use.
Orthopedic Surgeon’s Glove. Orthopedic surgical gloves may be larger, thicker, and more
resistant to tear than other surgical gloves. You may state the measured thickness and other
parameters of orthopedic gloves in the labeling. You should not use ambiguous terms, such
as "extra thick," or "super strong."
Autopsy Surgeon’s Glove. Autopsy gloves are intended for use during autopsy procedures
and may be similar to orthopedic surgeon’s gloves. These gloves are subject to the same
regulatory requirements as surgeon’s gloves.

4

Specialty/Chemotherapy Labeling Claim. We recommend that you follow the 510(k)
format for surgeon’s gloves outlined in Chapter 7 for chemotherapy glove 510(k)
submissions. The 510(k) should also include permeation and penetration data based on
actual testing with chemotherapeutic drugs. We recommend that surgeon’s gloves with
chemotherapy labeling claims follow the current FDA-recognized consensus standards for
surgeon’s gloves or an equivalent test method.
For additional information, refer to Chemotherapy Label Claim (under Attribute Labeling) in
Chapter 4.
Radiation Attenuating Surgeon’s Glove. Radiation attenuating surgeon’s gloves are used
during surgical procedures involving radiation exposure to the hands. The gloves offer some
degree of protection to the hand from radiation exposure as well as protection from
transmission of infectious agents. The use of these gloves includes surgical procedures that
require the use of fluoroscopy or radiography. In addition to meeting the requirements for a
surgeon’s glove, manufacturers should have technical data to show that their attenuation
claims meet the energy range of x-rays normally used in medical procedures.
GLOVES IN KITS
A medical device kit may include medical gloves. Kit manufacturers and assemblers should
assure that gloves in their kits are cleared for marketing and that the gloves can meet the
appropriate FDA and ASTM standard (such as ASTM D3577, ASTM D3578, ASTM D5250,
ASTM D6319) or an equivalent test method after the kit is sterilized.
We recommend that you enclose natural rubber latex gloves in their own packaging within
the kit to avoid possible protein contamination of other devices. You must label the kit
appropriately for any device or packaging containing natural rubber (21 CFR 801.437).
You may refer to the following documents for additional guidance:

Glove Liners/Undergloves. Glove liners or undergloves are worn with patient examination
or surgeon’s gloves. They may be made of materials such as cotton to prevent the medical
glove from contacting the user’s hand, or they may be made of materials that are resistant to
cutting or puncture. The glove liners provide added protection by reducing the risk of a cut
or puncture wound during surgical or examination procedures and by absorbing perspiration.
Unless separately classified, accessories to medical gloves have the same classification
(regulation number) as the gloves with which they are used.
Medical device regulations apply to glove liners and undergloves. Because glove liners and
undergloves contact the skin, you should submit biocompatibility data with a 510(k)
submission to show that they are safe for their intended use (See Chapter 3,
Biocompatibility). If your labeling states that your glove liners provide a protective barrier,
then the glove liners should meet the quality limit for barrier defects (pinholes) in the FDArecognized consensus standard (or an equivalent standard) for the glove to which the liner is
an accessory.
Surgeon’s Gloving Cream. Surgeon’s gloving cream lubricates the user’s hand before
putting on a surgeon’s glove. This cream may also be used with examination gloves. FDA
classified gloving cream as a class I device under 21 CFR 878.4470. Gloving cream is
exempt from 510(k) submission requirements unless the intended use of the cream is
different from that described in 21 CFR 878.4470, i.e., "lubricating the user's hand…."
Gloving creams should not degrade the glove material in latex gloves or other gloves, i.e., the
creams should not be oil-based. If a manufacturer modifies the ingredients of an existing
gloving cream or introduces a new gloving cream into commercial distribution, the
manufacturer should ensure that the cream performs as claimed. The manufacturer also
should maintain biocompatibility data on file to show that the new or modified cream is safe
and effective for the intended use.
OTHER GLOVE PRODUCTS
Radiographic Protection Glove. FDA classified radiographic protection gloves as a
"personnel protective shield" under 21 CFR 892.6500 (product code IWP). This is a class I
device and is exempt from Premarket Notification (510(k)). The gloves are intended to
protect the operator, patient, or other person from unnecessary exposure to radiation during
radiological procedures by providing an attenuating barrier to radiation. We recommend that
you maintain technical data to show that their attenuation claims meet the energy range of xrays normally used in medical procedures.
If radiographic protection gloves are also intended for use as medical gloves, FDA classifies
them as either patient examination gloves or surgeon’s gloves and they are subject to 510(k)
clearance.
Leak Detectors. Leak detectors are chemical, electromechanical, or electronic systems
designed for the glove user to monitor glove barrier integrity immediately before and during

6

glove use. FDA classifies these devices as accessories to medical gloves. Leak detectors
used as medical devices should have 510(k) clearance before marketing.
Leak testers and other equipment used during the production of gloves are production
equipment; they are not medical devices. The Quality System regulation in 21 CFR 820.70
and 820.72 covers the selection, use, control, and maintenance of production equipment.
NON-MEDICAL GLOVES
Embalming Gloves. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates
embalming gloves.
Food Service Gloves. FDA considers food service gloves to be a food contact surface which
may result in the addition of indirect food additives to the food handled. FDA’s Center for
Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) regulates food service gloves.
Gloves used for food handling or preparation are not medical devices; therefore, they are not
subject to the 510(k) premarket review process and thus are not cleared for marketing by
FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). Labeling of food service
gloves should not, in any way, represent or suggest that they may be used for medical
purposes. This may include the brand name and company name.
For further information regarding additives and food use of gloves, contact CFSAN at
301-436-2600 (phone) or oco3@cfsan.fda.gov (email).
The National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) has developed a protocol for food service gloves
identified as “P155: Disposable Food Contact Gloves.” This document is available at
http://www.nsf.org/.
Cleaning Gloves. FDA does not regulate gloves that are used for routine janitorial functions
in medical facilities. However, gloves that are used for cleaning patients, or cleaning or
handling surfaces or items contaminated with patient waste or fluids are medical gloves and
should meet the requirements for patient examination gloves.
Utility, industrial, or general purpose gloves are used for tasks that do not involve contact
with patients or body fluids. Therefore, FDA does not regulate them as medical devices. It
is illegal for manufacturers to relabel these gloves for medical use or to imply in their
labeling that the gloves are suitable for medical use. Labeling of utility, industrial, and
general purpose gloves should not, in any way, represent or suggest that they may be used for
medical purposes. This may include the brand name and company name.

GLOVE LUBRICANTS
ABSORBABLE DUSTING POWDER ................................................................................ 8
COAGULANTS AND RELEASE AGENTS ....................................................................... 9

ABSORBABLE DUSTING POWDER
Donning lubricants such as cornstarch and silicone may make it easier to put on medical
gloves. Powdered lubricants are also called donning powders or dusting powders. Powder
from medical gloves directly contacts wounds, body cavities, and skin and can contaminate
both the patient’s and the user’s environment. FDA believes it is important to minimize the
amount of powder on finished gloves. We recommend that you establish a specification for
the amount of powder on a glove and a procedure to verify that powder levels on finished
gloves meet that specification.
A small amount of silicone or other lubricant is also used on some powder-free gloves to aid
in donning. If used, the lubricants should be on the finished gloves when you conduct
biocompatibility tests. You should identify the complete chemical characterization/chemical
formulation of the lubricant in the 510(k) submission.
Examination Gloves. Cornstarch that meets the specification for absorbable donning or
dusting powder in the United States Pharmacopeia (U.S.P.) is a commonly used lubricant for
examination gloves. Any powder used for lubricating examination gloves should meet the
U.S.P. monograph for absorbable dusting powder or be equivalent in terms of safety and
effectiveness. The 510(k) submission should state the type, specifications, and source of
powder or other donning lubricant used on the gloves. You should not use talc, cotton flock,
and other non-absorbable materials as a lubricating, dusting, or donning powder. Recognized
consensus standards specify that the inside and outside surface of medical gloves be free of
talc. Lycopodium (club moss spores) and ground pine pollen are toxic. You should not use
them as powder on or in medical gloves.
Surgeon’s Gloves. Absorbable dusting powder for lubricating a surgeon’s glove is a
transitional device (a device formerly regulated as a new drug before l976). FDA classifies it
as a class III medical device under 21 CFR 878.4480 (product code KGP). Absorbable
dusting powder for lubricating a surgeon’s glove requires an approved Premarket Approval
Application (PMA) or, if marketed prior to May 28, l976, a New Drug Application (NDA).
You may use only absorbable dusting powders manufactured under an approved PMA or
NDA on powdered surgeon’s gloves.
A current list of approved NDAs or PMAs for Surgical Dusting Powder is available through
the PMA database on the FDA website. Place KGP in the Product Code box and click on
Search.

Device Advice PMA
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/pma/
COAGULANTS AND RELEASE AGENTS
In order to have uniform distribution of the latex mix on the mold, commonly called a
“former,” the mold is first dipped in a coagulant solution usually containing a calcium salt in
water. In addition, the coagulant solution sometimes contains a lubrication agent to facilitate
stripping (removing) the gloves from the molds at the end of the production line. A small
amount of the coagulant and release agent remains on the "inside" surface of the glove. In
some processes, washing removes most of the mold release agent from the surface of the
glove. If these manufacturing material residues can adversely affect the safety or
effectiveness of the gloves, you must establish and maintain procedures for the use and
removal of the manufacturing material to ensure that it is removed or limited to an amount
that does not adversely affect the gloves's quality (21 CFR 820.70(h).

INTRODUCTION
We recommend that you conduct biocompatibility testing as described in the guidance
entitled, “Use of International Standard ISO-10993, Biological Evaluation of Medical
Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing,” available at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/g951.html on
finished gloves. You should select biocompatibility tests appropriate for both surface and
external communicating devices with limited duration (24 hours) of contact. Because
medical gloves are in direct contact with skin, a primary skin irritation study and a dermal
sensitization study are appropriate.
You should perform biocompatibility tests on finished gloves. The gloves used for
biocompatibility studies should contain the same colorants, fragrances, flavors, powders,
lubricants, and processing chemicals. You should test gloves that have been processed,
packaged, and if appropriate, sterilized by the same methods as the gloves you will distribute.
You should consider the need to repeat biocompatibility studies if you make subsequent
changes in glove composition, manufacturing materials, or processing.
The 510(k) submission should include biocompatibility test results and other information and
data described in this manual as an attached report for each major study or test program. You
should identify all reports or attachments with the manufacturer’s name, number the pages,
and list the reports or attachments in the table of contents. For sterile devices, test data
should include the results of tests performed using the finished sterilized devices.
You and the contract laboratory, if used, should check the:
•
•
•
•

logical presentation of the biocompatibility data,
scientific soundness of the test method and data analysis,
relevance of the test program to the device and the intended use, and
completeness of the summary report of the tests or studies.

We recommend that you present the summary of test results in a table format in each report
whenever possible. Each study or test attachment report should contain sufficient and wellorganized information in reasonable detail so that the FDA reviewer can determine:

10

•
•
•
•

what exact material or device was tested,
what tests were performed,
how the tests were performed, and
what were the test results.

We recommend that you submit reasonable and sufficient details of all test procedures and
results to FDA. For biocompatibility studies, you should use a standard scoring system for
each test method, if a standard scoring system exists. We recommend each test report
include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

name and address of the manufacturer of the item tested,
name and technical description of the item tested,
name and address of the laboratory where the tests were conducted,
test methods, including the scoring method,
number of samples and replicates tested,
control data needed to establish the validity of the test,
date when the tests were conducted,
summary report(s) of results obtained, and
analysis, interpretation of results, and conclusions.

You should keep the original records of the study on file. For surgeon’s gloves, the records
should be maintained as part of your design verification records in the design history file.
You should also maintain the original records when a study, such as a biocompatibility study,
is conducted by a contract laboratory to establish a device specification and/or to obtain data
for a submission to FDA. The original document should include the name and address of the
laboratory and device manufacturer, the device identity, and dates of testing. You should not
submit the original records to FDA. During factory inspections, FDA investigators may ask
to see these original records.
SKIN IRRITATION AND DERMAL SENSITIZATION STUDIES
The following is a general discussion of how to conduct the skin irritation and dermal
sensitization studies. Because methods may vary from laboratory to laboratory, the test data
you submit to FDA should contain a brief description of the test protocol, scoring criteria
used, and the method used for rating skin responses.
Primary Skin Irritation Test (Animal Study)
Performing skin irritation testing demonstrates the irritation potential of the gloves, i.e., for
initiating or aggravating damage through its contact with the skin. We recommend that you
perform the primary skin irritation testing according to the regulations of the Consumer
Product Safety Commission (16 CFR 1500.41). We recommend that you identify the inside
and outside of the gloves so that both sides are tested, i.e., approximately half of the test
articles expose opposite sides of the glove to the subject.

11

Dermal Sensitization Study (Animal Study)
The purpose of performing dermal sensitization is to demonstrate the potential of the device
for eliciting a delayed hypersensitivity (Type IV) immunologic response through its contact
with the skin. This reaction is due primarily to substances which could leach out of a
material. Guinea pigs are used because they have been shown to be the best animal model
for human allergic contact dermatitis. We recommend the method described in ASTM
standard F720-86, Standard Practice for Testing Guinea Pigs for Contact Allergens, Guinea
Pig Maximization Test, for the study. Laboratories may also use the method of Buehler, as
reported in Archives of Dermatology (1965). Dermal sensitization studies use two tests or
phases: the induction phase and challenge phase. You should identify the inside and outside
of the gloves so that both sides are tested, i.e., approximately half of the test articles expose
opposite sides of the glove to the subject.
Testing for Skin Sensitization to Chemicals
Your labeling may include special claims regarding reduced potential chemical sensitization
in a 510(k), such as:
•
•

reduced potential for sensitizing users to rubber chemical additives or,
reduced potential for causing reaction in individuals sensitized to rubber chemical
additives.

You should support these claims by data from human testing. Additional guidance on testing
for skin sensitization to chemicals in latex products is available in the following guidance
document:
Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions for Testing for Skin
Sensitization to Chemicals in Natural Rubber Products
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/944.html
If you have already conducted a Modified Draize Test (MDT) on a minimum of 200 human
subjects to support a reduced sensitization claim, you may use the MDT data instead of the
primary skin irritation test (animal) and dermal sensitization study (animal) typically used to
support the general biocompatibility of medical gloves.
COLOR AND FLAVOR ADDITIVES
You should show that any substance added to the gloves, including color, flavor, and/or scent
additives, does not adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the gloves. Therefore, if a
device contains a color or other chemical additive and the device is intended to be in contact
with the skin or other parts of the body, you should submit biocompatibility data to
demonstrate the safety of the additives, unless you can establish that the additives would not
leach and contact the body.
FDA considers the addition of color, flavor, or any chemical to a medical glove to be a
significant change that should have a new 510(k) submission (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)). You

12

should provide full characterization and chemical identity of the color, flavor, or scent
additives. You may submit a 510(k) submission for a modification to an existing glove as a
“Special 510(k).” Additional information about Special 510(k) submissions is available at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/3144.html.
You can find color additive and flavor additive regulations in 21 CFR parts 70 to 82 and 21
CFR part 172, Subpart F, respectively. Note that color and flavor additives contained in
these regulations are specific to foods, drugs, and cosmetics. The color additive regulations
should not be confused with the general 510(k) requirements, which are independent of the
color additive listing and certification mentioned above. You should show that any color or
flavor substance added to a device does not adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of the
device. Gloves that contain FDA-approved color or flavor additives for foods, drugs, or
cosmetics should undergo biocompatibility testing to demonstrate the safety of the additives
in the device. We may accept other color or flavor additives not contained in these
regulations with appropriate biocompatibility testing.
Medical device labeling requirements do not require the glove box or carton to have an
"ingredient statement" listing the flavor agent, colorant, or other additives used in the
manufacture of the glove. However, manufacturers may do so voluntarily.
See Chapter 4 for labeling considerations for medical gloves with color and flavor additives.

BASIC LABELING
You can find general labeling requirements for all medical devices in 21 CFR part 801.
Specific labeling requirements for devices made from natural rubber latex are provided in 21
CFR 801.437.
Name and Place of Business
•

The label of a glove should contain the name and place of business of the
manufacturer, packer, or distributor, including the street, address, city, state, and zip
code. If the street address of the identified manufacturer, packer, or distributor is in
the local (U.S.) telephone directory, you can omit the street address. (21 CFR
801.1(a) and (d)).

•

If the firm identified on the label is not the manufacturer, then you should qualify the
firm’s name by an appropriate statement such as, “Manufactured for...” or
“Distributed by....” (21 CFR 801.1(c)).

Country of Origin
The label must contain the country of origin if other than the U.S. (19 CFR 134.11). The
U.S. Customs and Border Protection enforces this regulation.
Statement of Identity (21 CFR 801.61)
•

The statement of identity of the glove must be on the principal display panel. The
“principal display panel,” means “…the part of a label that is most likely to be
displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of display for
retail sale.” (21 CFR 801.60).

•

If the glove is made of a synthetic polymer, the statement of identity should include
the common, generic, or scientific name of the polymer used. The term "synthetic"
15

used alone does not fully characterize the composition of the glove and may mislead
the purchaser. If you manufacture the glove from a blend of polymers, you should
identify each component, including any blend containing natural rubber latex.
•

The identity statement must list the common name of the device (21 CFR 801.61(b)).
Examples include powdered latex surgeon’s gloves, powdered latex patient
examination gloves, powder-free latex surgeon’s gloves, powder-free latex patient
examination gloves, latex finger cots, powdered nitrile examination gloves, and
powder-free vinyl examination gloves. You should not use undefined terms such as
“low-powder.”

•

The identity statement must be in bold face type, reasonably related in size to the
most prominent printed matter on the display panel, and in lines generally parallel to
the base of the package when rested (21 CFR 801.61(c)).

Language
All labeling must be in English with the exception of those products distributed solely within
Puerto Rico or a U.S. Territory where the predominant language is not English (21 CFR
801.15(c)(1)). If any representation on the device label or labeling appears in a foreign
language, then all required labeling must also appear in that foreign language (21 CFR
801.15(c)(3)).
Net Quantity of Contents Statement
The label must contain a statement of net quantity of contents in terms of weight, measure,
numerical count, or statements of both numerical count and weight, measure, or size (21 CFR
801.62(a)). Whichever statement of net quantity of contents you use, you should state it
clearly and understandably on the label, e.g., “100 gloves, packaged by weight.”
The net quantity declaration must appear as a separate item in the lower 30 percent of
each principal display panel. You must separate it, by at least a space equal to the height
of the lettering used in the declaration, from other information appearing above and
below. Also, you must separate the declaration by at least twice the width of the letter
“N” from labeling to the left or right. (21 CFR 801.62(e)).
Adequate Directions for Use
You should label disposable medical gloves as "single use only." The label for surgeon’s
gloves should contain any necessary directions for use.
DEVICES THAT CONTAIN NATURAL RUBBER
Caution Statement. If your medical gloves contain natural rubber latex, you must put the
following statement in bold print on the device labeling:

16

“Caution: This Product Contains Natural Rubber Latex Which May Cause
Allergic Reactions.”
This statement must appear on all device labels, and other labeling, as well as on the
principal display panel of the device packaging, the outside package, container, or wrapper,
and the immediate device package, container, or wrapper (21 CFR 801.437(d)).
EXPIRATION DATE LABELING
Expiration date labeling for medical gloves is voluntary. However, if you make an expiration
date labeling claim, the gloves should meet the performance characteristics and specifications
presented in the Premarket Notification (510(k)) over the entire claimed shelf life.
Manufacturers with cleared 510(k) submissions for surgeon’s or patient examination gloves
do not have to submit new 510(k) submissions to add an expiration date to the labeling.
You should perform real-time stability studies in order to determine an expiration date. The
stability studies should include tests to verify that medical gloves maintain their barrier
properties, physical properties, packaging integrity, sterility, and any specific attributes
claimed in the labeling over the entire shelf life of the glove. We recommend the following
tests:
•

Barrier property tests. You should perform the FDA 1000 mL Water Leak Test (21
CFR 800.20) or ASTM International (ASTM) D5151, Standard Test Method for
Detection of Holes in Medical Gloves to assess barrier integrity.

•

Physical properties tests. You should use appropriate physical properties tests such
as those in ASTM D3577, Standard Specification for Rubber Surgical Gloves; ASTM
D3578, Standard Specification for Rubber Examination Gloves; ASTM D5250,
Standard Specification for Poly (vinyl chloride) Gloves for Medical Application;
ASTM D6319, Standard Specification for Nitrile Examination Gloves for Medical
Application; or an equivalent appropriate physical property test.

•

Sterility and package integrity tests. You should test sterile glove packaging for
package integrity and the ability to maintain sterility. Documentation should include
evidence that, after storage, the product packaging still meets the manufacturer’s
specifications for package integrity.

•

Tests to support labeling claims. You should test for properties that may be
adversely affected by product aging, such as resistance to chemicals. Manufacturers
should document this testing.

Manufacturers/sponsors may use test protocols from the applicable voluntary consensus
standards or may develop their own protocols for stability testing. If you develop original
protocols, you should describe the protocols in detail (test methodology, acceptance criteria,

17

time intervals for testing). You should give a rationale for any variation from the applicable
consensus standard. Manufacturers should maintain the originals of all protocols, test
reports, and identification of persons/labs performing the test at their manufacturing
establishment so that the information is available for review during an FDA inspection.
Provisional Expiration Date
FDA will accept a provisional expiration date of up to 3 years from the date of manufacture
based on accelerated aging studies, provided the manufacturer immediately initiates real-time
stability testing to obtain data to support the proposed expiration date. You should perform
accelerated aging studies at a minimum of two elevated temperatures between 40 and 80
degrees C°. If the product does not meet the required criteria after accelerated aging, you
should label the product with a shelf life determined by real-time testing. FDA believes that
expiration dates based on real time data should not exceed 5 years from the date of
manufacture. If the real-time data do not support the expiration date based on accelerated
aging, you should change the expiration date to reflect actual shelf life.
Test Reports
We recommend that you generate test reports to document both the real-time and accelerated
aging of the gloves. Test report documentation should be consistent with the appropriate
standards. In addition, we recommend that each test report should include the following
information:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

product identification, including lot numbers and date of manufacture
test method identification, including documentation for in-house procedures
sample size and acceptance criteria for each test conducted
description of product packaging during storage (e.g., individually packaged, standard
sterile packaging)
description of storage environment (temperature and humidity) and duration of
storage
time elapsed between date of manufacture and each testing interval
raw test data, including an appropriate statistical summary
data analysis
conclusion, including the shelf life supported by the data.

Labeling
When you establish the shelf life of the gloves using real time stability testing, or when you
establish a provisional shelf life using accelerated aging, the expiration date labeling on
medical gloves should conform with the following:
1. You can obtain the expiration date for a specific lot of gloves by adding the
established shelf life to the date of manufacture for that lot. The “date of
manufacture” refers to the date of completion of the final step of the manufacturing
process (final packaging or sterilization).
18

2. The expiration date should state the month and year of the shelf life. You should
express the expiration date by spelling out the name of the month followed by the 4digit year, e.g., January 2006. You should not express the date as 1/10/06 because
this may be interpreted as October 1, 2006, in some parts of the world, resulting in the
use of outdated and degraded gloves.
3. The expiration date, stated as “Use Before: [date]” should be prominently displayed
on the exterior of the primary and retail package and on the shipping carton.
4. Sterile surgeon’s and patient examination gloves that have an expiration date based
on sterility that is different from the expiration date based upon physical and
mechanical integrity testing should bear only the earlier expiration date.
ASTM International developed the following standards for expiration dating of medical
gloves:
•
•

D7160-05 Standard Practice for Determination of Expiration Dating for Medical
Gloves
D7161-05 Standard Practice for Determination of Real Time Expiration Dating of
Mature Medical Gloves Stored Under Typical Warehouse Conditions

You can obtain more information on these standards directly from ASTM at
http://www.astm.org.

DONNING POWDER OR LUBRICANT IDENTIFICATION
If surgeon’s gloves are powdered, they must be powdered with an absorbable dusting powder
that has received FDA approval under either an NDA or a PMA (21 CFR 878.4480). The
labeling should inform users with a statement such as, “Powdered with absorbable dusting
powder.” Absorbable powder for lubricating a surgeon’s glove is a Class III medical device
under 21 CFR 878.4480. For more information about glove lubricants, see Chapter 2 of this
manual.
If patient examination gloves are powdered, the powder should meet the United States
Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.) monograph for absorbable dusting powder or demonstrate
equivalence in terms of safety and effectiveness. U.S.P powder is commonly used on
examination gloves so the corresponding labeling statement should read, “Powdered with
absorbable dusting powder, U.S.P.”
ATTRIBUTE LABELING
In addition to basic labeling described above, manufacturers may have labeling claims for the
attributes of their gloves. Some attributes are color, flavor, scent, and thickness. You should
19

submit data to support all claims in your 510(k). You should not use ambiguous labeling
claims such as “extra thick” or “super-sensitive” because they are misleading. You should
use acceptable factual and definitive statements, such as the actual glove thickness as
determined by measurement.
Section 502 of the Act prohibits labeling that is false or misleading in any way (21 U.S.C.
352). Any labeling claim should describe the device truthfully and accurately. See Chapter
9, Compliance Activities, for more information on labeling.
“Powder-Free”
Gloves with trace amounts of residual former-release powder (2 mg or less per glove) and no
intentionally added donning powders are commonly referred to as “powder free.” Most
manufacturers dip the glove mold, known as a “former,” into a solution of calcium carbonate
and calcium nitrate. After controlled drying, manufacturers dip the coated former into the
latex solution and create a glove on the former. The calcium carbonate helps release the
glove from the former. An extremely small amount of calcium carbonate remains on the
glove. Most of it is removed by leaching and washing.
FDA has recognized standard method ASTM D6124, Standard Test Method for Residual
Powder on Medical Gloves, for collecting and measuring the manufacturing debris, residual
former-release powder, and other elements on a powder-free glove or the powder levels on
powdered medical gloves.
To establish a “powder-free” claim, FDA recommends that you have no more than 2 mg of
residual or trace powder and debris per glove, as determined by the ASTM D6124 test
method (Standard Test Method for Residual Powder on Medical Gloves) or an equivalent
method.
Protein Label Claims
Latex proteins can cause Type I sensitivity in some individuals who have been exposed to
latex-containing devices. Repeated exposure to latex proteins may increase the probability
that an individual will become sensitized. Since May 1991, the FDA has recommended that
manufacturers of latex devices reduce the water-extractable protein on their natural rubber
latex devices. FDA considers water soluble latex proteins to be concomitant constituents,
which are manufacturing materials under the Quality System regulation, 21 CFR 820.3(p).
FDA requires the reduction of these types of materials according to 21 CFR 820.70(h).
Manufacturers who can reliably reduce the levels of latex proteins in their gloves to a known
level may make a labeling claim, if they submit supporting data in their 510(k) submission.
At present, FDA does not allow a protein labeling statement or claim below the current
50µg/dm2 sensitivity limit of the ASTM Lowry test method (D5712). Work is being done to
determine the sensitivity and detection limits of the ELISA test method (ASTM D6499). At
the time of this writing, these limits are unknown.

20

FDA suggests that you measure the natural rubber latex protein on recently manufactured
finished gloves that have undergone accelerated aging according to the ASTM standard
D3578 (Standard Specification for Rubber Examination Gloves) or D3577 (Standard
Specification for Rubber Surgical Gloves) or real time aging. Water soluble proteins may
migrate to the glove surface during shipping. Aging should approximate this time period.
If you label your gloves as containing 50µg/dm2 or less per glove of extractable protein, the
labeling should also state:
“Caution: Safe use of these gloves by latex sensitized individuals has not been
established.”
You must ensure that any labeling changes to dispenser boxes and any changes to
manufacturing processes meet the requirements of the Quality Systems regulation in 21 CFR
820.30 (for surgeon’s gloves), 820.40 and 820.70. See Chapter 8, Quality System, for further
guidance.
Chemical Sensitization
Certain chemicals routinely used in the manufacture of medical gloves, such as natural
rubber latex and other materials, can cause skin sensitization and irritation. If you
sufficiently reduce or eliminate the presence of these chemicals, you may make appropriate
labeling claims regarding the reduced potential of chemical sensitization or reduced reactioninducing potential of your gloves in allergic individuals if cleared in a 510(k) submission.
You can find guidance about reduced sensitization claims for latex gloves in the guidance
document “Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Testing for Skin Sensitization to
Chemicals in Natural Rubber Products” at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/944.html. Refer to
Chapter 3, Biocompatibility, for additional information on biocompatibility.
Color and Flavor Additives
Medical device labeling does not require an “ingredients statement” listing the flavor agents
or colorants used in the manufacture of the gloves on the glove box or carton. However,
manufacturers may do so voluntarily.
FDA considers the addition of colorants, other than traditional whiteners, such as titanium
dioxide or the addition of a flavoring agent to a medical glove, to be a significant change
which should have 510(k) clearance (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)). The new finished glove should
undergo full biocompatibility testing.
Chemotherapy Label Claim
Medical gloves with a chemotherapy claim should meet an appropriate FDA-recognized
consensus standard for medical gloves or an equivalent test method. Physical features such
as increased thickness and length make these gloves more suitable for the safe handling of
chemotherapy agents (usually minimal thickness of 0.10 mm, minimal length of 270 mm).

21

Gloves for use with chemotherapy agents should also undergo the standard biocompatibility
testing for medical gloves.
To market the glove for use in the handling and/or preparation of chemotherapeutic drugs,
you should label the glove as a “Patient Examination Glove” or “Surgeon’s Glove” and
“Tested for use with [name of chemotherapeutic drug(s)].”
We recommend that you include the following labeling information (to enable the user to
make an appropriate product selection):
•

chemical resistance data (test method used, chemicals tested), for consumer review, if
desired,

•

the statement, “Gloves used for protection against chemotherapy drug exposure should be
selected specifically for the type of chemicals used,” and

•

instructions for users to review drug labeling or material safety data sheets for the
chemicals being used to determine an adequate level of protection for the intended use.

Pyrogen/Endotoxin Labeling Claim
FDA may consider a non-pyrogenic claim on a case-by-case basis for surgeon’s gloves. The
510(k) submission should contain data to support the claim. In addition, the Quality System
regulation includes requirements for, but not limited to, design controls, process validation,
and process controls (21 CFR part 820). If you label your glove as non-pyrogenic, you
should design the glove and validate the manufacturing process from the onset of
manufacture to the finished packaged device. You should continuously monitor the
bioburden throughout the entire process to assure the bioburden is within the validated
specifications. The bioburden monitoring should include the slurry tank for the glove
powder used to lubricate the gloves, as well as any bacterial over-growth that may occur
subsequent to powdering and prior to sterilization. You should establish manufacturing
timeframes to minimize growth at every stage of the process.
Hypoallergenicity
For medical gloves distributed after September 30, 1998, 21 CFR 801.437(h) states “Devices
that contain natural rubber that contacts humans...shall not contain the term ‘hypoallergenic’
on their labeling.” This includes gloves that have received prior 510(k) marketing clearance
with a claim of hypoallergenicity. Hypoallergenic incorrectly implies that latex sensitive
persons may use a product labeled as “hypoallergenic” safely.
FDA strongly discourages the use of the term “hypoallergenic” because the term cannot be
scientifically defined or quantified. Because there is virtually no way to rule out allergies to
any substance, FDA strongly discourages using the term “hypoallergenic” regarding any
medical device, whether the device contains natural rubber latex or not.

22

FDA does not require a new 510(k) submission for labeling changes made to comply with 21
CFR 801.437, provided that you do not make any other changes requiring a new 510(k)
submission. However, you should keep appropriate records documenting the labeling
changes.
STANDARDS
For voluntary labeling claims, you may state in the labeling that the product meets specific
national or international consensus standard(s). The labeling should clearly identify the
standard by name or alphanumeric text, including the year published or other information to
identify the specific standard. If you make a voluntary claim, it should be truthful and
accurate. Note that a 510(k) submission may contain a declaration of conformity with any or
all parts of a standard without an associated claim in the labeling.
If the label states that a product meets a specific standard, the product delivered to the
customer should meet the standard. The manufacturer should have data on file to support
these claims.
LOT NUMBER
Although FDA does not require a lot number to be placed on glove packaging, it is industry
practice for the package of medical gloves to bear a lot number. Lot numbers are useful for
traceability for complaints or returned product. This number or code may identify the batch
of compounded latex, the production lines, the production shift, and/or, if sterile, the
sterilization run. Some international consensus standards require lot numbers for
conformance. Gloves conforming to those standards should have lot numbers. The lot
number should be visible on the outside of the immediate packaging.
BAR CODING
Many manufacturers have started placing bar codes on cartons and on the bottom of
dispenser boxes. FDA encourages the use of bar coding.

INTRODUCTION
A Premarket Notification (510(k)) is a submission of information sent to the FDA to obtain
marketing clearance for a medical device. A 510(k) submission is a comparison of a new
device with a “predicate” device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device to which
equivalence is established. The 510(k) documents that the new finished medical glove you
wish to market is as safe and effective as a legally marketed medical glove in the U.S. You
cannot market medical gloves in the U.S. until you receive a letter from FDA declaring the
gloves substantially equivalent (21 CFR 807.100(a)(5)).
ASTM International (ASTM) has developed a number of medical glove related standards.
CDRH has officially recognized many of these standards for premarket clearance purposes.
Conformance to these standards is voluntary. (See Chapter 10 of this guidance for more
information on voluntary standards.)
You should provide physical parameter and biocompatibility data obtained from tests and
inspection of packaged and sterilized gloves (finished gloves). The 510(k) submitter should
keep this documentation on file.
You can find detailed instructions for a 510(k) submission for patient examination gloves and
surgeon’s gloves in Chapters 6 and 7, respectively.
TYPES OF 510(k) SUBMISSIONS
A 510(k) submitter may choose from three types of Premarket Notification 510(k)
submissions for marketing clearance: Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated. The
traditional 510(k) method is the original submission as provided in 21 CFR part 807. There
are two optional alternatives to the Traditional 510(k) method for obtaining 510(k) marketing
clearance under certain instances: Special 510(k) and Abbreviated 510(k). The Special
28

510(k) Device Modification utilizes certain aspects of the Quality System regulation to
streamline 510(k) review; the Abbreviated 510(k) relies on the use of guidance documents,
special controls (for class II devices), and recognized standards to facilitate 510(k) review.
Additional information about the 510(k) submission process is available at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
510(k) FEE
As of October 1, 2002, FDA charges a fee to review 510(k) submissions. This submission
fee applies to Traditional, Abbreviated, and Special 510(k)s. FDA should receive payment
on or before the time you submit the 510(k) submission. If the submitter has not paid all fees
owed, FDA will consider the submission incomplete and will not accept it for filing. You
should direct questions regarding user fees to the Division of Small Manufacturers,
International and Consumer Assistance at 240-276-3150.
Additional information, including the current review fee for a 510(k), is available at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314a.html.
INDICATIONS FOR USE STATEMENT
For medical gloves, the indication for use is the same as the intended use. The information,
data, and labeling claims in the entire 510(k) submission should support and agree with the
Indications for Use statement. CDRH will attach the Indications for Use statement to the
substantial equivalence letter that is sent to the submitter when the 510(k) is cleared.
We recommend one of the following statements or equivalent text as an indication for use
statement.
Powdered Examination Gloves
A powdered patient examination glove is a disposable device intended for medical
purposes that is worn on the examiner's hand or finger to prevent contamination
between patient and examiner.
Powder-Free Examination Gloves
A powder-free patient examination glove is a disposable device intended for medical
purposes that is worn on the examiner's hand or finger to prevent contamination
between patient and examiner.
Powdered surgeon's gloves
A powdered surgeon's glove is a device made of natural or synthetic rubber intended
to be worn by operating room personnel to protect a surgical wound from
contamination.

29

Powder-free surgeon's gloves
A powder-free surgeon's glove is a device made of natural or synthetic rubber
intended to be worn by operating room personnel to protect a surgical wound from
contamination.
For a special purpose glove, you should include additional text in the Indications for Use
statement that covers the additional function of the glove as stated in your labeling. You
should also indicate that it is an over-the-counter device.
LABELING
Medical glove 510(k) submissions should include samples of the package labeling. Labeling
does not need to be in final printed format; you may submit draft labeling. The final labeling
should be consistent with the draft labeling you submitted in the 510(k). The final labeling
should agree with your drawings for labeling and preprinted packaging in your Quality
System device master record (21 CFR 820.181), and comply with other applicable
requirements in the Act and regulations.
Labeling, labeling claims, and data should be consistent with the Indications for Use
statement. If you make any specific claims for your gloves, you should include data to
substantiate the claims in this format or in identified attachments. Puffery, ambiguous, or
unsubstantiated claims such as super strong, extra thick, micro thin, super sensitive, or low
protein, are not appropriate.
POWDER FOR EXAMINATION GLOVES
Powder used for lubricating examination gloves should meet the United States
Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.) monograph for absorbable dusting powder or be equivalent in terms
of safety and effectiveness. The 510(k) should include the type, specifications, and source of
powder or other donning lubricant used on the gloves. You should not use talc, cotton flock,
and other non-absorbable materials as a lubricating, dusting, or donning powder.
Lycopodium (club moss spores) and ground pine pollen are toxic and are not acceptable as
powder on or in medical gloves.
POWDER FOR SURGEON’S GLOVES
Absorbable donning or dusting powder from powder manufacturers that have obtained an
approved new drug application (NDA), abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or
premarket approval application (PMA) must be used on powdered surgeon’s gloves (21 CFR
878.4480). A list of firms with approved NDAs or PMAs for Surgical Dusting Powder is
available at www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/pma.cfm. Use Product
Code “KGP” as the search term.

30

COATINGS
Premarket Notification 510(k) submissions for coated medical gloves should contain
complete information about the composition and intended purpose of the coating used, e.g.,
ease of donning. The draft labeling should also contain any special or additional claims for
the gloves due to the presence of the coating, e.g., “easier to don.”
STERILITY
For gloves that are labeled as sterile, FDA recommends that you provide sterilization
information in accordance with “Updated 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1” available
at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/361.html. You should sterilize the gloves to a
sterility assurance level (SAL) of 1 x 10-6 using a sterilization cycle that has been validated in
accordance with the Quality Systems requirements, 21 CFR part 820.
510(k) SUMMARY OR STATEMENT
In accordance with 21 CFR 807.87(h), the Premarket Notification 510(k) submission must
include either a 510(k) Summary or a 510(k) Statement:
510(k) Summary is a summary of the 510(k) in sufficient detail to provide an
understanding of the basis for a determination of substantial equivalence (21 CFR
807.92).

http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/manual/stmnt2.html
PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS
If you make a change to your gloves that significantly affects safety or effectiveness of the
gloves, you must submit a new and complete 510(k) (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)). Examples of
changes that may require a new 510(k) include adding or deleting powder; adding color,
fragrance, or a claim to the labeling; or modifying an important process. FDA usually does
not require a new 510(k) if a manufacturer only does more of an existing process, such as
extra leaching or washing, and makes no claim or mention of this change on the product
labeling.

32

Changes to patient examination gloves, labeling, packaging, and processes should meet the
Quality System regulation at 21 CFR 820.40 and 820.70(b). You should make changes to
surgeon’s gloves, labeling, packaging, and processes in accordance with Quality System
regulation at 21 CFR 820.30, 820.40, and 820.70(b). If you do not need a new 510(k), you
should document your decision and how you arrived at it in the device master record (21
CFR 820.181).
We recommend the following guidance document for additional information:
Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/510kmod.html
You may submit a “Special” 510(k) submission for a modification to an existing glove
510(k) held by the same submitter.
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP OF A 510(k)
A 510(k) may be bought, sold, or transferred. FDA is not involved in transfers of ownership.
The new owner should maintain information documenting the transfer of ownership of a
510(k), including any legal transactions that took place, in its 510(k) files.
The new owner should list the device according to 21 CFR part 807 and the previous owner
should delete its device listing. Upon inspection of the firm or upon entry of glove shipments
into the U.S., FDA may request a review of documentation of ownership. If the owner is not
able to provide the information, FDA may request the owner to submit a 510(k). You may
not distribute the gloves until FDA clears the new submission.
Note that neither a registration nor a listing proves 510(k) ownership. The new owner of the
510(k) should maintain files with documentation proving ownership of the 510(k).
To avoid problems when importing a device with a transferred 510(k) ownership, FDA
recommends that a copy of the specific information relating to the ownership sale or transfer
accompany all shipments to the United States. This could be a simple one-page document
detailing the transfer transaction.

PATIENT EXAMINATION GLOVES
POWDER-FREE ................................................................................................................. 34
CHEMOTHERAPY GLOVES............................................................................................ 34
FORMAT FOR PREMARKET NOTIFICATION 510(k).................................................. 35

POWDER-FREE
To substantiate a “powder-free” claim in your Premarket Notification (510(k)) submission,
you should state whether the manufacturing process for the glove includes any powder, such
as a former-release powder and/or a donning powder. If it does, you should provide:
1. a description of the powder(s) introduced at any stage of the glove manufacturing
process, such as former release or stripping powder and donning powder;
2. a detailed description of the process to remove the added powder(s);
3. a description of the release specification supporting the powder-free claim and a brief
summary of the final product testing to ensure the glove meets this specification;
4. a description of how the glove is designed or manufactured to compensate for the lack
of donning powder, or reasons why the compensation is not necessary, including a
full characterization such as the chemical identity, specifications, and
biocompatibility of any material such as silicone added to the glove to facilitate glove
donning; and
5. a certification that the finished powder-free glove meets ASTM International (ASTM)
standard D3577 (Standard Specification for Rubber Surgical Gloves), D3578
(Standard Specification for Rubber Examination Gloves), D5250 (Standard
Specification for Poly(vinyl chloride) Gloves for Medical Application), or an
equivalent standard, as appropriate.
If the entire manufacturing process does not include any former release or donning powder,
then you only need to discuss items 4 and 5 in the above list.
CHEMOTHERAPY GLOVES
Chemotherapy gloves are specialty medical gloves. We recommend that you use the 510(k)
format for chemotherapy gloves provided later in this chapter. If you label patient
examination gloves designed for handling chemotherapy agents as, “Tested for Use with
Chemotherapy Agents," you should provide data to support the claim. Otherwise, labeling,
donning powder or lubricant, protein, and powder-free specifications for chemotherapy
gloves are the same as for examination gloves.
34

You should include in the 510(k) submission the results of a controlled scientific study
completed on the finished device to substantiate the claim. Test data should show the gloves
are chemically resistant and/or can resist the permeation of chemical agents. Chemical
resistance includes resistance of the glove to swelling, degradation, or deformation. The test
method for permeability determines the time for a hazardous liquid (including temperature
and concentration, if necessary) to permeate the barrier membrane of the glove as well as the
rate of penetration once the barrier has been breached.
Testing should utilize the actual chemicals to be encountered, using the finished product,
under the expected in use conditions (i.e., length of exposure, chemical concentration,
contact, and temperature). Supporting test data should include an explanation and/or method
of selecting the chemicals tested, a comprehensive description of the test method used, the
complete protocol, an analysis of test results, a discussion, and the conclusions.
Chemotherapy gloves should meet an appropriate ASTM standard or an equivalent
consensus standard for medical gloves. Physical features, such as increased thickness and
length, make them more suitable for the safe handling of chemotherapy agents (usually
minimal thickness of 0.10 mm, minimal length of 270 mm).
Premarket Notification (510(k)) submissions for Chemotherapy gloves should contain:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

the product labeling that specifies the chemical(s) that the glove provide(s) protection
against;
the results of a controlled scientific study to substantiate the claim,
a comprehensive description of the test method used,
the complete test protocol,
an analysis of test results,
a discussion as appropriate, and
conclusions.

Chemotherapy gloves should also undergo standard biocompatibility testing for medical
gloves.
FORMAT FOR PREMARKET NOTIFICATION 510(k)
This section contains a suggested format for the submission of a Premarket Notification
(510(k)) for patient examination gloves. FDA does not require this format, but you may use
it as a guide for submitting the necessary information to FDA. The suggested format should
increase the completeness and accuracy of your submission and may reduce the time needed
for review of your submission.
Although a single 510(k) submission for colored, flavored, or scented gloves may include
more than one color and/or flavor or scent, you should test each glove type separately, as a

35

finished glove, for biocompatibility and all physical characteristics. Data for multiple types
of gloves should be in separate attachments.
A 510(k) submission should be complete; that is, you should not reference information from
a previous 510(k) submission.
We recommend that you identify all attachments with the topic and the submitter’s name,
street address, phone, and fax numbers. You should number the pages in your submission
and attachments and include a table of contents. Do not include unnecessary information
such as copies of standards and details of test equipment.

FORMAT FOR PREMARKET NOTIFICATION 510(k).................................................. 43

POWDER-FREE
Powder-free surgeon’s gloves may be lubricated with small amounts of silicone or other
suitable lubricant or be coated with a non-tacky polymer. A Premarket Notification (510(k))
submission should include a full characterization of the lubricant or coating such as the
chemical identity, specifications, and biocompatibility.
FORMAT FOR PREMARKET NOTIFICATION 510(k)
This section contains a suggested format for the submission of a Premarket Notification
(510(k)) for surgeon’s gloves. FDA does not require this format; however, you may use it as
a guide for submitting the information to FDA. This format should increase the
completeness and accuracy of your submission and reduce the time needed for review of
your submission.
Although a single 510(k) submission for colored, flavored, or scented gloves may include
more than one color and/or flavor or scent, you should test each glove type separately as a
finished glove, for biocompatibility and all physical characteristics. Data for multiple types
of gloves should be in separate attachments.
The person having direct or contractual control over sterilization should submit the 510(k)
for surgeon’s gloves. If the manufacturer does the sterilization or contracts for the
sterilization, the manufacturer submits the 510(k). For imported prelabeled “sterile” but notyet-sterilized surgeon’s gloves, the importer that contracts for the sterilization should submit
the 510(k) to FDA. However, the submitter should identify the manufacturer of the gloves in
the submission.
A 510(k) submission should be complete; that is, you should not reference information from
a previous 510(k) submission.
We recommend that you identify all attachments with the topic and the submitters name,
street address, phone, and fax numbers. You should number the pages in your submission
and attachments and include a table of contents. Do not include extraneous information such
as copies of standards and details of test equipment.

INTRODUCTION
Quality System Regulation
Manufacturers of medical gloves must meet the requirements of the Quality System
regulation for medical devices (21 CFR part 820). The Quality System regulation at 21 CFR
820.5 states that “each manufacturer shall establish and maintain a quality system that is
appropriate for the specific medical device...manufactured.” This system must meet the
requirements of the Quality System regulation.
Proper quality control procedures help to control or eliminate manufacturing defects, such as
pinhole defects. FDA also believes that compliance with the Quality System regulation and
implementation of design controls will minimize water soluble proteins, chemical residues,
and other problems common to the manufacture of medical gloves.
This chapter provides guidance that is particularly relevant to the manufacture of medical
gloves and other natural rubber latex medical devices. This chapter does not cover all
requirements of the Quality System regulation.

51

DESIGN CONTROLS
The design control requirements are basic controls needed to ensure that the device being
designed will perform as intended when produced for commercial distribution. Although
surgeon’s gloves are subject to design control requirements (21 CFR 820.30(a)(2)(ii)),
patient examination gloves are not.
Design Input for Medical Gloves
When developing design inputs for a new or modified glove design, you should answer
questions pertaining to the intended use of the device as well as the needs of users and
patients. The questions and answers will vary for different types of gloves and accessories.
Some typical design input questions include:
Where will the new glove be used?
Who will use the new glove?
How will the new glove be used?
With what devices will the new glove be used?
Does the glove need to be resistant to certain chemicals?
How long will the new glove be used?
What is the appropriate labeling and packaging?
What are the regulatory requirements for the glove and any performance claims?
Are there any other questions that are specific to the glove you are developing?
Design input requirements should identify all of the desired performance, physical, safety,
and compatibility characteristics of the proposed glove design. Design input also includes
requirements for labeling, packaging, and manufacturing. You should consider shelf life
under design input as part of the activities to meet user and patient needs. FDA considers
shelf life to be a significant factor in meeting user needs. The design input requirements are
ultimately converted to the specifications for the finished glove.
You must have a design input requirement procedure (21 CFR 820.30(c)) in order to develop
the glove specifications. The specifications, among other factors, should address:
1. Performance and efficacy;
2. Human factors, fatigue, donning, color, and odor;
3. Length, cuff, size, and thickness;
4. Chemical safety;
5. Allergenicity (protein levels);
6. Pinhole AQL;
7. Biocompatibility;
8. Glove compatibility with blood, saline and any intended chemical contact;
9. Environmental compatibility;
10. Packaging (in a separate specification document);
11. Labeling (which may provided in a separate document or in the glove primary
specification, as appropriate);

52

12. Special labeling claims;
13. Any other regulatory requirements; and
14. Professional associations’ recommendations.
The final glove specifications should cover all significant glove characteristics. The glove
specifications may refer to other specifications or standards. Specifications should address
characteristics or factors such as biocompatibility (chemicals and proteins), barrier integrity,
packaging protection, shipping stability, and shelf life, if applicable.
Design Verification
You must establish and maintain procedures for verifying the device design (21 CFR
820.30(f)). Design verification confirms that the device design meets the design input
requirements. You should verify the design of gloves, packaging, and any subsequent
changes by testing parameters such as tensile strength, elongation, barrier integrity
(pinholes), protein residues, chemical residues, biocompatibility, correct labeling, and shelf
life. We recommend that you use test methods provided in recognized consensus standards
for your verification testing whenever possible.
Design Validation
While design verification confirms that the device design (outputs) meets the design
requirements (inputs), design validation is conducted to determine whether the device meets
user needs. The difference between design verification and design validation is illustrated in
the following diagram:

Validation for medical gloves may include use under real or simulated conditions.
Validation assures that the donning ability, strength, thickness, feel, size, shape, texture,
holding ability, tactile sensitivity, lack of fatigue, lack of irritation, color, and odor of the
gloves are satisfactory to users.
53

Generally, clinical testing is not required for gloves that are substantially equivalent to gloves
legally marketed in the U.S. However, if clinical testing is conducted, e.g., testing for skin
sensitization to chemicals, you should perform appropriate laboratory and animal verification
(e.g., performance, reliability, and biocompatibility) testing prior to human clinical or
simulated use testing.
DEVICE MASTER RECORD
Title 21 CFR 820.3(j) states a “Device master record means a compilation of records
containing the procedures and specifications for a finished device.” A Device Master Record
(DMR) is a comprehensive record of all of the procedures and instructions required to
manufacture each type of glove. A DMR contains or refers to the location of documents for
manufacturing and processing activities, such as procurement, processing, labeling, test and
inspection, and packaging. The DMR also contains information on the design, formulation,
specifications, complete manufacturing procedures, quality assurance requirements,
acceptance criteria, packaging, and labeling of a finished glove.
A DMR for medical gloves manufactured by complex processes, such as latex dipping,
usually consists of many documents. For convenience, many medical glove manufacturers
generate an index or table of contents which lists all of the documents in a DMR. The DMR
should contain a glove (device) specification. Generally, a medical glove specification will
include the following:
• product trade and common name(s)
• intended use(s)
• performance characteristics, such as tensile strength and elongation
• regulatory classification
• physical characteristics, such as cuffs, thickness, length, and size
• environmental limitations and product shelf life or expiration date
• user safety characteristics such as a pinhole and chemical residue limits
• water-extractable protein limit
• powder/particulate/debris limit
• packaging and labeling specifications
Exhibit #1 provides a sample specification for inclusion in the Device Master Record.
A DMR should contain specifications for the content and design of labeling. Labeling claims
should match glove characteristics and contain required labeling. Gloves that have false or
misleading labeling are misbranded under section 502 of the Act. (See chapter 4 on
labeling.)
Record Retention

54

The Quality System regulation at 21 CFR 820.180(b) states “All records required by this part
shall be retained for a period of time equivalent to the design and expected life of the device,
but in no case less than 2 years from the date of release for commercial distribution by the
manufacturer.” You should retain records for most medical gloves for two years or for as
long as the labeled expiration/shelf-life date, whichever is longer.
DOCUMENT CONTROL
Many written documents are needed to manufacture gloves. Written procedures should
cover the following areas:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

glove design
processes
components, coagulants, dewebbers, donning lubricants
labeling and packaging
colorants, flavors, odorants, antimicrobials, anti-ozonants, anti-oxidants
environmental control, facilities, employee practices
production and measuring equipment
manufacturing materials

Specifically, we recommend that written procedures address the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

cleaning tanks and equipment in accordance with a schedule

inspecting formers on and off line for defects and debris
washing formers each (or as designated) line cycle
protecting wet formers from dust and other debris
controlling the environment by screening or closing doors and windows
protecting dipping tanks from dust and other debris
maintaining covers, shields, and ledges to reduce debris falling into processing tanks
controlling the use of grease and oil to eliminate drips into the processing tanks,
inspecting lines, tumblers, etc., to assure there are no protrusions, vibrations that
could cause product defects

55

•
•

analyzing defective gloves (when acceptance criteria are not met) to determine the
cause of the problems,
personal hygiene, such as hand washing

You should establish and maintain procedures to control all documents (21 CFR 820.40).
Whenever there are changes to standard operating procedures, quality assurance procedures,
data forms, and product specific documentation, the review and approval must come from
individual(s) in the same function or organization that reviewed and approved the original
(21 CFR 820.40(b)). See the Quality System manual for additional information on change
control.
INCOMING AND IN-PROCESS ACCEPTANCE ACTIVITIES
Components and Manufacturing Materials
Components are materials used during manufacturing that are intended to be part of the
finished gloves. Examples of such products are latex concentrate, various chemicals that are
mixed with the latex or polymer during compounding (such as antioxidants), and donning
lubricant.
Manufacturing materials are substances used to help in the manufacturing process but are not
intended to become part of the finished gloves. Examples include ingredients contained in
the dipping compound (such as accelerators), former release chemicals, and any detergents
that are used to clean the formers. Corn starch (powder) is also a manufacturing material if it
is added and then removed for “powder-free” gloves.
Component Qualification
Qualification is the determination of suitability of components and consists of verifying
through documented testing, evaluation, and review that a manufacturing ingredient or
component will reliably perform its function. Well characterized manufacturing ingredients
or components that are used in their normal application may need minor testing. New
products, such as donning lubricants, protein modified latex, or new accelerators, will require
substantial testing.
For surgical gloves, you should maintain a design history file of any qualification
(verification) testing of components, raw materials, and manufacturing materials. This
record should include the product identity, testing methods that were used, who performed
the testing, date, and the actual test data and results.
Specifications for Incoming Components
Specifications for components and manufacturing materials should state essential properties
to assure the quality of the finished product. The specifications should adequately describe
the characteristics, dimensions, design, chemical purity, performance, and any other feature

56

or parameter necessary to assure receipt of the product desired. For some components, such
as donning powder, the specifications should include a limit on microorganism
contamination. Component and material specifications should be part of the device master
record.
Natural rubber latex is a biologically produced substance that may vary considerably
depending on climate, season, local environmental factors (including soil composition), and
specific tree varieties. Therefore, you should have as many applicable specifications for the
incoming latex as feasible in order to reduce some of the inherent variability in this
component. You should be aware that various applicable standard tests and specifications
are included in documents, such as ASTM D1076-02, Standard Specification for RubberConcentrated, Ammonia Preserved, Creamed, and Centrifuged Natural Latex.
Acceptance Criteria, Testing, and Documentation
To the extent feasible, you should have specific acceptance criteria for components and
manufacturing materials. Acceptance criteria are the attributes of a product that determine its
acceptability, such as appearance, color, dimensions, mechanical stability, percent solids,
preservative levels, protein levels, viscosity, purity, pH, or performance characteristics.
You should document the inspection, testing, and acceptance or rejection of raw materials,
manufacturing ingredients, and components. Exhibit #2 provides a sample record for
receiving incoming latex.
If you use a contract laboratory to test components, materials, and manufacturing materials,
the laboratory becomes an extension of the glove manufacturer’s quality system. The glove
manufacturer is responsible for assuring that the contractor’s test and inspection procedures
and quality system are acceptable. Typically, you can obtain this assurance by documented
audits.
Component Storage
You should store components so that they are protected from moisture, dirt, and insects. You
should store components or materials, such as latex and starch, in a manner that retards the
growth of microorganisms. FDA suggests that you store components and manufacturing
materials under conditions that prevent their deterioration. You may store ceramic formers
and other items not affected by the environment in sheds or outside.
In-Process Testing
You should perform in-process testing on the dipping compound as well as the glove to
determine if the manufacturing process is on target to meet your specifications. In-process
testing may include testing of the uncured compound, the cure status of the dipping
compound (whether the compound is ready to dip), and thickness, tensile strength, length,
and water leak testing of the glove. Also, you should test for powder, if it is a powder-free

57

glove. You can find a sample of an in-process record, Analysis of Latex Compounding, in
Exhibit #3.
PROCESS VALIDATION
Process validation is a means by which the manufacturer establishes that its manufacturing
process is capable of consistently producing a product that conforms to the specifications as
outlined in the device master record. Process validation is a key element in developing
process controls. A properly validated and controlled process will reduce scrap and rework
resulting in increased efficiency. Examples of processes that should be validated include
compounding, dipping, leaching, chlorination, sterile packaging, and sterilization.
If there is an increase in nonconforming product or process deviations occur, you should
review and evaluate the process, and you should perform revalidations where appropriate.
Changes to the manufacturing process, such as new equipment or a new compound, may
require revalidation prior to implementation of the change.

PROCESS CONTROLS
Each manufacturer must establish production and process controls, as appropriate, to ensure
that a device conforms to its specifications (21 CFR 820.70(a)). These controls should
reflect the ranges of parameters established during the previously conducted process
validation.
You should consider process controls for the following processes: compounding, maturation,
dipping, curing, bleaching, drying, powdering or removal of powder, and rinsing. Also, you
should control vibration which causes air bubbles in the dipping tanks. Exhibit #4 shows a
table providing the impact of processes that affect the finished glove characteristics. The
table provides examples of parameters for each process that you should consider for process
controls. Exhibit #5 provides a typical example of a monitoring and process parameter
control record.
Inadequate process control can lead to nonconforming product. For example, patient exam
gloves were insufficiently dried and subsequently packaged and distributed in a moist
condition. The lot was later tested and found to have Aspergillus and Fusarium molds and
recalled from the market. One way this situation may have been prevented is if the firm had
monitored in-process controls during the manufacturing process. Monitoring the humidity
and/or moisture content during the drying cycle could have revealed the problem. At this
stage, the firm may have been able to rework (re-dry) the gloves which could have avoided
the product recall.
Manufacturing Materials

58

Under the definition in 21 CFR 820.3(p) of the Quality System regulation, manufacturing
materials include “concomitant” or by-product constituents. Concomitant constituents are
substances that are unavoidably present in the components and manufacturing materials but
are not intended to be present in the finished device. These include water-soluble natural
rubber proteins present in the latex concentrate. These proteins do not contribute to the glove
barrier, because they are not bound into the latex film but readily leach out. By-products are
substances formed during mixing by reactions between various components and
manufacturing materials. These also include various calcium salts.
Manufacturing materials such as mold release compounds, cleaning agents, lubricating oils,
by-products, and other substances used to facilitate manufacturing are procured and received
the same as components. You should establish, maintain, and document procedures for the
removal of manufacturing materials when they could reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on product quality. You should remove manufacturing materials or limit them
to an amount that does not adversely affect the quality of the glove. Because natural rubber
latex proteins can adversely affect the safety of medical gloves, you should establish and
validate procedures to reduce the water soluble proteins to ensure that it is removed or
limited to an amount that does not adversely affect the gloves's safety.
Control, Use, and Removal of Manufacturing Materials
You should carefully consider manufacturing materials that may adversely affect the finished
glove. You should design each process to use a minimum amount of adverse chemicals to
reduce costs and removal efforts and increase the safety of the glove.
For medical gloves, processing of raw latex, and leaching and washing processes are
commonly used to reduce or remove natural water-soluble proteins and remove adverse
materials, such as processing chemical residues. When residues from sterilization agents
such as ethylene oxide need to be removed, instructions for aeration are necessary.
When you add starch to medical gloves to expedite handling and then remove it during
further processing (for example, during the production of some “powder-free” gloves), the
starch becomes a manufacturing material. You should use a written processing and
test/inspection procedure to assure that powder residues on the finished gloves meet finished
device specifications.
Water-Soluble Proteins. Water-soluble proteins on latex gloves may be a potential cause of
allergic reactions. Processing controls should include the reduction of water-soluble
proteins. You should remove them by:
•
•
•
•

reducing or removing the proteins in the raw latex,
using and controlling pre-cure leaching and post-cure washing processes,
assuring that the leaching tanks and spray or washing tanks use water that is flowcontrolled and continually refreshed to avoid protein saturation, and
leaching and washing for an appropriate time.

59

You should perform washing before and after curing, because proteins become more watersoluble and/or move to the surface of latex gloves during heat curing. This allows you to
remove the protein more efficiently. You should complete the washing before you apply the
final donning powder or lubricant, if applied.
Each manufacturer should establish the temperature of the leaching and washing water
because the temperature needed varies based on the parameters of the overall compounding,
dipping, and curing methods. Studies indicate that the purity (flow rate) and agitation of the
leach water and total leaching time are more important than water temperature.
Surface treatment of the cured latex glove with chlorine or similar agents denatures surface
constituents such as water-soluble proteins. These treatment processes also wash and rinse
away proteins and manufacturing residues. Chlorine is an adverse manufacturing material
which can cause deterioration of the gloves. You should remove it from the gloves after
chlorination by washing, neutralization, or other appropriate methods. The chlorination
process includes process control and validation.
You should test water-soluble proteins during routine production. You may test protein
levels using the FDA-recognized standard, ASTM D5712, Standard Test Method for the
Analysis of Aqueous Extractable Protein in Natural Rubber and Its Products Using the
Modified Lowry Method, or an equivalent consensus standard.
Trained personnel should develop, validate, document, implement, and control the processes
used to control water-soluble proteins and manufacturing materials (see 21 CFR 820.25).
Manufacturing Chemicals. You should remove manufacturing chemicals, such as
vulcanization accelerators and detergents, to the extent that they do not adversely affect the
finished glove. Reports of type IV sensitivity reactions have been associated with gloves that
contain residual amounts of these manufacturing chemicals.
You can remove manufacturing chemicals by some of the same methods used to remove
protein. You should develop leaching, washing, surface treatment, or other processes for
removing adverse manufacturing materials. You should also validate, document, and
continuously control the processes in order to meet the established specifications.
Maintenance and Inspection of Equipment
According to 21 CFR 820.70(g)(1), you must establish and maintain a schedule for the
adjustment and cleaning of equipment. For example, you should periodically strip and clean
the maturation tank of any residue to avoid contamination. The formers should have a
routine cleaning schedule because build up of residues can cause thin spots and holes in the
gloves. In addition to the in-line cleaning, you may need periodic maintenance of formers to
remove the build up of residues. You should lift, or remove and repair, or replace defective
formers. Because lubricant for production equipment can fall into dipping tanks, you should
inspect the equipment for excess lubricant and periodically clean the equipment.

60

To properly maintain equipment, manufacturers should:
•
•
•
•
•

establish a written schedule for performing these activities,
post the schedule or make it readily available to employees,
document the activities, the individuals conducting the activities, and the date,
audit the activities and document the audit, and
keep maintenance records for each piece of equipment.

When adjustment is necessary to maintain proper operation due to deterioration of parts
or other reasons, post the inherent limitations and allowable tolerances of the equipment
or make these readily available to personnel responsible for making adjustments.
Contamination Control
For each area in the building where you process components and gloves, you should control
any element that you determined might cause contamination. The contaminants include dust,
paint chips, rust, starch residues, protein residues, microorganisms, humidity, temperature,
and static electricity. If sources of contaminants are located above the manufacturing
equipment, you should consider covering or enclosing portions of the dip line or any other
area that could be affected by debris. You should clean equipment as needed by methods
that will reduce or prevent contamination of tanks, formers, and gloves with dust and other
debris.
Buildings should be appropriately constructed to prevent, reduce, and control contamination,
and support the manufacturer’s environmental control program. For example, controlling
dust may require that you pave driveways and parking lots. Floor sweeping and floor
polishing scatter dust can contaminate wet formers, coagulant dipping tanks, latex/polymer
dipping tanks, and finished gloves. You should clean floors and equipment by methods that
minimize the amount of debris released into the environment.
You should perform all manufacturing and labeling operations for low protein or synthetic
gloves in a separate area to avoid protein contamination by latex gloves. Synthetic polymer
gloves, polymer-coated latex gloves, or any gloves with a labeled or controlled protein level
should not be dipped in any tank (particularly starch slurry tanks) or tumbled in dryers where
regular protein coated latex gloves have been produced, unless you clean the tanks
thoroughly before the production of the low- or protein-free gloves. FDA recommends that
manufacturers dedicate lines specific to the manufacture of synthetic gloves to avoid protein
contamination.

61

Environmental Control
Where environmental conditions could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on
product quality, you must establish procedures to control the environmental conditions (21
CFR 820.70(c)). You should establish and maintain an appropriate system for regular
monitoring and documenting the control of environmental factors that apply to your specific
situation.
You should consider environmental factors, such as lighting, ventilation, temperature,
humidity, static electricity, insect and pest control, and particulates. If you use rodenticides,
insecticides, or similar agents, you should establish written procedures for limiting their use
and removing them from work surfaces. These procedures are to prevent any adverse effect
on the manufacturing process or the device. You should cover finished gloves, solution
tanks, and other appropriate items during the application of pesticides to the room.
You should store packaging and starch in a clean, dry, insect-free area. You should preserve
latex to prevent bacterial growth. You should store components such as starch that support
bacterial growth in a controlled environment such as sealed containers or bags. You should
not use unfiltered air to dry washed formers or coagulant-coated formers, because the
resulting contamination may cause pinholes. You should not use unfiltered factory air to
cool or dry finished surgeon’s gloves. You should have screens in open windows, and doors
should be screened to control insects.
Bioburden Control
Bioburden is an environmental factor that needs to be controlled for sterile surgeon’s gloves,
but it is also important in the manufacture of nonsterile gloves. The failure to control
bioburden may result in mold on the finished product.
Medical gloves, particularly those powdered with starch, can support the growth of microorganisms. Appropriate processing controls should include:
• purchasing starch with a low bioburden,
• properly storing the starch until it is used,
• applying starch per established procedures,
• cooling the starch slurry and/or using an antimicrobial in the starch slurry tanks,
• sampling finished gloves to assure that excessive starch is not applied,
• keeping the finished gloves clean,
• establishing and meeting a dryness specification for finished gloves, and
• protecting finished gloves from the environment.
Filthy or contaminated water may also be a major source of microbes on finished gloves.
You should monitor and appropriately treat water used in processing the glove, especially
near the end of the manufacturing process, such as post-cure washing, to control the
bioburden on the glove.
You should refer to ANSI/AMMI/ISO 11737-1:1995, Sterilization of Medical Devices—
62

Microbiological methods—Part 1: Estimation of Population of Microorganisms on Product
for guidance on bioburden testing.
Personnel Practices
You should establish and maintain procedures for personnel to follow to reduce
contamination and any other adverse effects on the gloves. Procedures should include hand
washing requirements. Personnel should not wear jewelry or have sharp fingernails.
Additionally, eating and smoking may adversely affect the finished glove. You should
confine these activities to designated areas.
FINISHED GLOVE ACCEPTANCE ACTIVITIES
Finished glove acceptance procedures should demonstrate that the gloves meet the
manufacturer’s acceptance criteria. The finished device evaluation should include inspection
and testing of samples of packaged gloves. A manufacturer’s evaluation of finished glove
lots usually includes appropriate in-process inspection and testing performed on
representative samples. You should record the evaluation data for finished glove lots in the
device history record (DHR). You should review and accept the DHR before releasing the
lot for distribution.
Glove evaluation may include the following parameters:
• barrier integrity, including pinholes and embedded debris,
• length, width, thickness,
• weight,
• elongation and tensile strength,
• cuffs/beads,
• powder and/or lubricant level,
• measurement or indication of manufacturing material residues,
• measurement or indication of proteins or allergens,
• moisture content or dryness level,
• fisheyes, webbing, or folds,
• package integrity,
• bioburden count,
• labeling,
• visual tests, such as color and material uniformity.
Your quality system procedures should describe the finished device test methods and
acceptance criteria, including sampling procedures and AQL. You should reference any
standard test methods that are used. Information on test methods for water leak testing,
protein, tensile strength, and powder residue is available in consensus standards. See Chapter
10, Voluntary Standards, for more information on consensus standards. For water leak
testing, FDA uses the methodology in 21 CFR 800.20 for its regulatory testing of all medical
gloves (of all materials).

63

NONCONFORMING PRODUCT
If a lot of gloves or product does not meet specifications, you should properly identify the
containers of rejected gloves and place them in a separate quarantine area or in a specially
identified area to prevent mix-ups. If nonconforming product is investigated, you should add
the results to the corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) system. According to 21 CFR
820.90(b)(1), you must document the disposition of nonconforming product. The records
should state whether you returned or scrapped the gloves, components, materials, or other
products.
Reworked Gloves
You must establish and maintain procedures for rework to include retesting and reevaluation
of reworked nonconforming product (21 CFR 820.90(b)(2)). Reworked product should meet
the original specifications. You should evaluate reprocessing to assure that gloves will not
be adversely affected and you should document the results of the evaluation.
Procedures for reworking should specify the types of nonconformances that may be
reworked. These procedures should document the specific tests and processes to be
performed. You should base these procedures on studies that measure the effects of
reprocessing operations.
Reworked product is nonconforming product until it meets all finished device acceptance
criteria. You should identify reworked product to distinguish it from acceptable product and
components.
LABELING AND PACKAGING
The Quality System regulation has specific requirements for labeling and packaging design,
as well as for labeling and packaging operations (21 CFR 820.120, 820.130)). Labeling
includes dispenser box labels, case labels, package labels, and directions for use, such as
caution statements.
Area Separation and Inspection
You should separate all labeling and packaging operations performed at the same time, as
necessary, to assure there are no mix-ups between similar labels or various sizes or types of
gloves. Before beginning any packaging and labeling operation where a mix-up could occur,
you should examine the production area and equipment to make certain that you have
removed any glove and labeling materials from previous operations. You should destroy
unused labeling that contains a pre-coded manufacturing date, expiration date, or lot number;
you should not return it to the label storage area.

64

A designated individual should examine the labeling for accuracy, in accordance with the
device master record, prior to initiating the labeling operation. The examination should
include the expiration date.
Packaging
An effective primary package for a medical glove should be designed and developed along
with the product by considering glove characteristics, contamination control, sterilization
process, sealing, labeling, secondary packaging, shipping, environment, shelf life (expiration
date), end use, and FDA regulations. The primary package and the shipping container should
protect gloves adequately under all reasonable conditions from original packaging to final
use. For sterile gloves, you should validate the packaging operation. You should either
compile complete storage and stability data for packaging for sterile gloves or obtain the data
from the packaging supplier.
Shipping for Further Processing
It is common industry practice for non-sterile gloves labeled as “sterile” to be shipped to a
contract sterilizer. You should conspicuously mark each pallet, carton, or other designated
unit to show its non-sterile nature when it is introduced into and is moving in interstate
commerce. See Sterilization for additional information.
COMPLAINT HANDLING
Each manufacturer must process complaints from all sources according to its complaint
handling procedure (21 CFR 820.198(a)). You should assure that personnel in marketing,
sales, engineering, and manufacturing report complaints. You should make these employees
aware of this Quality System requirement through formal training and note the training in
their training records.
Because FDA believes that customer complaints are underreported, user reporting for tears
and leaks are considered low. Therefore, even small increases in the rate of complaints may
be significant.
Customer complaints may include the following issues:
[ ] Pinholes, Tears, Thin Spots, Degradation
[ ] Expiration Date / Shelf Life
[ ] Powder, Lubricant, Tacky
[ ] Particulates: Type _________________ Location
[ ] Packaging
[ ] Sterility

Complaint Investigation
Each manufacturer must evaluate complaints to determine whether an investigation is
necessary (21 CFR 820.198(b)). After an analysis of the complaint, if an investigation is
needed, the failure investigation and analysis should determine the actual problem or actual
failure mechanism to the level necessary to correct the problem. A failure investigation may
include a review of the device history records and analysis of returned product. When you
diagnose the same failure, contaminant, or other problem several times, you do not need to
analyze all additional gloves that are returned with the same complaint.
Complaints Received by Distributors
When the manufacturer is located outside the U.S., the foreign manufacturer should provide
the U.S. distributor with instructions to forward any complaints to the foreign manufacturer
for review and analysis. You should consider the forwarding of complaints when developing
contracts or other business arrangements with importers.
Medical Device Reporting
According to 21 CFR 820.198(a)(3), you must evaluate complaints to determine whether the
complaint represents an event which must be reported to FDA under 21 CFR 803, Medical
Device Reporting. Incidents in which a device may have caused or contributed to a death or
serious injury must be reported to FDA under the Medical Device Reporting program. In
addition, you must report certain malfunctions. (21 CFR 803.1.) An allergic reaction may be
considered a reportable event.
The MDR regulation is a mechanism for FDA and manufacturers to identify and monitor
significant adverse events involving medical devices. The goal of the regulation is to detect
and correct problems in a timely manner. You can find additional information on the
Medical Device Reporting process at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/351.html
STERILIZATION

67

Sterilization of medical gloves should meet a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-6. This
means that you should design the sterilization process so that the probability of a glove being
non-sterile is 1 in 1,000,000, even if the gloves originally contained highly resistant
microorganisms.
You should sterilize medical gloves with a validated sterilization process. Note that some
glove materials are adversely affected by certain sterilization methods. Validation of the
sterilization method should demonstrate that the sterilization process does not adversely
affect glove safety and effectiveness.
Refer to the Quality System manual and applicable standards, such as AAMI or ISO, for
validation of sterilization processes. AAMI and ISO standards for sterilization include the
following:
• ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11135- Medical devices - Validation and routine control of ethylene
oxide sterilization
• AAMI/CDV 11137 Sterilization of health care products – Radiation
• AAMI/ISO Technical Information Report (TIR) 13409 Sterilization of health care
products - Radiation sterilization
Additional AAMI standards are available at
http://www.aami.org/applications/search/index.cfm?currentcategory=Sterilization
Contract Sterilization
It is common industry practice to ship non-sterile gloves labeled as sterile to a contract
sterilizer. This practice is recognized in 21 CFR 801.150(e) which states, in part, “the Food
and Drug Administration will initiate no regulatory action against the device as misbranded
or adulterated when the non-sterile device is labeled sterile, provided all the following
conditions are met:
(1) There is in effect a written agreement which:
(i)

contains the names and post office addresses of the firms involved and is signed by
the person authorizing such shipment and the operator or person in charge of the
establishment receiving the devices for sterilization,
(ii) provides instructions for maintaining proper records or otherwise accounting for the
number of units in each shipment to insure that the number of units shipped is the
same as the number received and sterilized,
(iii) acknowledges that the device is non-sterile and is being shipped for further
processing, and
(iv) states in detail the sterilization process, the gaseous mixture or other media, the
equipment, and the testing method or quality controls to be used by the contract
sterilizer to assure that the device will be brought into full compliance with the Act.

68

(2) Each pallet, carton, or other designated unit is conspicuously marked to show its nonsterile nature when it is introduced into and is moving in interstate commerce, and while
it is being held prior to sterilization. Following sterilization, and until such time as it is
established that the device is sterile and can be released from quarantine, each pallet,
carton, or other designated unit is conspicuously marked to show that it has not been
released from quarantine, e.g., “sterilized—awaiting test results” or an equivalent
designation.”
Compliance with 21 CFR 801.150(e) may require two written agreements when importing
pre-labeled “sterile” but not-yet-sterilized surgeon’s gloves. The two agreements are:
• one between the importer and the glove manufacturer, and
• one between the importer and the contract sterilizer.
Gloves that have been sterilized and shipped to the importer’s warehouse prior to final
release of the product should be properly marked as not yet released. For example, pallets or
other designated units may be marked “sterilized, awaiting test results,” or similar wording.
The importer should have control of the gloves until final release. Prior to shipping, you
should use either a highly controlled quarantine area or a label control system to prevent
distribution of gloves marked “sterile,” but not yet released for distribution.
QUALITY SYSTEM AUDITS
Under 21 CFR 820.22, you must conduct quality audits to assure that the quality system is in
compliance with the established quality system requirements and to determine the
effectiveness of the quality system. Individuals who do not have direct responsibility for the
area being audited must conduct the quality audits. You must take corrective action(s),
including a reaudit of deficient matters, when necessary. You must document the results of
each quality audit, (and reaudit(s), if necessary) in a report, and management responsible for
the area audited must review the report (21 CFR 820.22).
You should establish written procedures for quality audits. You should document the dates
and results of quality audits and reaudits.
EMPLOYEE TRAINING
Under 21 CFR 820.25, you must have sufficient personnel with the necessary education,
background, training, and experience to assure that all activities required by the Quality
System regulation are correctly performed. As part of their training, personnel must be made
aware of device defects that may occur from the improper performance of their specific jobs.
Personnel who perform verification and validation activities must be made aware of defects
and errors that may be encountered as part of their job functions.

69

You must establish procedures for identifying training needs and ensure that all personnel are
trained to adequately perform their assigned responsibilities. You must document employee
training (21 CFR 820.25).

FACTORY INSPECTIONS
FDA evaluates manufacturer compliance with the medical device regulations primarily by
factory inspections. During the inspection, the FDA investigator will review your facilities,
design controls (for surgeon’s gloves), manufacturing operations, environment, and records
to determine your level of compliance. The emphasis will be on compliance with the Quality
System regulation (21 CFR part 820). The FDA inspection program includes foreign
manufacturing sites. FDA will contact foreign firms to schedule an inspection.
You will find guidance on how FDA conducts factory inspections, including regulatory
sanctions FDA can take against noncompliant firms, in the following guidance documents.
Factory Inspections (Medical Device Quality Systems Manual: A Small Entity
Compliance Guide)
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/qsr/18inspn.html
Quality System Inspection Technique (QSIT)
http://www.fda.gov/ora/inspect_ref/igs/qsit/qsitguide.htm
IMPORTING GLOVES AND FDA SAMPLING
You will find information on the FDA import process at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/39i.html. FDA may collect a sample of your gloves and
test the gloves in accordance with 21 CFR 800.20, “Patient examination gloves and
surgeon’s gloves; sample plans and test method for leakage defects; adulteration.” Sketches
of the test apparatus described in 21 CFR 800.20 are provided in Appendix A.
When a glove shipment includes multiple lots or sizes, it is considered a commingled
shipment. FDA usually will not sample each individual lot within a commingled shipment.
In the sample, FDA will include only one type of glove (surgeon’s gloves or examination
gloves) and will attempt to represent glove sizes in the sample as they occur in the overall
shipment. Also, FDA will attempt to include several lot numbers, if present. However, exact
proportional representation of all lots or sizes is not necessary to obtain a representative
sample for testing. A shipment of gloves may be refused entry based on the appearance of
adulteration (Section 801 of the Act; 21 U.S.C. 381), and such an appearance can be obtained
even if the sample includes only one lot number or one size. If the sample fails, FDA will
77

detain all lots of the same glove type (surgeon’s gloves or examination gloves) in the
shipment.
FDA provides its sampling methodology and defect action levels in the FDA Compliance
Policy Guide, Chapter 3, Section 335.700, Surgeon’s Gloves and Patient Examination
Gloves; Defects - Criteria for Direct Reference Seizure.
CPG 335.700 Surgeon’s Gloves and Patient Examination Gloves; Defects - Criteria for
Direct Reference Seizure (CPG 7124.31)
http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgdev/cpg335-700.html
COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES
FDA may pursue regulatory sanctions when medical devices are determined to be
"adulterated" or "misbranded," or when individuals or firms commit certain "prohibited acts."
(Sections 301, 501, and 502 of the Act; 21 U.S.C. 331, 351, and 352.) These generic terms
also apply to other products that FDA regulates, such as foods, drugs, and cosmetics;
however, the causes of adulteration and misbranding are not identical for all products. The
following summarizes some common reasons why FDA may consider medical gloves to be
adulterated or misbranded.
Adulteration
Generally, a charge of adulteration indicates a potentially serious problem with the medical
device itself. Section 501 of the Act describes possible reasons for adulteration. Several
common examples of adulterated medical gloves are:
•

Gloves that do not provide an intact barrier as evidenced by failure of a water leak test
(21 CFR 800.20). The gloves are adulterated according to section 501(c) - failure of the
gloves to have the quality that they are represented to have.

•

Gloves that have never been cleared to market are automatically classified in Class III
(section 513(f)(1) of the Act). Without clearance or approval, the gloves are adulterated
according to section 501(f)(1)(B)(i).

•

Gloves that have been manufactured, packaged, or stored in a facility that was inspected
by FDA and that was found not in conformity with the Quality System regulation (21
CFR part 820). The gloves are adulterated according to section 501(h) because the
facilities and controls used for manufacturing, packing, and storage do not meet GMPs as
described in the Quality System regulation (21 CFR 820).

78

Misbranding
Usually, a charge of misbranding indicates a problem with the labeling or documentation of
the device or device manufacturer. Section 502 of the Act describes possible reasons for
misbranding. Several common examples of misbranded medical gloves are:
•

Gloves that have exaggerated, untrue, or unsubstantiated claims are “misbranded” under
section 502(a) of the Act, because the labeling is false or misleading in some manner.
Examples of claims that may misbrand a medical glove include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

“Leak Proof” or similar unsupportable claims of performance
“Hypoallergenic” claims for latex gloves (prohibited by 21 CFR
801.437(h))
“Antimicrobial” claims without supporting data
“Accelerator Free”
“Skin Care” claims without supporting data
“Synthetic Gloves” that do not identify the material
“Low Protein” claims that do not quantify the amount of protein
“Extra Thick” claims that do not quantify the thickness
“Lightly Powdered” claims

•

Natural rubber latex gloves that do not include the latex "Caution" statement required by
21 CFR 801.437. These gloves are misbranded under section 502(a) because the labeling
fails to reveal important information about the use of the product as required by section
201(n).

•

Gloves that are not labeled with the name of the manufacturer or distributor are
misbranded according to section 502(b).

•

Disposable gloves that are not labeled with a statement "For single use only" are
misbranded according to section 502(f)(1) for failure to have adequate directions for use.

•

Gloves that do not meet applicable registration and listing requirements are misbranded
according to section 502(o).

Disposition of Adulterated or Misbranded gloves
If any lots of medical gloves are found to be adulterated or misbranded, the manufacturer or
importer of record may request to recondition the gloves to bring them into compliance (see
21 CFR 800.20(d)).
The importer of record should advise the FDA District Office that initiated the detention of
the firm's plans to bring the product into compliance. If the gloves cannot be brought into
compliance, they cannot be marketed in the U.S. as medical gloves.

79

Non-conforming medical gloves may be brought into conformance by:
•
•

reconditioning to correct the non-conformance, i.e., remove defective gloves, correct
labeling deficiencies; or
reconditioning by relabeling, and subsequently distributing the gloves for nonmedical use, or non-FDA regulated use.

A manufacturer/importer that chooses to recondition the product should request and obtain
permission from the responsible FDA District Office.
The importer of record may also request permission to recondition a commingled shipment
that has failed FDA analysis by testing each lot or size in the shipment to identify whether
some lots or sizes meet the specified acceptable quality levels. Because the original analysis
provides an appearance of adulteration, FDA will need greater assurance that the
reconditioned gloves are not adulterated. The importer should consult with the FDA District
Office to obtain the appropriate sampling plan. Only those lots/sizes that are shown to be in
compliance, subject to verification testing by FDA, can be released for distribution in the
U.S.
If nonconforming medical gloves cannot be reconditioned, the medical gloves should be
• re-exported to the country of manufacture or to a country where the gloves would
meet local laws, or
• destroyed, usually via landfill.
DETENTION
Detention
Detention is the action that FDA takes against imported medical devices that do not comply
with the laws that FDA administers (21 CFR 800.55)). FDA may detain imported medical
devices whenever physical examination or testing of a medical device, or examination of
medical device labeling and labeling claims by FDA show that the medical device violates
FDA laws. The importer of record may file an appeal requesting an informal hearing. A
presiding FDA officer will affirm or revoke the detention. Detained devices are either
released if brought into compliance or refused entry if not brought into compliance.
Detention Without Physical Examination
Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) is the act by FDA of detaining the entry of
a specified article, usually from a specific supplier, and occasionally from all suppliers from
a specific country, without physical examination or testing. DWPE differs from general
administrative detention in that it is imposed based on the previous violative history of an
imported medical device being offered for entry into the U.S. DWPE does not occur as a
result of a violative analysis or evaluation of the present entry found by FDA. DWPE is an
action used for repeat violations or violators. DWPE essentially places the responsibility for

80

determining quality and compliance with the law upon the U.S. importer or broker, and
indirectly upon the foreign supplier (or sometimes a country). DWPE is generally based on
information regarding the past violative history of the medical device and/or other
information indicating that the medical device may be violative.
DWPE actions are implemented through the issuance of FDA “Import Alerts.” A list of
medical glove related FDA Import Alerts is provided below:
IMPORT ALERTS FOR MEDICAL GLOVES
There are currently several import alerts under which medical gloves are commonly refused
entry. Import alerts provide the reason for the alert and provide information on how to be
removed from the alert:
•

Import Alert #80-04, “Surveillance and Detention without Physical Examination of
Surgeon’s and/or Patient Examination Gloves.”
http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia8004.html
Manufacturers/shippers placed on this alert have had at least one previous failure
of their gloves to pass an FDA analysis. This import alert consists of three
increasingly more stringent levels of detention for manufacturers/shippers who
repeatedly attempt to import adulterated gloves (Recidivist Firms).

•

Import Alert #89-04, “Detention without Physical Examination of Devices that have
not met Device GMPs.”
http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia8904.html
Manufacturers/shippers placed on this alert have had a violative FDA inspection
and are not manufacturing in accordance with Quality System regulation.
Manufacturers may be removed from the alert after an FDA inspection has
verified corrective action.

•

Import Alert #89-08, “Detention without Physical Examination of Class III Medical
Devices Without Approved PMAs/IDEs or Other Devices Not Found Substantially
Equivalent.”
http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia8908.html
Manufacturers/shippers placed on this alert do not have a cleared 510(k) for their
gloves. Manufacturers may have their gloves removed from the alert after they
receive a 510(k) marketing clearance letter for the specific glove type (powdered,
powder-free, vinyl, etc.).

Importers may contact FDA near the port of entry and speak to the import operations staff
regarding their entry. Callers should have their entry numbers available for reference.

VOLUNTARY STANDARDS

INTRODUCTION ............................................................................................................... 85
FDA-RECOGNIZED CONSENSUS STANDARDS ......................................................... 85
OTHER CONSENSUS STANDARDS............................................................................... 86
INTRODUCTION
Conformance with recognized consensus standards can help provide a reasonable assurance
of safety and/or effectiveness for many aspects of medical devices. Conformance to
consensus standards is voluntary and may be used to demonstrate performance or safety of a
device.
FDA-RECOGNIZED CONSENSUS STANDARDS
Conformance with consensus standards will help establish the equivalence of a new glove to
a legally marketed predicate glove in a Premarket Notification 510(k) submission. If a
person elects to use a standard recognized by FDA to meet a premarket submission
requirement (or other requirement under the Act to which such standard is applicable), the
person must provide a declaration of conformity to the FDA that certifies the device is in
conformity with the standard (section 514(c)(1)(B) of the Act (21 USC 360d(c)(1)(B)). At
any time, FDA may request the data or information relied on by the person to make a
declaration of conformity (section 514(c)(3)(B)). A person making a declaration of
conformity must maintain the data and information demonstrating conformity for a period of
two years after the date of the classification or approval of the device by FDA or a period
equal to the expected design life of the device, whichever is longer (514(c)(3)(C)).
The manufacturer should submit the declaration of conformity in the Abbreviated 510(k)
method. Consensus standards may also be used in the Traditional 510(k) method to help
establish equivalence. See FDA guidances “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate
Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications”
(http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html) and “Use of Standards in Substantial
Equivalence Determinations” (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html for
additional information on the use of consensus standards in 510(k) submissions.
Information on FDA’s standard program, including a database of FDA-recognized standards,
can be found on the following website:
CDRH Standards Program
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/stdsprog.html
At this time FDA recognizes the following standards:

OTHER CONSENSUS STANDARDS
In addition to FDA-recognized standards, manufacturers may use other consensus standards.
As discussed earlier, under the Act, only FDA-recognized standards are those for which you
may submit a declaration of conformity in order to meet a premarket requirement; however,
you may find other consensus standards that have not been recognized by FDA useful.
Below is a list of some of the standards applicable to medical gloves.
