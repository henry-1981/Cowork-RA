Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff

Introduction

This guidance document provides recommendations that may help manufacturers comply with
the special controls related to non-clinical performance data for gynecologic and general
laparoscopic power morcellation containment systems (“tissue containment systems”). Tissue
containment systems are used to enable isolation and containment of tissue during a power
morcellation procedure performed following a laparoscopic procedure for the excision of benign
tissue that is not suspected to contain malignancy. These devices are class II (special controls)
and subject to premarket notification (510(k)) requirements. Throughout this guidance, the terms
“FDA,” “the Agency,” “we,” and “us” refer to the Food and Drug Administration and the terms
“you” and “yours” refer to medical device manufacturers.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 1 For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA
guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices.” 2

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
Laparoscopic power morcellators (LPMs) 3 have been associated with the spread of tissue. There
is a risk of spreading unsuspected cancerous tissue beyond the uterus when LPMs are used
during gynecologic surgeries intended to treat benign fibroids. Unsuspected cancerous tissue
may also be spread in the abdomen during use of a LPM during general surgical procedures. This
may have a negative impact on survival. 4 In addition, there is a risk of spreading benign uterine
tissue beyond the uterus that may result in additional surgery due to symptoms such as
abdominal pain and distension which are related to adhesions resulting in response to the
devitalized tissue. 5,6,7 Benign tissue may also be spread in the abdomen during use of a LPM
during surgical procedures, which can lead to abscess or infection. Tissue containment systems
used during laparoscopic power morcellation are intended to isolate and contain tissue that is
considered benign, which may prevent the peritoneal spread of cancerous tissue in cases of an
occult cancer. While a tissue containment system cannot prevent all cases of tissue spread, as
some cases may occur without morcellation or due to manipulation of the tissue before it is
placed into the tissue containment system, it can provide an important mitigation for this risk.
Tissue containment systems should only be used with compatible LPMs that have received FDA
marketing authorization. For more information, refer to the FDA guidance document “Product
Labeling for Laparoscopic Power Morcellators.” 8
A laparoscopic power morcellation containment system, for gynecologic or general use, is a
prescription device consisting of an instrument port and tissue containment method that creates a
working space allowing for direct visualization during a power morcellation procedure following
This guidance uses the term “laparoscopic power morcellators” or “LPMs” in lieu of laparoscopic
electromechanical morcellators. FDA believes this terminology is understood and recognized both by clinicians and
non-clinicians (e.g., American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Special Report: Power Morcellation and
Occult Malignancy in Gynecologic Surgery May 2014, available at: https://www.sgo.org/wpcontent/uploads/2014/04/ACOG_Statement.pdf and Society of Gynecologic Oncology Position Statement:

a laparoscopic procedure for the excision of benign tissue that is not suspected to contain
malignancy. FDA classified both laparoscopic power morcellation containment systems for
gynecologic and general uses into class II (special controls), subject to 510(k) requirements,
under section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). FDA
determined the special controls that are necessary, in conjunction with the general controls of the
FD&C Act, to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for these devices. The
special controls for laparoscopic power morcellation containment systems for gynecologic and
general use are codified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b), respectively.
This guidance recommends non-clinical test methods that may help manufacturers meet the nonclinical performance data requirements identified in the special controls codified in 21 CFR
884.4050(b)(4) (for gynecologic use) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4) (for general use), and also
includes other non-clinical testing recommendations to support a 510(k) submission/substantial
equivalence determination. The recommendations in this guidance are based on FDA’s
experience evaluating the safety and effectiveness of tissue containment systems. However,
manufacturers may use alternative approaches and provide different documentation so long as
their approach and documentation satisfy premarket submission requirements in applicable
statutory provisions and regulations.
For more information about the specific content requirements of and recommendations for a
510(k) submission, refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and FDA’s guidance document, “Format for
Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s.” 9

III. Scope
The scope of this guidance document is limited to the tissue containment systems used during a
power morcellation procedure for gynecologic use (product code PMU) classified under 21 CFR
884.4050 and for general use (product code PZQ) classified under 21 CFR 878.4825.
The guidance document provides recommendations on (1) test methods, (2) test parameters, and
(3) test acceptance criteria to support a 510(k) submission/substantial equivalence determination
and demonstrate compliance with the special controls requiring non-clinical performance data
identified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4):
21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) states (for gynecologic use):
Non-clinical performance data must demonstrate that the device meets all design
specifications and performance requirements. The following performance characteristics
must be tested:
(i) Demonstration of the device impermeability to tissue, cells, and fluids;

(ii) Demonstration that the device allows for the insertion and withdrawal of
laparoscopic instruments while maintaining pneumoperitoneum;
(iii) Demonstration that the containment system provides adequate space to perform
morcellation and adequate visualization of the laparoscopic instruments and tissue
specimen relative to the external viscera;
(iv) Demonstration that intended laparoscopic instruments and morcellators do not
compromise the integrity of the containment system; and
(v) Demonstration that intended users can adequately deploy the device, morcellate a
specimen without compromising the integrity of the device, and remove the device
without spillage of contents.
21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4) states (for general use):
Non-clinical performance data must demonstrate that the device performs as intended under
anticipated conditions of use. The following performance characteristics must be tested:
(i) Demonstration of the device impermeability to tissue, cells, and fluids;
(ii) Demonstration that the device allows for the insertion/withdrawal of laparoscopic
instruments while maintaining pneumoperitoneum;
(iii) Demonstration that the containment system provides adequate space to perform
morcellation and adequate visualization of the laparoscopic instruments and tissue
specimen relative to the external viscera;
(iv) Demonstration that compatible laparoscopic instruments and morcellators do not
compromise the integrity of the containment system; and
(v) Demonstration that users can adequately deploy the device, morcellate a specimen
without compromising the integrity of the device, and remove the device without spillage
of contents.
This guidance document is focused on non-clinical performance testing. Note that additional
information, such as clinical data, may be needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence.

IV. 510(k) Submission Recommendations
The sections below provide recommendations on how to comply with the special controls
requiring non-clinical performance data codified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) and 21 CFR
878.4825(b)(4), and describe what information is recommended for submission to FDA in a
510(k) to demonstrate that the special controls have been met. In addition to compliance with
special controls requiring non-clinical performance data, manufacturers must comply with all of
the other special controls identified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b) and should
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
include information to demonstrate that these special controls have been met in a 510(k)
submission for a tissue containment system. The other special controls relate to biocompatibility,
sterility, shelf life, training, and labeling, which includes a boxed warning. Manufacturers are
also expected to meet applicable 510(k) requirements. 10 The sections below also provide
recommendations for other non-clinical testing to support a 510(k) submission/substantial
equivalence determination. Please note that where the guidance references final, finished device
testing, this testing should be conducted on the tissue containment system that includes all
manufacturing processes for the “to-be-marketed” tissue containment system including
sterilization.

Device Description and Predicate Comparison
The device description in the 510(k) submission should include a labeled diagram for each model
included in the submission. The device description should include:
•
•
•
•

A description of the overall device system including accessories, pictures, samples (if
practical), and engineering diagrams;
A description of the principle of operation accompanied by labeled diagrams, as
applicable, to show the insertion, deployment and removal steps;
Specifications for the system overall as well as individual components; and
A description of the compatible LPMs.

510(k) submissions include a comparison of the new device to a legally marketed device,
commonly referred to as the “predicate” device. FDA recommends that all comparisons be
provided in a manner that is clear and comprehensible, such as in tabular form that lists the
similarities and differences between the new and predicate device. For more information, refer to
the FDA guidance “Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s: Guidance for Industry and
FDA Staff.” 11
In addition to the non-clinical performance testing required by the special controls, differences in
technological characteristics between the new and predicate devices may necessitate additional
testing to demonstrate substantial equivalence. For input on additional testing to support a
510(k), we recommend that you seek FDA’s feedback through the Q-Submission process. For
more information, see the FDA guidance document “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for
Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.” 12

a. Final Finished Tissue Containment System Testing
This section provides recommendations on test methods for evaluating the mechanical strength
and integrity of the final finished tissue containment system. For the purposes of this testing, we
recommend the use of samples at the end of their proposed shelf life as this is the least
burdensome approach to addressing the requirements identified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) and
21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4) as well as the requirements identified in 21 CFR 884.4050(b)(3) and 21
CFR 878.4825(b)(3) for demonstrating device functionality over the intended shelf life. Note that
samples can either undergo accelerated or real time aging. If there are multiple device sizes, you
should incorporate test samples that are representative of all sizes which could be assessed using
the worst-case size sample(s). You should provide a justification for the choice of worst-case
size sample(s) in your submission. In addition, each test should include a statistically significant
sample size to provide confidence that the results are representative of the final finished device.
i.

Final Finished Tissue Containment System Integrity Testing

Significance: During the surgical procedure, the integrity of the tissue containment system could
be compromised due to contact with surgical instruments, including the power morcellator,
and/or due to use issues. The tissue containment system could also be leak prone without any
direct contact with instruments for reasons such as design and manufacturing issues. An
evaluation of the integrity of the tissue containment system following power morcellation with a
leakage test is recommended to demonstrate the robustness of the device to withstand the
intended clinical use. Therefore, it is important to demonstrate device system integrity postmorcellation.
Recommendations: We recommend conducting microbial leakage testing that incorporates the
following:
•
•
•

•
•
•

Samples should include the final finished tissue containment system post-clinical
simulation study. (See Section IV.B(1)(a)(iv) below.)
The entire device (including seams) should be used to demonstrate that the device is
capable of retaining all of the patient’s cells/fluids during the morcellation procedure.
If there are multiple device models made of the same material and you are using the same
sealing method (if applicable), in lieu of testing each device model, you should conduct
testing on a worst-case sample (e.g., the bag with the largest surface area). You should
provide adequate justification for the worst-case sample in your submission.
A quantitative method should be used to test for the presence of leaks and/or the size of
the leaks.
You should ensure the device is subjected to worst-case quantitative testing during
leakage testing. You should consider the worst-case conditions for duration of testing
consistent with the device labeling and clinically relevant pressure.
You should ensure that during the leakage testing, the bag is sufficiently filled to
adequately distend the bag and prevent any folds or creases from forming in the bag,
which in turn may prevent a hole in the bag from being detected. You should provide
adequate justification for the volume used to fill the bag.
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Validation of the detection limit of your assay and justification as to how it is sufficiently
sensitive to detect the passage of a single cancer cell should be provided. You should
ensure that the acceptance criteria of the assay are sufficiently sensitive to detect a single
cancer cell crossing the device barrier.
• Validation data that evaluates the ability of your test method to detect leaks using tissue
containment systems with known hole sizes in a volume similar to the tissue containment
system test volume should be provided. You should use positive and negative controls for
leakage tests to help verify the sensitivity of the test protocol.
• While performing leakage testing, you should pressurize the inside of the bag with the
worst-case pressure expected during the surgical procedure for the following scenarios,
including a safety factor, and should include an adequate description for:
• When the hole size is greater than the size of cancer cells and the ability of the
cancer cells to permeate through the holes depends on the pressure differential
across the barrier. Under clinically relevant pressures, the contents (i.e., tissue,
cells, including blood and cancer cells, and fluids) could leak outside the tissue
containment system.
• When the surgical instruments, while damaging the tissue containment system,
may create a flap instead of a complete opening. Under clinically relevant
pressures, the flap might open and leak the contents outside the tissue
containment system. Consequently, if the pressure applied during the leakage
testing is lower than the clinically relevant pressure levels, the tissue containment
system might “pass” the leakage test (because the differential pressure is low or
the flap is closed without tissue containment system pressure) even though cancer
cells would have leaked out of the tissue containment system under appropriate
pressure conditions. You should use clinically relevant pressure for leakage
testing and provide appropriate justification for the chosen pressure.
• After the clinical simulation study, but prior to conducting the microbial leakage testing,
the test samples should be subjected to cleaning and/or sterilization. You should describe
and justify these processes and ensure that any residuals from cleaning and sterilization
processes are effectively removed or neutralized. You should validate the neutralization
step to demonstrate that the results have not been confounded by cleaning and/or
sterilization residuals. As part of the consideration of worst-case conditions, you should
choose a microbial species size that is significantly smaller than cancer cells (e.g.,
Brevundimonas diminuta) and a large microbial concentration (i.e., >106-107 CFU/mL)
and you should immerse the entire device in the growth media.
• To ensure that the acceptance criteria of the assay is sufficiently sensitive to detect a
single cancer cell crossing the device barrier, you should perform filtration of the entire
volume of fluid.
• If you choose to conduct an alternate test to the microbial method, you should evaluate
the entire bag surface for leaks and provide validation of the detection limit of your assay.
If applicable, provide a justification/rationale for not testing leaks on certain areas of the
tissue containment system.
•

ii. Final Finished Tissue Containment System Strength Testing
(a)

Tissue Containment System Pull Force Test
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Significance: Tissue containment devices are generally subjected to tensile loads during
laparoscopic surgery (e.g., during insertion and removal of the tissue containment system). An
evaluation of the tensile strength of the tissue containment system as a final finished device is
important to ensure that when used as intended, the device can withstand clinical forces during
insertion and removal and not fail.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct a pull force test on the tissue containment
system that incorporates the following:
•

•

•
•

•

Samples of final finished tissue containment system at the end of their proposed shelf life
should be used for testing. The test samples do not need to be preconditioned (i.e.,
subjected to clinical simulation) before testing. Note that either accelerated aged or real
time aged samples can be used.
You should perform the pull test in a test fixture that mimics the clinical use conditions.
The following are general recommendations for the test fixture. You should:
• Ensure that the spatial and physical properties of the test fixture mimic the
abdominal wall.
• Create the smallest possible incision (or cavity) as per the instructions for use for
your device. You should include a specific wound retractor or other accessories
intended to be used with the tissue containment system in the test setup.
• Include a tissue specimen that represents the worst-case scenario with respect to
shape, size, and weight of tissue relative to the incision size. See also Section
IV.B(1)(a)(iv) for additional considerations for the tissue specimen.
To measure the applied force, you should use either a hand-held force gauge or a tensile
testing machine attached to the part(s) of the tissue containment system that is intended to
help pull the tissue containment system out of the abdominal cavity.
For a tissue containment system with multiple openings, you should pull and measure the
forces for all the openings. If applicable, you should provide a justification/rationale for
omitting pull testing and measuring the forces on certain openings of the tissue
containment system.
The measured forces to the pre-defined acceptance criteria should be compared.
(b)

Tissue Containment System Burst Strength Test

Significance: It is important to evaluate the burst strength of the tissue containment system as a
final finished device, since the tissue containment system may be made of various components
such as straps, tethers, and opening rings attached to the tissue containment system. An
evaluation of the burst strength of the tissue containment system as a final finished device is
important to ensure that when used as intended, the device can withstand clinical forces during
use and not fail.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct a burst strength test that incorporates the
following:

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

•
•

Samples of final finished tissue containment system at the end of their proposed shelf life
should be used for testing. The test samples do not need to be preconditioned (i.e.,
subjected to clinical simulation) before testing. Note that either accelerated aged or real
time aged samples can be used.
You should test the device specimens to failure and compare the measured pressure-tofailure to the pre-defined acceptance criteria.
You should provide the following results and analyses from the burst testing 14 in your
submission:
• Pressure-time curve;
• Burst pressure (i.e., the maximum pressure prior to failure);
• Factor of safety, which compares the burst pressure to radial forces imparted on
the device during the surgical procedure (e.g., insufflation pressure, external
pressure of the tissue from the abdomen); and
• Failure locations, if any, based on the tissue containment system design and
composition.
iii. Insufflation Pressure Control Testing

Significance: Insertion and withdrawal of laparoscopic instruments into the tissue containment
system should not significantly impact the ability to maintain insufflation within the tissue
containment system. Inability to maintain the insufflation pressure could cause the power
morcellator and/or other surgical instruments to contact and damage the tissue containment
system. Any damage to the tissue containment system may cause leakage of its contents.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct insufflation pressure control testing that
incorporates the following:
•

•

•

Samples of final finished tissue containment system at the end of their proposed shelf life
should be used for testing. The test samples do not need to be preconditioned (i.e.,
subjected to clinical simulation) before testing. Note that either accelerated aged or real
time aged samples can be used.
In order to ensure adequate distension within the tissue containment system, you should
perform tests to examine the limits of insufflation pressure losses during laparoscopic
instrument insertion/removal that would still ensure that there is adequate space within
the tissue containment system for surgical instruments. You should test devices to ensure
that they are within the acceptance criteria.
For devices that include valves as part of the design, you should conduct testing on the
component that includes the valve(s). For devices that rely on passage through an
accessory that includes the valve(s), you should conduct testing on the complete device
usage set-up.

iv. Clinical Simulation Study
Significance: The clinical simulation study is important to evaluate the ability of the tissue
containment system to maintain its structural integrity and impermeability when users perform
power morcellation of resected tissue. Inability to use the tissue containment system
appropriately could cause damage to the tissue containment system while operating the power
morcellator and other surgical instruments. Any damage to the tissue containment system may
cause leakage of bag contents.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct a clinical simulation study that incorporates the
following:
Study Design Recommendations
• You should describe the scope of the study and the list of pass/fail criteria.
• While choosing the people who will use the device during the study, you should consider
the clinical specialties associated with the intended use of the device and select people
with varying levels of surgical experience with different surgical specialties and clinical
settings.
• You should ensure that the test setup reflects the clinical settings where the device may
be used and the intended users, including the surgical team.
• You should ensure that the simulation study design closely mimics clinical use, which
may include a bench model, animal model or cadaver, with an appropriate rationale. For
the chosen model, the test setup should have the following features that are important to
simulate clinical use:
• Mimics the spatial and physical properties of the abdominal wall.
• Simulates the presence of other organs in the abdomen and their relationship with
the morcellator and the tissue containment system.
• Distends the bag to the same level and volume as expected during clinical use.
• Replicates forces encountered by the clinician while inserting the bag, insufflating
the bag, and inserting the instruments into the laparoscopic environment and
while performing the surgery.
• Includes a tissue surrogate that can mimic the weight, dimensions, rigidity,
elasticity, volume, density, and other relevant physical properties of human tissue
that will be subjected to power morcellation. If ex vivo tissue is selected for
simulation, it should mimic the true compliance of the tissue in vivo.
• Provides comparable visibility inside the bag.
• You should use blood or blood analog fluid inside the tissue containment
system to mimic the same level of visibility as expected clinically.
• If ex vivo tissue is used and contains blood, separate use of blood or blood
analog fluid is not needed.
• If your device is intended to also be used for human tissue that may contain stones
(e.g., kidney stones), you should use tissue or tissue surrogate containing stones.
• As part of this simulation, we recommend that you only consider the surgical steps
related to the contained power morcellation and tissue extraction. The initial surgical
steps for organ excision (e.g., hysterectomy, myomectomy, splenectomy, partial
11

hepatectomy, nephrectomy) can be omitted from the study. As mentioned above, the
surrogate tissue can be placed in the abdomen and used for the simulation in lieu of ex
vivo organs/tissue.
Simulation Procedure Recommendations
• You should select the morcellators for testing based on the proposed indications for use.
• All the laparoscopic instruments (e.g., trocars, graspers, tenaculum, insufflator,
laparoscope) intended for use with the tissue containment system should be used.
• Before morcellating the tissue specimen, you should observe and describe if the viscera
and bowel are retracted sufficiently to allow for safe morcellation of the tissue in the
tissue containment system.
• You should track and describe the rate of leakage of CO2 from the tissue containment
system and/or the change in pressure in the device while performing the surgery (see
Section IV.B(1)(a)(iii)). This information is relevant for assessing the ability of the tissue
containment system to maintain a distended state during the procedure and prevent
aerosol spread of cancer cells at tissue extraction sites and within the abdomen. In the
event of loss of working space within the tissue containment system, you should assess
the ability and ease of re-insufflation of the tissue containment system to regain working
space.
• After the procedure, you should:
• Perform a visual assessment of the tissue containment system for tears and
perforations.
• Perform a qualitative leak test, which may include the use of dye to identify leaks.
• Conduct quantitative final finished tissue containment system integrity testing
(see Section IV.B(1)(a)(i)).
• You should include the following information in the test report:
• Morcellator details;
• Incision size;
• Tissue specimen type, size and weight;
• Surgical instruments used;
• Ability of the user to develop and maintain distension of the tissue
containment system;
• Ability of the user to insert and remove surgical instruments;
• Ability of the user to introduce the tissue containment system correctly;
• Ability of the user to place the specimen in the tissue containment system
correctly;
• Ability of the user to morcellate the tissue and maintain visual contact
with the tissue and morcellator;
• Ability of the user to remove the tissue containment system following
morcellation;
• Any additional input received from the users;
• Documentation that the study met all pre-defined acceptance criteria; and
• Detailed description of any protocol deviations and why they are not
expected to impact the outcome of the study.

Additional Testing Recommendations

While not required in the special controls in 21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4),
we recommend that you conduct the following additional tests to aid in demonstrating substantial
equivalence of the new tissue containment system. We recommend that you provide the results
from testing that demonstrate that all device specifications have been met. We recommend that
you consider evaluating the design specifications for individual device components (as discussed
above, for the final finished device, non-clinical performance data must demonstrate that the
device meets all design specifications (21 CFR 884.4050(b)(4) and 21 CFR 878.4825(b)(4)).
For each test method, we recommend that you conduct comparative testing using a predicate
device with similarities in device design and material composition (e.g., homogeneous versus
composite materials) to your device. If you determine that the following tests are not warranted,
such as because these device properties were assessed through other tests, we recommend that
you state this in your submission and provide a rationale.
a. Thickness/Material Composition
Significance: Thickness and material composition are important design parameters as they
impact the physical strength and impermeability of the device. Tests that evaluate thickness and
material composition generally help to ensure that any local defects and irregularities in the
material that may cause decreased strength or increased permeability are identified.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct testing that evaluates the thickness and material
composition that incorporates the following:
•

•
•

You should provide complete information on the methodology used to measure thickness
and identify the total thickness of the tissue containment system material. If the tissue
containment system under consideration is a composite material with multiple layers
(e.g., polymer and fabric material), you should describe the process used to manufacture
the layered-composite.
Measurements of thickness for the different layers (e.g., as averages with standard
deviations), and if applicable, for the entire system should be included.
You should provide details about the material homogeneity of the system. You should
observe and describe the presence of voids or defects in the polymer layer and at the
intersection of polymer and fabric layers for a composite tissue containment system. The
resolution of the measurement technique should be fine enough to delineate the presence
of manufacturing defects such as voids that may be on the order of the size of cancer cells

or smaller. We recommend using imaging techniques such as high resolution optical or
electron microscopy. 16
For homogeneity and void testing, you should consider evaluating material specimens
from multiple locations, including weak spots such as seams and straps.
b. Material Permeability Testing

Manufacturers can elect to conduct initial testing on the containment system material itself as
part of the design development process to ensure that the selected materials, when subjected to
processing, are impermeable to tissue, cells and fluids. This section is intended to provide
recommendations on tissue containment system material permeability testing, if the
manufacturer elects to conduct this test; it does not address the final finished device testing. Final
finished device testing as described in Section IV.B(1)(a) is a recommended method to address
certain special controls identified in Table 1 above.
Significance: If the device material, following manufacturing and additional processing,
including sterilization, is not adequately robust to ensure that the tissue containment system is
impermeable to tissues, cells, and fluids, cancerous and non-cancerous blood cells, tissue cells,
and fluids can leak from the tissue containment system into the abdomen.
Recommendations: We recommend conducting material permeability testing that incorporates
the following:
•

•

•
•

You should use an appropriate marker for material permeability testing (e.g., viral or
bacteriophage marker) and provide a detailed methodology for the testing similar to the
American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) F1671/F1671M-13 standard. 17 You
should consider the worst-case scenario for the surrogate marker by using a marker size
less than or equal to the size of cancer cells.
If you are considering an alternative to the microbial leak testing methodology described
in ASTM F1671/F1671M-13, you should provide validation of the detection limit of your
assay and the justification as to how it is sufficiently sensitive to detect the passage of a
single cancer cell. The method of leakage detection should be sensitive enough to detect
the tissue containment system material without and with defects (e.g., defects could be
holes that are smaller than cancer cells). In addition to leakage testing of the tissue
containment system material under consideration, you should include positive and
negative controls for leakage tests to verify the sensitivity of the test protocol.
If you are conducting microbial leakage testing, you should provide evidence that the
method is sensitive enough to identify holes smaller than cancer cells.
While performing any type of leakage testing, you should challenge the tissue
containment system material to pressures that are clinically relevant as these devices are

subjected to insufflation and additional localized pressures during the power morcellation
procedure. 18 You should test the material to a pressure above the insufflation pressure
using a safety factor, 19 and should provide a detailed scientific rationale for the
designated safety factor.
It is important to evaluate the material permeability of critical sections of the tissue containment
system such as straps, tethers, and opening rings that are bonded/attached since these sections
undergo additional processing steps that may impact material permeability. You should provide a
detailed justification for the selection of both tested and untested sections of the device.
c. Mechanical Strength
The tests recommended in this section are intended to evaluate the mechanical strength of the
tissue containment system material. They do not address the final finished device testing.
Manufacturers should refer to Section IV.B(1)(a)(ii) above for FDA’s recommendations on
mechanical strength testing of the final finished device.
It is important to evaluate the mechanical strength of critical sections of the tissue containment
system such as straps, tethers, and opening rings that are bonded/attached since these sections
undergo additional processing steps that may impact mechanical strength. You should provide a
detailed justification for the selection of both tested and untested sections of the device.
The following are general recommendations for mechanical strength characterization testing:
•

•

When establishing the acceptance criteria, you should consider the forces applied to the
tissue containment system during clinical use and include a safety factor by comparing
the clinical forces to force-to-failure. We recommend that you provide a rationale for
each acceptance criterion.
We recommend that you test the specimens to failure or provide a justification for the test
endpoint (e.g., choosing the maximum test withstand pressure/force in a pull test).
i. Tensile Strength Testing

Significance: Similar to the concerns associated with evaluating the tensile strength of the final,
finished tissue containment system, as described in Section IV.B(1)(a)(ii)(a), if the device
material does not have enough mechanical strength to withstand these loads, the device may fail
and result in leakage of the device contents.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct tensile testing and describe the results and
analyses from the tensile testing by including the following information:

Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and its comparison to the tensile forces imparted
on the device during a worst-case surgical scenario;
Elongation or strain at break;
Toughness; and
Failure locations, if any, based on device design and composition.
ii. Puncture Testing

Significance: The tissue containment system may be subjected to puncture forces from surgical
instruments (e.g., graspers). It is critical for the device material to be able to withstand these
forces without resulting in leakage.
Recommendations: We recommend you conduct puncture testing that incorporates the following:
•
•
•

You should use surgical instruments (e.g., graspers and trocars) that are typically used in
the clinical procedure. You should test worst-case scenario(s) in terms of instrument
sharpness and contact area.
You should apply the load to the side of the device that is in contact with the instrument.
For composite tissue containment system with multiple layers, the force at which the tip
of the instrument pierces all the layers is considered the puncture force.
The following results and analyses from puncture testing should be provided:
• Instrument force-displacement curve;
• Puncture force; and
• Safety factor analysis, comparing the measured puncture force to forces imparted
on the device during the surgical procedure.
iii. Partial Puncture Followed by Material Permeability Testing

Significance: For a composite tissue containment system, surgical instruments could damage one
of the layers while leaving the other layers intact. For example, the layer that offers leak
resistance could be damaged while the other layers remain intact. 20 The force at which a layer of
the tissue containment system is damaged and causes leakage of the contents from inside is
referred to as the partial puncture force. A combination of instrument puncture testing followed
by leakage testing helps estimate the partial puncture force.
Recommendations: The test methodology for this test is similar to puncture testing and material
permeability testing discussed in Sections IV.B(2)(c)(ii) and IV.B(2)(b) above, respectively. We
recommend you conduct insufflation pressure control testing that incorporates the following:
•

You should use information from the puncture testing (in Section IV.B(2)(c)(ii) above) to
determine the range of applied forces for partial puncture. For a composite tissue

containment system, the puncture forces used to partially puncture the device and to
cause leakage can be much lower than the complete puncture forces.
Force should be applied the same way as for puncture testing (with the applied force less
than puncture force) followed by leakage testing with dye for detection. Alternatively, a
microbial leakage test may also be used for confidence and robustness in the leakage
detection study. After partial puncture testing, you should perform material permeability
testing (similar to Section IV.B(2)(b) above) with a predetermined pressure of 2 psi. 21
Alternatively, you should provide a justification for using a different pressure for leakage
testing.
You should use surgical instruments that are typically used in the clinical procedure. You
should consider testing a worst-case scenario in terms of instrument sharpness, contact
area, and probability of contact with the tissue containment system during use.
You should apply the partial load to the side of the tissue containment system that is in
contact with the instrument. Information from the puncture testing can be used to
determine the range of partial loads that can be imparted on the device and you should
include this information in your submission.
The following results from the partial puncture and leakage testing should be provided:
• Partial puncture force-displacement curve;
• Partial puncture force that created enough damage to the device to cause leakage
during leakage testing; and
• Failure locations with respect to puncture and leakage, if any, based on device
design and composition.
