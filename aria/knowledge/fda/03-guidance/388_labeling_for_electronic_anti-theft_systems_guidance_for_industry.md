Guidance1 on Labeling for Electronic
Anti-Theft Systems
August 15, 2000

Dear Electronic Anti-Theft System Manufacturer,

The purpose of this letter is to recommend that all manufacturers of electronic anti-theft systems
develop labeling or signage to post on or near all new and currently installed systems, indicating that
an electronic anti-theft system is in use. Such labeling or signage will permit implant wearers to
avoid lingering around or leaning against systems that may affect their implanted electronic medical
devices.

Interference concerns
Implantable electronic medical devices may be affected by the electromagnetic radiation produced
by electronic anti-theft systems. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 63 reports
over the past 10 years describing electromagnetic interference (EMI) to implantable devices caused
by various types of anti-theft systems. Of the 63 reported incidents, 49 were caused either by antitheft systems, electronic article surveillance (EAS) systems, or security systems. The affected
devices in these reports included pacemakers, neurological stimulators, and implantable cardioverter
defibrillators. Examples of the reported effects on the device included changes in the rate of
stimulation (e.g., increase of pacing rate), changes in the level of stimulation (e.g., neurological over
or under stimulation), and changes in the mode of stimulation (e.g., reprogramming). Examples of
reported effects on the implant wearer range from unconsciousness and sensation of pain, to
wearers being unaware that an interaction occurred. These effects on the implant and the wearer
are typically transient and unlikely to cause clinically significant symptoms in most wearers.
Collaborative efforts
At the 1998 and 1999 meetings of the Technical Electronic Products Radiation Safety Standards
Committee (TEPRSSC), local and federal government agencies, the anti-theft industry, and the
medical community came together to address this issue in a public forum. The TEPRSSC urged
each of the stakeholders in this issue to work together, research the

problem, and identify solutions to reduce the risk of EMI to implantable electronic medical devices.
The FDA sent a letter in 1998 containing important information for doctors and patients on the issue
of anti-theft system interference with implantable devices. That letter affirmed recommendations
made by the anti-theft system industry and medical community that implant wearers should practice
“don’t linger, don’t lean” around electronic anti-theft systems. The FDA applauds the collaborative
efforts put forth by the anti-theft industry and the medical community over the past two years to
mitigate anti-theft system interference with implantable devices. More importantly, the FDA
encourages your continued cooperation toward this effort.

Recommendations
The FDA recognizes that the likelihood of anti-theft systems interfering with implantable electronic
medical devices is low. The number of adverse event reports indicates that a relatively small
number of individuals have been affected within a large population of implant wearers. Further, the
reports describe a majority of the interactions as moderate or mild in nature, with little or no
significant effect on the implant wearers.
In light of advances in implantable electronic device technology and increasing numbers of implant
wearers, the FDA believes that implant wearers should be notified whenever and wherever
electronic anti-theft systems are in use. The FDA recommends that anti-theft system manufacturers
develop either labeling or signage that can be posted on or near new and installed anti-theft
equipment to further reduce the risk of interference.
Examples of appropriate language for such labeling and signage may include: “ELECTRONIC
ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM IN USE” or “ELECTRONIC SECURITY SYSTEM IN USE.”
Anti-theft systems employing visible monitoring elements (e.g., towers) may simply have a label
affixed to the surface of the element. Signage may be posted for systems employing either visible or
concealed (e.g., installed in the walls or ceiling) monitoring elements. In either case, the FDA
recommends that labeling or signage be positioned so that it is visible before an individual enters the
monitored area. FDA also recommends that you include labeling and signage with all new
equipment in addition to the signage provided to facilities wherever anti-theft systems are currently
installed.
It is important that manufacturers of anti-theft systems, the retail industry, and the medical
community continue to develop mutually agreeable solutions to this issue. The use of labeling or
signage on electronic anti-theft systems will enable implant wearers to take appropriate precautions
to further minimize the risk of interference, namely to avoid

lingering around or leaning on such systems. The labeling or signage may also provide an additional
deterrent against theft while relaying this important information.
