Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A variety of diseases can affect the appearance of nails, including fungal infection. This
guidance is intended to provide recommendations regarding clinical trial design for medical
devices intended either (1) to provide improvement in the appearance of nails affected by
onychomycosis, that is, to affect the structure/function of the nails or (2) to treat onychomycosis
(fungal nail infection). All marketed devices to date have been 510(k)-cleared for visual
improvement, with Indication for Use statements such as “temporary increase of clear nail in
patients with onychomycosis (e.g., dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton
mentagrophytes, and/or yeasts Candida albicans).” 1 Some elements of this guidance will be
primarily applicable to non-ablative energy-based devices, although the basic principles may be
broadly applicable to all devices.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) distinguishes these two conditions as target outcomes.
An indication for the treatment of onychomycosis (an infectious disease) requires proof of stable
1

For brevity, this guidance may use the abbreviated phrases “temporary increase of clear nail” or “temporary
increase in clear nail” to refer to the Indication for Use “temporary increase of clear nail in patients with
onychomycosis (e.g., dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and/or yeasts
Candida albicans, etc.).

elimination of the fungal organism, which is a medical endpoint. This outcome is distinct from
outcomes limited to “temporary increase in clear nail” in nails which are fungally-infected,
which is considered an aesthetic endpoint, and does not necessarily signify successful eradication
of fungal infection, but rather an effect on the structure/function of the nails. The Agency
recognizes that this endpoint may have functional benefits as well, which may be of some value
to the patient if the improvement in appearance or function is clinically significant and if the
benefits outweigh potential risks of the treatment. Nonetheless, claims related to appearance
remain distinct from claims of eliminating fungal infection.
This guidance addresses patient populations in the United States as the intended demographic for
intervention. The recommendations regarding clinical trial design may be applicable for any
medical device type that is intended for temporary increase of clear nail or to treat
onychomycosis (fungal nail infection). These recommendations would apply to clinical
performance data submitted in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions, Evaluation of
Automatic Class III Designations (de novo submissions), and Premarket Approval (PMA)
applications, as well as for Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs). 2
The need for clinical performance data will be dependent on the design and use of the device. 3
Sponsors are encouraged to discuss this with the agency. In addition, we recommend that you
contact the Agency through the pre-submission process prior to starting any clinical study for
these nail indications. For information on the pre-submission process see FDA’s guidance
“Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and
Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM311176.pdf).
This guidance is not intended to replace the policies described in other guidance documents. In
cases where questions arise, consult the appropriate FDA review division directly or the Center
for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Division of Industry and Consumer Assistance
(DICE).
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2

Currently marketed devices indicated for temporary increase in clear nail have been cleared through the 510(k)
pathway. As such, this guidance refers to “clearances” and “devices cleared.” However, wherever such
terminology is used in this document, the recommendations and considerations may apply to all premarket
submission types (e.g., PMA, de novo).

One example of a device type that has been cleared for the indication of “temporary increase in clear nail” is lightbased devices. Refer to the Appendix for an example of the information that FDA recommends be submitted in a
regulatory application for this device class.

II.

BACKGROUND

Nail dystrophy is commonly due to fungal infection (onychomycosis), but approximately 40% of
nails which appear abnormal may be due to other clinical conditions. 4 A wide variety of
disorders, including inflammatory, metabolic, genetic, and non-fungal infectious diseases, as
well as physical trauma to the nail, can create abnormal nail structures. These changes, which
include separation of the distal nail from the nail bed, nail thickening, and color changes within
the nail, can be visually indistinguishable from onychomycosis. 5 However, it cannot be assumed
that treatments that alter the appearance of nails are necessarily effective in eliminating
onychomycosis. Conversely, it cannot be assumed that treatments that are effective in treating
onychomycosis would necessarily alter the appearance of nails, if the abnormal nail growth or
appearance (dystrophy) were caused by a condition other than onychomycosis. It is therefore
important to distinguish the indications of “temporary increase of clear nail in patients with
onychomycosis” and “treatment of onychomycosis,” so as to differentiate the treatment goals.
This guidance is intended to provide information related to both indications, when the device is
applied to nails with confirmed fungal infection. The considerations in this guidance may not be
equally applicable to nails whose appearance is altered by non-fungal causes. Therefore, prior to
pursuing treatment of abnormally structured or dystrophic nails, it is critical to diagnose the
underlying cause, and to base treatment decisions on proven therapies for the identified cause.
Temporary increase of clear nail
Historically, devices have been cleared with the Indications for Use (IFU) of “temporary increase
of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis (e.g., dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and/or
yeasts Candida albicans, etc.).” This indication has been used to highlight that the outcomes for
which the device has provided support are limited to visual improvement, an aesthetic endpoint,
and not for mycological cure, which would constitute a medical endpoint. Several aspects of this
IFU are noteworthy:
1) This IFU is not intended to mean that the treatment eliminates fungal infection. It does,
however, convey that clinical studies performed in support of the IFU included nails with
confirmed fungal infection.
2) The devices have primarily been assessed for their effectiveness in nails infected with the
common fungal organisms; the effectiveness may not be comparable in nails infected
with rare species.
3) As stated above, this indication should not be assumed to demonstrate effectiveness in
other causes of nail dystrophy. Therefore dystrophic nails should be confirmed as
fungally-infected prior to initiation of clinical trials or treatments that employ devices
cleared with this IFU.

4) Finally, we recognize that some patients seek total clearing of their nails rather than
partial clearance and this expectation should be clarified. Labeling and promotional
materials should provide a transparent portrayal of representative results that were
achieved in the clinical trials, both in terms of the extent of nail clearance and the
timeline of effect.
Treatment of onychomycosis
In contrast to treatments for increase in clear nail, treatments aimed at treating a fungal infection
require evidence of an antifungal effect. Specifically, devices marketed with an indication of
treating fungal infections of the nail are expected to provide evidence that the fungal infection in
the nail has been eliminated. For treatment of toenail fungal infection, this indication, in most
cases, will be supported by evidence of visual improvement in conjunction with negative fungal
cultures and stains.
Fungal species: geographic and demographic considerations
Clinical studies performed outside the United States may not be applicable to the U.S. population
due to different prevailing fungal organisms that may affect the nails. Therefore, studies
performed in the U.S. are recommended. Data from clinical studies performed outside the U.S.
should include a comprehensive analysis of all fungal species detected in the nails of the
population screened for enrollment in the clinical study, and the analysis reveals a similar
spectrum and distribution of fungal species.
Special populations, including individuals with certain chronic diseases, occupational risks, or
immune compromise, may have different or additional organisms in the nail, and the
effectiveness demonstrated in clinical studies performed in healthy adults may not be sufficiently
informative about these populations.
Although indications for use statements in prior clearances have included Candida as an example
of an organism that may have been present during treatment, Candida is not a toenail pathogen in
healthy individuals and is involved in only approximately half of fingernail infections. 6 Since it
is recommended that non-healthy individuals be excluded from clinical studies for these
indications, Candida should not be assessed in clinical studies of toenails for the indication of
temporary increase in clear nail or of treatment of onychomycosis. An Indication for Use
addressing Candida may be considered with specially designed studies assessing the
performance of the device in nails infected with Candida species. Future marketing application
labeling should reflect this information.
Care and re-use of devices which contact fungally-infected nails
Devices intended for use on infected tissue should be evaluated for design and labeling as
described in FDA’s guidance “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings:
Validation Methods and Labeling”

III.

TEMPORARY INCREASE IN CLEAR NAIL
A. Regulatory considerations
1. Defining “temporary increase in clear nail”

Normal appearance of nails is the goal for appearance improvement. Historically, for medical
devices, FDA has allowed less than fully clear nails as acceptable for a primary endpoint.
Although the assessment method for clear nail varied, several medical devices have received
510(k) clearance on the premise that they improve the appearance of nails by an increase in clear
nail, observed clinically. These devices have demonstrated that this improvement is maintained
or increased when assessed at two timepoints (e.g., 3 months and 6 months) after the last
treatment, to reflect growth of clear nail. All studies were performed on toenails, primarily the
first toenail. 7
By way of comparison, pivotal studies performed in support of oral antifungal treatments have
shown that the mean time to overall success is 10 months in toenails and 4 months in
fingernails. 8 These studies employed multiple endpoints, including complete visual clearance, or
for partial responders at least 5 mm increase in clear nail at 36 weeks (9 months) after
completion of treatment of the toenails and at 18 weeks after completion of treatment of the
fingernails.
Nails which are structurally abnormal can only clear by outgrowth of the dystrophic component
and replacement by newly-created, normal-appearing nail. The mean growth rate for nails in
healthy U.S. adults is 1.5 mm per month for toenails and 3-3.5 mm per month for fingernails. 9
Based on this mean growth rate, the ideal effective treatment would be expected to yield a fully
replaced, clear fingernail in a healthy adult after approximately 6 months and a fully replaced,
clear great toenail approximately 12 months after the initiation of treatment. However, given the
length of time after the initiation of treatment, it is possible that the nail would be re-infected
during this time, in the absence of ongoing treatment.
2. Combining treatment with antifungal drugs or debridement
Historically, device studies have allowed concomitant debridement and/or use of topical or
systemic antifungal drug products, aimed at treating the nails or the skin. The combination of
debridement and/or antifungal drug therapy confounds the interpretation of the study results in
determining the relative contribution of the device to the clinical outcome.

adults. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology, 2010; 24(4): 420-23.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

The Agency will continue to consider submission of clinical performance data evaluating the
device with adjunctive interventions, with the exception of oral antifungal drugs. The use of oral
drugs will likely confound any device results observed, and as a result, FDA does not believe
such data should be used to support a substantial equivalence determination. If topical products
(not systemic) are used which can have antifungal activity, they should be administered
according to standard of care dosing and route of administration.
For truthful and transparent labeling, the Agency recommends that the device labeling reflect any
adjunctive treatment in the Indications and Usage statement. Recommended wording for a
device whose clinical trials were performed with topical antifungals and/or debridement, for
example, would be:
“Indicated for adjunctive use in the temporary increase in clear nail in patients
with onychomycosis (e.g., dermatophytes - Trichophyton rubrum and
Trichophyton mentagrophytes). This device should be used with manual
debridement and/or topical antifungal products, administered according to
standard of care dosing and route of administration, whose use may need to be
continued after completion of device treatment course, as stand-alone
effectiveness of this device for this indication has not been demonstrated;”
or
“Indicated for the temporary increase in clear nail in patients with onychomycosis
(e.g., dermatophytes - Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes)
only when used together with topical antifungalproducts, administered according
to standard of care dosing and route of administration for treating accompanying
tinea pedis and/or onychomycosis.”
For transparency, FDA recommends that the patient and practitioner labeling disclose that the
device has been assessed as an adjunct to drug therapy or other intervention.
3. Differentiating aesthetic indications from medical indications
Devices cleared for improvement in the appearance of nails, or an increase in clear nail, could be
misconstrued to be intended to treat onychomycosis. To prevent misinterpretation, FDA
recommends that the labeling for these devices contain clarifying language, to include:
“This device has not demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of fungal
infections. It is cleared only for improvement in nail appearance.”
4. Special populations
The distinction between aesthetic improvement of the nail and elimination of a fungal infection
is of particular clinical relevance for vulnerable populations, who require definitive antifungal
treatment, and who may remain at ongoing medical risk by postponing definitive treatment. To
protect these populations, the labeling should include the following statement:
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

“Warning: These devices should be used with caution in patients with diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, or immune-suppression, or with any other medical
state which warrants definitive antifungal therapy.”
Devices that have not been studied in such populations should receive a similar warning.
B. Clinical trial considerations
The claim of temporary improvement in clear nails is an aesthetic one, but treatments will be
performed in nails that are infected with a fungus. Therefore, although the claim is aesthetic,
clinical trial design should take into account the medical implications of the proposed protocol.
1. Special populations
Ethical design of clinical studies mandates that risk to special populations be minimized. Special
populations may be considered particularly vulnerable and may not be appropriate subjects for
clinical studies assessing temporary increase in clear nail. For example, patients with diabetes
mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, recurrent cellulitis, lymphatic insufficiency, or immune
compromise (whether due to underlying medical disorders or to immunosuppressive treatments),
exhibit an increased risk of bacterial infections. In these patients, the skin breakdown induced by
a fungus may provide a portal for bacterial infections, which consequently pose a significant
health risk. Portals of entry can also be formed at sites of skin breakdown caused by adverse
events in the course of a device-based treatment. Furthermore, nails may appear to have an
increase in clear area but still harbor fungal organisms; this is the distinction between the “clear
nail” indication and an indication of treating onychomycosis. For these reasons, it is
recommended that patients with diabetes, immune suppression, peripheral vascular disease,
lymphatic insufficiency, recurrent cellulitis, or other compromised states of health be excluded
from participating in clinical trials intended to demonstrate improvement in the appearance of
nails.
Sponsors and investigators are urged to design clinical studies which enroll a cross-section of
subjects that reflects the U.S. demographic. This may include variable age, sex, and Fitzpatrick
skin types (if needed).
Treatment with light sources whose wavelength is absorbed by melanin pose increased risk to
individuals with darker skin types. In addition, any modality that can induce injury to skin poses
an increased risk for post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in subjects with darker skin. Since
the pigmentation of both the nails and the surrounding skin may affect response and treatment
tolerance, it is recommended that studies be designed to allow assessment of safety and
effectiveness in the target population. If the nature of the treatment mandates restriction in
Fitzpatrick skin phototypes in the clinical study, this should be reflected in the device labeling.
2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: recommendations
Clinical involvement
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Nails with 100% dystrophy or with involvement of the lunula can be very resistant to treatment
due to permanent damage to the nail matrix (“root”); this may reduce the mean effectiveness
assessed across a group of subjects. 10 Conversely, nails with minimal distal changes may not be
representative of the target populations for this procedure. Therefore, it is recommended that the
study population include nails with at least 25% involvement of the nail area and no more than
75% involvement of the nail area.
Clinical presentations of onychomycosis
There are several clinical forms of onychomycosis, differentiated by their appearance. Some are
appropriate for inclusion in device clinical trials, while others may be less appropriate for
inclusion in clinical studies intended to demonstrate improvement in the appearance of nails.
•

Distal subungual onychomycosis (DSO): This type of onychomycosis is the most
common clinical presentation, in which the distal nail plate is separated from the nail bed.
This infection is visualized as nails with normal surface texture and thickness but variable
“bays” of white nail that extend from the distal nail tip proximally into the area of the nail
bed. This form has been the cornerstone of antifungal drug studies. Since it generally
does not involve the nail matrix, it is more amenable to improvement in clinical
appearance than some other forms.

•

Proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO): PSO is an uncommon form of
onychomycosis that appears as a white discoloration below the nail plate at the base of
the nail, near the lunula. The distal nail retains normal appearance and texture. PSO
involves infection near the matrix, deep to the nail. It may be associated with trauma to
the nail or to immune compromise. Therefore, the clinical presence of PSO may hint at
an underlying medical disorder. In addition, PSO may reflect different species of fungus.
Moreover, obtaining samples for mycology studies prior to enrollment is not possible
without piercing or removing the nail. It is therefore recommended that this form of
onychomycosis not be included in device clinical studies.

•

Superficial white onychomycosis (SWO): This form of onychomycosis is defined by the
appearance of a white coating on the nail surface. This clinical form can be eliminated
by filing or buffing the surface of the affected portion of the nail. Since subjects might
buff or file the nails during the study and confound the results, and since this form does
not generally require any other treatment, SWO is not an ideal clinical form of
onychomycosis for device trials or for post-market treatments.

•

Complete dystrophy: Nails which are 100% dystrophic are manifested by yellowing and
thickening of the entire nail unit. These nails may be difficult to treat due to irreversible
damage to the nail matrix. In such cases even complete eradication of the fungus may
not lead to normal nail growth rate or appearance. Such nails may provide data that is
relevant for subsequent clinical use, but these cases may also be more difficult targets for

treatment. If enrolled, it is recommended that this clinical form of onychomycosis be
evaluated for improvement in appearance separately from other clinical forms, whose
appearance may improve more readily with treatment.
•

Other nail changes: Nail changes that appear as parallel lines, small pinpoint depressions,
brown spots, black or brown linear streaks, complete yellowing of all nails without
textural change, green debris below the nail, or notches in the nail margin may represent
causes of nail dystrophy that are not fungal. It is therefore recommended that all nails be
evaluated by an expert in nail disease prior to enrolling such subjects in device clinical
trials or post-market treatments.

Confirmation of fungal infection underlying nail appearance
To support an Indication for Use of “temporary increase of clear nail in onychomycosis,” it is
appropriate that all enrolled subjects be confirmed to have nails infected by the common fungal
organisms implicated onychomycosis. In the United States, Trichophyton rubrum accounts for
roughly 80% of toenail onychomycosis, with additional infections caused by Trichophyton
mentagrophytes or Epidermophyton floccosum; other observed but less common fungal
infections of the toenails include Candida parapsilosis, and Fusarium species. 11 In fingernail
onychomycosis, Candida albicans accounts for over 50% of cases, with another 25% accounted
for by Trichophyton rubrum; other Candida species comprise most of the remaining cases.10 By
enrolling subjects whose nails have been demonstrated to harbor these organisms, studies are
more likely to generate data that is clinically meaningful. It is recommended that nails infected
by rare fungal species or non-fungal organisms such as mold or bacteria be excluded, as their
data is unlikely to provide information that is widely applicable.
Common methods for identifying the presence and type of fungus present in nails include stains
(e.g. periodic acid Schiff (PAS); silver stains; potassium hydroxide (KOH)) and fungal culture.)
Negative stains, particularly PAS and silver stains, provide convincing evidence that the sampled
portion of the nail is free of fungal organisms. However, while finding fungal organisms within
the nail plate using fungal stains provides convincing evidence of the presence of fungus, it does
not speak to the organism’s viability, and it does not identify the type of fungus. Identification
of the organism and determination of its viability, both of which are critical pre-treatment data,
are accomplished by culture.
The best evidence that a nail is suitable for a clinical study would be a concurrent positive stain
showing septate hyphae and positive culture demonstrating the growth of T. rubrum or other
common dermatophyte. Therefore, it is suggested that prior to enrollment, both a stain and
culture be obtained.
It is known that cultures may yield false negative results. If the stain exhibits septate hyphae but
the culture fails to grow a fungus, the culture may be repeated. If two sequential cultures are
negative, it is recommended that the nail not be included in the study, as the fungus may be
partially treated, fastidious, or otherwise not representative of the target strains. Sponsors may

wish to stain and culture material from two nails from an affected foot or hand in parallel to
expedite this process. The finding of positive stains with negative cultures from two nails would
suggest the subject is not a good candidate for the study.
Co-morbidities
Subjects with psoriasis, lichen planus, or other medical conditions known to induce nail changes
may also have superimposed fungal nail infections. Trauma from ill-fitting shoes, running, or
overly-aggressive nail care can also induce changes visually indistinguishable from
onychomycosis. These causes of nail breakdown can predispose to secondary fungal infection.
However, it cannot be predicted whether treatments aimed at increasing clear nail in patients
with onychomycosis would also improve the appearance of nail changes when those nail changes
are due to an additional causative condition. It is therefore advisable to avoid inclusion of
subjects known to have such medical conditions, as their response may not be indicative of the
effects of the device on nails that are infected by fungus but are otherwise normal.
Prior or ongoing antifungal drug therapy
Systemic antifungal drugs are deposited in the nail substance and remain in the nail until the nail
grows and is trimmed. Based on the known rates of nail growth in healthy adults, it is expected
that nails exposed to even one dose of an antifungal drug may contain the drug for 1 year in the
case of toenails and 6 months in the case of fingernails. Enrollment of subjects who have been
exposed to antifungal drugs in the 12 months prior (in the case of toenails) or 6 months prior (in
the case of fingernails) could confound interpretation of the study data, and it is therefore
recommended that these subjects be excluded from any device study.
Topical antifungal drugs are less effective in providing clinical clearance of onychomycosis.
However, their presence can reduce the sensitivity of fungal cultures, even if applied only to the
skin of the affected hand or foot. It is therefore recommended that a significant washout period
be applied when enrolling patients who have undergone topical treatment of the skin or nails, and
that such treatments be avoided during the clinical trial and follow-up period.
Demographics
It is recommended that the enrollment include adequate US demographic representation of the
intended population with regard to sex, age, ethnicity, race, and skin phototype.
3. Adjunctive therapies
Adjunctive therapies in clinical trials of devices are suboptimal as they may mask the true
performance of the device. Nonetheless, if a clinical trial is designed in which antifungal drug
therapy or other intervention is administered in parallel to the device treatment, the adjunctive
intervention should be consistent across all study subjects, and the full regimen should be
included in the recommended treatment protocol as well as the device labeling. Sponsors might
consider including a control which utilizes only the adjunctive therapy, in order to identify the
incremental benefit provided by the device. For example, studies that include a topical
antifungal product may be able to provide additional data in support of device effectiveness by
performing a contralateral controlled study, in which both feet (or hands) are exposed to the

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

topical antifungal agent, but only one side is exposed to the device treatment. Such a study
design would require special considerations if blinding or placebo were to be incorporated.
It is recommended that debridement not be carried out more proximally than the most proximal
margin of the dystrophic nail, as this can interfere with assessment of clear nail area attributable
to the device intervention. If debridement is used in clinical studies performed in support of a
device, the debridement procedures should be well described in the clinical protocol, used
consistently in study subjects, and included in the recommended treatment protocol as well as the
device labeling.
4. Endpoints
Based on the nail growth rates described in the “regulatory considerations” section above, and to
provide a fair and informative guideline for assessment of the success of a treatment, FDA
recommends the following effectiveness endpoints be used in a study to demonstrate temporary
increase in clear nail. Although these endpoints differ from those historically provided for this
device type for this indication, we believe that the use of data at time points measured after the
first treatment, rather than the last treatment, provides a more clinically relevant result than
assessment of nails after treatment has been discontinued. Further, to address variability in nail
length among different digits, the longest nail (thumb or first toe) is recommended as the target
nail for measurement.
The 95% one-sided confidence interval (i.e., lower bound only) around the observed response
rate as described below should be ≥50%.
Toenails: (based on assessment in the first toe nail)
•

To be defined as a responder, a nail would need to meet one of the following
measurements of clear nail increase:
o at least 6 mm increase in clear nail measured from the proximal nail fold
to the most proximal area of nail dystrophy, with evidence of distal growth
of the affected area, 6 months after the first treatment;
or
o an additional 60 mm2 of clear nail (based on width of the first toenail),
with evidence of outward growth of the affected area, 6 months after the
first treatment;
or
o complete clearance 6 months after the first treatment if less than 6 mm
distal nail was involved prior to treatment.

•

Treatments may be continued, as the clear nail will be measured 6 months after
the initiation of treatment.

•

The response should be progressive in at least 2 sequential timepoints that are at
least 3 months apart, with a projected increase in clear nail of at least 1 mm per
month.
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Fingernails: (based on assessment in the thumb nail)
•

Measurement of clear nail increase:
o at least 12 mm increase in clear nail, with evidence of distal growth of the
affected area, 6 months after the first treatment;
or
o an additional 90 mm2 of clear nail (based on width of the thumb nail), with
evidence of outward growth of the affected area, 6 months after the first
treatment;
or
o complete clearance 6 months after the first treatment if less than 12 mm
distal nail was involved prior to treatment.

•

Treatments may be continued, as the clear nail will be measured 6 months after
the initiation of treatment.

•

The response should be progressive in at least 2 sequential timepoints that are at
least 3 months apart, with a projected increase in clear nail of at least 2 mm per
month.

These recommended endpoints arise from the combined consideration of the expected response
to an effective treatment (in which the majority of nails would respond) with the known slower
nail growth rate in older individuals and in certain disease states. It is anticipated that at least
half the treated nails would show a response within the designated time frame for assessment,
while slower-growing nails would achieve the response later.
FDA may consider alternate endpoints and/or response rates for devices which pose very high or
very low risk. If alternate endpoints are being considered, FDA recommends that you contact
the Agency through the pre-submission process to discuss these endpoints.
Studies performed on fingernails only should only be used to support an IFU in the fingernails.
Studies which include the toenails can be used to support an IFU of all nails.
The indication of “temporary increase in clear nail” is an aesthetic endpoint, and as such study
endpoints will reflect visual improvement in clear nail. A number of methods can be employed
to assess the improvement. In some trials, multiple methods may be employed to offer the most
accurate assessment.
•

Millimeters of clear nail: The simplest method of assessing increase in clear nail is
sequential measurements of the distance from the proximal nail fold to a predefined distal
mark, such as the most proximal edge of the nail change. Effective therapy will allow
normal nail to replace the affected nail as it grows, leading to a progressive increase in
the distance from the proximal nail fold to the most proximal portion of the nail change.
Measurement to the distal margin of the nail is not recommended as nail trimming can
introduce artifact into the measurement. The drawback of this technique is that the nail
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

dystrophy may not form a well-demarcated line, nor will it necessarily be parallel to the
proximal nail margin. Furthermore, such techniques do not account for variable rates of
nail growth. Variations on this method can overcome this limitation. For example, a nail
file can be used to etch a shallow horizontal line parallel to the horizontal portion of the
proximal nail fold; this line would be placed at the most proximal portion of the
dystrophic nail. This line can serve as both a marker for nail growth rate, to confirm the
nail is growing, as well as for marking the most proximal point of the nail dystrophy.
•

Clear nail area (mm2): An increase in the area of the nail that is clear can provide
clinically-meaningful data, and this method overcomes the limitations imposed by
uneven margins of a dystrophic nail segment. This method suffers from more complex
evaluation methods with standardized photography equipment and dedicated software.
Providing that methods can be validated, a measurement of area, presented as millimeters
squared, can yield objective data. Presentation of the same data as percentage is less
desirable, as nail trimming or debridement can artificially increase the percent of the nail
which is clear. Therefore, measurement of clear nail area in square millimeters provides
a more reliable, stand-alone objective measurement than percent clear nail.

•

Photographic assessment: Visual evidence of improvement underlies all aesthetic
treatments, including the indication of “temporary increase in clear nail,” and therefore
will represent the bulk of the study data. FDA recommends submission of all
photographic data gathered in the performance of a clinical study for this indication, in
order to assess the visual change. To ensure adequate photographic quality and to
maximize the ability to compare photographs across timepoints and across subjects, a
standardized photography protocol should be put in place. Photographs should be of high
quality and high resolution. An internal scale (e.g. ruler) should be included in all images
to allow objective measurement of millimeters of clear nail regardless of magnification of
the image. Unedited and unretouched photographs are necessary in order to perform an
accurate assessment. Images should be assembled and presented in an organized fashion,
for example pre-treatment and post-treatment images side by side, to facilitate FDA
review. Sponsors may choose to score the nail appearance on a numerical scale or use
another categorization tool. When such tools are used, they are most reliable when
photographs are evaluated in a blinded manner and when the scores of multiple
independent, blinded observers are combined. The use of training aids, such as
representative photographs for each score or category, add to the accuracy and reduce
inter-observer variability and should therefore be considered.

•

3-Dimensional improvement: Dystrophic nails may also be thickened. Means of
assessing nail thickness, using calipers or photography from an appropriate angle, may be
used as additional tools in assessing improvement in nail appearance. Such assessment
would be less relevant if debridement were used in the treatment protocol.

•

Composite endpoints: Methods of assessing “overall improvement” or multi-axis scoring
systems can be of use in some aesthetic indications. However, these endpoints should be
used with caution as they can be subjective or easily affected by non-quantifiable factors.
Furthermore, such scales may lack clinical validation. If a composite endpoint is chosen,
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

it is recommended that it be a secondary endpoint and that it be discussed with the FDA
prior to commencement of the study.
•

Nested studies endpoints: The endpoints for an indication of clear nail may later be used
to support an indication for treatment of onychomycosis, when combined with
appropriate mycology studies and controls. As will be discussed below, a study can be
designed to provide data in support of a clear nail indication in the first phase, and after
continued follow-up and analysis of the relevant additional data, further endpoints can be
used to support an indication of treating onychomycosis in a second phase of the study.
5. Follow-up

In the absence of fungal re-infection or recurrence, it is anticipated that successful treatment will
result in stable and progressive increase in clear nail. To assess the effectiveness of the response
to treatment, an ideal study would follow the nails until they are completely replaced by clear
nail. As discussed above, based on the average growth of nails this follow up duration would
translate to roughly 6 months after the first treatment for fingernails and 12 months after the first
treatment for toenails.
The FDA recognizes that there is an inherent rate of re-infection or recurrence, and that the goal
of studies in support of clear nail indications is to assess the improvement in appearance in
response to treatment, rather than the ability to prevent re-infection. However, sponsors are
reminded that prospective patients and providers will have interest in data about recurrence rates.
6. Controls
When possible, clinical trials benefit from the use of well-selected controls. In the design of
trials assessing body sites which are symmetric, such as the hands and feet, the use of a
contralateral untreated control can be of great value, provided the two sides have similar
involvement at baseline. This type of control is of particular value in studies whose design
includes the concomitant use of a topical antifungal drug. When the baseline severity of the two
sides is not similar, a contralateral control with crossover may allow maximal use of the
contralateral side as control.
Using the “before” status or photos of a nail as a control may not be sufficient. Sponsors are
encouraged to consider contralateral control design when possible, as this approach reduces
inter-subject variability. Additional controls that have been employed include untreated
individuals or historical controls. These approaches suffer from multiple limitations; the use of
such data may not provide adequate comparator data or may necessitate a larger number of
subjects for adequate statistical power. Sponsors and investigators are advised to consult with a
statistician and with the Agency.
7. Blinding
The use of blinding in clinical trials that assess visual improvement strengthens the data by
removing conscious or unconscious bias by the observer and by reducing placebo effect in the
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

subject when patient reported outcomes or unblinded photographic analysis is used. When
possible, the use of a sham strengthens study design. This may only be possible for treatments
which cannot be felt by the treated subject, as may be the case in low level laser therapy, for
example. Blinding may be difficult when a laser or other energy-based treatment can be
distinguished by the subject if the active intervention leads to heating or discomfort. However,
blinding of the observer is possible and recommended. This blinding can be accomplished by
providing unmarked before and after photographs, or by providing unlabeled “treated” and
“control” photographs to independent observers. The FDA recommends use of blinded
assessment to provide maximally objective data.
8. Dose considerations
The Indication for Use of “temporary increase in clear nail” does not distinguish between
different nails. Historically, studies in clear nail were performed on the first toe, which has the
largest nail, and which nail is most often affected. However, in practice the treatment will be
applied to the smaller toenails as well as to fingernails. The differing thickness and area of these
nails, together with potential differences in heating of underlying neural and vascular structures,
may require that different doses of energy be applied to the first versus other toenails and to the
toenails versus the fingernails. Clinical trials and labeling should address dose considerations so
as to assess and ensure substantially equivalent safety and effectiveness in these different body
sites.
9. Data analysis
Clinical trial data can be analyzed in several different manners in order to evaluate whether a
device is as safe and effective as a predicate device, to confirm a response to a particular
regimen, to identify a dose-response relationship in both safety and effectiveness, to test whether
different nail changes respond differently, and to unmask sources of confounding. For trials that
study the response of a nail whose appearance has been altered by fungal infection, several
different analyses may be relevant. Analysis of data as a function of each of these may provide
information that will assist FDA in evaluating the performance of the device. Such analyses may
also provide valuable information to the sponsor with respect to training, marketing, and
development of devices for clear nail indications. Suggested analyses include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Increase in clear nail at each timepoint of evaluation after the last treatment
Increase in clear nail as a function of the number of treatments, energy dose, or other
controllable variable
Subgroup analysis of response by clinical subtype (e.g., distal subungual onychomycosis,
total dystrophy)
Subgroup analysis by fungal species isolated prior to enrollment
Subgroup analysis by baseline severity
Subgroup analysis by degree of response (e.g., complete response or clearing, >75%
clear, 50-75% clear)
If multiple nails are affected, subgroup analysis of toenails vs. fingernails, or first nail vs.
smaller nails

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

If relevant, device alone vs. device with adjunctive topical antifungal product or
debridement

When responder analysis is reported on a per nail basis, per subject analysis should be included.
10. Adverse event monitoring
Post-market monitoring of devices cleared for temporary increase of clear nail has identified
several adverse events which may be device-related. These adverse events include edema,
burn/blister, disfigurement of nails, infection of soft tissue, infection of the underlying bone,
deep tissue damage and nerve damage, and delayed wound healing. Some of these events were
associated with device output failure or use error, while others occurred when the device was
used and operating within specifications.
In light of these reports, sponsors, investigators, and practitioners are urged to be mindful that
energy-based treatments do pose risks. In the context of the aesthetic Indications for Use of
“temporary increase in clear nail,” the benefit-risk analysis is particularly important. All adverse
events related to such procedures should be reported by type, severity, duration, outcome, and
relationship to the device or procedure in order to develop an accurate understanding of the risks
and benefits of these procedures.
C. Statistical Considerations
Like studies for other medical products, clinical studies for devices aimed at treating or
improving the appearance of fungally infected nails should be well designed with valid
statistical analysis plans. Many general statistical principles such as study design, objective
(e.g., superiority or non-inferiority), randomization, prespecification of analyses (e.g., method,
covariates), multiplicity control of type I error due to multiple endpoints or analyses,
determination of analysis populations (e.g., ITT, per protocol), handling of missing data, use of
interim or subgroup analyses, etc., are issues that need to be addressed for devices intended to
treat nails in the same way as for other medical devices. As such, these topics will only be
briefly discussed here.
1. The study objective(s) should be clearly stated as superiority, non-inferiority. The null
and alternative hypotheses should be stated in text and in statistical notation, including
the non-inferiority margin (delta), along with appropriate justification if the study is a
non-inferiority trial.
2. Study designs with randomized, concurrent controls are recommended whenever
possible. For products not expected to have systemic effects, the most efficient design
would be a within-patient controlled design, where nail(s) on one foot get the
investigational treatment and nail(s) on the other foot get the control treatment. This
“split-foot” design reduces the patient to patient variability and thus requires a smaller
sample size. Another strong design is the controlled parallel group design, where
treatment (investigation or control) is randomly assigned to subjects in two independent

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

groups. FDA recognizes the inherent limitations with historically controlled studies
and recommends other study designs be utilized when appropriate.
3. There should be a statistical justification of sample size, which is typically based on
type I error, power, and expected outcomes considerations. In some cases, there may
be a need to power the study for safety as well, as there may be a low tolerance for
serious or bothersome adverse reactions. The final sample size is a judgment and
depends upon prior experience with the class of products. If a performance goal is
being used, such as a 50% response rate, then the (lower bound) 95% one-sided
confidence interval around the observed success rate in the study population should be
≥50%.
4. The randomization scheme should be fully described, including the randomization
ratio, and any use of stratification or block size. It should also be specified whether the
randomization is centrally controlled or managed at each site.
5. The level of blinding (patient/investigator/evaluator) should be carefully considered.
Double-blinded studies should be conducted whenever possible. However, when this is
not possible, investigator- or evaluator-blinding should be considered. The use of
photographic evaluations may also be used to maintain the blind; however, assessment
of depth is typically compromised with photographs. It is prudent to have as much
blinding as possible due to the degree of subjectivity in assessing endpoints with nail
products.
6. Studies for devices intended to treat nails may have a number of assessments that are
used to define the primary and secondary endpoints. The number of assessments
may be due to the multifaceted nature of the condition (e.g., color, area, thickness,
texture), the number of assessors (e.g., investigator, subject, or blinded evaluator), or
the timepoints for assessment. When appropriate, scales should allow for worsening of
the condition as well as improvement. Studies may evaluate efficacy, safety, or patient
satisfaction outcomes. All scales used should be validated to the extent possible.
7. If efficacy is based on the number of patients responding to treatment (i.e., a responder
analysis), then the patient success decision rule should be described. This may
involve meeting a single criteria or meeting all components of a composite endpoint.
8. The overall study success decision rule should be prespecified. Study success should
depend on both clinical significance and statistical significance. The protocol should
include a plan for adjusting for multiplicity in cases with more than one endpoint to
control the type I error.
9. The follow-up schedule should be fully described. Long-term follow-up may be
needed to assess duration of effect (i.e., for one-time use or intermittent use products).
Protocols should include plans to minimize loss to follow-up, especially in cases where
subjects may not be motivated to return for follow-up after receiving treatment or
complying with only some of the post-treatment visits.
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

10. The length of treatment or the number and spacing of treatments should be specified.
Data should be collected on dosing or volume of product administered.
11. The statistical methods to be used for the analysis of all endpoints should be specified
in the statistical plan, and should be appropriate for the type of data collected. If the
statistical method will incorporate important covariates, such as with various
regression methods or subgroup analyses, the covariate list should be prespecified.
How the covariates will be used should be spelled out in the statistical plan.
12. The primary analysis cohort (e.g., ITT, modified ITT, per-protocol) should be prespecified. If other analysis cohorts will be used, these should be prespecified as well.
13. For some types of treatments administered by the investigator, the investigator
technique may impact the results. Studies should be designed to enroll sufficient
numbers of subjects per center so that investigator-to-investigator variability and
treatment-by-center interactions can be adequately assessed. Number of
investigational centers planned (#US and #foreign) should be carefully considered.
14. If the study is a non-inferiority study, the control treatment should be shown to be
effective at the primary analysis time point. It would be inappropriate to evaluate noninferiority/equivalence to an ineffective treatment.
15. Primary and secondary endpoints intended for labeling should be clinically relevant
and supported by appropriate prespecified statistical hypotheses. The labeling should
only reflect what was demonstrated in the clinical trial.
16. There should be a plan for handling missing data which includes the type of
imputation that will be used for missed observations and a plan for a sensitivity
analyses.
17. Any planned subgroup analyses should be prespecified or they will be considered
exploratory. In some cases a multiplicity adjustment is needed.
18. Any planned interim analyses (i.e., early stopping for futility or effectiveness) should
be prespecified. The purpose of the analysis should be clearly stated as well as the
alpha spending function to be used to control the overall type 1 error.
19. The kappa statistic, weighted kappa, or intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)
may be used to measure inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, or reliability
depending on the nature of the data (e.g., dichotomous, ordered categorical,
continuous). It is reasonable to obtain more than one opinion on the amount of clear
nail.
20. Some trials require the use of a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). An interim
analysis of safety may be needed if the risk of the medical device is high.

D. Labeling Considerations
Devices which are cleared for “temporary increase in clear nail in patients with onychomycosis”
should be clearly labeled for this indication. Specifically, claims should be limited to aesthetic
improvement.
Since the IFU specifies visual improvement in fungally-infected nails, appropriate labeling
should include language which states this clearly by conveying both components of the IFU:
1) Target nails are those whose appearance is altered due to fungal infection. Physician
labeling should list the species assessed, and should recommend that physicians confirm
fungal etiology.
2) The physician labeling should indicate that the device has not been cleared to treat
fungus, as discussed in the “Regulatory Considerations” section above.
As discussed in the “Regulatory Considerations” section above, due to the potentially increased
risk of these treatments in patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, immune
suppression, and other compromised medical states, the labeling should include a warning in
both the physician and patient labeling stating that these devices are to be used with caution in
these populations.
The labeling for devices cleared for a “clear nail” indication should contain details regarding the
clinical study data, including:
Physician labeling:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Representative before and after photos of nail with various severities prior to treatment
Description of the treatment protocol used, including any adjunctive interventions such as
topical antifungal products or debridement
Potential and observed adverse events, and frequency as available
A table summarizing the percent complete responders, partial responders (which may be
further stratified), and non-responders.
Fungal species assessed, and response rates for each species.
Clinical presentations of onychomycosis assessed (e.g., DSO).
If a controlled study, results should be reported for both treated and control data with pvalues for any statistical comparison tests performed.
Caveat that the results represent the US population, and that these data may not be
extrapolatable to other strains or other geographic areas.

Patient labeling:

IV. TREATMENT OF ONYCHOMYCOSIS
A. Regulatory considerations
1. Defining “treatment of onychomycosis”
In contrast to the indication of “temporary increase in clear nails in patients with
onychomycosis,” which provides support only for aesthetic improvement, the IFU of “treatment
of onychomycosis” is a medical indication, based on reduction or elimination of fungal
organisms as assessed by mycological testing. As discussed in section III.A.1 (Defining
“temporary increase in clear nail”), stains may be used to assess the presence or absence of
fungal organisms, while culture is needed to assess whether the organisms are viable and to
identify the species. Mycological cure is therefore defined as simultaneous occurrence of
negative stain and negative culture. However, in slow-growing nails, there may be residual
fungal forms detectable by staining which are not viable. In such cases, two serial negative
cultures from the same nail may provide evidence of mycological cure.
Mycological cure may be assessed in parallel to clear nail. Antifungal drug studies have also
assessed overall response rate using an endpoint of “effective treatment” which was defined as
mycological cure plus 0% nail involvement or a pre-defined minimum distance of unaffected
nail growth, to allow inclusion of nails which are mycologically cured but whose slow growth
precludes complete nail replacement within the anticipated timeframe.
As discussed above, nails which are structurally abnormal can only clear by outgrowth of the
dystrophic component and replacement by newly-created normal-appearing nail. Based on the
mean growth rate for nails in healthy U.S. adults, the ideal effective treatment would be expected
to yield a fully clear fingernail after approximately 6 months and a fully clear great toenail
approximately 12 months after the initiation of treatment. 12 In contrast to the IFU of “temporary
increase in clear nail,” it is anticipated that effective treatment of the fungus underlying
onychomycosis will lead to durable changes in the nail after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Any
regression could indicate incomplete or unsuccessful elimination of the fungus or recurrent
fungal infection.

adults. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology & Venereology, 2010; 24(4): 420-23.

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

2. Combining treatment with antifungal drugs or debridement
Due to the nature of the indication, the use of antifungal drug therapy of any kind in studies
performed in support of “treatment of onychomycosis” could compromise assessment of device
effectiveness and are therefore not recommended. Debridement may be offered for functional
improvement, but such interventions should be used uniformly across study subjects with given
severities and should be disclosed in labeling.
3. Species-dependent outcomes
Clinical studies may reveal that different organisms respond differently to the procedure, or may
require varying doses or treatment protocols. However, the Indication for Use of “treatment of
onychomycosis” is worded broadly. A sponsor may choose to specify within the IFU what
species can be treated effectively, or may provide this information in the labeling. The goal in
either case is to ensure that the device be used to treat only nails which are likely to respond to
the treatment protocol.
4. Special populations
As discussed in section III.A.4 (Special populations), effective treatment of a fungal infection is
of particular clinical relevance for vulnerable populations, who may remain at ongoing medical
risk with partially-treated or unsuccessfully-treated onychomycosis. Furthermore, in these
populations, trauma to the nail due to potential adverse events during the procedure may result in
delayed wound healing or may predispose to severe or life-threatening infections. To protect
these populations, the labeling should include the following statement:
“Warning: These devices should be used with caution in patients with diabetes,
peripheral vascular disease, or immune-suppression, or with any other medical
state that renders the foot at risk of infection or delayed wound healing.”
A device whose labeling includes an Intended Use or Indication for Use for treating
onychomycosis and which has not been studied in such vulnerable populations should be labeled
with a similar warning.
B. Clinical trial considerations
1. Special populations
As discussed above (section III.B.1 (Special populations)), risk to special populations should be
minimized. Special populations may be considered particularly vulnerable and may not be
appropriate subjects for clinical studies assessing treatment of onychomycosis in lieu of
definitive therapy, until such procedures are demonstrated safe and effective. It is recommended
that subjects with diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, recurrent cellulitis, lymphatic
insufficiency, or immune compromise (whether due to underlying medical disorders or to

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

immunosuppressive treatments), or other compromised states of health be excluded from
participating in clinical trials intended to treat onychomycosis.
Investigators are urged to design clinical studies which enroll a cross-section of subjects that
reflects the U.S. population by including subjects with varying age, sex, race, and Fitzpatrick
skin type, if applicable, in which it is anticipated the device will be used.
2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria: recommendations
Clinical involvement
The recommendations discussed above (section III.B.2 (Clinical involvement) will also apply to
studies performed in support of the treatment of onychomycosis.
Clinical presentations of onychomycosis
The different clinical forms of onychomycosis, which are differentiated by their appearance, are
discussed in section III.B.2 (Clinical presentations of onychomycosis). Certain clinical forms are
associated with particular species of fungus. As such, some clinical forms may be more resistant
to treatment, both due to anatomical factors and due to variably sensitive organisms. It may
therefore be of value to evaluate various clinical forms separately, or to analyze and report the
outcomes obtained in the treatment of different clinical forms of onychomycosis separately.
Confirmation of fungal infection
As described section III.B.2 (Confirmation of fungal infection underlying nail appearance), a
small number of fungal strains are the predominant causes of toenail and fingernail
onychomycosis. To maximize the clinical relevance of trial results, and to provide data that is
most predictive of treatment response in the population of patients with onychomycosis, it is
recommended that studies include only subjects whose nails have been demonstrated to harbor
the common causative organisms and exclude subjects whose nails are infected by rare fungal
species or non-fungal organisms such as mold or bacteria.
To support an IFU of “treatment of onychomycosis,” it is appropriate that all enrolled subjects
have confirmed nail infection by one of these fungal organisms prior to treatment and that the
nails be definitively assessed for cure of the fungal organism at the relevant timepoint after
treatment. Mycological cure is defined as negative stain (e.g. periodic acid Schiff (PAS); silver
stains; potassium hydroxide (KOH)) concurrent with negative fungal culture. The concurrence
of a negative stain and a negative culture from the same nail may be considered definitive. In the
event that the stain and the culture provide conflicting results, i.e., one is positive and the other
negative, resolution may be obtained by several approaches. A nail which shows fungal
organisms by staining may yield a negative culture. It is known that cultures may yield false
negative results in up to 30% of cases due to partially-treated organisms, fastidious organisms,
nuances in laboratory methodology, or recent contact with a topical microbicidal agent
(including alcohol or acetone applied to the nail prior to collecting the specimen). 13 Conversely,

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

in slow-growing nails the distal nail margin may contain non-viable organisms, leading to a true
negative culture and a positive stain. In this case also, two serial negative cultures from the same
nail may provide evidence of mycological cure.
Co-morbidities
Many non-fungal conditions can affect nail appearance, including psoriasis, lichen planus,
trauma from ill-fitting shoes, running, or overly-aggressive nail care. These conditions may be
the primary cause of nail dystrophy but may also predispose a subject to secondary fungal
infection. While these subjects may benefit from procedures which can treat the secondary
onychomycosis, it is recommended that they not be included in clinical studies, as the nail
appearance may remain abnormal despite successful eradication of the fungus.
Prior or ongoing antifungal drug therapy
Because systemic antifungal drugs are deposited in the nail substance and remain in the nail until
the nail grows and is trimmed, enrollment of subjects who have been exposed to antifungal drugs
in the 12 months prior (in the case of toenails) or 6 months prior (in the case of fingernails) could
confound interpretation of the study data and is not recommended.
While topical antifungal drugs are less effective in providing clinical clearance of
onychomycosis, their application can interfere with fungal cultures, even if applied only to the
skin. It is therefore recommended that such treatments be discontinued prior to screening and
enrollment and for the duration of the clinical trial and follow-up period.
3. Adjunctive therapies
Adjunctive medical therapies may mask the true performance of the device. The use of a topical
or systemic antifungal therapy would preclude the ability to assess true safety and effectiveness
of a device in treating onychomycosis and are therefore not recommended. If a sponsor or
investigator wishes to assess the ability of a second intervention to work in synergy with a
device, for example, a topical product that would increase the absorption of laser light,
appropriate study design could be established in support of the combination, by providing
properly-controlled comparative data of the product alone, the device alone, and the
combination. Sponsors are urged to discuss such study designed with the Agency in advance,
and to address whether such combinations would be drug-device combination products. 14
4. Endpoints
Based on the average nail growth rates discussed above, and to provide a fair and informative
guideline for assessment of the success of a treatment, FDA recommends the following
effectiveness endpoints for treatment of onychomycosis, based on achieving endpoints of both
clear nail and mycology.

Clear nail: The specifications for clear nail are described below. The 95% one-sided confidence
interval (i.e., lower bound only) around the observed response rate as described below should be
≥50%.
Mycology: Among toenails and fingernails which are deemed responders based on the “clear
nail” criteria, at least 80% should demonstrate negative mycology (negative stain with
concurrent negative culture, or two negative cultures from the same nail).
Toenails: (based on assessment in the first toe)
• Measurement of clear nail increase:
o at least 12 mm increase in clear nail, with evidence of distal growth of the
affected area, 12 months after the first treatment;
or
o an additional 120 mm2 of clear nail (based on mean width of the first
toenail), with evidence of distal growth of the affected area, 12 months
after the first treatment;
or
o complete clearance 12 months after the first treatment if less than 12 mm
distal nail was involved prior to treatment.
•

The response should be progressive in at least 2 sequential timepoints that are at
least 3 months apart, with projected increase of at least 1 mm per month.

Fingernails: (based on assessment in the thumb)
•

Measurement of clear nail increase:
o at least 12 mm increase in clear nail measured from the cuticle to the most
proximal area of nail dystrophy, with evidence of distal growth of the
affected area, 6 months after the first treatment;
or
o an additional 90 mm2 of clear nail (based on mean width of the thumb
nail), with evidence of distal growth of the affected area, 6 months after
the first treatment;
or
o complete clearance 6 months after the first treatment if less than 12 mm
distal nail was involved prior to treatment.

•

The response should be progressive in at least 2 sequential timepoints that are at
least 3 months apart, with projected increase of at least 2 mm per month.

Studies performed on fingernails only should only be used to support an IFU in the fingernails.
Studies which include the toenails can be used to support an IFU for all nails.

As stated earlier, these recommended endpoints arise from the combined consideration of the
expected response to an effective treatment (in which the majority of nails would respond) with
the known slower nail growth rate in older individuals and in certain disease states. It is
anticipated that at least half the treated nails would show a response within the designated time
frame for assessment, while slower-growing nails would achieve the response later. FDA may
consider alternate endpoints and/or response rates for devices which pose very high or very low
risk. If alternate endpoints are being considered, FDA recommends that you contact the Agency
through the pre-submission process to discuss these endpoints.
The indication of “treating onychomycosis” should include demonstration of mycological cure,
defined by the concurrence of a negative stain and a negative culture. Sponsors and investigators
may choose to apply a nested study design, in which early endpoints are applied and discussed
for the clear nail indication (section III.A.1 (Defining “temporary increase in clear nail”)) in the
first phase, and to pursue a subsequent IFU of “treatment of onychomycosis” with the data
generated in a second phase of the study, in accordance with the recommended endpoints
(section III.B.4 (Endpoints)). If such a study design is used, pre-specified statistical
considerations should be included in the study design to account for the interim data analysis and
unblinding.
To evaluate the overall response rates, it is recommended that the study report be written in a
tiered fashion, citing the success rate for the subjects exhibiting mycological cure concurrent
with clear nail, with separate presentation of the data for subjects exhibiting mycological cure
with residual nail dystrophy.
5. Follow-up
The goal of treatments for onychomycosis is complete elimination of the fungal organism and
full clearance of the nail. Follow-up for this indication should be based on the anticipated time
for complete nail regrowth, which is approximately 6 months for fingernails and 12 months for
toenails as discussed above. Longer follow-up times will be helpful for assessing recurrence
rates. To control for loss of subjects who do not exhibit the desired visual outcome, it is
recommended that subjects who drop out or are lost to follow-up be considered as treatment
failures for this indication. This restriction should be incorporated into the statistical analysis
plan.
6. Controls
The controls discussed in the “clear nail” section above (section III.B.6 (Controls) are relevant
and can be applied to studies in support of the treatment of onychomycosis. These controls may
be complemented with mycological studies from the control nails.
7. Blinding
The blinding considerations discussed in the “clear nail” section above (section III.B.7
(Blinding)) are relevant and can be applied to studies in support of the treatment of

25

onychomycosis. Blinding should be applied to mycological specimen assessment in addition to
clinical assessments.
8. Dose considerations
The dosimetry of energy for different toes and for toenails versus fingernails is addressed in
section III.B.8 (Dose considerations). It is not known whether elimination of fungal organisms
to support the IFU of treatment of onychomycosis would require similar or higher doses of
energy than those used for “temporary increase in clear nail,” nor whether a higher dose would
be tolerated if needed. Clinical trials and labeling should address dose considerations if a device
is used to treat both the “temporary increase in clear nail” and “treatment of onychomycosis”
IFU, and if it is to be used on different nails, so as to assess and ensure adequate safety and
effectiveness in these different body sites.
9. Data analysis
General considerations for data analysis are discussed in section III.B.9 (Data analysis). Given
the antifungal nature of the IFU of “treatment of onychomycosis,” there is particular importance
in identifying dose-response relationships and species-specific response rates. Sponsors and
investigators may utilize bench testing to identify target parameters prior to human studies.
However, the ability of an energy source to penetrate a living nail overlying complex structures
will in most circumstances necessitate clinical studies. Such studies would also provide
information about the ability of the nail to resume normal growth after treatment.
10. Adverse event monitoring
As discussed in section III.B.10 (Adverse event monitoring) post-market monitoring of devices
cleared for temporary increase in clear nail has identified several adverse events which may be
device-related. In the absence of dose-response data about such adverse events, sponsors,
investigators, and practitioners are urged to monitor and report all adverse events in order to
develop an accurate understanding of the risks and benefits of these procedures. FDA will
review adverse events and provide a benefit-risk analysis.
C. Statistical Considerations
These are the same as those discussed in III.C (Statistical Considerations) above.
D. Labeling considerations
Devices which are cleared for “treatment of onychomycosis” should be clearly labeled for this
indication, provided they have demonstrated effectiveness in eliminating nail fungus. No
devices have been cleared or approved for this indication as of the publication of this guidance.
Therefore, much is not yet known, including potential response rates, adverse events, etc. for
these studies, and FDA cannot make specific recommendations for labeling at this time.
However, general labeling considerations will follow best practices and provide transparency to

26

the provider and patient. It is anticipated that the recommendations will be similar to those
detailed in section III.D (Labeling Considerations) above.

Appendix: Light Sources for Nail Indications
FDA recommends that the following information be included in marketing submissions for
devices incorporating a light source intended for a nail indication, with specific attention to the
parameters applicable to the IFU. This example may serve as a paradigm for other energy-based
devices, in which comparable relevant parameters will be evaluated.
For 510(k) submissions, this information will be taken into consideration along with any
performance data (non-clinical or clinical) when comparing the proposed device to a predicate
device for purposes of determining substantial equivalence. For devices that differ significantly
from those already on the market, additional information may be necessary to evaluate those
differences.

I.

Wavelength: The submission should identify the individual wavelength(s) or the
range of wavelengths of light that will be delivered to the nail by the proposed
device.

II.

Laser or Light Generation: If the device is a laser, the details of the laser
generation method should be submitted. This description may include the gain
medium, pumping source, and the method used for pulsing (q-switch or other). If
the laser is generated without a gain medium, e.g., by laser diodes, detailed
specifications and engineering drawings of the diodes or other laser source(s) may
be requested. If the device is an intense pulsed light or any other kind of light
source, a description of the light source and the method of light generation will be
requested.

III.

Fluence: The submission should identify the total fluence (energy per area),
delivered at each spot. If the clinical procedure for the nail includes multiple
steps, the submission should identify the energy delivered to a spot at each step as
well as the total energy delivered to a spot.

IV.

Spot Size: The submission should include the spot size(s) that will be used for the
procedure.

V.

Output mode: The submission should detail whether the light output is pulsed or
continuous wave (CW).

VI.

Power: Submissions should identify the power that will be delivered during the
procedure. For pulsed light, the average power should be provided.

VII.

Pulsed laser and light sources: The following parameters should be submitted for
pulsed lasers and light sources.
•
•

Pulse duration
Energy per pulse

during the clinical procedure

•

The spatial distribution and number of spots per unit area, if the light is to be
delivered at discrete spots

•

The dwell time at each spot and the time interval between spots, as well as the
direction of movement to complete the spot pattern, if the light is delivered in
discrete spots, or in a stacked or “paintbrush” fashion

•

The movement velocity and the direction(s) of the movement, if a
“paintbrush” fashion is employed

•

The number of procedures per session, number of sessions per week, and the
total number of sessions
