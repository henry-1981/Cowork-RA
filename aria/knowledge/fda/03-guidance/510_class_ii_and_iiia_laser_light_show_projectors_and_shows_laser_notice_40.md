TO: TO ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS
SUBJECT: Class II and Illa laser light show projectors and shows.

BACKGROUND: On August 20, 1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
published amendments to the Federal performance standard for laser
products. As a Tesult, Class IIla laser light show products no longer
require a variance from the standard for introduction into commerce. There
was no change in the requirements for the manufacturer to certify and
report the projection system with its supporting literature and the general
show configuration prior to its introduction into commerce,

This has resulted in the increased promotion of Class II and Illa
low/moderate power laser products for producing laser light show effects in
establishments or at locations having severely restricted space
limitations, which, in some cases, may constitute unsafe installation and
use of these products.

The preamble to the final rule published in the Federal Register

[50 FR 33687, Aug. 20, 1985, Comment 27] recognizes that this type of
demonstration laser product, although of moderate power, still presents a
hazard if not installed and used safely. The preamble also advised
manufacturers: "... that instructions for assembly, operation, and
maintenance need to include warnings to avoid possible exposure to laser
and collateral radiation in excess of the limits of Class I. Such warnings
should be based on the laser safety concepts contained in laser light show
variances issued by FDA.”

POLICY: In keeping with this recognition of a hazard and the advice given,

the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) will object to any
intentional exposure of the public to hazardous levels (i.e., greater than
Class I levels) of laser or collateral radiation (light) from this type of
equipment. Further, the CDRH will object to any instructions or promotion
of Class II or IIIa demonstration laser products (projectors, scanners,
shows, etc.) that do not adequately warn the user to prevent such exposure,

MANUFACTURER GUIDANCE: The manufacturer, during production and marketing
of Class II and IIIa demonstration laser products, must consider the
following points. This is necessary to assure that the user is adequately
informed of the hazards involved with the use of the product as well as the
responsibility of the purchaser/operator to provide a safe environment for
their patrons.

1. Class I audience exposure levels.

Only Class I levels of laser radiation have no known hazard and these
are the only exposure levels that are considered safe for direct
exposure of people. Exposure of the audience to levels in excess of
the Class I limits is not to be promoted or encouraged in any way.

Class II warning: CAUTION Laser Radiation (or Light)
Do Not Stare Into Beam

Class Illa warning: DANGER Laser Radiation (or Light)
Avoid Direct Eye Exposure

These levels are hazardous to the eyes. No direct or reflected

beams may be directed into audience areas or used to scan the audience
in any way. A projector certified as Class II or IIIa cannot be used
for audience scanning unless the projector is equipped with an adequate
scanning safeguard which will prevent scanning above the Class I limits
and adequate user instructions for achieving the Class I levels are
provided (as discussed below.)

Installation restrictions/limitations.

Although the purchaser/operator is responsible for providing a safe
environment for patrons and for configuring the laser light to avoid
public exposure to unsafe levels of laser light, the projector
manufacturer is required to provide the purchaser/operator with
adequate directions for creating such an installation.

The CDRH is aware that the laser Class II and IIla emissions are a
lesser hazard than the higher levels emitted in shows that require a
variance. Nevertheless, the CDRH recommends that the 3 meter (about 10
feet) vertical and 2.5 meter (about 8 feet) lateral clearance distances
from audience area floors be used for Class II and IIIa laser light
shows. This will provide the same degree of safety that is imposed by
the variance requirements for higher power laser light shows. Smaller
clearance distances should be used only if there is assurance that
people in the audience and general public areas are not exposed to
Class II and IIIa levels. It would be prudent to use a minimum beam
height of 7 feet if it is not possible to achieve the standard laser
light show clearance distances in a particular installation. This
clearance gives some assurance that people in the audience will not
receive direct eye exposures.

The American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers, ANSI 2136.1
- 1986, published by the American National Standards Institute, Inc.
should be consulted before undertaking any laser light shows or
effects. This is a voluntary safety standard established by
representatives of the laser industry for users of all types of lasers.
It should be noted that this standard also requires that Class IIIa and
Class II projection devices be set up so as not to expose people to the
direct beam (or its mirror reflection) unless the beam irradiance has
been dropped to (or below) the applicable MPE (Maximum Permissible
Exposure). The beam should NOT be directed at the eye, and, in an
unsupervised location, steps must be taken to PREVENT access of the
public to the direct beam (or its mirror reflections.)

Scanning safeguard.

As noted above, projection systems designed for scanning beams or
images into a public area with possible exposure of the audience must
have a scanning safeguard. The scanning safeguard must be designed to
meet the laser performance standard (21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11) and
therefore must maintain all beams and effects scanning the audience
within Class I at all times or terminate the effect before the Class I
limits are exceeded.

Measurement parameters.

When determining the levels of laser radiation to which the audience
could be exposed, appropriate measurement parameters must be used.

This must include the use of a 50 mm aperture since viewing optics such
as cameras, binoculars, and similar devices may easily be used by the
audience. Likewise, worst case considerations must be applied in this
evaluation, including (but not limited to) such factors as: (1) the
worst case scan pattern permitted by a scan safeguard system, (2) the
closest point of approach to the projector within the audience

area, etc.

User information, Owner's Manuals, or Instructions.

a. The written information provided to the purchaser/owner must be
clear enough so that someone not technically oriented and/or not
familiar with lasers can learn of the hazards associated with
lasers, can install and operate the product (projector and show)
correctly, and can produce the intended effects without creating a
hazardous environment for the viewer.

b. The user manual must contain specific warnings that any levels
exceeding the Class I limits are considered hazardous to the eye
and exposure of the viewer by direct or reflected beams must not be
permitted. If Class I levels can be achieved by following the
manufacturer's instructions (discussed below) and the projector is
equipped with a scanning safeguard that meets the Federal
requirements, then, and only then, may intentional exposure of
people be used as an effect.

c. User instructions for projectors equipped with scanners and
scanning safeguards must thoroughly explain in simple, nontechnical
language the procedures for setting up, adjusting, and operating
the equipment in a manner to achieve and maintain the Class I
levels in audience areas.

d. The user instructions must contain a description or graphic
representation of typical show installations and effects. This
provides the essential elements of the required show report for
products intended for sale only. Thus, the laser light show
reporting requirement may be considered satisfied in this case.

Page 4

The manufacturer must submit a FINAL (not preliminary) user manual
in the required product report. This will allow FDA to evaluate
the user instructions to determine whether adequate warnings have
been provided. Also, if audience exposure to Class I effects is
intended, this manual will be reviewed to ensure that adequate,
straightforward instructions have been provided to achieve and
maintain the required Class I radiation levels.

Advertising and promotion.

A manufacturer is responsible for promotion of the product(s)

in accordance with the safety instructions contained in the users'
manual. Failure to do this would be considered inadequate user
instruction and the manufacturer would be in noncompliance with the
laser standard.

Misuse or disregarding user instructions.

ae

b.

The manufacturer is responsible for providing user information
which will instruct the purchaser/operator how to use the product
safely.

The purchaser/operator is responsible for learning and following
the operational procedures for safe use provided in the
instructions.

The CDRH invites comments from the public on this notice. Please address
any comments to the Director, Office of Compliance (HFZ-300), Center for
Devices and Radiological Health), Silver Spring, Maryland 20910.
