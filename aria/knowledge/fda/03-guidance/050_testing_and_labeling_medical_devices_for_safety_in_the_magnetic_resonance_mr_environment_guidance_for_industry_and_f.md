Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

Scope
This guidance document applies to all medical devices that might be used in the MR
environment. This includes all implanted medical devices, medical devices that are fastened
to or carried by a patient (e.g., external insulin pump, pulse oximeter), medical devices that
would reasonably be anticipated to enter the MR environment during clinical care, and all
medical devices that are intended to enter the MR environment. The recommendations in this
guidance for MR labeling of devices are consistent with ASTM F2503 Standard Practice for
Marking Medical Devices and Other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance
Environment.
This guidance document does not apply to the MR system or associated components such as
accessory spacing pads and coils.
This guidance document provides recommendations on MRI safety and compatibility
assessments and labeling information that should be included in premarket submissions (i.e.,
premarket approval (PMA) applications, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications,
premarket notification (510(k)) submissions, investigational device exemption (IDE)
applications, and De Novo requests).

Terminology
We recommend using the following terminology when testing your medical device for safety
in the MR environment and labeling your medical device with one of the three standardized
terms: MR Safe, MR Unsafe and MR Conditional.
Active medical device—“medical device relying for its functioning on a source of electrical
energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or
gravity”3
Active implantable medical device (AIMD) —“active medical device which is intended to
be totally or partially introduced, surgically or medically, into the human body or by medical
intervention into a natural orifice, and which is intended to remain after the procedure”4

prevent harm from the Static magnetic field”5
Magnetic Resonance (MR) environment—“ three dimensional volume surrounding the
MR magnet that contains both the Special Environment (Faraday shielded volume) and the
B0 Hazard Area (space around the MR equipment where the static magnetic field can cause
harm). This volume is the region in which a medical device might pose a hazard from
exposure to the electromagnetic fields produced by the MR equipment and accessories, and
for which access control is part of the risk mitigation.”6
Magnetic Resonance (MR) System—“ensemble of MR equipment, accessories including
means for display, control, energy supplies, and the controlled access area, where provided”7
MR Conditional—“a medical device with demonstrated safety in the MR environment
within defined conditions including conditions for the static magnetic field, the time-varying
gradient magnetic fields, and the radiofrequency fields”8
MR Safe—“a medical device that poses no known hazards resulting from exposure to any
MR environment. MR Safe medical devices are composed of materials that are electrically
nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic”9

or other persons within the MR environment”10
Passive implant—“an implant that serves all of its function without supply of electrical
energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or
gravity”11
Passive medical device —“a medical device that serves its function without supply of
electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human
body or gravity”

Addressing Hazards for Medical Devices in the MR
Environment
The MR environment presents unique safety hazards for patients and other persons with
medical devices near or inside an MR system bore.19 Ensuring safety and effectiveness for
implants and other medical devices anticipated to enter the MR environment should be an
integral part of medical device risk management. Appropriate testing and analyses, scientific
rationale, and labeling, such as well supported MR Conditional labeling as described below,
form the basis of adequate mitigations for the unique safety hazards of the MR environment.
The hazards caused by the presence of a medical device in the MR environment are listed
and described below. Standardized test methods that address specific hazards are listed in the
relevant section below. When available, standardized test methods to address specific
hazards should be used. Note that the worst-case medical device size or configuration may
vary for different hazards as described in the individual sections below.
The characteristics of the static magnetic field, gradient magnetic fields and radiofrequency
coils may vary significantly in different MR systems and thus can lead to different risk
profiles for a device. The safety and conditions of use of a medical device should be assessed
or an adequate scientific rationale provided, for each magnetic field strength (e.g., 0.25 T, 1.2
T, 1.5 T, 3.0 T, 7.0 T) MR system, radiofrequency (RF) transmit coil type (e.g., whole-body

transmit coil, head RF transmit-receive coil) and RF excitation (e.g., Circularly Polarized
(CP), Multichannel-2 (MC-2)) to which the medical device is anticipated to be exposed.
Testing may not be warranted if an adequate scientific rationale or validated computational
modeling/simulation is provided.
A medical device that is MR Conditional in a 1.5 T MR system may be unsafe in higher or
lower field MR systems. For instance, depending on the size and shape of the device, device
heating may be greater or less in MR systems with higher or lower magnetic field strength. In
addition, for a specific type of device, conditions for safe use may not be the same for all
models.
For electrically active medical devices that are intended to function during the MR procedure
or in the MR environment (for example, an electrically active medical device that is intended
to monitor the patient or deliver therapy) appropriate testing, adequate scientific rationale,
and/or validated computational modeling/simulation should demonstrate safe use and
intended performance during the MR procedure. This is important due to presence of higher
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) risks both due to strong emissions from the MR system
as well as the sensitivity of MR systems to RF noise from active devices.
For devices belonging to the same device type, the risk produced by the individual hazards
can vary due to differences in the design of the individual device model. If you have
questions about the most appropriate testing for your specific medical device, we encourage
you to seek input from FDA as you develop the specific test plan for your medical device.
See the FDA guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device
Submissions: The Q-Submission Program”20 for more information on constructing your presubmission.

Magnetically Induced Displacement Force
The spatial gradient of the static magnetic field (spatial field gradient) induces a
displacement force on magnetic materials. This force is greatest near the entrance to the MR
system bore. Magnetically induced displacement force may cause tissue damage by inducing
unwanted movement or dislodgement of the medical device. In addition, typical designs and
shapes of large equipment (e.g., patient monitors, injectors) can be vulnerable to tipping over
when subjected to magnetically induced forces and/or torques.
This hazard should be addressed for all medical devices anticipated to enter the MR
environment. For relatively small medical devices that can be suspended from a string,
ASTM F2052 provides a test method for the measurement of magnetically induced
displacement force. For medical devices that are too large to suspend from a string, we
recommend you develop alternate test methods to assess the magnetically induced
displacement force and appropriate conditions for safe use. For medical devices composed of
paramagnetic materials whose magnetic properties are not affected by processing and
fabrication, it may be possible to leverage test results and analyses for devices or material
20 https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-

device-submissions-q-submission-program

samples composed of the same material as the subject medical device.21 Magnetically
induced force and torque testing on devices composed of alloys whose magnetic properties
may be altered during processing and fabrication (e.g., nitinol and austenitic stainless steels
like grades 303 and 304 stainless steel) should be performed on a finished device and should
not be leveraged from other device or material testing.
For large equipment that can be mounted to a cart or stand and might contain wheels, you
should also assess the propensity of the medical device to tip or topple due to magnetically
induced displacement forces and torques.
For medical devices that come in multiple sizes, the medical device with the greatest mass of
magnetic material, or with the largest proportion of magnetic material to total mass, is
typically the worst-case for the assessment of magnetically induced displacement force.
To mitigate the possibility of a projectile event for medical devices anticipated to be used
inside the MRI scanner room but outside the MR system bore (e.g., ventilators and anesthesia
systems), we recommend that the medical device be permanently secured so that it cannot be
moved into a hazardous area. If this is not possible, we recommend that you include one or
more of the following as part of your medical device: dead-man brakes, gauss meters
mounted on the medical device, and/or nonferromagnetic tethers. Dead-man brakes and
tethers reduce the potential for freely-moving projectiles. A gauss meter mounted on the
medical device will not stop an object from being a projectile. However, a gauss meter
mounted on the medical device that generates an audible or visual alarm may be helpful in
alerting the user when a given static magnetic field is detected.
A maximum magnetically induced displacement force of less than or equal to the
gravitational force on the medical device is often used as a conservative acceptance criterion
for implants. A greater magnetically induced displacement force may be acceptable for
implants or medical devices that are fastened to a patient depending on the properties of the
tissue adjacent to the implant or medical device and the means by which an external medical
device is fastened to the patient. Similarly, an acceptance criterion greater than the
gravitational force could be used for a medical device that is not attached to a patient if a
system is provided to prevent the device from entering the region in which it would become a
projectile. Such systems might include permanent mounting to the MR system room,
nonferromagnetic tethers, dead-man brakes and/or magnetic field alarms.

Magnetically Induced Torque
The MR system’s static magnetic field induces a torque on magnetic materials. This
magnetically induced torque may cause tissue damage by inducing unwanted movement or
dislodgement of the medical device. The magnetically induced torque is proportional to the
static magnetic field strength and is the greatest inside the MR system bore where the static
magnetic field strength is greatest.

This hazard should be addressed for all medical devices anticipated to enter the MR system.
ASTM F2213 provides standard methods for measuring magnetically induced torque for
medical devices in the region of the uniform magnetic field in an MR system. Some
experimentation may be needed to determine the worst-case device size and configuration for
assessing magnetically induced torque.
A maximum magnetically induced torque of less than or equal to the gravitational torque on
the medical device is often used as a conservative acceptance criterion. A greater
magnetically induced torque may be acceptable depending on the type of tissue adjacent to
the medical device or how an external medical device is fastened to the patient or restrained
from moving when it is within the MR environment.

Heating
The radiofrequency (RF) and time-varying gradient fields (dB/dt) of the MR system can
induce heating of the tissue adjacent to the medical device and/or heating of the medical
device itself. This hazard should be addressed for all medical devices anticipated to enter the
bore of the MR system.
RF induced heating
RF induced tissue heating is a complex interaction that depends on many variables, including
the characteristics of the transmit RF coil of the MR system (e.g., geometry, tuning, source
location), frequency, the RF transmit mode (e.g., Circularly Polarized (CP), Multichannel-2
(MC-2)), as well as patient anatomy, tissue properties, and position with respect to the RF
coil (i.e., imaging landmark). In addition, for patients with implanted or patient-contacting
medical devices, the RF induced heating also depends on the medical device characteristics
(e.g., geometry, size, materials, physical properties, configuration) and location within the RF
field and within or on the patient. The RF safety evaluation of medical devices anticipated to
be used within the MR environment should take into consideration all these variables to
ensure that a clinically relevant worst-case heating scenario is assessed. In some cases, when
a large number of variables are present (for example for multiple lead paths for a device with
a lead), a risk-based assessment to determine a percentile for the heating comparison rather
than a worst-case approach could be used. Such evaluation can include appropriate
experimental measurements, computational modeling and simulations (e.g., virtual
anatomical models), data from scientific literature, and/or a scientific rationale.
In this context, medical devices are typically categorized as
·
·
·
·

fully implanted passive medical devices (e.g., stents, clips, screws, plates, heart
valves, hip implants),
AIMDs (e.g., neurostimulators, pacemakers, cochlear implants),
partially implanted medical devices (e.g., MR-guided ablation catheters, orthopedic
external fixators), or
medical devices that are external and connected to the body (e.g., EEG electrodes,
ECG electrodes, pulse oximeters, head frames).

For fully implanted passive medical devices, ASTM F2182 provides a method for
measurement of RF induced heating. The FDA Guidance Document on the “Assessment of
Radiofrequency Induced Heating in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment for MultiConfiguration Passive Medical Devices”22 provides information that may assist in
determining worst-case configurations used to assess RF induced heating for multiconfiguration passive medical devices. Note that this guidance can also be used to determine
the location of the greatest expected temperature rise for passive medical devices with a
single configuration (e.g., stents). The RF induced heating assessment should consider the
possibility that during Normal Operating Mode as defined in IEC 60601-2-33, the wholebody Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) can exceed 2 W/kg for short intervals.
When the implant is located inside the local RF transmit coil, RF induced heating should be
determined by local exposure (local SAR, B1+rms) rather than the whole-body SAR. A
scientific rationale could be used to determine safe scan conditions for an implant located
outside the local RF transmit coil.
A passive implant with dimensions of less than 2 cm in all directions and at least 3 cm away
from another passive implant does not need to be tested with respect to RF induced heating at
3.0 T or less, as it is expected to generate a temperature increase of less than 2 °C in Normal
Operating Mode, over the course of 1 hour of exposure. This test exclusion is not valid (i)
when multiple replicas of the implant (e.g., multiple metallic anchors) are implanted within 3
cm of each other, or (ii) part of the implant is outside the patient. The 3 cm distance is
recommended to avoid any RF coupling with neighboring implants.23,24,25 For devices where
multiple replicas can be joined, the worst-case condition should be assessed.
If a sound scientific rationale is provided, it may be possible to leverage RF induced heating
testing and analyses for one passive implant to another passive implant with similar geometry
and electrical properties.
For AIMDs, ISO/TS 10974 provides a tiered approach for assessing RF induced heating.
There are no standard methods for assessing RF induced heating in the MR environment for
partially implanted medical devices or medical devices that are external and patientcontacting. These devices include shielding materials, high permittivity blocks or dielectric
pads that should be evaluated for RF safety because of the significant effects of these devices
on the electric fields present around them. ASTM F2182 was developed for fully implanted
medical devices and the phantom test described is not appropriate for partially implanted
medical devices or medical devices that are external and patient-contacting. Therefore, we

recommend you seek feedback through the Q-submission process on the proposed test plan
for assessing heating and the corresponding MRI safety labeling for these devices.
Acceptance criteria for the temperature/time dose should be established based on the location
of the medical device in or on the body using a scientific rationale or existing literature. No
rationale is needed for a temperature increase up to 2 °C for the SAR condition in the
labeling.26
A patient, with a device that was demonstrated to heat adjacent thermally sensitive tissue
(e.g., brain, eyes, neural tissue, testes, and ovaries) up to 2 °C in 15 minutes in Normal
Operating Mode can be scanned for 1 hour in Normal Operating Mode without a cooling
period.27,28 For devices that heat thermally sensitive tissues more than 2 °C in 15 minutes, the
manufacturer should determine a scan time with an appropriate cooling period.
A patient with a device that was demonstrated to heat adjacent tissue that is not thermally
sensitive up to 4 °C in 15 minutes in Normal Operating Mode can be scanned for 1 hour in
Normal Operating Mode without a cooling period.29,30 For devices that heat adjacent tissue
that is not thermally sensitive by more than 4 °C, in 15 minutes, in Normal Operating Mode,
the manufacturer should determine a scan time with an appropriate cooling period.
Heating induced by time-varying magnetic field gradients, (dB/dt)
Exposure to time-varying magnetic fields (gradient pulses) can induce eddy currents on
conductive surfaces of conductive/metallic implants, and in the internal conductive
components of AIMDs placed inside the bore of the MR system.31 The power deposited by
the magnetic field gradients is primarily determined by the surface area and thickness of the
conductor, rate of change of the magnetic field, electrical conductivity, and the relative
orientation of the conductive loops to the varying magnetic fields. The power deposited is
also determined by the location in the bore, since the strength of the time-varying magnetic
field changes with time and location.
ISO/TS 10974 includes test methods for the assessment of gradient induced heating for
AIMDs. There are no standard test methods for the assessment of gradient induced heating
for passive medical devices. Due to the typical small planar surface area, gradient induced
heating is generally not expected to pose a hazard for tissue damage or medical device
malfunction for passive medical devices. However, it can be significant in some large passive

implants such as cranial plates. The ISO/TS 10974 methods using dB/dt (rms and peak) can
be adapted to test passive medical devices. Testing for passive medical devices may not be
warranted if a sound scientific rationale is provided. In determining whether testing for
gradient induced heating of a passive medical device is warranted, the following factors may
be useful to consider. All the following conditions need to be present for gradient induced
heating of a metal implant to reach a clinically significant level: 1) large and symmetric
surface area of the medical device, 2) dB/dt perpendicular to the large surface of the medical
device, 3) large sustained gradient slew rate, and 4) the medical device is located in the
region of the MR system bore where dB/dt is most intense.32
Due to the rapid drop-off of the gradient fields outside the MR system bore, gradient induced
heating does not pose a thermal hazard for medical devices located outside the bore.
Acceptance criteria for temperature/time dose should be established based on the location of
the medical device in or on the body using scientific rationale or existing literature. No
rationale is needed for a local tissue temperature increase of up to 2 °C at the labeled SAR
condition.33

Gradient Induced Vibration
The MR system’s pulsed gradient magnetic fields, dB/dt, may induce forces on metallic
medical devices that result in vibration of the device. This gradient induced vibration may
lead to device malfunction or tissue damage. This hazard should be addressed for all AIMDs.
Testing may not be warranted if a sound scientific rationale is provided. ISO/TS 10974
provides a test method for the assessment of gradient induced vibration for AIMDs. Due to
the typical small planar surface area, gradient induced vibration is generally not expected to
pose a hazard for tissue damage or medical device malfunction for passive medical devices.
In determining whether testing for gradient induced vibration of a passive implant is
warranted, the following information may be useful to consider. All the following conditions
need to be present for gradient induced vibration of a metal implant to reach a clinically
significant level: 1) large and symmetric surface area of the medical device, 2) dB/dt
perpendicular to the large surface of the implant, 3) large sustained gradient slew rate, and 4)
implant is located in the region of the MR system bore where dB/dt is most intense.34
Acceptance criteria for gradient induced vibration should be established based on the location
of the medical device in or on the body and the location inside the magnet using a scientific
rationale or existing literature. The acceptance criteria should address the potential for tissue
damage and device malfunction for specific functions of the medical device.

Gradient Induced Extrinsic Electrical Potential
(Unintended Stimulation)
The time-varying gradient magnetic fields associated with an MR exam can induce an
electric potential at the electrodes of a lead. Extrinsic electric potential may develop within a
single AIMD lead (intra-lead), between electrodes of a multi-lead AIMD (inter-lead), or
between electrodes and a conductive AIMD enclosure in contact with tissue. The induced
voltage can generate currents that can cause unintended physiologic stimulation or medical
device malfunction. This hazard should be addressed for AIMDs and partially implanted
active medical devices that contain electrodes or leads that contact neural or muscular tissue.
The tests outlined in ISO/TS 10974 measure the amount of unintended charge and the current
flow due to time-varying gradient magnetic fields.
Acceptance criteria should be established based on the location of the medical device in or on
the body and the location in the MR system bore using a scientific rationale or existing
literature.

Rectification of RF pulses from MR Exams
(Unintended Stimulation)
In the context of active medical devices in the MR environment, rectification refers to the
conversion of RF waveforms to slowly varying voltages that are capable of unintended tissue
stimulation. Unintended tissue stimulation can occur if the rectified voltages are generated at
the active medical device electrodes.
This hazard should be addressed for AIMDs, for partially implanted active medical devices
and for non-implanted active medical devices that contain electrodes that contact neural or
muscular tissue. The tests outlined in ISO/TS 10974 measure the levels of rectified voltages
generated by the AIMD during RF exposure. These methods may be adapted for partially
implanted and non-implanted active medical devices that contain electrodes that contact
neural or muscular tissue.
Acceptance criteria should be established based on the location of the medical device in or on
the body and the location in the MR system using a scientific rationale or existing literature.

Medical Device Malfunction
The exposure to the MR environment of active medical devices (e.g., AIMDs, partially
implanted active devices, patient monitors, infusion pumps, active accessories, RF tuned
components, and magnetizing components) and passive medical devices with magnetic or
magnetically controlled components (e.g., magnetic switches and inductive loops) or
thermally controlled components may cause the medical device to malfunction. Medical
device malfunction due to exposure to the MR system’s electric and magnetic fields should
be addressed for these types of devices. Such malfunctions can be either temporary during
the MR exposure or procedure, or permanent and continue after the exposure.

For AIMDs or devices with electrical circuits, we recommend that you demonstrate that the
static magnetic fields (B0), time-varying gradient magnetic fields (dB/dt), and pulsed
radiofrequency (RF) fields of the MR system do not affect the performance or safe operation
of the medical device.
ISO/TS 10974 provides standardized test methods for assessing AIMD malfunction in the
MR environment. These include potential malfunctions induced by MR fields, including:
·
·
·
·

Static magnetic field (B0)
RF fields
Time-varying gradient magnetic fields (dB/dt)
Combined fields

The test methods outlined in ISO/TS 10974 involve measurements and testing in both
simulated and actual MR systems. They also include testing for each type of field separately.
Because the field exposure during MR exams involves concurrent exposure of static
magnetic field, RF and pulsed gradient fields, the medical device should also be tested by
exposing the medical device to typical MR pulse sequences in an MR system using the
ISO/TS 10974 test methods for combined fields. These methods rely on testing a medical
device before the scan and monitoring the medical device during the scan, if applicable, to
verify each intended function. The device should be assessed for proper operation as per
intended use within 30 minutes of the exposure and should be tested comprehensively for
damage and malfunction with 14 days of the exposure. This method simulates MR exams in
a clinical setting and helps to demonstrate medical device safety and function through
performance function tests. The timeline for the combined fields testing is important because
malfunction or EMI to the medical device can be permanent or temporary.
For non-implanted active medical devices or medical devices anticipated to be actively used
during the MR exposure, you should demonstrate that the MR system does not affect or
degrade the operation of the medical device in its intended use location. For example, for a
patient monitor anticipated to remain outside the 20 mT (200 gauss) field line, you should
demonstrate that the patient monitor continues to meet its performance specifications while
in its location within the MR environment.
Medical device malfunction due to exposure to the MR system electric and magnetic fields is
not generally expected for passive medical devices, although there can be exceptions for
which medical device malfunction in the MR environment should be assessed, such as for
implanted passive drug infusion pumps that are activated by body temperature, medical
devices with inductive loops, oxygen tank regulators containing ferromagnetic springs, or
magnetically activated or operated switches. For these types of passive medical devices, we
recommend you demonstrate that exposure to the static magnetic fields (B0), time-varying
magnetic fields (dB/dt), and/or RF fields, as appropriate, do not adversely affect the
performance or safe operation of the medical device.
Acceptance criteria should be based on safety and the essential performance of the medical
device.
13

In addition to electrical and magnetic fields, acoustic noise should also be considered if the
device or accessory is susceptible to interference from the acoustic exposure of the MR
system (e.g., a servo ventilator with a pressure sensor that may receive a signal generated as
acoustic noise by the MR system).
In addition to malfunction of the medical device, you should assess and demonstrate that the
medical device does not affect the operation of the MR system.

Extent of Image Artifact
The presence of metallic implants or other medical devices can lead to artifacts in the acquired
MR images. The operation of an active medical device may lead to artifacts or corruption of
the acquired MR images. Both can lead to uninterpretable or non-diagnostic images or diseasemimicking artifacts. This issue should be addressed for all medical devices anticipated to enter
the MR environment by including a statement in the MR Conditional labeling to inform health
care providers about the potential for medical device induced image artifacts.
ASTM F2119 provides a standardized test method for the assessment of susceptibility image
artifact. While the scope of this standard is passive implanted medical devices, the method
can also be applied to AIMDs, partially implanted medical devices, or non-implanted
medical devices that are anticipated to be in the MR system bore.
For medical devices that come in multiple sizes, the largest medical device or the medical
device with the largest amount of magnetic material can generally serve as a worst-case for
assessing magnetic susceptibility image artifact. For multi-component medical devices, all
clinically relevant configurations should be considered to determine which one(s) adequately
represent the worst-case(s) for assessing image artifact, a scientific rationale provided, and
assessment and/or testing performed accordingly.
For electrically active medical devices that do not enter the MR system bore,
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) emissions should meet criteria defined for the special
environment35 as specified by the MR system manufacturer.36 While no standardized test
methods currently exist to assess image artifact produced by electrically active medical
devices that do not enter the MR system bore, a qualitative assessment of image quality and a
measurement of signal to noise ratio (SNR) using standardized test methods (such as NEMA
MS 137) with and without the medical device present may be useful.
In general, there are no acceptance criteria for image artifact, as the intent of including image
artifact information in the medical device labeling is to provide health care providers
information they can use in making the benefit-risk decision about the MR exam for the
35 IEC 60601-1-2 Medical electrical equipment -Part 1-2: General Requirements for Basic Safety and Essential

patient. Additional information regarding image artifact may be needed for implanted
medical devices (e.g., cochlear implants) for which follow-up MR exam is routinely
performed. If you wish to indicate in your medical device labeling that diagnostic MRI is
possible within a specified distance of an implanted medical device (e.g., MR angiography to
demonstrate vessel patency after aneurysm coil placement), this claim should be supported in
your premarket submission.

Reporting Results
We recommend you provide test report summaries, and if applicable, complete test reports,
as described in the FDA guidance titled “Recommended Content and Format of NonClinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.”38 In addition,
you should provide the following information in the test report summaries and complete test
reports:
·
·

·

·

·

·

List the hazard addressed by the test.
List the test equipment used. When testing is performed using an MR system, please
specify the system field strength, manufacturer, model, and software version. If
appropriate, also list MRI sequences used in the test.
When using a consensus standard in which the content of a test report is defined, results
should be reported as defined in the consensus standard. If computational modeling is
used, the report should follow the FDA Guidance “Reporting of Computational Modeling
Studies in Medical Device Submissions.”39
For testing based on ASTM F2182, the RF induced heating results should be expressed in
°C/(V/m) or in °C/(W/kg), where V/m and W/kg refer to the local background levels in
the ASTM phantom in the absence of the tested device.
When ASTM F2182 is used, the values for °C/(V/m) or in °C/(W/kg) should be scaled to
a temperature increase (in °C) for the exposure conditions specified in the MR
Conditional labeling. The scaling of results from ASTM F2182 to create MR Conditional
labeling can be performed using computational modeling or a scientific rationale.
As an alternative to a written narrative for each non-clinical bench performance test, a
tabulated summary can be provided to organize the information recommended in a test
report summary (see Table 1 below for an example of the format). If a summary table is
used, it is still recommended that a narrative discussion of the results/conclusions be
provided as described in Section II.A.6 of the FDA guidance titled “Recommended
Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance Testing Information in
Premarket Submissions,”40 when needed. An example for a passive implant is shown in
Table 2 in Appendix 1.

MRI Safety Labeling
A premarket submission must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy any
applicable requirements for the type of premarket submission (e.g., 21 CFR 807.87(e) or
21 CFR 406 814.20(b)(10)). In addition, device labeling must satisfy all applicable FDA
labeling requirements, including, but not limited to, 21 CFR part 801. Your device
labeling should include sufficient information for a healthcare professional to determine
whether a device can safely enter the MR environment. Specifically, we recommend that
you include information describing the safety of your medical device in the MR
environment in a separate section of your labeling entitled “MRI Safety Information.”
To make it easier for users to locate, we recommend that this section be included in the
table of contents of your labeling document(s), if applicable. Based on the results of your
assessment, you should label your medical device as MR Safe, MR Unsafe, or MR
Conditional, and include the appropriate symbol from ASTM F2503 and/or the
corresponding term in your labeling. The color versions of the symbols are
recommended, but the black and white versions can be used. As original labeling may
not always be available to patients and healthcare providers for the entire life of the
medical device, the MRI safety information should be readily accessible, for instance on
the manufacturer’s website and/or by telephone, taking care to clearly and
unambiguously identify the medical device in all labeling. The term MR Compatible,
which appeared in a 1997 FDA draft guidance document and was frequently
misinterpreted, is obsolete, and should not be used.
By definition, MR Safe medical devices are composed of materials that are electrically
nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic.41 For the purposes of determining the safety
of a medical device in the MR environment, a medical device can be defined as electrically
nonconductive if the conductivity is less than 2 S/m, given that the conductivities of some
41 ASTM F2503 -20 Standard Practice for Marking Medical Devices and other Items for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance

Environment

human tissues reach this value. Most plastics, glass, and many ceramic materials are MR
Safe.42 A scientific rationale (e.g., including information about the electrical conductivity and
magnetic properties of the device material(s)) rather than testing can be used to support an
MR Safe designation. Small metallic devices such as metal markers or polymer devices
containing small metal radiopaque markers are not MR Safe because they contain metal and
should be labeled MR Conditional. However, depending on the metal used, the MR
Conditional labeling can be developed using a scientific rationale rather than testing.
Electrically active medical devices should be designated either MR Conditional or MR
Unsafe, but not MR Safe because they contain electrically conductive components.
MRI safety labeling should include information for both patients and healthcare
providers. As appropriate for the specific medical device, this should include
information for the healthcare provider implanting or prescribing the medical device, the
physician or other healthcare provider who provides continuing care for the patient with
the medical device, and the healthcare provider who prescribes the MR exam. In
developing this labeling information, please be aware that the healthcare provider
prescribing the MR exam may not have implanted or provided the medical device to the
patient or may be the healthcare provider who provides follow-up care to the patient
with the medical device. For MR Conditional devices with conditions that restrict the
MR system operation below Normal Operating Mode, the labeling should include
information for the patient and healthcare providers that the MR conditions for safe use
may limit the availability and diagnostic quality of some MR procedures.
The healthcare provider labeling should clearly and unambiguously identify the medical
device, identify the MRI safety status of the medical device (MR Safe, MR Unsafe, or
MR Conditional), and if the medical device is MR Conditional, provide the conditions
for safe use in the MR environment. If the medical device is anticipated to enter the bore
of the MR system, the conditions for safe use in the MR environment should include
instructions for safely performing the MR procedure on a patient with the medical
device. This might include patient preparation, procedural instructions, special medical
device operating modes, illustrations, peripheral equipment needed, any patient or
medical device monitoring or intervention during and after scanning, or other
instructions to ensure safety. All intended and expected operation of the medical device
during an MR exam should be clearly explained. Information describing the image
artifacts caused by the presence of the device should also be provided.
The patient labeling should clearly and unambiguously identify the medical device and
identify the MRI safety status of the medical device (MR Safe, MR Unsafe, or MR
Conditional). For MR Unsafe implants and medical devices that are fastened to or
carried by the patient, the patient labeling should clearly inform the patient that they
should not receive an MR exam while the device is implanted or fastened to the patient.
For MR Conditional medical devices, the patient information should direct the patient to
consult with their healthcare provider prior to an MR exam and inform MRI site

personnel that they have an MR Conditional medical device during MR screening prior
to the MR exam. For MR Conditional medical devices for which patient preparation,
peripheral equipment or specialized personnel for an MR exam is needed, this
information should be described in the patient labeling.
To allow medical professionals to identify the specific medical devices a patient has, the
MRI safety status of the medical devices, and the conditions for safe use in the MR
environment for MR Conditional devices, we recommend that the patient labeling
include a patient medical device card for implanted medical devices and for the patient’s
medical devices that are fastened to or carried by the patient. The patient medical device
card should clearly and unambiguously identify the medical device, the MRI safety
status of the medical device (MR Safe, MR Unsafe, or MR Conditional), and, if the
medical device is MR Conditional, either provide the conditions for safe MRI scanning
or direct users to the location (i.e., via a URL and/or telephone number) where the MR
Conditional labeling can be found.
Recommendations for the content and format of labeling for MR Safe, MR Unsafe, and MR
Conditional medical devices are given below and in the Appendices. Example labeling for
MR Safe, MR Unsafe, and MR Conditional medical devices are also given below and in the
Appendices.

MR Safe
The MRI safety information for an MR Safe medical device should indicate that the medical
device is MR Safe as defined in ASTM F2503 and as shown below. By definition, MR Safe
medical devices do not contain any metal and are composed entirely of materials that are
electrically nonconductive, nonmetallic, and nonmagnetic. An MR Safe medical device can
safely be taken into any MR environment. MR Safe medical devices have no constraints or
conditions on the MR environment or the use of the device in the MR environment. If there
are any constraints or conditions on the MR environment or on the presence or use of the
medical device in the MR environment, the device should not be labeled MR Safe.
For non-implanted medical devices, this information should appear directly on the medical
device if possible. To provide MRI safety information that is concise and easy to understand,
we recommend that labeling for MR Safe medical devices not include additional information
that is not needed for the medical professional to safely administer an MR exam (e.g., the
scientific rationale upon which the MR Safe determination was made). Labeling example:
MRI Safety Information

or
And/or a statement such as “The <insert medical device name> is MR Safe.”

18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

MR Unsafe
The MRI safety information for an MR Unsafe medical device should indicate that the
medical device is MR Unsafe and should remain outside the MRI scanner room as shown
below. For non-implanted medical devices, the MR Unsafe icon should appear directly on
the medical device if possible. If applicable, the labeling should also indicate that the medical
device may be a projectile hazard. To provide MRI safety information that is concise and
easy to understand, we recommend that labeling for MR Unsafe medical devices not include
additional information that is not needed for the medical professional to safely administer an
MR exam (e.g., the scientific rationale upon which the MR Unsafe determination was made).
For example:
MRI Safety Information
And/or a statement such as “The < insert medical device name > is MR Unsafe.”
and, if appropriate, the statement “The device presents a projectile hazard.”
For non-implanted medical devices, the MR Unsafe labeling should appear directly on the
medical device if possible. For example:

WARNING
Projectile Hazard

For implanted medical devices and for a patient’s medical devices that are fastened to or
carried by the patient (e.g., external insulin pump), we recommend that you provide a patient
medical device card. For an MR Unsafe medical device, the patient medical device card
should include the following information:
·

The MR Unsafe symbol and/or the term “MR Unsafe,” and

·

A statement such as: “This person <choose “is implanted with” or “has”> a
<insert medical device name>. Do not enter an MRI scanner room or an MR
system. Doing so may result in <choose one or more of “injury” or “severe
injury” and/or “death”> and

·

URL and/or phone number for the medical device manufacturer.

MR Conditional
The labeling for MR Conditional medical devices should include the MR Conditional
symbol,
, and/or the term “MR Conditional” and list the conditions under which a
medical device that is anticipated to enter the MR environment (or a patient with an implant
or a medical device that is fastened to or carried by the patient) can safely enter the MR

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

environment as described in ASTM F2503. The conditions of safe use should ensure safety
but also be as concise and easy to implement as possible. Because the conditions for safe use
may change over time (e.g., with the introduction of new field strength MR systems),
consideration should be given to the means for providing the most current conditions for safe
use. For MR Conditional devices with conditions that restrict the MR system operation below
Normal Operating Mode, the labeling should include information for the patient and
healthcare providers that the MR conditions for safe use may limit the availability and
diagnostic quality of some MR procedures. If scanning a patient with an MR Conditional
device could produce pain, this should be noted in the labeling.
For an MR Conditional medical device, the patient medical device card should include at
least the following MRI safety information:
·

The MR Conditional symbol and/or the term “MR Conditional,” and

·

A statement such as: “This person <choose “is implanted with” or “has”> a
<insert medical device name> and can safely undergo an MR exam only
under very specific conditions. Scanning under different conditions may
result in <choose one or more of “injury” or “severe injury” and/or
“death”> or device malfunction. Full MRI safety information is available in
the MRI Safety Information section of the <insert name of
document/manual containing MRI safety information>, which can be
obtained at www.<insert URL> or by calling <insert phone number>.”

Patient medical device cards for specific medical device types may need additional
information (e.g., patient name and implantation date).
Patient medical device cards for devices with relatively few conditions (e.g., many passive
implants) can list the conditions for safe entry and use in the MR environment rather than a
general statement such as the example above.

MR Conditional Medical Devices anticipated to enter the MR system bore
The MR Conditional labeling for a medical device anticipated to enter the MR system bore
should include:
1. The MR Conditional symbol and/or the term “MR Conditional,” and
2. Nominal value(s) of permitted static magnetic field strength [T]
The following information should be included when needed for the specific medical device.
Note that if a parameter is not listed, no modifications of that parameter are needed for the
safe scanning of a patient with the specific medical device.
1. Nucleus being imaged by MRI. If no nucleus is listed, the nucleus is assumed to be
1

breaks) followed by a wait time of <insert number> minutes if this limit is reached.”)
8. MR exam exclusion zones and information on patient position relative to the MR
system (e.g., laser-landmark positions). Include a diagram showing the exclusion
zone(s) for imaging.
9. Information about image artifact. For example: “The presence of this implant may
produce an image artifact. Some manipulation of scan parameters may be needed to
compensate for the artifact.” Additional information regarding image artifact should
be included if you wish to indicate in your medical device labeling that diagnostic
MRI is possible within a specified distance of an implanted medical device.
10. Instructions to be followed before and/or after an MR exam (e.g., patient preparation,
medical device checks or programming for special modes).
11. Additional instructions or information essential for safe use in the MR environment.
(e.g., information about scanning patients with other devices. For example: “Patients
who have other MR Conditional devices can be scanned as long all the MR
Conditional scan parameters for each of the devices are met. Do not conduct an MRI
scan if any conditions for safe scanning for any device cannot be met.”; information
for active medical devices about how to proceed when an alarm signal is present)
12. A statement such as: “If information about a specific parameter is not included, there
are no conditions associated with that parameter.”
For item 7 above although the actual implant heating values from bench testing or
computational modeling are not needed in the labeling, these values will inform the safe MR
exam.
For devices that are less than 2 cm long in all directions and at least 3 cm from another
passive metallic medical implant for which RF induced heating testing was not conducted,

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

we recommend an SAR of 2 W/kg (Normal Operating Mode) and a maximum scan time of
one hour after which a cooling period is needed.
For devices that are 2 cm or longer, the labeling should consider whether the intended
location in the body is near thermally sensitive tissue (i.e., brain, eyes, neural tissue, testes,
and ovaries). For devices contacting thermally sensitive tissue, the safe continuous scan
period is restricted compared to devices intended for thermally less sensitive tissue as
described below:
Devices adjacent to thermally sensitive tissue:
If the device is expected to heat adjacent tissue up to 2 °C in 15 minutes in Normal Operating
Mode, it can be labeled for 1 hour of continuous scanning in Normal Operating Mode
without a cooling period. 43,44 A cooling period is needed for longer scans. For devices that
heat adjacent tissues more than 2 °C in 15 minutes, the manufacturer should provide an
appropriate continuous scan time with cooling period.
Device adjacent to thermally less-sensitive tissue:
If the device is expected to heat adjacent tissue up to 4 °C in 15 minutes in Normal Mode, it
can be labeled for 1 hour of continuous scanning in Normal Operating Mode without a
cooling period. 45,46 A cooling period is needed for longer scans. For devices that heat
adjacent tissue more than 4 °C in 15 minutes, the manufacturer should provide an appropriate
continuous scan time with cooling period.
We recommend you use a table to list the information in items 1-6. Information in items 7-12
can be included in a table or in another format if that enhances the clarity of the information.
See Table 3 in Appendix 2 for an example of MR Conditional labeling for a passive implant.
See Tables 4a and 4b for an example for an active implant and the conditions for safe
scanning that could be clearly provided in a table. To further enhance clarity, we recommend
including a diagram showing the allowable scan regions with each table. Information that is
more clearly provided in a non-tabular format can be included after the tables, for instance
instructions to be followed before and/or after an MR exam (e.g., patient preparation,
medical device checks or programming for special modes) and additional instructions or
information essential for safe use in the MR environment.

Labeling for MR Conditional medical devices anticipated to enter the MR environment but
remain outside the bore of the MR system should provide the conditions under which the
medical device can be safely used. Because of variability between MR systems, the MRI
safety information should include positional conditions in terms of maximum static magnetic
field (also known as gauss line restrictions) [e.g., 20 mT (200 gauss)] rather than distances.
The MRI safety information for active medical devices should include information directing
the user on how to proceed when an alarm signal is present.
The MR Conditional symbol should be included directly on the medical device when
possible, and if space permits, the conditions for safe use in the MR environment should also
be included on the medical device in a supplementary sign as defined in ASTM F2503. At a
minimum the supplementary sign should include the gauss line restriction. As appropriate,
you should also include statements such as “projectile hazard” or “equipment operation may
be affected” in the supplementary sign.
Table 5 in Appendix 2 shows an example of the MR Conditional labeling for a medical
device anticipated to be used in the MR environment and outside the MR system bore.
Appendix 2 also includes an example of MR Conditional labeling that we recommend you
include directly on the medical device for a medical device that is anticipated to be used in
the MR environment but not anticipated to enter the MR system bore.

Safety in MRI Not Evaluated
For passive implants, passive medical devices that are fastened to or carried by a patient, and
passive medical devices anticipated for use in the MR environment that have historically not
provided any information about MRI safety, the following labeling could be used in certain
circumstances. If used, this information should be included in a section headed “MRI Safety
Information” and included in the table of contents if the labeling has a table of contents. We
recommend you provide a rationale as to why this labeling is appropriate for your medical
device in your premarket submission. The labeling should include the following information:
The <insert medical device name> has not been evaluated for safety in the MR
environment. It has not been tested for heating or unwanted movement in the MR
environment. The safety of <insert medical device name> in the MR environment
is unknown. Performing an MR exam on a person who has this medical device
may result in injury or device malfunction.
You should NOT use the above labeling option if:
·
·

·

there are any known adverse effects or adverse events due to exposure to the MR
environment for the medical device or medical device type, or
the medical device or medical device type has typically been labeled as MR
Conditional or MR Unsafe (for example, including but not limited to
cardiovascular stents, intracranial aneurysm clips, endovascular grafts, and
transprostatic tissue retractors), or
this is a new medical device type, or

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

·
·
·

the medical device contains ferromagnetic material(s), or
the medical device is an active medical device, or
the medical device is a partially implanted medical device.

If you are uncertain whether it is appropriate to label your medical device as “Safety in MRI
Not Evaluated,” we recommend that you submit a pre-submission through the Q-submission
process to obtain feedback prior to submission of a regulatory submission.47
