Electronic Submission Template for
Medical Device De Novo Requests
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing this guidance document to
introduce submitters of De Novo requests1 to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to the current resources and
associated content developed and made publicly available to support De Novo electronic
submissions to FDA. This guidance is intended to represent one of several steps in meeting
FDA’s commitment to the development of electronic submission templates to serve as guided
submission preparation tools for industry to improve submission consistency and enhance
efficiency in the review process.2 This guidance facilitates the implementation of the FDA’s
mandate under section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),
amended by section 207 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) (Pub. L. 115-523) to
provide further standards for the submission by electronic format, a timetable for establishment
of these further standards, and criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the requirements.
FDA’s guidance document “Providing Regulatory Submissions for Medical Devices in
Electronic Format — Submissions Under Section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act” (hereafter referred to as the “745A(b) device parent guidance”) provides a
process for the development of templates to facilitate the preparation, submission, and review of
regulatory submissions for medical devices solely in electronic format. As described in the
1

See section 513(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and 21 CFR part 860, subpart D.
See 163 CONG. REC. S4729-S4736 (daily ed. August 2, 2017) (Food and Drug Administration User Fee
Reauthorization), also available at https://www.fda.gov/media/102699/download, 168 CONG. REC. S5194-S5203

745A(b) device parent guidance, FDA plans to implement the requirements of section
745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act with individual guidances specifying the formats for specific
submissions and corresponding timetables for implementation. This guidance provides such
information for De Novo electronic submissions solely in electronic format.
In section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, Congress granted explicit statutory authorization to
FDA to specify in guidance the electronic submissions requirement by providing standards,
criteria for waivers and exemptions, and a timetable for such submissions. Accordingly, to the
extent that this document provides such requirements under section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C
Act, indicated by the use of mandatory words, such as must or required, this guidance is not
subject to the usual restrictions in section 701(h) of the FD&C Act and FDA’s good guidance
practices (GGPs) regulations, such as the requirement that guidances not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. See 21 CFR 10.115(d).
This document provides guidance on FDA’s interpretation of the statutory requirement for
electronic submissions solely in electronic format. Therefore, to the extent that this guidance
describes recommendations that are not “standards,” “timetable,” or “criteria for waivers” and
“exemptions” under section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, this document does not create or
confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public, but does
represent the Agency’s current thinking on this topic. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to
discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff listed on the title page of this guidance.
To comply with the GGP regulations and make sure that regulated entities and the public
understand that guidance documents are nonbinding, FDA guidances ordinarily contain standard
language explaining that guidances should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. This guidance contains both binding and
nonbinding provisions. Insofar as this guidance provides “standards,” “timetable,” or “criteria for
waivers” and “exemptions” pursuant to section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, it will have a binding
effect.
For those provisions not identified as binding, the contents of this document are not intended to
have the force and effect of law. This document, other than the binding provisions, is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, amended by section 207 of FDARA, requires that presubmissions and submissions for devices under section 510(k), 513(f)(2)(A), 515(c), 515(d),
515(f), 520(g), 520(m), or 564 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act,
and any supplements to such pre-submissions or submissions, including appeals of those
submissions, be submitted in electronic format specified by FDA beginning on such date as
specified by FDA in final guidance. It also mandates that FDA issue draft guidance not later than
2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

October 1, 2019, and a final guidance not later than 1 year after the close of the public comment
period, providing for further standards for the submission by electronic format, a timetable for
establishment of these further standards, and criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the
requirements.4
In addition, in the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV) Commitment
Letter5 from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to Congress, FDA committed to
developing “electronic submission templates that will serve as guided submission preparation
tools for industry to improve submission consistency and enhance efficiency in the review
process” and “[by] FY [fiscal year] 2020, the Agency will issue a draft guidance document on
the use of the electronic submission templates.” In addition, the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter
states that “[n]o later than 12 months after the close of the public comment period, the Agency
will issue a final guidance.” The 745A(b) device parent guidance was intended to satisfy the final
guidance documents referenced in section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act and the MDUFA IV
Commitment Letter. The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022 (MDUFA V)
Commitment Letter affirmed FDA’s commitment to the continued development of electronic
submission templates for a variety of premarket submission types.6
In February 2020, CDRH piloted the use of the electronic Submission Template And Resource
(eSTAR) electronic submission template for 510(k)s through launching the eSTAR Pilot
Program.7 CBER piloted the use of eSTAR for 510(k)s in June 2022.8 The eSTAR template
became available for voluntary use by all 510(k) submitters in September 2020. Mandatory use
of the eSTAR template for 510(k) submissions began in October 2023. In January 2022, CDRH
expanded the eSTAR template to include the ability to submit content for De Novo requests.
During the transition time up to the point when De Novo electronic submissions will be required
(see Section VI.B below), anyone can voluntarily use eSTAR for submission of De Novo
requests. As described below, eSTAR is the only electronic submission template currently
available to enable De Novo electronic submissions.

III. Scope
This guidance describes the technical standards associated with preparation of the electronic
submission template for De Novo classification requests9 that enable submission of the De Novo
electronic submission solely in electronic format. The electronic submission template includes

the information and guided prompts FDA believes will best facilitate the collection and assembly
of the necessary elements of a ‘complete’ submission.10 This guidance is not intended to specify
the user-interface and detailed content of the eSTAR, but instead is limited to establishing the De
Novo electronic format and standards for complying with section 745(A)(b)(3) of the FD&C
Act. FDA intends to implement new versions of eSTAR as relevant policies change. FDA also
has an ongoing process to collect and consider public comments and stakeholder feedback,
which is described on FDA’s website.11

IV. Significant Terminology
For the purpose of this document the following significant terminology is described:
eCopy: An electronic copy is a duplicate device submission in electronic format of the
previously required paper copy submission sent to FDA.12 An electronic copy is not considered
to be an electronic submission, as defined below.
Electronic Submission (eSubmission): The submission package produced by an electronic
submission template13 that contains the data of a ‘complete’14 submission.
eSTAR (electronic Submission Template And Resource): An electronic submission
template15 built within a structured dynamic PDF that guides a user through construction of an
eSubmission. eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission template that is currently
available to facilitate the preparation of De Novo requests as eSubmissions. For simplicity, the
electronic submission created with this electronic submission template is often referred to as an
eSTAR.
Electronic submission template: A guided submission preparation tool for industry. An
electronic submission template walks industry through the relevant contents and components for
the respective premarket submission type and device to facilitate submission preparation and
enhance consistency, quality, and efficiency in the premarket review process.16
Structured data: Data and content that are captured in the fields, dropdown boxes, checkboxes,
etc., within the electronic submission template.
Unstructured data: Data and content that are submitted as attachments to the electronic
submission template.

V. Current Electronic Submission Template Structure,
Format, and Use
The electronic submission template, eSTAR, is the only currently available electronic
submission template at this time to facilitate the preparation of De Novo electronic submissions.
eSTAR consists of a collection of questions, text, logic, and prompts within a template that
guides a user through construction of a ‘complete’ De Novo17 request. eSTAR is highly
automated, includes integrated databases (e.g., FDA product codes, FDA-recognized voluntary
consensus standards), and includes targeted questions designed to collect specific data and
information from the submitter. eSTAR also includes applicable links to regulations, relevant
guidances, and other resources for the submitter’s reference. Finally, eSTAR is structured to
collect and assemble content in the De Novo request as an electronic submission that closely
follows the content of the “SMART” De Novo review memo template used by FDA reviewers.
Given that an electronic submission properly prepared with an electronic submission template
should represent a complete submission,18 the acceptance review under 21 CFR 860.230 has
been largely automated within the eSTAR.19 However, FDA intends to employ a virus scanning
and technical screening process for an eSTAR as part of the acceptance review process. A
technical screening process is a process for verifying that eSTAR responses are consistent with
descriptions of the device(s) (e.g., there are, in fact, no tissue contacting components if indicated
as such) and that there is at least one relevant attachment per each applicable attachment-type
question (e.g., a Software Description attachment is included in response to the Software
Description question if software is applicable to the submission).
A completed eSTAR submission and the use of the technical screening process incorporates the
acceptance review criteria described in 21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(i) through (v). As part of
considering these criteria, FDA staff should determine whether the subject device is a device
type for which De Novo classification is known to be an inappropriate regulatory approach. If
the device does not appear to be eligible for De Novo classification (e.g., a predicate device
exists, an existing classification regulation exists for the same device type, or an approved
PMA(s) exists for the same device type), FDA staff should make this determination during the
technical screening process. The technical screening process is not intended to identify De Novo
requests for which a substantive review is required in order to determine if De Novo
classification is an inappropriate approach (e.g., FDA staff need to conduct a substantive review
of information in the request to research and analyze De Novo eligibility or to determine if
special controls can mitigate the identified risks to health). If FDA determines the device is
ineligible during the technical screening process, FDA considers this to be a basis for placing the
De Novo request on hold (see section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR 860.200, 21 CFR
860.230(c)(1)(ii), and 83 FR 63128).

17

See 21 CFR 860.230 and the FDA guidance “Acceptance Review for De Novo Classification Requests”.
After submitters complete all necessary sections in their eSTAR file correctly, the status message at the top of the
PDF will indicate “eSTAR Complete” to represent a complete submission.
19
For more information on the acceptance process, please see 21 CFR 860.230 and the FDA guidance “Acceptance
Review for De Novo Classification Requests”.

Additionally, in evaluating the criterion described in 21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(iv) FDA staff should
also consider if the De Novo request is for devices of more than one type. It may be appropriate
for FDA to review multiple devices in a single marketing submission under certain
circumstances.20 For example, it may be appropriate for multiple sizes of a device to be reviewed
together in a De Novo request and classified together as the same type of device under a single
regulation. However, if a De Novo requester is instead proposing that multiple device types be
classified under a single De Novo request (e.g., a submission for a device with multiple proposed
indications or technologies that each have different benefit-risk considerations and supporting
datasets would likely constitute more than one device type), the De Novo request should be
placed on hold (see 21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(iv)) and the review team should work with the De
Novo requester to clarify which device type should be the subject of the De Novo request. This
helps ensure efficient use of FDA resources by confining the scientific and regulatory issues in a
submission to a single classification decision so that FDA can render a timely decision and
assess user fees appropriately.
The technical screening process should occur within 15 calendar days of FDA receiving the De
Novo eSTAR.21 FDA will only begin the technical screening for De Novo electronic submissions
where the appropriate user fee has been paid. If the eSTAR is not complete when submitted,
FDA will notify the submitter via email22 and identify the incomplete information, and the De
Novo will be placed on hold. If a replacement eSTAR is not received within 180 days of the date
of technical screening deficiency notification, FDA will consider the De Novo to be withdrawn
and the submission will be closed in the system.23 The technical screening review time does not
impact the review clock for files that pass the technical screening. For a submission that passes
technical screening, the review clock starts on the day the submission was received by FDA.
Once the eSTAR passes technical screening and the De Novo submission is accepted, FDA will
notify the requester electronically.24 If FDA does not complete the technical screening within the
acceptance review period (i.e., within 15 calendar days of receipt), FDA will accept the De Novo
request for review and will notify the requester.25

template responses accurately describe the device.
27
Throughout completion of the eSTAR, submitters can add attachments as unstructured data, including documents,
PDFs, images, and videos that submitters believe are pertinent to the review of their device. In addition, eSTAR will
prompt for any documents that are needed. For example, when the use of clinical testing to support the submission is
affirmatively indicated, eSTAR will automatically prompt for the attachment of clinical testing documents and any
applicable financial certifications or disclosure statements. These attachments appear within the applicable
bookmark of the eSTAR PDF when viewed by the submitter or FDA.

VI. Electronic Submission Template Waivers, Exemptions,
and Timing
With this final guidance, all submissions for De Novo requests, including original, Supplements
and Amendments (amendments include add-to-files and appeals),32 and any other subsequent
submissions to an original submission unless exempted below in Section VI.A of this guidance,
are required to be submitted as electronic submissions as of the implementation date. A De Novo
request that is not provided as an electronic submission as of that date and as described in
Section V above, will not be received unless an exemption from the electronic submission
requirements or a waiver with respect to that submission applies.

A.

Waivers and Exemptions From Electronic Submission
Requirements

Above, FDA identified that De Novo requests are subject to electronic submission requirements
of this final guidance after the implementation date. However, section 745A(b)(2) of the FD&C
Act allows for FDA to set forth criteria for exemptions and waivers from electronic submission
requirements. FDA has identified such criteria for De Novos below.
Exemptions
FDA is exempting the following De Novo submissions/information from the De Novo electronic
submission requirements:
· Interactive review responses;33
· Amendments:34
· Appeals/requests for supervisory review;35
· Substantive summary requests;
· Change in correspondent amendments;
· Amendments after final decision (i.e., add-to-files); and

32

References to supplements and amendments are generally meant to capture the various submission types that
typically occur in association with a De Novo file that is undergoing review or has received a final decision.
33
If the reviewer used interactive review via phone or email, the submitter should reply to the reviewer via email
with the requested attachments and additional information. Other responses to requests for additional information
must be submitted in eSTAR (see “Amendment/Additional Information (AI) Response” category in Table 1 above).
34
These De Novo amendments remain subject to any applicable eCopy requirements. For more information, see the
FDA guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions”.
35
Section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to also require that appeals be submitted solely in such
electronic format as specified by the Agency in guidance. Once FDA develops such a format, FDA intends to update
this guidance to specify any further standards for the submission of De Novo appeals by electronic format, the
timetable for establishment of such further standards, and any criteria for a waiver from such requirements.

Withdrawal requests.36

Waivers
At this time, FDA has not identified any particular circumstances appropriate for a waiver of the
De Novo electronic submission requirements and does not intend to grant requests for waiver.
Given the widespread availability of software to enable use of the current De Novo eSTAR PDF
(available to download on FDA’s website), all submitters should have the ability to provide a De
Novo eSTAR.37

B.

When Electronic Submissions Will Be Required

As described in the 745A(b) device parent guidance, this guidance specifies the corresponding
timetable(s) for implementation of De Novo electronic submissions. FDA is identifying October
1, 2025, as the date on which the De Novo electronic submission requirements will take effect.
This date includes a transition period of a minimum of one year prior to the requirement that all
De Novo submissions be provided as electronic submissions. During the transition period,
eSTARs may be used voluntarily for submission of De Novo requests. As instructed at the
website for the eSTAR Program (under the heading, “How to prepare a submission using
eSTAR”38), the electronic submission must be submitted using FDA’s electronic portal when
submitted to CDRH. You can submit questions pertaining to the preparation of submission in
electronic format to CDRH at OPEQSubmissionSupport@fda.hhs.gov. For electronic
submissions to CBER, please refer to Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format for CBERRegulated Products on how to submit through the Electronic Submissions Gateway. You can
submit questions pertaining to the preparation of submission in electronic format to CBER
at ESUBPREP@fda.hhs.gov.

36

Submission withdrawal requests remain subject to any applicable eCopy requirements.
For more information, see the FDA guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions.” FDA recommends
that withdrawal requests be submitted electronically via email or to the CDRH Portal.
37
There are currently known technical reasons that preclude certain electronic submissions via the CDRH Portal.
Those impacted submissions should be mailed to the CDRH Document Control Center (DCC). For more
information on the known technical reasons, please refer to FDA’s CDRH Portal webpage, available at
