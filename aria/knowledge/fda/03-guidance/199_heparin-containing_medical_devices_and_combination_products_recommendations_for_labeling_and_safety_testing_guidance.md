Heparin-Containing Medical Devices
and Combination Products:
Recommendations for Labeling and
Safety Testing
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

1. Introduction1
The United States Pharmacopeia (USP)2 drug substance monograph for Heparin Sodium, and
drug product monographs for Heparin Lock Flush Solution and Heparin Sodium Injection,
recently have undergone several revisions following serious and fatal events related to the use of
heparin sodium products.3 Investigation of heparin product overdose errors identified the
expression of drug strength in the labels as a major contributing factor in these errors. This
guidance document addresses these safety concerns by clarifying new expectations for labeling
with regard to the revised heparin USP monographs,4 as well as outlining safety testing
recommendations.

The Office of Combination Products (OCP) and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) were
consulted in the preparation of this guidance.

The United States Pharmacopeial Convention is a scientific nonprofit organization that develops standards for the
identity, strength, quality, and purity of drugs and drug ingredients marketed in the United States. These standards
are published in the compendia, U.S. Pharmacopeia and National Formulary (USP-NF). The Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) recognizes the USP-NF as official compendia. Section 201(j) of the FD&C Act.

USP Monograph: Heparin Sodium, USP Monograph: Heparin Sodium Injection, USP Monograph: Heparin Lock
Flush Solution. The FD&C Act generally requires a drug product to conform with an applicable official USP drug
product monograph. Sections 501(b) and 502(g) of the FD&C Act.

In addition, the outbreak of serious and often fatal events due to heparin contamination with
oversulfated chondroitin sulfate (OSCS) in 2008 led the USP to include in its drug substance
monograph additional testing of heparin sodium to ensure its quality and purity. This guidance
also outlines use of conformance to the monographs in premarket submissions, namely testing
specified in the current USP monographs and testing and documentation recommendations
contained in the guidance document “Heparin for Drug and Medical Device Use: Monitoring
Crude Heparin for Quality.”5,6
Note that recommendations made in this guidance reflect FDA’s current position on this issue
and may change in the future as new scientific information or new detection methods become
available. FDA intends to revise this guidance document as needed to reflect any additional
revisions to these USP heparin monographs.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2. Scope
This guidance provides labeling and safety testing recommendations for medical devices and for
combination products that include heparin sodium or low molecular weight heparin that have a
device primary mode of action (PMOA) or are otherwise assigned to CDRH for regulation.7
Note that some devices for in vitro diagnostic uses include heparin. Such products can be
classified as devices if the heparin would not come into contact with the body when the product
is used as intended. Products that include a device and heparin for in vivo use are combination
products.8 Products that include only bonded coatings of heparin sodium or low molecular
weight heparins with a fixed total dose of heparin are unlikely to pose a risk of heparin overdose
and recommendations in this guidance may not be warranted; however, recommendations in this
guidance may be appropriate for these types of products in certain instances, such as in cases
where significant amounts of heparin are found to be released.

The Agency updates guidances periodically. To make sure you have the most recent version of this guidance,
check the FDA guidance page at
https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm.

Center assignment for combination products is based on which constituent part (the drug or device in this case)
provides the PMOA, i.e., makes the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the
combination product. See section 503(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 3.2(m). If PMOA cannot be determined
with reasonable certainty, Center assignment is based on application of the criteria at 21 CFR 3.4(b).

3. Background
Heparin has been identified as a high-alert medication by the Institute for Safe Medication
Practices (ISMP) due to a heightened risk of patient harm when dosed incorrectly. In 2003, the
USP's Safe Medication Use Expert Committee recognized a recurring trend of medication errors
related to misinterpretation of the expression of concentration on the labeling of injectable
products, resulting in serious consequences to patients, including death. Heparin products span a
wide range of doses and concentrations based on the indication for use for the product as well as
the intended patient population. Heparin administration for systemic anticoagulation is provided
as final concentrations ranging from 50-100 units/mL. The source vials from which these
dilutions are prepared contain concentrations ranging from 1,000-20,000 units/mL. When
heparin sodium is only intended to maintain patency of an indwelling intravascular catheter, the
heparin lock flush solution (which is regulated by FDA as a drug-device combination product
with a device PMOA (see 71 FR 47499 (August 17, 2006)), typically includes heparin
concentrations ranging from 1-100 units/mL packaged in 1-30 mL vials with total drug content
ranging from 1 unit to 1,000 units or a variety of fill volumes in prefilled syringes with total drug
amounts per syringe ranging from 1 unit to 500 units.
In 2007, the USP Parenteral Products-Industrial Expert Committee recommended revisions to the
new "Strength and Total Volume for Single- and Multiple-Dose Injectable Drug Products"
section of USP General Chapter <1> Injections. These revisions became official in 2009 and this
information was subsequently relocated to General Chapter <7> Labeling in 2016. This chapter
directs that for single- and multiple-dose injectable drug products, the strength per total volume
should be the primary and prominent expression on the principal display panel of the label,
followed in close proximity by strength per mL enclosed by parentheses. Following these
changes, FDA and ISMP expressed concern that the labeling prescribed in the Heparin Lock
Flush Solution monograph (and in the Heparin Sodium Injection monograph) was inconsistent
with General Chapter <7> Labeling. USP’s Expert Committees, including the committee
responsible for these Heparin monographs at that time, Monographs-Biologics and
Biotechnology 1, proposed revisions to the labeling sections of the heparin monographs that
would incorporate the USP standards for labeling for injectable medications, specifically, USP
General Chapter <1> Injections, Strength and Total Volume for Single- and Multiple-Dose
Injectable Drug Products (which now appears in <7> Labeling). Those revisions became
official May 1, 2013.

4. Labeling Statements
A. For Heparin Lock Flush Solution Products
The USP monograph for Heparin Lock Flush Solution requires the product labels9 express
strength per total container volume as the primary expression of strength, followed in close

Under section 201(k) of the FD&C Act, “The term ‘label’ means a display of written, printed, or graphic matter
upon the immediate container of any article; and a requirement made by or under authority of this Act that any word,
statement, or other information appear on the label shall not be considered to be complied with unless such word,

proximity by strength per mL enclosed by parentheses, for single- and multiple-dose injectable
drug products. The strength per total volume should be the primary and prominent expression on
the principal display panel of the label.10 For example:
Total strength/total volume: 100 USP Units/10 mL
Strength/mL:
(10 USP Units/mL)
For products containing a volume of less than 1 mL, the strength per fraction of an mL should be
the only expression of strength.11 For example;
Strength/mL:

100 USP Units/0.5 mL

For products containing a volume equal to 1 mL, the strength should be expressed as strength per
mL, not strength/1 mL.
Strength/mL:

100 USP Units/mL

The Agency further recommends that the above information be included in the instructions for
use as part of the device/combination product description. Consistent with the monograph, the
label must identify the organ (e.g., intestinal mucosa) and the animal species (e.g., porcine) from
which the heparin sodium is derived.12

B. For Heparin­Bonded Products
Specific labeling for the amount and strength of heparin for heparin-bonded products is not
generally needed. However, there may be additional labeling considerations based on the specific
device type and review of the product. For example, the Agency may recommend that the
amount and strength of heparin be included in the label if significant amounts of heparin were
found to be leaching from a product. In such cases, the total amount of heparin per total surface
area should be displayed on the primary package label followed by the concentration per area
unit in parentheses. For example:
Total amount of heparin/total surface area: 100 USP Units/total surface area2
Strength/area unit:
(10 USP Units/unit of surface area2)
The Agency further recommends that the above information, if requested, be included in the
instructions for use as part of the device/combination product description. For all heparin-bonded
products, the Agency recommends the labeling identify the tissue (e.g., intestinal mucosa) and
the animal species (e.g., porcine) from which the heparin sodium is derived.

5. Safety Testing for Heparin-Containing Products
Manufacturers of heparin lock flush solutions must comply with the current USP monograph for
that product, as well as the USP drug substance monograph for Heparin Sodium. Manufacturers
of heparin sodium injections must comply with the current USP monograph for that product, as
well as the USP drug substance monograph for Heparin Sodium. See sections 501(b) and 502(g)
of the FD&C Act. Firms are also recommended to follow the guidance document, “Heparin for
Drug and Medical Device use: Monitoring Crude Heparin for Quality,” mentioned above. 13,14 In
addition, we recommend that manufacturers who receive heparin sodium drug substance or
active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is represented to be “USP” to produce a combination
product or an in vitro diagnostic medical device that includes heparin sodium or low molecular
weight heparin ensure and document that the heparin has been tested according to the current
USP drug substance monograph, and that it is manufactured and/or tested consistent with
applicable guidance documents on heparin. Manufacturers of medical devices and combination
products containing heparin must comply with the elements of safety testing that are required to
be performed and documented as part of compliance with the Quality System (QS) regulation for
devices (21 CFR 820), and with both the QS regulation and current good manufacturing practice
requirements for drugs if the product is a combination product (see 21 CFR Part 4).
Premarket submissions to CDRH – premarket notification (510(k)) submissions, premarket
approval (PMA) applications, De Novo requests, and humanitarian device exemption (HDE)
applications – should describe the heparin product in detail and document compliance with
heparin safety testing. Please note, however, that heparin testing data and records should be
maintained on file with the medical device or combination product manufacturer, but do not need
to be included in premarket submissions. See Appendix A for more details. The premarket
submission should include the following information:
·

Heparin source-tissue and confirmation of species origin (e.g., porcine intestinal
mucosa);

·

Identification of the actual manufacturer (i.e., name, address, and contact information) of
the heparin sodium API and any repackagers and distributors who handle the heparin
sodium before receipt.

The premarket submission should also provide the following to indicate the manufacturer’s
conformance with testing parameters from the guidance “Heparin for Drug and Medical Device
Use: Monitoring Crude Heparin for Quality.”
·

Testing for OSCS using methods that are qualified and suitable for detecting low levels
of OSCS concentrations (e.g., strong anion exchange high-pressure liquid
chromatography and 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance).
