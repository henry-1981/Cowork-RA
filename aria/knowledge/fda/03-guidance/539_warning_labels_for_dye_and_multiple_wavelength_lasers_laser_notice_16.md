MAD 9 1077

TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Wording of Required Warning Labels For Dye Laser and Other
Multiple Wavelength Lasers, 21 CFR 1040.10(g)

BACKGROUND: A laser is capable of emitting, at the discretion of the
user, laser radiation in a number of ranges in the visible and invisible
portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The laser manufacturer asks
what wording should be provided on the required warning logotype which
would fulfill the requirements of 21 CFR 1040.10(g) (5) and (8) and be
appropriate to the product. The manufacturer comments that the following
problems exist: (1) A listing of all possible wavelengths would not
accurately indicate the particular hazard that might be present at any
given time, and (2) in the case of dye lasers, the maximum output of the
pumped laser is also dependent on the laser used for pumping which
cannot be controlled by the dye laser manufacturer.

POLICY: If a laser could be made to produce either visible or invisible
laser radiation and perhaps both visible and invisible laser radiation
simultaneously, it would be acceptable for a manufacturer to appropriately
precede the word "radiation" on the required warning labels with the

words "visible and/or invisible". The Bureau would not object to the
addition of a note on warning labels refering the user to the operation
or instruction manual for further information.

Since no specific wording is required for the radiation output information
on the warning logotype (21 CFR 1040.10(g) (5)), the following statements
of laser medium or wavelength of emitted laser radiation might be used

at position 2 of the required warning logotype of a dye laser:

"DYE LASER - VARIOUS ULTRAVIOLET, VISIBLE OR INFRARED WAVELENGTHS
MAY BE EMITTED. CONSULT INSTRUCTION MANUAL."; or

"DYE LASER ~ WAVELENGTHS EMITTED MAY RANGE FROM nm to nm.
CONSULT INSTRUCTION MANUAL."

A similar statement would be used for other types of multiple wavelength
lasers as appropriate.

Since the maximum output level of a dye laser is dependant upon and
limited to that of the input radiation, a statement to this effect would
be adequate, for example:

"MAXIMUM OUTPUT DEPENDS ON DYE, MIRRORS. AND PUMPING LASER — CONSULT
INSTRUCTION MANUAL AND LABEL ON PUMPING LASER FOR MAXIMUM POWER."

Policy Statement #16

ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS 2

This statement would serve to direct the attention of the reader of this
information to the warning logotype of the pumping laser.

INVITATION TO COMMENT: The Bureau is considering an amendment to the
performance standard for laser products which may provide an opportunity
in the future for manufacturers to seek greater flexibility in the
wording of warning logotypes and other required labels. In the interim,
the above policy shall apply to the circumstances as described. Comments
on this policy are invited.
