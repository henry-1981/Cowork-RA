Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies 
 
 
 
 
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.  It 
does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  
You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and 
regulations.  If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for 
implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate 
number listed on the title page of this guidance. 
 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
This guidance is intended to provide advice to sponsors, clinical investigators, and institutional 
review boards (IRBs) on how to determine the differences between significant risk and 
nonsignificant risk medical device studies.  This document supersedes Significant Risk and 
Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies (September 1998) Office of Health Affairs, Food 
and Drug Administration.  This document was revised to update the list of examples of 
significant and nonsignificant risk devices, to clarify the IRB’s responsibilities when making the 
risk determination for investigational medical devices, and to make the guidance consistent with 
the Agency’s good guidance practices regulations (21 CFR 10.115). 
 
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should 
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are 
cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
recommended, but not required. 
 
II. BACKGROUND 
 
 
1 This guidance document was developed by the Good Clinical Practice Program in coordination with the Agency 
Centers.

The Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812) describes three types of 
device studies: significant risk (SR), nonsignificant risk (NSR), and exempt studies.  In this 
guidance, we discuss the two types of studies that are subject to the IDE regulation – the SR and 
NSR studies.  For information on studies that are exempt from the IDE regulation, see the 
Information Sheet Guidance entitled, “Frequently Asked Questions About Medical Devices.”     
III. 
SIGNIFICANT RISK AND NON-SIGNIFICANT RISK DEVICE STUDIES 
  
  
A. 
What is a Significant Risk Device Study? 
  
Under 21 CFR 812.3(m), an SR device means an investigational device that: 
  
• Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject; 
• Is purported or represented to be for use supporting or sustaining human life and presents a 
potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; 
• Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, 
or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk 
to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or 
• Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.    
B. 
What is a Nonsignificant Risk Device Study? 
  
  
An NSR device study is one that does not meet the definition for an SR device study.  
  
C. 
Who Decides Whether A Device Study is SR or NSR? 
  
Sponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and presenting it to the IRB.  
FDA is also available to help the sponsor, clinical investigator, and IRB in making the risk 
determination.2 
  
Unless FDA has already made a risk determination for the study, the IRB must review the 
sponsor's SR or NSR determination for every investigational medical device study reviewed and 
modify the determination if the IRB disagrees with the sponsor.  If FDA has already made the 
SR or NSR determination for the study, the agency's determination is final.  FDA is available to 
help the IRB when making its risk determination.  (Also, see section VII. “How does an IRB 
document the SR or NSR determination?”) 
  
  
2 See the guidance entitled, “Procedures for Handling Inquiries Regarding the Need for an Investigational Device 
Exemptions Application for Research Involving Medical Devices.”  This guidance may be found at: 
www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulatonandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm126598.

FDA is the final arbiter as to whether a device study is SR or NSR and makes the determination 
when an IDE is submitted to FDA or if asked by the sponsor, clinical investigator, or IRB.  See 
21 CFR § 812.2(b)(1) 
 
D. 
What are the Major Differences Between SR And NSR Device Studies? 
 
The major differences between SR and NSR studies are in the IDE approval process and in the 
sponsor’s record keeping and reporting requirements, as outlined below.  
 
1. Significant 
Risk (SR) Device Studies 
 
• SR device studies must follow all the IDE regulations at 21 CFR 812.   
 
• SR device studies must have an IDE application approved by FDA before they may proceed.  
 
2. 
Nonsignificant Risk (NSR) Device Studies 
 
• NSR device studies must follow the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b). 
 
• These abbreviated requirements address labeling, IRB approval, informed consent, 
monitoring, records, reports, and prohibition against promotion.  However, there is no need 
to make progress reports or final reports to FDA. 
 
• NSR device studies do not have to have an IDE application approved by FDA.  
 
• Sponsors and IRBs do not have to report the IRB approval of an NSR device study to FDA.  
This means that an IRB may approve an NSR device study and an investigator may conduct 
the study without FDA knowing about it.   
 
• An IRB’s NSR determination is important because the IRB serves as the FDA’s surrogate for 
review, approval, and continuing review of the NSR device studies.  An NSR device study 
may start at the institution as soon as the IRB reviews and approves the study and without 
prior approval by FDA. 
 
IV. 
WHAT ARE THE SPONSOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN INITIATING A 
 
DEVICE STUDY? 
 
A. 
For Nonsignificant Risk Device Studies 
 
• If the sponsor identifies a study as NSR, the sponsor must provide the reviewing IRB an 
explanation of its determination (21 CFR 812.2(b)(1)(ii)) and should provide any other 
information that may help the IRB in evaluating the risk of the study.  For example, a 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
 
 
 5
description of the device, reports of prior investigations with the device, the proposed 
investigational plan, subject selection criteria, and other information the IRB may need.   
 
• If FDA has determined that the study is NSR, the sponsor should so inform the IRB. 
By providing such risk determination information to the IRB, the IRB’s workload should be 
reduced and the review process should be facilitated.   
 
B. 
For Significant Risk Device Studies 
 
• The sponsor must submit an IDE application to FDA and obtain the agency’s approval of the 
study.   (See 21 CFR 812.20(a)(1) and (2)) 
 
• The sponsor must advise its clinical investigators about the SR status and obtain their 
agreement to comply with the applicable regulations governing such studies (i.e., 21 CFR 
Parts, 50, 56, 812)  (See 21 CFR 812.43(c)(4)(i)).  Sponsors should provide the IDE number 
and/or a copy of the IDE approval letter to the IRB when requested. 
 
• Sponsors may send their SR device study to an IRB for review before the IDE application is 
approved by FDA.  However, FDA cautions that an SR device study may not begin until 
FDA approves the IDE. 
 
V. 
WHAT ARE THE IRB’S RESPONSIBILITIES WHEN IT RECEIVES A DEVICE 
STUDY FOR REVIEW? 
 
• IRBs should have standard operating procedures that explain how the IRB makes SR and 
NSR determinations and that the decision should be documented.  FDA considers this 
determination to be part of the IRB’s responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a 
study.  (See 21 CFR 56.108)  
 
• IRBs should make the SR or NSR determination about a study by reviewing relevant 
information at a convened meeting.  This information includes the description of the device, 
reports of prior investigations conducted with the device, the proposed investigational plan, 
and subject selection criteria.  The sponsor should provide the IRB with a risk assessment 
and the rationale used in making its SR or NSR determination.   
 
• An IRB may agree or disagree with the sponsor’s initial NSR assessment. 
   
• If the IRB determines the study is NSR, the IRB may approve the study using the criteria at 
21 CFR 56.111.  The study may begin without submission of an IDE application to FDA.   
 
• If the IRB disagrees with the sponsor’s NSR assessment and decides the study is SR, the IRB 
must tell the clinical investigator, and where appropriate, the sponsor.  (See 21 CFR 812.66) 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

• An IRB may approve the study as an SR device study, but the study may not begin until FDA 
approves the sponsor’s IDE application.  
 
• To facilitate the IRB’s review of the study, an IRB may ask the sponsor for proof (i.e., a copy 
of FDA’s approval or conditional approval letter) that an SR study has an FDA-approved 
IDE application. 
 
• The IRB should document its SR/NSR determination in the IRB meeting minutes.  
 
VI. 
WHAT SHOULD IRBS CONSIDER WHEN MAKING THE SR AND NSR  
DETERMINATION? 
 
• What is the basis for the risk determination? The risk determination is based on the proposed 
use of a device in an investigation, and not on the device alone.   
 
• What is the nature of harm that may result from use of the device?  SR studies are those that 
present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  See the 
question “What is a Significant Risk Device Study?” for further information.  
 
• Will the subject need to undergo an additional procedure as part of the investigational study, 
for example, a surgical procedure?  IRBs should consider the potential harm the procedure 
could cause as well as the potential harm caused by the device.  Several examples follow: 
 
1. The study of a change to a commercially available pacemaker (e.g., new leads, 
battery pack, or software) poses an SR because the device is used to support or 
sustain human life and it presents a potential for serious harm to the subjects. This is 
true even though the changed pacemaker may potentially pose less risk, or only 
slightly greater risk, in comparison to the commercially available model.  
2. The study of an extended wear contact lens is SR because wearing the lens 
continuously overnight while sleeping presents a potential for injuries not normally 
seen with daily wear lenses, which are NSR. 
3. An investigational study of a sensor pad to find out if the device can detect the 
electrical activity of the spinal cord may be NSR, if the study of the sensor pad takes 
place at the same time as the planned surgical repair of the spinal cord, if all the 
following are true:  
 
- 
repair of the spinal cord would occur anyway;

 7
- 
the sensor pad does not present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or 
welfare of a subject (for example, placing the pad would not prolong or interfere 
with the operation);  
- 
the sensor pad is not implanted;  
- 
the pad is not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or 
treating disease. 
 
VII. 
HOW DOES AN IRB DOCUMENT THE SR OR NSR DETERMINATION? 
 
The IRB should write its decision in the meeting minutes.  The minutes should describe the 
IRB’s reason for its SR or NSR determination and may also include the documentation used to 
establish the IDE status for the study.  For an SR determination, such documentation may 
include, for example, a copy of the IDE approval or conditional approval letter from FDA.  For 
an NSR determination, the documentation may include FDA's NSR determination where the 
agency has made the determination.  FDA will issue an NSR letter upon written request. 
 
VIII.   WHAT SHOULD AN IRB DO FOR DEVICE STUDIES THAT ARE EXEMPT 
FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE IDE REGULATIONS (21 CFR 
812.2(C))? 
 
For studies that are exempt from the IDE regulations, the IRB does not need to decide whether 
the study poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk.  However, the IRB must still review the 
study in accordance with the IRB regulations before the investigation may begin. 
 
IRBs should understand distinctions between certain important concepts that are frequently 
confused: 
 
A. 
Difference between NSR and Minimal Risk Determinations 
 
IRBs should not confuse their responsibility to make an SR/NSR determination for a device 
study with the concept of “minimal risk.” “Minimal Risk” is a term used in the IRB 
regulations in part to identify certain studies that IRBs may approve through an expedited 
review procedure.  For a device study to be eligible for expedited review, it must be an NSR 
study AND present no more than minimal risk to the subject. (See 21 CFR 56.110)  
 
B. Difference 
Between SR/NSR Determinations and Approval Decisions 
 
IRBs should not confuse their responsibility to review and approve research for conduct at a 
clinical site with the SR/NSR determination.  IRBs make the SR/NSR determination before 
the IRB conducts its review of the study under Part 56.  The judgment about whether a study 
poses a significant risk or nonsignificant risk is based on the significance of the potential 
harm that may result from participation in the study, including the use of the device; whereas

 8
the IRB’s decision to approve a study for implementation is based on the study’s risk-benefit 
assessment.   
 
IX. 
WHAT ARE FDA’S RESPONSIBILITIES? 
 
• As discussed, FDA is the final arbiter in deciding whether a device study poses a significant 
or nonsignificant risk.  It should be noted, however, that FDA generally only sees those 
studies that sponsors submit to the agency or those studies for which an IRB or clinical 
investigator asks for FDA’s opinion. 
 
• If FDA disagrees with an IRB’s NSR decision and determines that the study poses a 
significant risk, the sponsor may not begin their study until FDA approves an IDE.  (See 21 
CFR 812.42) 
 
• If a sponsor submits an IDE to FDA because the sponsor presumed it to be an SR study, and 
FDA determines that the device study poses a nonsignificant risk, FDA will tell the sponsor 
in writing.  The study may then be reviewed by the IRB as an NSR study. 
 
X. 
EXAMPLES OF NSR AND SR DEVICES  
 
The following examples may help sponsors and IRBs in making SR and NSR determinations. 
The list includes many commonly studied medical devices.  Inclusion of a device in the NSR list 
is not a final determination because the evaluation of risk must reflect the proposed use of a 
device in a study.
