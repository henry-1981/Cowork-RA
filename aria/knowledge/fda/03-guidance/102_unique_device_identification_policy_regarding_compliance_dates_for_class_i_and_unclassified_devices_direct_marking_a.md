Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

FDA’s unique device identification system (UDI system) is designed to adequately identify
devices through distribution and use.1 Its requirements were designed to be phased in over seven
years according to established compliance dates based primarily on device classification.
The compliance dates established for class I and unclassified devices, other than implantable,
life-supporting, or life-sustaining (I/LS/LS) devices2 are:
·

September 24, 2018, for the following requirements:
o Standard date formatting (21 CFR 801.18),
o Labeling (21 CFR 801.20, 21 CFR 801.50), and

1

The final rule establishing the UDI system was published September 24, 2013 (78 FR 58786).
Section 519(f) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires implementation of FDA’s UDI system
regulations for I/LS/LS devices within two years of finalizing those regulations. I/LS/LS devices were required to
comply with labeling, direct mark, and GUDID submission requirements under 21 CFR 801.20, 801.45, 801.50,
and 830.300, as well as the standard date format requirement under 21 CFR 801.18, by September 24, 2015,
unless an exception or alternative applied. See 78 FR at 58815-58816.

o Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) data
submission (21 CFR 830.300); and
September 24, 2020, for direct mark requirements (21 CFR 801.45).3

This guidance describes FDA’s policies with regard to enforcement of these requirements for
class I and unclassified devices,4 including the Agency’s compliance policy regarding GUDID
submission requirements under 21 CFR 830.300 for certain class I devices considered consumer
health products. In addition, the guidance describes how a labeler of a class I device can
determine whether its device is within the scope of that compliance policy.
This guidance also reiterates FDA’s direct mark compliance policy for class III, LS/LS, and class
II devices that are non-sterile, that are manufactured and labeled prior to their applicable direct
mark compliance date, and that remain in inventory, as well as for class I and unclassified
devices that are not LS/LS devices, that are non-sterile, that are manufactured and labeled prior
to September 24, 2022, and that remain in inventory.
Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to FDA staff
from the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (CBER). “You” and “your” refer to the labeler, as defined in 21
CFR 801.3.
A portion of this guidance describing a 75-day extension of an existing FDA compliance policy
is being implemented without prior public comment because the Agency has determined that
prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate (section 701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 371(h)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). FDA
has determined that this approach presents a less burdensome policy that is consistent with public
health. Although the portion of this guidance describing that policy is being implemented
immediately, the guidance remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good
guidance practices. The remainder of the updates to this guidance are being implemented
following the opportunity for public comment on FDA’s draft guidance, Select Updates for
Unique Device Identification: Policy Regarding Global Unique Device Identification Database
Requirements for Certain Devices, issued October 14, 2021.
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind
the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

See 78 FR at 58815-58816.
The compliance policies for class I and unclassified devices described in this guidance do not apply to I/LS/LS
devices. Additionally, class I devices that FDA has by regulation exempted from the good manufacturing practice
requirements are outside the scope of this guidance because such devices are excepted from UDI requirements (21
CFR 801.30(a)(2)).

II. Background
On September 24, 2013, the FDA published a final rule establishing a UDI system designed to
adequately identify devices through distribution and use (the “UDI Rule”). 5 Phased
implementation of the regulatory requirements set forth in that final rule is based on a series of
established compliance dates based primarily on device classification, which range from
September 24, 2014, to September 24, 2020.6
The UDI Rule requires a device to bear a unique device identifier (UDI) on its label and
packages unless an exception or alternative applies (21 CFR 801.20), and special labeling
requirements apply to stand-alone software regulated as a device (21 CFR 801.50). The UDI
Rule also requires that data pertaining to the key characteristics of each device required to bear a
UDI be submitted to FDA’s GUDID (21 CFR 830.300). GUDID provides a repository of device
safety information for FDA. Most of the information submitted to GUDID is also available to the
public through AccessGUDID.7 AccessGUDID enables healthcare providers and patients to
obtain useful safety information on specific device models, such as sterility requirements and
MRI compatibility information.
In addition, the UDI Rule added 21 CFR 801.18, which requires certain dates on device labels to
be in a standard format. As explained in the preamble to the UDI Rule, FDA aligned the
compliance date for standard date format requirements under 21 CFR 801.18 with the
compliance date by which a device must bear a UDI on its label and packages under 21 CFR
801.20 to avoid the need to make changes to a device label more than once to implement the
requirements in the final rule.8 For devices that 1) must bear UDIs on their labels and 2) are
intended to be used more than once and reprocessed between uses, 21 CFR 801.45 requires the
devices to be directly marked with a UDI.9
The UDI system seeks to improve the identification of medical devices by making it possible to
rapidly and definitively identify a device and certain key attributes related to a device’s safe and
effective use. Fully realizing the benefits of the UDI system depends on UDIs being integrated
into data sources throughout our healthcare system, including in the supply chain, electronic
health records, and registries. This requires UDI data to be of a high quality, such that all
stakeholders in the healthcare community have sufficient confidence in the accuracy and
completeness of that data.
In January 2018, FDA issued the initial version of this guidance document, “Unique Device
Identification: Policy Regarding Compliance Dates for Class I and Unclassified Devices,”10

which was superseded in November 2018 by the guidance, “Unique Device Identification: Policy
Regarding Compliance Dates for Class I and Unclassified Devices and Certain Devices
Requiring Direct Marking,”11 and then subsequently superseded in July 2020 by the guidance
with the same title (hereafter referred to as “2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance”).12
Throughout that time, FDA has been working with labelers on implementing UDI requirements
and addressing policy and technical issues. The prior versions of this guidance reflected our
belief that it was important to continue focusing our resources on addressing UDI
implementation issues and data quality for higher risk devices. In addition, as described in the
2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance, to the extent the policy articulated in that guidance
helped labelers remain focused on public health needs related to Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), we believe it was further consistent with the public health.
As UDI implementation has progressed, FDA has gained further insight into the public health
benefits and potential burdens of UDI requirements for class I devices, which generally pose the
lowest risk. Many 510(k)-exempt class I devices are sold directly to consumers over-the-counter
in brick-and-mortar and/or online stores. For purposes of this guidance, we refer to these devices,
when they do not fall within one or more of the categories identified in section III.B.2, as
“consumer health products.” These class I devices are also typically labeled with a Universal
Product Code (UPC),13 which is a barcode primarily used for scanning items at the point of sale.
The UPC is used to identify products to a very granular level—such as where in stores the
product is displayed, and whether the product has temporary promotional packaging—and the
UPC for the same version or model of a device can change frequently.
With respect to class I devices that are consumer health products, FDA believes that the entry of
UDI data into GUDID, especially given the frequent changes to the UPCs serving as the UDIs
for these devices, is burdensome to stakeholders. Further, FDA considered the public health
benefit of GUDID submission for consumer health products and the risks to public health if
GUDID submission is not provided for these devices. After reviewing available postmarket
information, such as medical device reports and recall data for class I devices, FDA has a better
understanding of the devices and device characteristics for which GUDID information is
particularly useful in evaluating and improving device safety throughout a product lifecycle, as
well as those for which GUDID information may be less important in this regard. Based on this
analysis, at this time, FDA does not intend to enforce the GUDID submission requirements under
21 CFR 830.300 for consumer health products.

requirements (21 CFR 801.18, 21 CFR 801.20, 21 CFR 801.50, and 21 CFR 830.300) prior to September 24, 2020,
and direct mark requirements (21 CFR 801.45) prior to September 24, 2022.
11
83 FR 55372 (Nov. 5, 2018). This previous version of the guidance retained the original compliance policy and
clarified FDA’s policy on direct marking requirements for certain non-sterile devices in inventory.
12
85 FR 39477 (Jul. 1, 2020). This previous version of the guidance stated that FDA did not intend to enforce
standard date formatting, UDI labeling, and GUDID data submission requirements under 21 CFR 801.18, 21 CFR
801.20, 21 CFR 801.50, and 21 CFR 830.300 for class I and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, before
September 24, 2022.
13
For class I devices, the UDI Rule provides that the UPC may serve as the UDI (21 CFR 801.40(d)). As with the
production identifier exception for class I devices (21 CFR 801.30(d)), this option for a UPC was provided after
weighing the public health benefit against the burden on industry with respect to these lower risk devices.

Class I devices that FDA does not consider to be consumer health products may pose greater
risks to public health. These devices are typically used in healthcare settings and are often
subject to additional regulatory controls, such as the requirement to submit premarket
notification, restrictions under section 520(e) of the FD&C Act, and other requirements. For
these devices, FDA has determined that submission of UDI data into GUDID is particularly
important to help enable FDA and other stakeholders to evaluate and improve device safety
throughout the product lifecycle.14 Submission of UDI data into GUDID for these devices may
also help reduce medical errors and simplify the integration of device use information into data
systems.15 These devices are discussed further in section III.B.2.
Section III.B.2 and section III.C also explain that we intend to extend our existing compliance
policy regarding GUDID submission requirements for class I and unclassified devices, other than
I/LS/LS devices, regardless of whether they are consumer health products, for an additional 75
calendar days. In the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance, FDA stated that we did not intend
to enforce the GUDID submission requirements under 21 CFR 830.300 for class I and
unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, before September 24, 2022.16 We recognize,
however, that the new policy regarding consumer health products, described in section III.B of
this guidance, is being finalized close to that date and that some labelers may have been waiting
for the publication of this guidance before planning for GUDID submission. In light of these
considerations, at this time, we do not intend to enforce the GUDID submission requirements
under 21 CFR 830.300 for class I and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, before
December 8, 2022. We believe this brief extension of the policy may help facilitate submission
of high quality UDI data to GUDID and is consistent with the public health. The other policies
and related dates in this guidance remain the same and have not changed since the publication of
the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance. FDA’s UDI webpage17 contains additional
information about UDI compliance dates and other dates related to UDI compliance policies.
Additionally, as explained in prior versions of this guidance, meeting the UDI direct mark
requirements for certain finished devices that are manufactured and labeled before the labeler
has implemented direct marking and that remain in inventory has been challenging for
labelers. The cost of remediating existing devices in inventory to add a direct mark may be
substantial, as it can entail different design changes and design validations than those made in
order to add a required UDI direct mark to future lots of the device.
The compliance policy described in section IV of this guidance for certain devices in inventory
that do not comply with the direct mark requirements is intended to facilitate use of those devices
while still realizing some UDI-related benefits to patient safety. The lower burden of the
approach outlined in this guidance also helps reduce the risk that industry will choose to avoid
the cost of remediation by discarding inventory, potentially creating device shortages and

14

GUDID data may be used to facilitate recalls and medical device reporting, in analysis of premarket approval
application (PMA) annual reports, and for other FDA processes.

negatively impacting patients and providers. At this time, we have concluded that this direct
mark compliance policy for certain inventory devices appropriately serves the public health.

III. Policy On Standard Date Formatting, UDI Labeling,
and GUDID Submission Requirements for Class I and
Unclassified Devices
Compliance Policy for Standard Date Formatting and
UDI Labeling Requirements for Class I and Unclassified
Devices
As previously stated in the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance, FDA does not intend to
enforce standard date formatting and UDI labeling requirements under 21 CFR 801.18, 21 CFR
801.20, and 21 CFR 801.50 for class I and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices,18
before September 24, 2022.19
We note that, pursuant to 21 CFR 801.30(a)(1), a finished device manufactured and labeled prior
to the compliance date established by FDA for 21 CFR 801.20 regarding that device is excepted
from the requirement to bear a UDI for a period of three years after that compliance date. The
compliance dates established in the preamble of the UDI Rule have not changed. Finished class I
and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, manufactured and labeled prior to
September 24, 2018, are excepted from UDI labeling and GUDID submission requirements for a
period of three years after the established compliance date or until September 24, 2021 (21 CFR
801.30(a)(1)). However, FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under 21 CFR 801.18,
801.20, and 801.50 for class I and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, prior to
September 24, 2022, regardless of the date they are manufactured and labeled.

Compliance Policy for GUDID Submission Requirements
for Class I Devices
1.

Class I Devices Considered Consumer Health Products

At this time, FDA does not intend to enforce the GUDID submission requirements under 21 CFR
830.300 for class I devices considered consumer health products that are required to bear a UDI
on their labels and device packages. For purposes of this guidance, “consumer health products”
means 510(k)-exempt class I devices that are sold directly to consumers over-the-counter in
brick-and-mortar and/or online stores and that do not fall within one or more of the categories
18

See footnote 2.
This policy for standard date formatting and UDI labeling requirements under 21 CFR 801.18, 21 CFR 801.20,
and 21 CFR 801.50 for class I and unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, remains the same as the policy
in the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance. See 85 FR 39477 (Jul. 1, 2020).

identified in section III.B.2. In addition to being sold directly to consumers, some consumer
health products may be sold to or used in professional healthcare facilities.20 Consumer health
products are typically labeled with a UPC, which may serve as the UDI for class I devices (21
CFR 801.40(d)).21
If a labeler has questions regarding whether their device is considered a consumer health product
that is within the scope of this compliance policy, the labeler may contact the FDA at
GUDIDSupport@fda.hhs.gov.

2.
Class I Devices Not Considered Consumer Health Products
by FDA
FDA has determined that class I devices that we do not consider consumer health products may
pose greater risks to public health and, based on FDA’s analysis, GUDID data is particularly
important to monitoring the safety of these devices. These potentially higher risk devices are
typically used exclusively in professional healthcare facilities and are often subject to additional
regulatory controls.
Class I devices that fall into one or more of the categories described below are not considered
consumer health products for purposes of this guidance and, therefore, do not fall within the
compliance policy described in section III.B.1 of this guidance. However, FDA does not intend
to enforce the GUDID submission requirements under 21 CFR 830.300 for class I devices, other
than I/LS/LS devices,22 regardless of whether they fall within that compliance policy, before
December 8, 2022 (an additional 75 calendar days).23
a. Class I Reserved Devices
The majority of class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification process.
However, “any class I device that is intended for a use which is of substantial importance in
preventing impairment of human health… or … that presents a potential unreasonable risk of
illness or injury” is not exempt from the 510(k) notification process. FD&C Act section
510(l)(1). These devices are typically referred to as “Class I Reserved Devices.” More

20

“Professional healthcare facility” is defined as any environment where personnel with medical training are
continually available to oversee or administer the use of medical devices. This includes, but is not limited to,
hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, emergency medical services, clinics, physicians’ offices, and
outpatient treatment facilities; or a clinical laboratory. For more information, see the following guidance: “Design
Considerations for Devices Intended for Home Use”, available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/design-considerations-devices-intended-home-use.
21
Class I devices that bear UPCs on their labels and device packages are deemed to meet all UDI labeling
requirements of 21 CFR 801, subpart B (21 CFR 801.40(d)), and the UPC will serve as the UDI required by 21 CFR
801.20. These devices are not required to bear a UDI, in addition to a UPC, but may elect to do so.
22
See footnote 2.
23
In the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance, we stated that we do not intend to enforce the GUDID data
submission requirements under 21 CFR 830.300 for class I devices, other than I/LS/LS devices, before September
24, 2022. See 85 FR 39477 (Jul. 1, 2020).

information about devices considered to be Class I Reserved Devices can be found on FDA’s
website.24
b. Restricted Devices
Under section 520(e) of the FD&C Act, FDA may by regulation require that a device be
restricted to sale, distribution, or use only upon written or oral authorization by a practitioner
licensed by law to administer or use such device (i.e., prescription use) or such other conditions
as may be prescribed in such regulation. For example, regulations restricting the sale,
distribution, and use of in vitro diagnostic devices are located in 21 CFR part 809, subpart C.
c. Implantable Devices
“Implantable device” is defined at 21 CFR 801.3 as “a device that is intended to be placed in a
surgically or naturally formed cavity of the human body” and “is regarded as an implantable
device . . . only if it is intended to remain implanted continuously for a period of 30 days or
more, unless the Commissioner of Food and Drugs determines otherwise in order to protect
human health.”
d. Life-Supporting or Life-Sustaining Devices
“Life-supporting or life-sustaining device” is defined at 21 CFR 860.3 as a device that is
“essential to, or that yields information that is essential to, the restoration or continuation of a
bodily function important to the continuation of human life.” FDA recommends evaluating the
characteristics of the device and looking to the device’s intended use to determine whether a
particular device is life-supporting or life-sustaining.
e. Certain Devices Distributed to Professional Healthcare Facilities and
Intended for Use by Healthcare Professionals Only
The compliance policy described in section III.B.1 does not apply to devices that are distributed
to professional healthcare facilities, are intended for use by healthcare professionals only, and
are: (1) reusable or reprocessed,25 including those that are non-sterile and sterilized on-site before
use; or (2) intended for wound care.

Compliance Policy for GUDID Submission Requirements
for Unclassified Devices
24

Available at: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpcd/3151.cfm
For purposes of this guidance, consistent with FDA’s Direct Mark Guidance, available at:
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/unique-device-identification-directmarking-devices, we consider a device to be reusable if it is “intended to be used more than once,” meaning that it is
intended for repeated uses on or by different patients. If the device is intended to be used more than once on or by
the same patient, and not on or by multiple patients, it is not considered reusable for purposes of this guidance. Also
consistent with the Direct Mark Guidance, we consider a device intended to be reprocessed if it is intended to
undergo high-level disinfection and/or sterilization before each use or between uses.

An unclassified device is a pre-amendments device type26 for which a classification regulation
has not been promulgated. Unclassified devices generally require submission of a 510(k)
premarket notification. FDA has issued compliance policies related to certain unclassified
devices.27 FDA does not intend to enforce the GUDID submission requirements under 21 CFR
830.300 for unclassified devices, other than I/LS/LS devices,28 before December 8, 2022 (an
additional 75 calendar days).29

IV. Policy for Direct Mark of Certain Devices
A. Class III, LS/LS, and Class II Non­Sterile Devices
Manufactured and Labeled Prior to the Established Direct
Mark Compliance Date That Remain in Inventory
The policy in this section IV.A. of this guidance applies only to finished class III, LS/LS, and
class II devices that are non-sterile, that were manufactured and labeled prior to their established
direct mark compliance date, and that remain in inventory.30 In general, the direct mark
compliance date for class III devices is September 24, 2016; for LS/LS devices is September 24,
2015; and for class II devices is September 24, 2018.31 However, pursuant to 21 CFR
801.30(a)(1), finished devices manufactured and labeled prior to the applicable compliance date
established by FDA for 21 CFR 801.20 are not required to comply with UDI requirements,
including direct mark requirements under 21 CFR 801.45, until three years after that labeling
compliance date.32 This provision was intended to reduce burden associated with the UDI Rule
for inventories of finished devices that were manufactured and labeled prior to the applicable
compliance date.33
For the class III, LS/LS, and class II devices described above, including device constituents of a
copackaged combination product or kit, FDA does not intend to enforce UDI direct mark
requirements under 21 CFR 801.45 when the device’s UDI can be derived from other
information directly marked on the device.

A pre-amendments device type is one that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, the date the
Medical Device Amendments were signed into law.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In determining whether a device’s UDI can be derived from other information directly
marked on the device, FDA intends to consider whether the labeler has developed and made
available a method for constructing the UDI from other information directly marked on the
device (such as catalog number, lot number, serial number) such that the UDI is readily
available at the point of use and has documented or referenced that method in the DMR.
FDA also intends to develop a new field(s) in GUDID to capture that a device is subject to
such a method for constructing the UDI. We recommend that labelers use the new field(s) to
document, when applicable, that their devices are subject to such a method when the field
becomes available.

B.

Class I and Unclassified Devices

The direct mark compliance date for class I and unclassified devices, except for LS/LS devices,34
is September 24, 2020.35 As previously stated in the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance,
FDA does not intend to enforce UDI direct mark requirements under 21 CFR 801.45 for those
devices before September 24, 2022.36 This policy applies to sterile and non-sterile devices and
includes device constituents of a copackaged combination product or kit.
In addition, after September 24, 2022, FDA does not intend to enforce UDI direct mark
requirements under 21 CFR 801.45 for finished class I and unclassified devices, including class I
and unclassified device constituents of a copackaged combination product or kit, that are not
LS/LS, that are non-sterile, that were manufactured and labeled prior to September 24, 2022, and
that remain in inventory, when the device’s UDI can be derived from other information directly
marked on the device. In determining whether a device’s UDI can be derived from other
information directly marked on the device, FDA intends to consider whether the labeler has
developed and made available a method for constructing the UDI from other information directly
marked on the device (such as catalog number, lot number, serial number) such that the UDI is
readily available at the point of use and has documented or referenced that method in the DMR.
As noted above, FDA intends to develop a new field(s) in GUDID to capture that a device is
subject to such a method for constructing the UDI. We recommend that labelers use the new
field(s) to document, when applicable, that their devices are subject to such a method when the
field becomes available.

This policy for UDI direct mark requirements under 21 CFR 801.45 for class I and unclassified devices, other than
LS/LS devices, remains the same as the policy in the 2020 UDI Compliance Policy Guidance. See 85 FR 39477 (Jul.
1, 2020).
