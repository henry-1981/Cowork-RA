Characterization of Ultrahigh
Molecular Weight Polyethylene
(UHMWPE) Used in Orthopedic
Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
FDA has developed this guidance document for members of industry who submit and FDA
staff who review testing of orthopedic devices using ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene
(UHMWPE) material. In this document, the terms “you” and “your” refer to members of
industry, also known as sponsors, submitters, or applicants; and the terms “we,” “us,” and
“our” refer to FDA. This guidance is intended to assist you in determining the appropriate
information and testing to submit in Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), De Novo requests,
Premarket Approval (PMA) applications, Humanitarian Device Exemptions (HDEs), and
Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for orthopedic devices that contain UHMWPE.
This guidance addresses the characterization and testing of UHMWPE materials used in
orthopedic devices. These materials include conventional UHMWPE, highly crosslinked
UHMWPE, highly crosslinked UHMWPE containing antioxidants (e.g., α-tocopherol (an
isomer of vitamin E)), and non-conventional UHMWPE. This document outlines the
information we recommend you include in a submission to FDA to characterize the
UHMWPE material (e.g., material description, sterility, biocompatibility, mechanical
properties, and chemical properties).
Many standards are referenced in this document. For the current edition of the FDArecognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus

Standards Database.1 A table of referenced FDA-recognized standards applicable to
UHMWPE is provided in Appendix 1.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
The recommendations in this document are applicable to class II and class III devices
intended for orthopedic applications, including spinal devices, which contain UHMWPE.
If you intend to submit an original IDE for an investigational device containing
UHMWPE, we recommend you submit a Pre-Submission to the appropriate review
division to determine what level of characterization is needed for the UHMWPE material.
For more information on Pre-Submissions, see the FDA guidance document entitled,
“Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program
and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff.”2
This guidance document does not address nor discuss device-specific functional testing,
such as impingement testing, wear testing, or interconnection strength testing. If you have
any questions on these topics, refer to the recommendations in any applicable devicespecific guidance, when available, or contact the appropriate review division.

III. Types of UHMWPE Materials Used in Implantable
Orthopedic Devices
The UHMWPE materials used in implantable orthopedic devices may be organized into four
general categories: 1) conventional UHMWPE; 2) highly crosslinked UHMWPE; 3)
antioxidant highly crosslinked UHMWPE; and 4) non-conventional UHMWPE.
A. Conventional UHMWPE
Conventional UHMWPE originates from virgin resin powders or consolidated forms
conforming to international consensus standard ASTM F648: Standard Specification for
Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene Powder and Fabricated Form for Surgical
Implants. According to section 5.1 of ASTM F2759: Standard Guide for Assessment of
the Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) Used in Orthopedic and
Spinal Devices, fabricated forms of conventional UHMWPE are “manufactured by

compression molding or ram extrusion and [have] not been intentionally cross-linked
before terminal sterilization.”3
B. Highly Crosslinked UHMWPE (HXLPE)
HXLPE originates from virgin resin powders or consolidated forms conforming to
ASTM F648. This material type includes UHMWPE that has been highly crosslinked by
various methods. According to section 5.2 of ASTM F2759, fabricated forms of
extensively radiation-crosslinked UHMWPE, a subset of HXLPE, are “manufactured by
compression molding or extrusion and irradiated with a dosage higher than 40 kGy of
gamma or e-beam radiation for improved wear resistance.”4
This material type may also include HXLPE that has been extensively crosslinked by
methods other than ionizing radiation (e.g., peroxides, silane, high temperature exposure).
C.

Antioxidant Highly Crosslinked UHMWPE (AO-HXLPE)

AO-HXLPE material originates from virgin resin powders or consolidated forms
conforming to ASTM F648 and/or ASTM F2695: Standard Specification for Ultra-High
Molecular Weight Polyethylene Powder Blended with Alpha-Tocopherol (Vitamin E) and
Fabricated Forms for Surgical Implant Applications. According to section 5.3 of ASTM
F2759, “Two stabilizing methods for the antioxidant UHMWPE form (Vitamin Estabilized or alpha-tocopherol) are blending or diffusing. The blending method has the
Vitamin E mixed (blended) into the UHMWPE powder before consolidation and
radiation cross-linking. The diffusing method has the Vitamin E diffusing into a
consolidated UHMWPE form before or after radiation cross-linking. Also, antioxidant
UHMWPE could potentially be used without any radiation cross-linking.”5
D. Non-Conventional UHMWPE
Non-conventional UHMWPE is a polyethylene material other than the three material
types discussed above. Examples may include, but are not limited to, materials that are
made from lower molecular weight polyethylenes that may or may not be extensively
crosslinked, porous polyethylenes, functionalized UHMWPE such as hyaluronic acidmodified UHMWPE, or polyethylenes whose surfaces have been modified. These may or
may not be stabilized with an antioxidant.

IV. Material Processing and Characterization
For all material types and submission types (510(k), De Novo, PMA, HDE, or IDE), FDA
recommends that you provide the following general technical information regarding the
UHMWPE material to establish the type of UHMWPE in use:
·
·
·

Starting resin (e.g., GUR 1020, GUR 1050);
Resin consolidation method (e.g., ram extrusion, compression molding); and
Terminal sterilization method.6 If radiation, type (e.g., gamma irradiation, electron beam)
and delivered dose or equivalent measure should be provided, along with a description of
the packaging and the environment in which it was packaged (e.g., barrier film, inert gas,
vacuum).

Depending on the type of UHMWPE, different mechanical and chemical characterization
should be provided, as discussed in more detail below. This characterization information is
summarized in Appendix 2. For information on recommended content and format of
complete test reports for non-clinical bench performance testing in premarket submissions,
refer to FDA’s guidance, “Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench
Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.”7 In cases where you believe
the information or testing described in this document do not apply to your device, you should
provide a rationale explaining why you believe the recommended information or testing are
not applicable.
A. Conventional UHMWPE
Material characteristics of conventional UHMWPE should conform to the specifications
of ASTM F648 for both powder and fabricated forms, and we recommend that you
include a declaration of conformity to ASTM F648, as appropriate, in your premarket
submission.8 For orthopedic implants we recommend you consider the information
summarized in Table 2 of ASTM F648, which identifies the material property
specifications for conventional UHMWPE in fabricated form. Standard test methods
typically used to assess these properties are also referenced in ASTM F648. You should
provide the following material properties of your conventional UHMWPE in your
regulatory submission to FDA:
·

Tensile properties (e.g., yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation at
break);

·
·

Impact resistance (e.g., Izod); and
Density.

If the material meets the specifications in ASTM F648, no additional information will
typically be requested. However, if the material’s properties are not within the
specification range in the standard, then additional information should be provided to
demonstrate that the device can perform as intended for its indicated use.
We recommend that manufacturers refer to ASTM F2759 which provides general
guidelines for physical, chemical, biocompatibility, mechanical, and preclinical
assessments of UHMWPE in implantable orthopedic and spinal devices intended to
replace a musculoskeletal joint.
B. Highly Crosslinked UHMWPE (HXLPE)
HXLPE primarily differs from conventional UHMWPE in that extensively radiationcrosslinked UHMWPE absorbs a relatively larger radiation dose and is then thermally
processed. These differences alter the mechanical, physical, and chemical properties of
the material, and these properties should be characterized. In addition to the information
that is requested for conventional UHMWPE in Section IV.A, you should provide the
following information in your regulatory submission to FDA:
·
·
·
·
·

·
·
·
·

·

Radiation type (e.g., gamma irradiation, electron beam) and delivered dose, inclusive
of terminal sterilization, as measured by dosimeters or equivalent measures;
Percent crystallinity;
Melting temperature;
Trans-vinylene index throughout the sample;
Post-accelerated aging testing (e.g., oxidation index throughout the sample to
compare pre- and post-aging properties and/or mechanical properties that demonstrate
no adverse effect on performance);
Crosslink density;
Fatigue resistance crack propagation testing (ΔKinception, Paris exponent, Paris
coefficient);
Free radical concentration;
Time, temperature, and rationale for all post-crosslinking thermal processing steps
such as heating above the melt temperature of UHMWPE or annealing below the melt
temperature (e.g., to reduce/eliminate free radicals, relieve internal stresses); and
Compression ratio of mechanical thermal processing steps.

We recommend that characterization tests listed above be performed per the current
FDA-recognized standards, ASTM F2759 and ASTM F2565: Standard Guide for
Extensively Irradiation-Crosslinked Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene
Fabricated Forms for Surgical Implant Applications, which reference standard test
methods recommended to assess this information.

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If the measured values lie within an acceptable range, as determined by comparison to
either another legally marketed device with the same intended use or literature, no
additional information will typically be requested. However, if the material’s properties
lie outside the previously accepted range, then additional information should be provided
to demonstrate that the device can perform as intended for its indicated use.
For the characterization of properties that are also recommended for conventional
UHMWPE, such as tensile properties, impact resistance, and density, we consider the
minimum specifications set forth in ASTM F648 to be acceptable for highly crosslinked
polyethylenes, which are outside the scope of that standard. If the material meets the
specifications of ASTM F648, no additional information will typically be requested to
characterize these properties. However, if the material’s properties do not meet these
acceptance criteria, then additional information should be provided as recommended in
the preceding paragraph.
During the radiation crosslinking process, free radicals are produced, and the free radical
concentration directly influences the oxidative stability of the material. As a result, post
irradiation thermal treatment of the polymer is performed to reduce or eliminate the free
radical concentration and to ensure the long term oxidative stability of the polyethylene.
For materials thermally processed above or below the melt temperature, the free radical
concentration should be determined. There currently is no standard test method for
determining free radical concentration. Free radical concentration is typically assessed
using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, also known as electron spin
resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The test method you choose should be fully described and
justified in your submission and the limit-of-detection of EPR/ESR measurements should
be included in the test reports. We recommend that, in addition to supplying the measured
concentration of free radicals, spectrographs showing the free radical spectra should also
be provided.
Some properties, such as wear, fatigue crack propagation resistance, and morphology of
the fabricated form (i.e., consolidation quality, per Annex 2.1 of ASTM F648-14), are
comparative in nature. No acceptance criteria are specified. These properties should be
evaluated in a manner that demonstrates that the device can perform as intended for its
indicated use.
Finally, device-specific impingement and/or fatigue studies should also be carried out on
HXLPE in its final component design form factor to test locking mechanisms, posts, and
other design features that may be sensitive to fatigue crack propagation. Refer to the
recommendations in any applicable device-specific guidance document, when available,
or contact the appropriate review division for comments on proposed testing.
For UHMWPE that has been extensively crosslinked by methods other than ionizing
radiation (e.g., peroxides, silane, high temperature exposure), additional tests may be
requested depending on the crosslinking procedures, such as assessment of residual
peroxide concentration and reaction by-products. If a different crosslinking method is
used, we recommend discussing your proposed procedures and any additional

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
characterization assessments with the Agency prior to submission of a marketing
application. Please refer to the guidance “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device
Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug
Administration Staff”9 for more information on meetings with FDA staff.
C. Antioxidant Highly Crosslinked UHMWPE (AO-HXLPE)
AO-HXLPE primarily differs from HXLPE in that an antioxidant (e.g., α-tocopherol) is
added either before or after exposure to radiation and the material is not thermally
processed above its melting temperature. In addition to the information that is requested
for conventional UHMWPE in Section IV.A, and HXLPE in Section IV.B., the following
additional characterization information should be provided to address specific concerns
raised by the addition of antioxidants:
1. Concentration and identification of antioxidant or other additives (in weight percent
(wt. %) and parts per million (ppm) or as a Vitamin E index or equivalent).10
2. Stability of antioxidant in the material. It is possible that the added antioxidant may
leach out over time due to loading and/or in vivo fluids that act as a solvent for the
antioxidant. The loss of the antioxidant may undermine the material’s oxidation
resistance. This concern can be addressed by demonstrating adequate oxidation
resistance following wear testing where the material is exposed to clinically relevant
loads and solvents.
3. Effect of antioxidant on the wear mechanism. An antioxidant may affect the
mechanism by which the material wears. FDA recommends that you assess if the
wear mechanism has been altered due to the addition of the antioxidant by
characterizing the wear debris from wear testing of the new device per ASTM F1877:
Standard Practice for Characterization of Particles. In addition, wear testing under
normal and abrasive wear conditions should be performed. An analysis of the wear
rates and wear surfaces in terms of type and extent of damage modes should also be
provided. The anticipated, or known, impact of the wear test results on device
performance should be thoroughly discussed and supported with available literature
and scientific rationale (e.g., comparison to the control, animal studies11).
Alternatively, it may be possible to address this concern by supplying a scientific
rationale comparing the antioxidant type, concentration, radiation dose, and radiation
type (i.e., gamma or electron beam) to a legally-marketed, antioxidant-containing
device with a similar intended use.

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible.
We encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is
suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for
equivalency to an animal test method.

4. Effect of antioxidant on material consolidation. When an antioxidant is added to the
UHMWPE powder prior to consolidation, its presence may hinder powder
consolidation. Therefore, FDA recommends that the morphology of the fabricated
forms be assessed as described in Annex 2 of ASTM F648-14.
5. Biocompatibility should be evaluated per the recommendations in Section V, below.
If additional concerns not discussed above are identified based on the material
characterization, additional information such as preclinical or clinical data may be
requested to mitigate these concerns.
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

D. Non-Conventional UHMWPE
As non-conventional UHMWPE is not clearly defined, it is not possible to provide
specific testing recommendations at this time. We encourage you to submit a PreSubmission with specific questions to be discussed for non-conventional UHMWPE
devices. For additional information regarding the Pre-Submission process, refer to the
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device
Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug
Administration Staff.”12
In addition to the testing discussed above, we recommend you consider the following
points:
·
·
·
·

Compression properties of the material;
Crystal size and structure;
Creep resistance; and
Durability of modified surface.

If additional concerns are identified based on the material characterization, additional
information such as additional preclinical or clinical data may be requested to mitigate
these concerns.

V. Biocompatibility
UHMWPE materials used in implantable orthopedic devices are patient-contacting materials,
which, when used for their intended purpose (i.e., contact type and duration), may induce a
harmful biological response.
You should determine the biocompatibility of all patient-contacting materials present in your
device. If the subject device uses the identical UHMWPE materials and manufacturing
processes as a legally marketed device with a history of safe use, you may reference previous
testing experience or literature, if appropriate.
If you are unable to identify a legally marketed device with similar location/duration of
contact and intended use that uses the same materials and manufacturing processes as used in
your device, we recommend you conduct and provide a biocompatibility risk assessment.
The assessment should explain the relationship between the identified biocompatibility risks,
the information available to mitigate the identified risks, and any knowledge gaps that
remain. You should then identify any biocompatibility testing or other evaluations that were
conducted to mitigate any remaining risks. If your biocompatibility assessment relies on
12

Available at
https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
information regarding the raw material in a device Master File (MAF), we recommend that
you include a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for the relevant Master File, and ensure that you
address the subsequent processing, cleaning, and sterilization steps to address the
biocompatibility of the final sterilized device. In addition, you may declare conformity to a
recognized material consensus standard, if applicable.
We recommend that you follow FDA’s guidance “Use of International Standard ISO 109931, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process’”13 (referred to as “CDRH’s 2016 Biocompatibility Guidance”), which
identifies the type of biocompatibility assessments that should be considered and
recommendations regarding how to conduct related tests, if applicable.
Per ISO 10993-1 and Attachment A of CDRH’s 2016 Biocompatibility Guidance, most
orthopedic devices that incorporate UHMWPE are considered implant devices in contact
with tissue/bone for a permanent contact duration. Therefore, the following endpoints should
be addressed in your biocompatibility evaluation:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

Cytotoxicity;
Sensitization;
Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity;
Acute Systemic Toxicity;
Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity;
Subchronic toxicity (Sub-acute toxicity);
Genotoxicity (We recommend that both mutagenicity and clastogenicity be assessed.);
Implantation;
Chronic Toxicity; and
Carcinogenicity.

For device-specific, patient-contacting device instrumentation in contact with tissue/bone for
a temporary contact duration, the following endpoints should be addressed in your
biocompatibility evaluation:
·
·
·
·
·

Cytotoxicity;
Sensitization;
Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity;
Acute Systemic Toxicity; and
Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity.

The following additional considerations are recommended for components made from
UHMWPE materials containing antioxidants:

13

Available at
https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM348890.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

The addition of antioxidants raises concerns regarding the biocompatibility of the
antioxidant itself and the biocompatibility of radiation-induced degradation products. The
second concern generally applies to materials that contain the antioxidant and have been
exposed to radiation (i.e., AO-HXLPE, or possibly Non-Conventional UHMWPE). For
tissue/bone contacting, permanently implanted devices, FDA recommends that you
submit a biocompatibility evaluation as per CDRH’s 2016 Biocompatibility Guidance,
referenced above.

·

Wear debris is an important consideration for any UHMWPE-containing, articulating
device component. Therefore, the body’s response to any antioxidant and associated
degradation products leached from the wear debris should be assessed. This may be
accomplished via injecting wear particles from the wear simulator or other representative
particles into an appropriate animal model. The results of the test should be compared to
a control. We encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission with a testing protocol for
review prior to initiating animal testing. As an alternative to the animal testing, it may be
possible to demonstrate that the wear debris generated has similar size/number/shape of
particles as other similar, legally marketed devices, and the antioxidant and its
degradation products are not bioavailable.

VI. Shelf Life and Packaging
Shelf-life testing is conducted to support the proposed expiration date through evaluation of
the package integrity for maintaining device sterility and evaluation of any changes to device
performance or functionality.
With respect to package integrity for maintaining device sterility, you should provide a
description of the packaging, including how it will maintain the device’s sterility. Depending
on submission type, you should also provide the protocol(s) used for your package integrity
testing, the results of the testing, and the conclusions drawn from your results. FDA
recommends that package integrity test methods include simulated distribution and
associated package integrity, as well as simulated (and/or real-time) aging and associated seal
strength testing, to validate package integrity and shelf life claims. We recommend you
follow the methods described in the FDA-recognized series of consensus standards ISO
11607-1: Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1: Requirements for
materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems, and ISO 11607-2: Packaging for
terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 2: Validation requirements for forming, sealing
and assembly processes.
The mechanical properties of UHMWPE that contains unstable free radicals may degrade if
the product is exposed to air during shelf storage. In addition, the shelf life of UHMWPE that
has been irradiated and packaged in an inert environment may be limited by the integrity of
the packaging material. Therefore, FDA recommends that the stability of UHMWPE
materials used in implantable devices be assessed for the duration of their specified shelf life.
With respect to evaluating the effects of aging on device performance or functionality, shelf
life studies should evaluate the critical device properties to ensure that it will perform
adequately and consistently during the entire proposed shelf life. To evaluate device
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
functionality, we recommend that you assess each of the relevant bench tests described in
Section IV and repeat all tests that evaluate design components or characteristics that are
potentially affected by aging.
If you intend to extend the shelf-life of the device after initial approval, we recommend that
you provide the methods or protocol(s) to support the extension in the original submission.
We recommend devices undergo real-time aging to determine definitively the effects of
aging on the maintenance of sterility and device performance. If you use devices subjected to
accelerated aging, we recommend that you specify the way in which the device was aged and
develop a rationale to explain how the results of shelf life testing based on accelerated aging
are representative of the results if the device were aged in real time. We recommend that you
age your devices as per the currently FDA-recognized version of ASTM F1980: Standard
Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems for Medical Devices and specify the
environmental parameters established to attain the expiration date. Testing of real-time aged
devices can be conducted in parallel with submission review, with results documented to file
in the design history file (i.e., complete test reports do not need to be submitted to FDA).
