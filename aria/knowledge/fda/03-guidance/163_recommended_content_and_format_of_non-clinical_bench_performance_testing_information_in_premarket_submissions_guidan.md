Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction and Scope

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed this document to describe relevant
information that should be included in test report summaries, test protocols, and complete test
reports for non-clinical bench performance testing provided in a premarket submission (i.e.,
premarket approval (PMA) applications, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications,
premarket notification (510(k)) submissions, investigational device exemption (IDE)
applications, and De Novo requests).
For the purpose of this document, non-clinical bench performance testing is defined as
performance testing, performed by either a device manufacturer or a third party testing facility
(e.g., test laboratory), which encompasses all bench testing and will be dependent upon the
specifics of the actual device or device type. Non-clinical bench performance testing includes,
but is not limited to: mechanical and biological engineering performance (such as fatigue, wear,
tensile strength, compression, and burst pressure); bench tests using ex vivo, in vitro, and in situ
animal1 or human tissue; and animal carcass or human cadaveric testing.

1

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Non-clinical bench performance testing excludes biocompatibility evaluation, reprocessing or
sterilization validation, human factors, software verification and validation, and computational
modeling, because relevant information on these assessments are detailed in associated guidance
documents. Test reports for clinical studies, animal studies, and studies evaluating the
performance characteristics of in vitro diagnostic devices are also excluded from the scope of
this document.
The information listed below is intended to help ensure that clear and consistent information is
provided in premarket submissions containing non-clinical bench performance testing.2 The
information in this guidance is intended to be used in conjunction with other FDA guidance
documents, including device-specific guidances, as well as in conjuction with specific test
reporting recommendations in FDA-recognized standards. For more information regarding use of
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
“Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices”3 and “Standards Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions
Reviewed in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.”4
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Reporting of Non­Clinical Bench Performance Testing
Information
To facilitate FDA’s review, we recommend that in all premarket submissions containing nonclinical bench performance testing information, you include “test report summaries” (i.e., a
summary of the conducted testing as described by the submitter of the premarket submission)
and “complete test reports,” when appropriate. You should provide test report summaries either
embedded within an executive summary section of the premarket submission or provided as a
separate document within the premarket submission (see Section II.A for more details). When
necessary, you should provide complete test reports as separate attachments to the premarket
submission (see Section II.B for more details). You can provide test protocols as separate
attachments to the premarket submission, or as part of a complete test report (see Section II.B

The recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the least burdensome provisions (see Sections 513(a),
513(i), and 515(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) and guiding principles described in the guidance
“The Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/least-burdensome-provisions-concept-and-principles.

and C for more details). The submitted summaries, test protocols, and test reports should be
clear, legible, and written in English or have English translations.
Complete test reports are typically not needed for Special 510(k)s and for some testing provided
within Abbreviated 510(k)s. For premarket submissions with tests for which a Declaration of
Conformity (DOC) to an appropriate FDA-recognized consensus standard is provided, the
information to support the DOC (i.e., supplemental documentation) will vary based on the
elements addressed by the consensus standard, but may include test report summaries, test
protocols, and/or complete test reports. For additional information regarding the use of consensus
standards and a DOC, please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary
Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices”5 and “Standards
Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions Reviewed in the Center for
Biologics Evaluation and Research.”6
Your premarket submission should also discuss how the non-clinical bench performance test
results support the overall submission (e.g., substantial equivalence for 510(k), reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for PMA). The conclusions from your testing should
discuss, for example, how the testing demonstrates substantial equivalence of your device to the
identified primary predicate device for a 510(k)7 or demonstrates a reasonable assurance of
safety and effectiveness of the device for a PMA8 or De Novo request.9 This information can be
provided in the test report summary (see Section II.A below) or another location in your
premarket submission, and the information should be referenced appropriately for ease of
identification within the submission.

A.

Test Report Summaries

We recommend that within the body of your premarket submission, you provide test
report summaries that briefly describe and summarize the testing performed to support
the submission. The test report summaries may be included within the executive
summary of a premarket submission. Alternatively, a test report summary may be
provided as a distinct document within the premarket submission (e.g., as a preface to the
complete test reports). The test report summaries should include the following elements:

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

1. Test(s) performed
You should identify the tests performed. If the testing was conducted as
recommended by a FDA guidance document or FDA-recognized consensus standard,
we recommend that you state such in the test report summary.

2. Objective(s) of the test(s)
You should provide test objectives in the test report summary if a complete test report
is not provided within the premarket submission.

3. A brief description of the test methods, including sample size,
device(s) tested, and any consensus standard(s) utilized
In the test report summary, you should briefly describe the test methods used for the
conducted bench tests, or reference an established method that was followed, such as
any FDA-recognized consensus standards that were used for the conducted testing.
You should also provide a description of the test sample that was tested (whether it is
a final, finished device or not), and whether that sample is the entire device, a part or
component, or an attribute of the device (e.g., the device’s material
composition/properties or packaging). In addition to the description of the test
sample, you should include a brief discussion on sample selection (e.g., size or
configuration) and how the samples represented a clinically relevant worst-case
scenario(s).

4. Pre-defined pass/fail criteria (when applicable)
We recommend that your test report summary include an identification of the
acceptance criteria, when applicable, that were pre-defined and that were applied
during testing. When a non-clinical bench performance test that is conducted for
characterization purposes does not have acceptance criteria, you should still provide a
description of the assessment criteria that you used to allow for interpretation of the
data, for example, the visual inspection criteria utilized for coating integrity testing
when assessing voids or cracks.

5. Results summary
a. Provide an appropriate summary of data (in tabular and/or text format),
including a summary from any analyses performed. For example:
§ For quantitative assessments, provide appropriate summary
parameters such as: the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and
maximum for normal data; or summary parameters per the data
analysis plan.
§ For attribute or qualitative data, provide an appropriate summary
of the number of observed characteristics by category (e.g.,
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

characteristic present/total observations, characteristic absent/total
observations). Include statistical information such as
confidence/reliability level, if applicable.
b. Specify whether the acceptance criteria (if applicable) were met.
c. Provide a brief explanation of study results that do not meet acceptance
criteria, and/or protocol deviations that may have impacted the study results,
conclusions, or data integrity, and describe how the resulting concerns were
resolved.

6. Discussion/Conclusions
Your test report summaries should provide a discussion of the conclusions drawn
from the test results. This section of the test report summary can be used to provide
additional information regarding the testing conducted and/or observed test results
(e.g., justification for the methods used to perform the testing, clinical/scientific/
engineering basis for the acceptance criteria, outlying and anomalous results). Note
that a justification for methods and/or acceptance criteria is generally not needed if
they were directly obtained from a FDA-recognized consensus standard or guidance
document. A discussion of the test methods or acceptance criteria, if needed, can
include how the testing relates to the use of the device in clinical practice or as
described in literature. For example, tracking tests typically use a fixture that
simulates the target anatomy. A discussion or justification for the tracking test fixture
used would address how the testing relates to expected worst-case clinical use for the
indicated anatomical location. For non-clinical bench performance tests that are
conducted for characterization purposes, the conclusions should address the
relationship between the results and the intended performance of the device. As noted
above, a brief discussion of how the test results support the overall submission can be
included in the test report summary or another location in your submission.

7. Location of complete test report
We recommend that you identify the location (e.g., appendix and/or page number) for
each complete test report for which a summary is provided, if applicable.

8. Summary table (optional)
As an alternative to a written narrative for each non-clinical bench performance test, a
tabulated summary can be provided to organize the information recommended in a
test report summary (see below for example). If a summary table is used, it is still
recommended that a narrative discussion of the results/conclusions be provided as
described above in Section II.A.6, when needed.

Complete Test Reports

We recommend that premarket submissions include complete test reports attached to the
main body of the submission (e.g., in an appendix). A complete test report means the
entirety of the testing documentation submitted for a study, which some submitters or test
labs might embody in a single document, while others might embody in multiple and
separate documents (e.g., a test protocol and a test report; see Section II.C). We
recommend that efforts be made to ensure that scanned test reports are legible in order to
reduce the likelihood of requests for additional, more legible, copies.10
Complete test reports should include the information described below.

1. Test performed
The test report should clearly state the test that was performed.

2. Objective of the test
The test report should state the purpose of the test that was conducted. Note that this
information can alternatively be provided in the test protocol.

3. Description of test methods
You should provide a detailed description of the test methods with sufficient detail
that an individual familiar with testing of the device type will be able to interpret the
purpose of the test, how the test was conducted, and whether the test setup and data
analysis was appropriate to assess the performance of the device type.
If FDA-recognized consensus standards that include test methods are utilized during
testing, providing detailed test methods or a test protocol is generally unnecessary,

Administration Staff,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

even when a DOC to the standard is not provided (i.e., general use of consensus
standards). Instead, you should provide a full citation of the standard, including the
version, and information regarding the extent to which the standard was followed,
including deviations from the standard. Similarly, if you provide a DOC to a FDArecognized consensus standard that includes test methods, providing detailed test
methods or a test protocol is typically not necessary. When the FDA-recognized
consensus standard includes choices related to, for example, what is to be tested,
which test methods to use, or performance limits to assess conformity, you should
include an explanation for the choices and selections made. When test methods have
deviated from the FDA-recognized consensus standard used, we recommend that you
provide this information within the DOC if one is submitted, or within the complete
test report if no DOC is submitted. For additional information regarding the use of
consensus standards, DOC, and supplemental documentation to support a DOC,
please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices”11 and “Standards
Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions Reviewed in the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.”12
a. Test sample information
The test report should provide a description of the test sample that was tested
(whether it is a final, finished device or not), and whether that sample is the entire
device, a part or component, or an attribute of the device (e.g., the device’s
material composition/properties or packaging).
Generally, the tested devices should represent the final, finished device that has
been subject to all manufacturing processes for the “to be marketed” device
(including sterilization, environmental conditioning, simulated transportation,
etc.). If you conducted any testing on samples that are not the final, finished (e.g.,
sterilized) product or part or component, we recommend that you indicate this in
the test report summary and the test report, if known (e.g., if test lab is aware that
the test sample is not the final, finished device), along with a justification
explaining why this approach is appropriate given any differences that may
impact performance of the tested device compared to the final, finished device
that is to be marketed. You should specify the number of sterilization cycles or
other conditioning (e.g., simulated use, environmental conditioning, distribution
simulation, aging) that the samples have been exposed to prior to testing. If test
samples were conditioned or sterilized in a manner that is different than what is
intended for the marketed product, we recommend that you provide a
justification.
b. Test sample size/selection

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

We recommend that you provide a scientific rationale to support the number of
samples tested. The sample size selected should be based upon the objective of
the study and supported by your risk analysis and sampling plan. For testing
performed according to a FDA-recognized consensus standard or as specified in a
FDA guidance document, the sample size selected should meet the applicable
recommendations of the standard or guidance. When applicable, you should
follow any device-specific guidance document recommendations for sample
selection.
If one particular device model is used to represent the entire family (or a subset
thereof) of device models included in your submission, you should justify why the
tested device is representative of the entire product family (or subset) and explain
why the tested device represents the worst-case design for that respective test. In
some cases, there may be multiple worst-case designs per family, and a “fourcorners” or bracketed approach may be appropriate and should be justified.
Finally, your test sample selection should account for both inter- and intra-lot
variability by examining multiple manufacturing lots, when appropriate (e.g.,
when it is expected that such sampling is likely to impact the testing results and/or
is needed to adequately capture the variability in the testing results).
c. Test methods
The test report should contain a concise description of the test methods utilized in
the conducted testing. You should also include materials used, methods, and a
description of the test parameters, including an explanation of and rationale for
critical test parameters, when appropriate, and any specific sample preparation
steps. In many cases, labeled diagrams or photographs of the test setup and test
fixtures can be helpful in understanding the test methods, and should be included
with the test methods to provide appropriate context.

4. Pass/Fail criteria
You should describe in the test report, the acceptance criteria that you prospectively
identified, including specifications or acceptance and rejection criteria, and a
clinical/scientific/engineering justification for these criteria, when applicable. The
acceptance criteria should be based on the specific performance needs of the device and
the intended use of the device. An example of an appropriate clinical/scientific/
engineering justification for an acceptance criterion includes a performance specification
of the device based on clinical use; e.g., “tensile strength of component should be 10
times the expected normal working load since failure of the component could cause
serious injury to patients.” If applicable, you should refer to FDA-recognized consensus
standards or FDA guidance documents for recommended acceptance criteria. When a
non-clinical bench performance test that is conducted for characterization purposes does
not have acceptance criteria, you should still provide a description of the assessment
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

criteria that you used to allow for interpretation of the data, at a minimum, in the test
report summary.

5. Data analysis plan
We recommend that your test report include the data analysis plan used to analyze your
results. Your data analysis plan should include all planned quantitative and/or qualitative
assessments.

6. Test results
We recommend that you include the following items in the test results section of your test
report:
a. Data
We recommend that you present the data collected for all test samples (including
outlying and anomalous results) during the tests conducted to support the
premarket submission, where appropriate and routinely provided. The results
should be presented in data sheets or tables. These data should be accompanied by
a summary of the data and applicable statistical information. Also, in situations
where they may yield additional context, such as when testing to failure, images
of the failure mode should be provided. You should use appropriate units of
measure that are consistent throughout your report. Values should be reported to
the appropriate significant digit, and if the data is rounded, you should specify the
rounding method used.
b. Data analysis
You should analyze the data, including any outlying points and anomalous results,
using statistical analyses when appropriate, and indicate whether the acceptance
criteria were met. As discussed in Section II.A.5, these analyses could include
quantitative and/or qualitative assessments. If the data analysis concludes that the
acceptance criteria were not met for either individual samples or entire sample
populations, we recommend that you discuss (in either the test report or test report
summary) the potential reasons for failure of the testing to meet the acceptance
criteria, and whether re-testing was determined to be appropriate and why.
c. Protocol deviations
We recommend that you describe test protocol deviations, particularly those that
may have impacted the study results, conclusions, or data integrity. The test report
should discuss the reasons why the deviations occurred, a description of any
activities executed to determine the source of the deviation, and an assessment of
their impact on the test results, conclusions, or data integrity.
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

7. Discussion/Conclusions
We recommend that the test report discuss the conclusions drawn from the test
results in consideration of the stated study objective. For example, the test report
conclusions should indicate whether the pre-specified acceptance criteria were
met.

C.

Test Protocols

A “test protocol” typically consists of the methods that were used to conduct the testing
(see Section II.B.3), the objective of the test (see Section II.B.2), pre-specified acceptance
criteria (see Section II.B.4), and data analysis plan (see Section II.B.5). This information
can be provided in the premarket submission within the complete test report, or can be
provided as a separate test protocol document submitted along with the test report.
