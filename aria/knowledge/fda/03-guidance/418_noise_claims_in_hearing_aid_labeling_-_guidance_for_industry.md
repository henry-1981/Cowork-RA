Noise Claims In Hearing Aid Labeling
Manufacturers who make noise claims in their labeling for
hearing aids (e.g. improved speech understanding in noisy
environments) are no longer required to submit a 510(k)
premarket notification to obtain a “substantially equivalent”
decision in support of these claims.
Under the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act
(FDAMA) of 1997, air conduction hearing aids are exempt from
premarket notification subject to limitations of exemptions
found in 21CFR 874.9.
The limitations of exemptions basically state that a major
change in the intended use of a hearing aid or a change in the
fundamental scientific technology would require a new 510(k)
submission. Specifically, a change that only involves the
addition of a noise claim to the labeling, including promotion
and advertising materials, does not exceed the limitations of
exemptions and does not require a new 510(k).
Manufacturers should develop substantiating data, from
scientific and/or clinical studies, to support their claims.
This data should be kept and maintained at the manufacturer’s
facility. The data should be made available for review at the
request of the FDA or made available during an FDA inspection.
Claims that are determined to be unsubstantiated may result in
the device being misbranded under Section 502 of the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
