Reporting of Computational
Modeling Studies in Medical Device
Submissions
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction
For many years, computational modeling and simulation (CM&S) studies have been used by
sponsors to support device design/development and have been reported in medical device
submissions. These studies have traditionally been used in the areas of fluid dynamics (e.g.,
calculate shear stress in ventricular assist devices), solid mechanics (e.g., determine
maximum stress locations in a hip implant), electromagnetics and optics (e.g., radiofrequency
safety in magnetic resonance imaging, fluorescence for fiber optic spectroscopy devices),
ultrasound propagation (e.g., absorbed energy distribution for therapeutic ultrasound), and
thermal propagation (e.g., temperature rises with radiofrequency and laser ablation devices).
The purpose of this guidance document is to provide recommendations to industry on the
formatting, organization, and content of reports of CM&S studies that are used to support
medical device submissions. Moreover, this guidance is also for FDA Staff, to improve the
consistency and predictability of the review of CM&S studies and to better facilitate full
interpretation and complete review of those studies.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Scope
Computational modeling and simulation studies, together with bench, nonclinical in vivo, and
clinical studies, can be used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. In
order for the CM&S studies to serve as valid scientific evidence in regulatory submissions,
specific details need to be included in the report of such studies. In this guidance, the term
“CM&S report” refers to the part of a regulatory submission that provides information about
a CM&S study; the term does not describe a new submission requirement.
The recommended format provided in this document aims to establish uniformity in reporting
CM&S studies. FDA recognizes that the level of detail to be reported will vary and will
depend on the context of use for the CM&S studies. Moreover, there are a variety of CM&S
modalities and thus the specific details will vary across disciplines. Therefore, we have
provided a general outline in the main body of this document and five subject matter
appendices for CM&S modalities that are widely used in regulatory submissions. The main
body is written in general terms to capture reporting for any modality. The five appendices
provide more background, structure, and specific terminology for the following subject areas:
I.
II.
III.
IV.
V.

Fluid Dynamics and Mass Transport
Solid Mechanics
Electromagnetics and Optics
Ultrasound
Heat Transfer

For multiphysics modeling, recommendations in several of these appendices may apply.
The scope of this guidance is limited to how CM&S studies and its outcomes can be used to
support a regulatory submission when medical devices use such studies to determine safety
and effectiveness. This guidance document does not address or make a determination
whether CM&S tools may be considered medical devices.
While verification and validation of the CM&S studies are necessary components of the
report, this document does not establish the amount or type of verification and validation
needed to support using the CM&S studies in regulatory submissions. Further, this guidance
document does not address how to conduct a computational modeling or simulation study,
nor does adherence to this guidance ensure that your computational modeling or simulation
study is adequate or appropriate. This guidance only provides guidelines for reporting this
information to FDA and highlights some common issues with models and simulations.

Outline of the CM&S Report
In the following section, we provide the recommended headings and details for a CM&S
report contained within a regulatory submission.

I.

Executive Report Summary

We recommend that you provide a concise and complete overview of the report of the
computational modeling and/or simulation study, that includes the following:
• Context of use of the CM&S study including a clear identification of the
quantity(s) of interest (QOI) (e.g., to determine the maximum stress value(s) and
location(s))
• Scope of the analysis (e.g., for a device that has multiple sizes and/or
configurations, specify which sizes and/or configurations were modeled, and how
the computational model relates to the intended patient population)
• Type of analysis (e.g., fluid dynamics and mass transport, solid mechanics,
electromagnetics and optics, ultrasound, heat transfer)
• Conclusions with respect to the context of use
• Keywords: we recommend that you provide up to five keywords or key phrases
that describe the modeling modality, the device product code, any relevant
materials of the device, analysis type, and if applicable, location in the body. For
more information on the device product code, refer to the FDA guidance entitled
“Medical Device Classification Product Codes” issued on April 11, 2013. The
following are examples of keywords that outline this information:
− e.g., finite element analysis, MIH, nitinol, fatigue, aorta
− e.g., radiofrequency dosimetry, OQG, cobalt chromium, magnetic
resonance safety, hip
This information will be used for semantic text mining of CM&S reports to better
understand the impact of this guidance on CM&S studies used in regulatory
submissions.

II.

Background/Introduction

We recommend that you provide a brief description of the device system and intended
use environment. Discuss the context of use of the analysis, as this will dictate the

III.

Code Verification

We recommend that you provide a brief description of the software quality assurance
(SQA) and numerical code verification (NCV) that you performed. Code verification
establishes the correctness of the code used as software tools for CM&S and establishes
the correctness and fidelity of the numerical algorithms; this is accomplished through
SQA and NCV. Software tools include off-the-shelf, modified-off-the-shelf, or userdeveloped. Code verification is important, regardless of the software type.
A. Details
SQA ensures that the code is functioning correctly and produces repeatable results on
specified computer hardware and in a specified software environment. NCV ensures
correct implementation and functioning of the numerical code, which is typically
accomplished by, for example, comparison to bench-mark solutions, method of
manufactured solutions. You should briefly describe the code verification activities.

• the methods of the mesh refinement study, and provide representative images
of the meshes used in the refinement study;
• the mesh sensitivity analysis performed to justify the production mesh used
for the subsequent simulations, that is, to demonstrate that the mesh density
did not affect the numerical results;
• the numerical metrics (e.g., shear rates, concentration gradients) chosen to
establish the mesh density; and
• the algorithm for assigning the mesh density or distribution.

IX.

Numerical Implementation

We recommend that you provide information regarding the numerical implementation
used to solve the governing equations.
A. Details
You should describe the discretization of the equations, including:
• numerical method used (e.g., finite element, finite volume, finite difference);

and discuss the ramifications of the particular choice (i.e., discretization errors).

X. Validation
We recommend that you provide information regarding the method(s) employed to
validate the computational model [1]. We recommend the following format for
presenting that information.
A. General Description
• You should describe, if any, the experimental or analytical comparator that
was used for model validation study (e.g., velocity, wall shear stress
calculations, hydrodynamic pressure loss). If a comparator was used, describe
if the comparison was made in a quantitative (preferred) or qualitative
manner.

• You should describe the validation test conditions and geometry.
• You should describe the region of interest where validation(s) are performed.
• You should provide diagrams and data to support the assessment of the model.
• You should describe instrumentation and calibration.
• If a biological process was modeled (e.g., hemolysis, platelet damage, binding
of drug in vessel tissue), then you should describe how the biological
calculations were verified and validated.
C. Assumptions and Rationale

use of surrogates when biological information is lacking).

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
You should provide a rationale to support any differences between the
operating and boundary conditions of the comparator experiments and

parameters contained in turbulence models, boundary conditions, fluid
properties).
• You should provide a rationale for any geometric and dynamic scaling
assumptions.
D. Validation Study Results
• You should provide qualitative comparisons between the QOI from the
computational model and experimental results. For example, images that
directly compare model and experimental results (e.g., velocity or shear
stress) can provide an overall qualitative assessment of how well the model
can capture relevant behavior.
• You should provide quantitative comparisons for critical areas of relevance to
the goals of the study [2, 3].
E. Discussion
• You should discuss the degree of agreement between the computational and
experimental results.

experiment, you should provide a measure of confidence, as well as the risk
associated and how it influenced your decision.

XI.

Results

We recommend that you present the quantitative results from the computational modeling
study. You should provide the results with sufficient level of details, including labels and
legends. The results may be presented in more than one format (e.g., table, graph, plot).
Specifically, we recommend that you present the results in regions of interest graphically
and quantitatively. Additionally, please consider providing the following, as applicable:

XII. Limitations
We recommend that you provide details regarding how the assumptions/simplifications
described in the previous sections might affect the output of the computational model and
simulation, the interpretation of the results, and the relevance to the purpose of the study.
Because assumptions and simplifications are made in the generation of the model device,
in the performance of the simulation, and in the interpretation of the analysis, it is
important to describe the limitations of the use of the computational model and the
interpretation of the results. Therefore, we recommend that you discuss how the
assumptions/simplifications might affect the output of the model and simulation and the
interpretation of its relevance to device performance and safety.
For example, it is important to know whether the simulation of blood flow through a
small gap in a blood pump was based on the nominal dimensions or whether it includes
the limits of the manufactured component tolerances. If you believe that your results are
significantly dependent on the assumptions and/or simplifications in your model, you
should consider performing sensitivity analyses on the computational model parameters
associated with the assumptions and simplifications.

XIII. Discussion/Conclusion
We recommend that you summarize the CM&S study with respect to the context of use
and how it relates to the regulatory submission (e.g., selecting the device size that is
expected to perform the worst under the simulated use conditions, establishing the
loading conditions for bench testing). Discuss how the results compare with
experimental results, literature results and/or prior product performances, if these results
exist. Discuss the assumptions and simplifications that were made to the model and how
they are expected to affect the results and interpretation of the results. Discuss the
strength of your conclusions in terms of the limitations of the model that you have
identified. Discuss how your results convey acceptable performance of the product in
vivo, if applicable.

rrcm@fda.hhs.gov.

Introduction/Scope of the Appendix
The purpose of this appendix is to provide recommendations on the formatting, organization,
and content of reports for computational solid mechanics modeling studies in medical device
regulatory submissions.
Specific examples provided in this appendix, such as output metrics, are only examples and
should not be considered as requirements or recommendations for the type of CM&S studies
and validation to complete.
The scope of this appendix is limited to finite element analysis (FEA). FDA acknowledges
that there are other types of computational modeling modalities that can be used to evaluate
the mechanics and kinematics of medical devices. Additionally, FDA acknowledges the
issues and considerations for non-finite element analyses are similar to those raised for FEA
and aspects of this guidance might be applicable. However, there might be aspects of the
non-FEA approaches that are distinct from FEA and could present other issues which are not
addressed in this appendix but should be included in the reporting of those studies.

applied displacements, forces, pressures, or moments.
• You should describe any constraints used in the model, including the
location(s) and the degrees of freedom for each fixed or free constraint.

appropriate for the relevant aspect of the context of use. You should describe the
sources and/or methods used to obtain the loading mode and magnitude (e.g.,
literature data, standards, imaging, other analytic methods).

refinement or adaptive meshing in transition regions or regions of complex
geometry. We recommend that you provide figures depicting the mesh at

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

relevant scales, especially in transition regions or regions of complex
geometry and regions of high stress or strain.
You should provide details of the mesh refinement or convergence analysis
used to demonstrate that the QOI are independent of element size.
− Report the number of mesh densities used to demonstrate convergence
stability of the QOI with respect to element size.
− Report the metric(s) of the mesh refinement analysis in graphical or
tabular format and clearly identify the mesh chosen for the analysis
against the criterion.

B. Assumptions, simplifications, and rationale
Regarding the mesh refinement study, you should provide rationale for the type of
element selected and for the numerical criterion chosen (e.g., principal stress,
displacement) to evaluate the mesh density.

IX.

vibration, buckling).
• You should provide details on the solver routine used including, at a
minimum, the following parameters:
− state whether the solver is implicit or explicit. If the latter, include and
provide rationale for the analysis time frame, time step size, material(s)
density and any mass scaling used
− indicate if the solver accounted for nonlinear geometric changes.
− state the convergence criteria and iteration method.

X. Validation
We recommend that you provide information regarding the methods employed to validate
the computational model [1]. The results of a validation study support the choice of the
input parameters to the computational model.
You should describe how the validation study supports the context of use of the CM&S
study. Specify the QOI(s) from the validation experiment and their relationship to
computational model of the validation experiment. We suggest the following format for
reporting the validation study.
A. Details
i. Comparator
You should describe the comparator (e.g., physical test, in vivo study,
literature) used for validation. Include the following:

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
a. mode of loading;
b. boundary and loading conditions including the loading and
unloading path, as applicable;
c. environmental parameters within the experiment (e.g., temperature,
humidity); and
d. manufacturing processes or pre-conditioning applied to the device
prior to conducting the experiment, if applicable. For example, if the
model is designed to predict safety of a nitinol cardiovascular stent,
specify if the device was loaded onto a delivery systems and tracked
through a representative anatomical model prior to experimental
measurements.
You should describe the apparatus used to capture data during the
experiment, the level of measurement accuracy and uncertainty. For
example, if the validation study compares uniaxial force-extension data
between the computational model and an experiment, present the capacity
and accuracy of the load cell used to measure force data.
You should describe the locations on the device or tissue where the
experimental measurements were acquired. For example, if your study is
designed to analyze strain in a hip stem, describe where strain gauges were
placed to acquire the data.
ii.

Computational model of the Validation Setting
You should describe the boundary and loading conditions used for the
validation model and describe how they relate to the experimental
comparator. For example, the rate and magnitude of applied torsion to a
pedicle screw system in the computational model should match that applied
to the device mounted on a mechanical testing system.
You should describe the validation model QOI. If applicable, describe any
post-processing calculations.

Include images that directly compare the validation model and experimental QOIs
(e.g., deformation or stress contours) to demonstrate that the computational model is
able to capture relevant behavior.
You should present a quantitative comparison of the QOI from the computational
model and experimental at relevant steps in the analysis. For example, if the
validation study compared the radial force generated by the stent during the step of
being loaded on to the delivery system, it might be more insightful to compare this
force at several diameters between nominal and loaded diameter rather than at the
final loaded diameter.
B. Assumptions, simplifications and rationale
You should discuss the relevance of the validation experiment to expected loading
conditions as described in the context of use, implications of model and experimental

24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
assumptions on the results, limitations on the agreement between the validation model
and experiment, and the extent of predictive capability of the general model.
If the validation model parameters are different from those used in the computational
model for the context of use, you should provide rationale for the differences.
You should list and discuss the assumptions for the validation model (i.e., neglecting
viscous behavior if you are comparing instantaneous force values).
You should list and discuss the simplifications for the validation model. These
simplifications might include geometric, such as axisymmetry, or may consist of
explanations for testing device sub-components (e.g., validating the wear scar on
articulating components in a total disc replacement device may not necessitate
modeling of the device-bone interface).
You should provide a discussion of the extent to which the validation model captures
the observed validation experimental behavior and its limitations.

Mohr-Coulomb), along with a graphic or equation that clearly demonstrates
how factors of safety were calculated;
• the QOI values and graphically display the location(s) of the critical stresses,
strains, forces, or displacements; and
• the safety factors. For reporting the safety factors:
− provide a table that specifies the safety factors for each case (i.e.,
device size, loading mode(s), and analysis step); and
− show locations of minimum safety factor(s) on the device graphically.
We recommend that you provide the following for fatigue evaluation:
• a description of the method used to calculate mean and alternating
stresses/strains (e.g., scalar, tensor);
• a statement on whether cyclic loading results in rotations of the principal
directions;
• a description of the fatigue criterion (e.g., Goodman, Soderberg), along with a
graphic or equation that clearly demonstrates how fatigue factors of safety are
calculated; and

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

the fatigue safety factors. For reporting fatigue safety factors:
− provide a table that specifies the critical mean and alternating
stresses/strains and the resulting safety factors for each device size,
loading mode(s), and analysis step;
− Show locations of minimum safety factor(s) on the device graphically;
and
− Plot mean and/or alternating stress/strains on a point cloud graph and
include fatigue criterion if applicable.

For other analysis types (e.g., vibration or buckling), we recommend that you provide all
relevant results including critical stresses or strains and their locations on the device as
well as describe any post-processing techniques used to evaluate safety and/or
performance.
If multiple loading modes were modeled separately, we recommend that you provide
rationale and discuss the implications of superposition of stress or strain states for each
loading mode (e.g., location, direction, and phase of the critical stresses or strains).

XII. Limitations
We recommend that you discuss the major limitations of the computational model
identified in Sections II-XI above. Discuss any inconsistencies between the results and
the assumptions and simplifications.
If the conclusions of the analysis are significantly dependent on the assumptions and/or
simplifications of the computational model, we recommend that you report on a
sensitivity analysis of the parameters associated with those assumptions and/or
simplifications.

XIII. Discussion/Conclusion
You should state the overall conclusions of the CM&S study and whether the objective(s)
outlined in the context of use have been met.
We recommend that you discuss the results with respect to the context of use. For
example, discuss how critical stresses or strains obtained from the computational model
relate to failure locations observed in bench testing and/or the potential consequences of
failure at locations of minimum safety factor.
