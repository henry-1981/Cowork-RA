FDA exempted certain class II surgical masks from premarket
notification requirements, subject to conditions and limitations (83 FR
22846). Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective
devices (i.e., N95s) used in a healthcare setting and worn by healthcare
personnel during procedures to protect both the patient and the
healthcare personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids,
and particulate material that are regulated under procode MSH are
exempt from premarket notification.
FDA is assessing how to revise this guidance to represent our current
thinking on this topic. For more information, please contact

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Surgical Masks - Premarket Notification
[510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket notification
submissions for surgical masks and other masks including isolation masks, procedure masks, and
dental masks. These devices may be used by healthcare personnel during procedures to protect
both the patient and the healthcare personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids,
and particulate material.
The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe should be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues
we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is
available on our Center web page at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.

1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type should conform to the
general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), including the
premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a
substantial equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also 21
CFR 807.81 and 807.87).
This guidance document identifies the classification regulation and product codes for surgical
masks (refer to Section 4). In addition, other sections of this guidance document provide
additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks related to these devices in premarket
notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements
of a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and "How to
Prepare a 510(k) Submission" on FDA Device Advice at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial
Equivalence in Premarket Notifications; Final Guidance,”
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html, a manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or
has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an
Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing
that device. Manufacturers considering modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen
the regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA may consider the
contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the meaning of 21 CFR
807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary report. The report should
describe how this guidance document was used during the device development and testing and
should briefly describe the methods or tests used. We recommend that you also include a
summary of the test data or description of the acceptance criteria applied to address the risks
identified in this document, as well as any additional risks specific to your device. This section
suggests information to fulfill some of the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87, as well as some other
items that we recommend you include in an Abbreviated 510(k).
Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and
cite the title of this guidance document.
Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Refer to Section 11 for specific information that we recommend you
include in labeling.)
Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain a:

1

•

Description of the device and its intended use. We recommend that the description
include a complete discussion of the performance specifications and, when
appropriate, detailed, labeled drawings of the device. (Refer to Section 5 for specific
information that we recommend you include in the device description for devices of
the types covered by this guidance document.) You should also submit an
"indications for use" enclosure.1

•

Description of device design requirements.

•

Identification of the risk analysis method(s) used to assess the risk profile in general
as well as the specific device’s design and the results of this analysis. (Refer to
Section 6 for the risks to health generally associated with the use of this device that
FDA has identified.)

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.

•

Discussion of the device characteristics that address the risks identified in this
guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in your risk analysis.

•

Brief description of the test method(s) you have used or intend to use to address each
performance aspect identified in Sections 7-10 of this guidance document. If you
follow a suggested test method, you may cite the method rather than describing it. If
you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method but should provide
sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for the modification. For
each test, you may either (1) briefly present the data resulting from the test in clear
and concise form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that you will
apply to your test results.2 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design Controls
under the Quality System Regulation.)

•

If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or
testing, you may include either a:
o statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance
criteria before the product is marketed; or
o declaration of conformity to the standard.3
Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe you
cannot properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the
testing the standard describes. For more information, please refer to section
514(c)(1)(B) of the act and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial
Equivalence Determinations; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html.

We may request additional information about aspects of the device’s performance characteristics
or information to assess the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the subject
device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being introduced into
interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance criteria and, thus,
differs from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends that submitters apply
the same criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3))
to determine whether marketing of the finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

may request any additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding
substantial equivalence.)
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you may submit a Traditional 510(k) that
provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87. A Traditional 510(k)
should include all of your methods, data, acceptance criteria, and conclusions. Manufacturers
considering modifications to their own cleared devices should consider submitting Special
510(k)s.

Risks to Health

In the table below, FDA has identified the risks to health generally associated with the use of the
surgical masks addressed in this document. The information we recommend you include in your
510(k) to address these identified risks are given in this guidance document, as shown in the
table below. We recommend that you conduct a risk analysis, before submitting your 510(k), to
identify any other risks specific to your device. The 510(k) should describe the risk analysis
method. If you elect to use an alternative approach to address a particular risk identified in this
document, or have identified risks additional to those in this document, you should provide
sufficient detail to support the approach you have used to address that risk.

NIOSH certification

Surgical masks include parts that have prolonged contact with intact skin. We recommend that
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

you evaluate the biocompatibility of the materials in these parts as described in the standard ISO10993, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing” for limited
contact devices, contacting intact skin. We also recommend that you document the results in
your design history file as a part of the Quality Systems Requirements (21 CFR 820.30). You
should select tests appropriate for the duration and level of contact with your device. If identical
materials are used in a predicate device with the same type and duration of skin contact, you may
identify the predicate device in lieu of performing biocompatibility testing.
For a surgical mask that is also an N95 Respirator and certified by NIOSH as a respirator,
you may submit the NIOSH certification number in lieu of filter efficiency performance
(Section 8) and differential pressure (Section 9).

7.

Fluid Resistance

Fluid resistance is the ability of the mask’s material to resist the penetration of blood and body
fluids. We recommend that you evaluate the fluid resistance of your device using the standard
listed below.
•

ASTM F 1862: Standard Test Method for Resistance of Surgical Mask to Penetration by
Synthetic Blood

According to ASTM F 1862, surgical masks are tested on a pass/fail basis at three velocities
corresponding to the range of human blood pressure (80, 120, 160 mm Hg). Fluid resistance
may be claimed if the device passes ASTM F1862 at any levels. Surgical masks that show
passing results at higher velocities are more fluid resistant.

8.

Filtration Efficiency

For surgical masks that are not NIOSH certified N95 Respirators, we recommend that you
evaluate filter efficiency performance and bacterial filtration efficiency. For surgical masks that
are NIOSH certified N95 Respirators, you may submit your NIOSH certification number in lieu
of this information.
Particulate Filtration Efficiency
We recommend that you conduct a particle challenge study using 0.1-Micron Polystyrene
Latex Spheres. This in vitro test challenges the mask with unneutralized 0.1-micron
polystyrene latex spheres and measures penetration. The use of latex spheres provides an
appropriately rigorous test for evaluating a submicron efficiency performance (ASTM F
1215-89 Standard Test Method for Determining the Initial Efficiency of Flatsheet Filter
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Medium in an Airflow Using Latex Spheres.).
Bacterial Filtration Efficiency
Bacterial Filtration Efficiency (BFE) is a measure of the ability of the mask’s material to
prevent the passage of aerosolized bacteria. BFE is expressed in the percentage of a known
quantity that does not pass the mask material at a given aerosol flow rate. We recommend
that you evaluate the BFE of your device using one of the test methods or standards listed
below.

9.

•

Bacterial Penetration (aerosol filtration) - Mil- M369454C, Military Specifications:
Surgical Mask, disposable (June 12, 1975).

•

Modified Greene and Vesley Method: Method for evaluation of bacterial filtration
efficiency of surgical masks. J Bacteriol 83:663-667. (1962).

•

ASTM F2101-01 Standard Test Method for Evaluating the Bacterial Filtration
Efficiency (BFE) of surgical masks using a Biological Aerosol of Staphylococcus
aureus.

Differential Pressure (Delta-P) Test

For surgical masks that are not NIOSH certified N95 Respirators, we recommend that you
evaluate differential pressure. For surgical masks that are NIOSH certified N95 Respirators, you
may submit your NIOSH certification number in lieu of this information.
Differential Pressure (Delta-P) is the measured pressure drop across a surgical facemask
material. Delta-P determines the resistance of the surgical facemask to air flowing through the
mask. Pressure drop also relates to the breathability and comfort of the surgical mask. In
general, a lower Delta-P translates to increased breathability.
•

10. Flammability Testing
We recommend using one of the standards below to determine the flammability by class.
•

CPSC CS-191-53 Flammability Test Method (16 CFR 1610) Standard for Flammability
of Clothing Textiles

•

NFPA Standard 702-1980: Standard for Classification of Flammability of Wearing
Apparel 4

•

UL 2154: Test that measures the level of atmospheric oxygen required to propagate
flame when ignition is caused by an electrosurgery unit or laser. Higher levels of oxygen
required for flame propagation indicate materials which are more flame resistant for
electrosurgery or laser procedures.

We recommend that Class 1 and Class 2 flammability materials be used in surgical masks
intended for use in the operating room.
FDA believes that devices with a NFPA Class 4 rating are not appropriate for use in the
operating room. There are many potential ignition sources in the operating room, including
surgical lasers, electrosurgical units, endoscopic fiberoptics, and high-energy electro-medical
devices. All materials will burn if a high intensity heat source is applied to them, especially in
the presence of elevated oxygen levels.

4

In the past, an NFPA test method was used to assess flame-spread rate in textile. Although this
document was removed from NFPA’s list of "active" standards in 1987, the test is still
referenced by many submitters.
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

11. Labeling
The premarket notification should include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements
of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you in preparing labeling
that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801.5
Intended Use
We recommend that you clearly state the intended use of your device, and identify whether it
is a combination surgical mask /NIOSH certified N95 Respirator. We recommend that you
also describe the indications for use, such as whether the mask is an isolation mask,
procedure mask, or dental face mask.
We also recommend that you state whether your device is intended to be a reusable device or
a single use disposable device.
Warning
For a Class 3 flammability surgical mask, we recommend that you include a flammability
warning, such as one of the following examples:
This device does not meet 16 CFR 1610, NFPA, or CPSC flammability standards.
This device may burn when used in the presence of high intensity heat source or
flammable gas.

5

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with
the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 before a device is introduced into interstate commerce. In
addition, final labeling for prescription devices must comply with 21 CFR 801.109. Labeling
recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements of part 801.
