Purpose

The purpose of this guidance document is to provide a detailed description of the information that
should be included in a premarket (510(k)) notification for an emission computed tomography
diagnostic device or nuclear tomography system submitted to the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH). This information is an elaboration of the general requirements
contained in 21 CFR 807.87.
II.

Scope

The scope of this document encompasses Emission Computed Tomography Systems as defined in
21 CFR 892.1200 and Nuclear Tomography Systems as defined in 21 CFR 892.1310.
“An emission computed tomography system is a device intended to detect the location and
distribution of gamma ray- and positron- emitting radionuclides in the body and produce crosssectional images through computer reconstruction of the data”
“A nuclear tomography system is a device intended to detect nuclear radiation in the body and
produce images of a specific cross-sectional plane of the body by blurring or eliminating detail
from the other planes.”
This includes Single Photon Emission Tomography (SPECT) imaging systems and their accessory
devices, 511 keV Ultra-High Energy collimators (UHEC), Attenuation Correction Devices
(ACD), Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging systems and their accessories,
Coincidence Imaging Devices (CID), and Nuclear Tomography Systems (NTS) and its
accessories.
III.

Background

A number of legislative changes relating to the authority of the agency have occurred. These changes
have resulted in the adoption of new regulations and administrative procedures by CDRH which affect
the 510(k) process. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) has resulted in New Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations requiring pre-production design controls, and several
administrative requirements (Summaries of Safety and Effectiveness, and Statements of Indications for
Use) have been added. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997 and a
re-engineering effort have resulted in the development of a new 510(k) paradigm, which incorporates
alternative approaches to demonstrating substantial equivalence in premarket notifications. These
approaches are intended to facilitate the marketing clearance of devices, such as SPECT or PET devices,
for which recognized standards exist, and for cases in which the new device is a modification of a
previously cleared product.
IV.

Regulatory Requirements

Under the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1976, all
Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) and their accessory devices may be cleared by 510(k)
process, when the device shows substantial equivalence to the legally marketed predicate devices.
5

All Emission Computed Tomography devices and accessories are currently classified as Class II
devices with a Product Code of 90-KPS. Nuclear Tomography Systems are classified Class II
with a product code of JWM.
V.

The New 510(k) Paradigm

On March 20, 1998 CDRH issued a document entitled “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternative
Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications”. This document is
available on the CDRH web site (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html). In addition to the
traditional 510(k), this document describes two alternatives, the “Special 510(k): Device Modification”
and the “Abbreviated 510(k)”.
A.

Special 510(k)

The Special 510(k) is based on the requirement that manufacturers establish design controls in
accordance with the SMDA and 21 CFR 820.30. A manufacturer uses the FDA guidance
document entitled “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device” to
decide if a device modification could be implemented without submission of a new 510(k). If a
new 510(k) is needed, and if the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or the
basic fundamental scientific technology, conformance with design controls may form the basis for
clearing the application. Under this option, a manufacturer who is intending to modify a legally
marketed Class II device would conduct the necessary verification and validation activities to
demonstrate that the design output of the modified device meets the design requirements. Once
the company has ensured the satisfactory completion of this process through a design review, a
Special 510(k) may be submitted. While the basic content requirements for the submission are the
same, this type of submission should also reference the cleared 510(k) and contain a “Declaration
of Conformity” with design control requirements. In the Special 510(k) the manufacturer has the
option of using a third party to assess conformance with design controls (refer to the paradigm
document for details). Special 510(k)s are to be processed by the Office of Device Evaluation
within 30 days of receipt by the Document Mail Center.
B.

Abbreviated 510(k)s

The Abbreviated 510(k) is based on the use of conformance to voluntary standards in place of
data review as the means by which the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices can be assured.
Manufacturers may submit an Abbreviated 510(k) when FDA has recognized an individual or
several voluntary standards that cover aspects of the new device. In addition to the required
elements of a 510(k) as described in 21 CFR 808.87, Abbreviated 510(k) submissions should
include information that describes how conformance to one or several voluntary standards,
recognized by CDRH, have been used to address risks associated with the device, and a
“Declaration of Conformity” to those standards. The “Declaration of Conformity” should provide
the information listed in the paradigm. A third party may be used to assess conformance with
these standards (refer to the paradigm document for details). The review of abbreviated 510(k)s is
intended to be more efficient since they are not required to contain the experimental data from
which conformance is determined.
6

VI.

Standards for Emission Computed Tomography (ECT) Devices

The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 authorizes CDRH to recognize
consensus standards established by national and international standards development
organizations that may be used to satisfy identified portions of device review requirements. On
February 19, 1998 CDRH issued a “Guidance on the Recognition and Use of Consensus
Standards” which is intended to provide information relating to the recognition and use of
national and international consensus standards. It is available on the CDRH web site
(hhtp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/k982.html), and describes how the agency will use information
on conformance with recognized standards to satisfy premarket review requirements. It also
describes the content of a declaration of conformity. In the case of 510(k)s, information on
conformance with recognized standards might help establish the substantial equivalence of a new
device to a legally marketed predicate in the areas covered by the standards. If a premarket
notification contains declarations of conformity, this will in most cases eliminate the need to
review the actual test data for those aspects of the device addressed by the standards. However,
the results of testing are expected when the standard specifies a test method without the
associated performance limits, as in the case of the NEMA standards discussed below.
A.

NEMA Performance Standards

The NEMA standards NU 1and NU 2 are recognized by CDRH and thus may be used in
Abbreviated 510(k)s for emission tomographic diagnostic devices. They provide standardized
methods for measuring performance parameters for and gamma cameras (SPECT) and positron
cameras (PET). To the extent possible, these methods should be utilized in traditional as well as
abbreviated 510(k)s. The NEMA standards are:
NU 1 ---- Performance Measurements of Scintillation Cameras (1994)
NU 2 ---- Performance Measurements of Positron Emission Tomographs (1994)
It is important to recognize that the NEMA standards only prescribe standard measurement
methods. They do not specify acceptable levels of performance or safety. Acceptable levels of
performance are assessed by a comparison to previously cleared devices, on a case-by-case basis,
depending upon intended use, and the substantial equivalence criterion.
B.

Other Standards

Levels of electrical and mechanical safety parameters are addressed by other standards discussed
below. These standards are also recognized by CDRH.
IEC 60601-1, International Electrotechnical Commission, Medical Electrical Equipment,
Part 1: General Requirements for Safety

IEC 60601-1-2, Requirements for safety; Electromagnetic Compatibility – Requirements
and Tests

recognized methodological standard (e.g., NRC guideline for measurement
of leak rate of a radioactive sealed source or NCRP Report 102). Leakage
rates less than 2 mGy/h (200 mrad/h) at 5 cm from the surface of the
source housing, and less than 20 uGy/h (2 mrad/h) at 1 m from the source
are acceptable.

b.

Provide an estimate of the patient radiation exposure dose from the
transmission source for a typical clinical procedure.

System performance
The performance characteristics of the system should be provided and include:
intrinsic spatial resolution in FWHM at the surface and at 10 cm;
energy resolution;
transverse and axial resolutions
spatial linearity;
flood field uniformity;
the system sensitivity,
coincidence timing window,
coincidence dead time,
scatter fraction,
scatter correction method,
slice thickness,
count rate sensitivity; and
isolation of the detector from background.
Performance test data, should be obtained using a NEMA NU2 phantom, or an
equivalent, under the NEMA or equivalent performance standard test procedures.
Describe, in detail, alternate methods and phantoms and provide a rationale for the

Nuclear Tomography Systems
A.

Definition

A nuclear tomography system (NTS) is a device intended to detect nuclear radiation in the
body, using a scintillation (gamma) camera, and produce images of a specific crosssectional plane of the body by blurring or eliminating detail from the other planes by means
of synchronous motion of the camera collimator and the patient support assembly.
B.

Device Review Process

The device covered by this section used mechanical motion synchronized between the
camera collimator and patient table to create a tomographic effect with the image plane
parallel to the patient table. Emission computed tomography superseded NTS as the
method of choice for performing nuclear medicine tomography. The last submission for
marketing approval for an NTS device was received in 1991. CDRH, therefore, regards
NTS devices to be obsolete. There are no submission guidances available for this type of
device.

Appendix 1

Declaration of Conformity
Voluntary Standards in 510ks

Reviewers should rely on a declaration of conformity to the recognized consensus standards if the
declaration
•

identifies the applicable recognized consensus standards and specifies those that were
met;

•

specifies, for each consensus standard, that all requirements were met, except for
inapplicable requirements or deviations noted below;

•

identifies for each consensus standard any way(s) the standard may have been tailored
or modified for application to the device under review, e.g., identifies which of an
alternative series of tests were performed;

•

identifies, for each consensus standard, any requirements that were not applicable to
the device;

•

specifies any deviations from each applicable standard that were applied (e.g.,
deviations from international standards which are necessary to meet U.S. infrastructure
conventions such as the National Electrical Code (ANSI/NFPA 70));

•

specifies what differences exist, if any, between the tested device and the device to be
marketed and justifies the use of test results in these areas of difference; and

•

if a test laboratory or certification body was employed, provides the name and address
of each laboratory or certification body that was involved in the determining the
conformance of the device with the applicable consensus standards and a reference to
any accreditation of those organizations.
