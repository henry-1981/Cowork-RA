Voluntary Malfunction Summary
Reporting (VMSR) Program for
Manufacturers
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this final guidance document to help
manufacturers better understand and use the Voluntary Malfunction Summary Reporting
(VMSR) Program. It is intended to further explain, but not change, the conditions of the VMSR
Program.
This guidance describes and clarifies several aspects of the VMSR Program, including the
FDA’s approach to determining the eligibility of product codes for the program and the
conditions for submitting medical device reports (MDRs) for device malfunctions in summary
format under the program. Consistent with the goals outlined in the Medical Device User Fee
Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV) Commitment Letter, the VMSR Program is intended to
streamline reporting of device malfunctions. The program began in 2018 when FDA issued a
notification in the Federal Register of an order granting an alternative under 21 CFR 803.19 that
permits manufacturers of devices in eligible product codes to report certain device malfunction
MDRs in summary form on a quarterly basis, subject to the conditions of the alternative (2018
Notice, 83 FR 40973). On August 29, 2024 FDA issued a notification in the Federal Register,
announcing a minor, technical modification to the VMSR Program alternative granted under 21
CFR 803.19, to align with the most current version of Form FDA 3500A and with current
adverse event codes (Modification Notice, 89 FR 70096). This guidance is consistent with that
modification.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of

1

the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
Each year, FDA receives over two million MDRs of suspected device-related deaths, serious
injuries, and malfunctions. The MDR Program is one of the postmarket surveillance tools that
FDA uses to monitor device performance, detect potential device-related safety issues, and
contribute to benefit-risk assessments.1 Malfunction reports represent most of the MDRs
received by FDA on an annual basis. As part of FDA’s postmarket surveillance for devices, the
Agency reviews the MDRs submitted by both mandatory and voluntary reporters.
FDA has determined that for many devices, it is appropriate to permit manufacturers to submit
malfunction summary reports on a quarterly basis, for certain malfunctions related to devices
with certain product codes, instead of individual, 30-day malfunction reports. FDA’s VMSR
Program is intended to yield benefits for FDA, the public, and manufacturers, such as increasing
transparency for the public, helping FDA to process certain malfunction reports more efficiently,
allowing both FDA and the public to identify malfunction trends more readily, and reducing the
burden on manufacturers.
MDR requirements for manufacturers are set forth in section 519 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and 21 CFR Part 803. Among other things, 21 CFR Part 803 requires that
a manufacturer submit a report of an individual adverse event when it becomes aware of
information, from any source, that reasonably suggests that one of its marketed devices
malfunctioned and the malfunction of the device or a similar device marketed by the
manufacturer would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the
malfunction were to recur (21 CFR 803.10(c)(1) and 803.50(a)(2)). Throughout this guidance
document, FDA refers to such malfunctions as “reportable malfunctions” or “reportable
malfunction events.” Under 21 CFR Part 803, such reports generally must be submitted to FDA
within 30 calendar days after the day the manufacturer becomes aware of the reportable
malfunction event (21 CFR 803.10(c)(1) and 803.50). Under some circumstances an MDR is
required to be submitted within 5 workdays after the day the manufacturer becomes aware of the
need to submit such a report (see 21 CFR 803.10(c)(2) and 803.53).
The FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA2) amended section 519(a) of the FD&C Act
related to the reporting of device malfunctions. FDAAA did not alter the malfunction reporting
requirements for class III devices and those class II devices that are permanently implantable,
life supporting, or life sustaining. Under section 519(a)(1)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, as amended
by FDAAA, manufacturers of such devices must continue to submit malfunction reports in
accordance with 21 CFR Part 803 (or successor regulations), unless FDA grants an exemption or
variance from, or an alternative to, a requirement under such regulations pursuant to 21 CFR
803.19. FDAAA also amended the FD&C Act to require that manufacturers submit malfunction
MDRs for class I and those class II devices that are not permanently implantable, life supporting,

or life sustaining—other than any type of class I or II device that FDA has, by notice, published
in the Federal Register or by letter to the person who is the manufacturer or importer of the
device, indicated should be subject to Part 803 in order to protect the public health—in
accordance with criteria established by FDA. The criteria require those reports to be in summary
form and made on a quarterly basis. See section 519(a)(1)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act. In the Federal
Register of March 8, 2011 (76 FR 12743), FDA explained that, pending further notice from the
Agency, all class I devices and those class II devices that are not permanently implantable, life
supporting, or life sustaining would remain subject to individual reporting requirements under
Part 803 to protect the public health, pursuant to section 519(a)(1)(B)(i)(III) of the FD&C Act.
Consequently, unless granted an exemption, variance, or alternative, manufacturers of those
devices have continued to be required to submit individual malfunction reports under Part 803.
FDA began a pilot program in 2015 for the submission of MDRs of certain malfunctions in a
summary format on a quarterly basis (80 FR 50010).
In the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter, FDA committed to streamlining MDR requirements for
malfunction reporting.3 To help meet the MDUFA IV commitment, FDA issued a notification in
2017 (82 FR 60922) outlining FDA’s proposal to grant an alternative under 21 CFR 803.19 to
permit manufacturer reporting of certain device malfunctions in summary format on a quarterly
basis, subject to certain conditions, and requested public comment. FDA granted that alternative
in 2018 to manufacturers of devices in certain product codes and provided notice of an order
granting that alternative in the Federal Register (2018 Notice, 83 FR 40973).
FDA implemented the VMSR Program only after the Agency had conducted the 2015 pilot
program that demonstrated the value of the program to public health, better use of Agency
resources, and promotion of public transparency.
As explained when it proposed the VMSR Program (82 FR 60922), and consistent with our
VMSR Program experience to date, FDA believes that bundling “like events” together into a
single summary report description has benefits for manufacturers, FDA, and the public. For
many manufacturers, we expect this approach will greatly reduce the volume of reports that the
manufacturer needs to submit to FDA. As more information is received in a streamlined manner,
it can facilitate a more efficient understanding by FDA of malfunction issues. For the public,
summary reports may make malfunction event trends for a particular device more readily
transparent. We believe increased manufacturer participation in the program will enhance these
benefits.

III. Principles of Voluntary Malfunction Summary
Reporting
In the 2018 Notice, FDA identified the following overarching principles for summary reporting
of malfunctions under the VMSR Program:
1. The collection of information in summary format should allow FDA to collect sufficient
detail to understand reportable malfunction events.
2. To increase efficiency, summary malfunction reporting should occur in a common format
for the electronic reporting system used.
3. Information about reportable malfunctions should be transparent to FDA and to the
public, regardless of whether the information is reported as an individual MDR or a
summary report.4 Information contained in a summary malfunction report that is
protected from public disclosure under applicable disclosure laws is redacted prior to
release of the report.
4. Manufacturers should communicate information regarding an imminent hazard5 at the
earliest time possible.
5. Summary reporting is meant to streamline the process of reporting malfunctions. It does
not change regulatory requirements for MDR-related investigations or recordkeeping by
manufacturers. For example, manufacturers participating in the VMSR Program remain
subject to requirements for establishing and maintaining MDR event files under 21 CFR
803.18. In addition, under the Quality System regulation, manufacturers must evaluate,
review, and investigate any complaint that represents an MDR reportable event (see 21
CFR 820.198).6
6. Summary reporting information should not be duplicative of information received
through other MDR reporting processes.
4

Consistent with this principle, summary reports submitted by manufacturers under the VMSR Program are made
available to the public in the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. For more
information about FDA’s procedures for disclosing information submitted under 21 CFR Part 803, see 21 CFR
803.9.
5
For the purposes of this overarching principle and as explained in the 2018 Notice (83 FR 40793), FDA intends
“imminent hazard” to capture situations in which a device poses a significant risk to health and creates a public
health situation that should be addressed immediately to prevent injury.
6
On February 2, 2024, FDA issued a final rule amending the device quality system (QS) regulation, 21 CFR part
820, to align more closely with international consensus standards for devices and making conforming amendments
to 21 CFR part 4 (89 FR 7496). This final rule will take effect on February 2, 2026. Once in effect, this rule will
withdraw the majority of the current requirements in part 820 and incorporate by reference the 2016 edition of the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485, Medical devices – Quality management systems –
Requirements for regulatory purposes, in part 820. As stated in the final rule, the requirements in ISO 13485 are,
when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the current part 820, providing a similar level of
assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to consistently manufacture devices that are safe and
effective and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. When the final rule takes effect, FDA will also update
the references to provisions in 21 CFR part 820 in this guidance to be consistent with that rule.

IV. Voluntary Malfunction Summary Reporting Program
Eligibility and Scope
The VMSR Program permits manufacturers of devices within eligible product codes to report
certain device malfunction MDRs in summary form quarterly, as an alternative to submitting
individual MDRs for reportable malfunction events. Manufacturers may “self-elect” to
participate in the VMSR Program by submitting summary malfunction reports for eligible
product codes, and do not need to submit a separate application to FDA to participate. As
participation in the VMSR Program is voluntary, applicants may choose to leave the program at
any time. Upon leaving the VMSR Program, manufacturers must resume submitting individual,
30-day malfunction reports in compliance with 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52 and update their
MDR procedure as needed to comply with 21 CFR 803.17.
The VMSR Program helps enhance the FDA’s capacity to effectively monitor the safety and
effectiveness of devices. The VMSR Program’s conditions help ensure that manufacturers
submit sufficient information to allow FDA to detect potential safety issues and identify
malfunction trends, while the summary reports provide information on malfunctions in a more
efficient format. The program thus enables FDA to be more effective in its device safety
oversight. The following sub-sections are intended to explain the factors FDA generally
considers when determining if a product code is eligible for the VMSR Program and to clarify
event types that are not covered by the VMSR Program. Further clarification on the reporting
conditions of the program are discussed under Section V.

A.

Product Code Eligibility

When FDA implemented the VMSR Program in 2018, the Agency evaluated all device product
codes, for all device classes, to determine program eligibility, including product codes for
device-led combination products. As noted, when FDA began the VMSR Program, product
codes that have been in existence for fewer than two years generally are not eligible, unless the
new product code was created solely for administrative reasons.7 In FDA’s experience, this twoyear period is important for having more timely, detailed information to monitor malfunction
events. FDA continues to evaluate new product codes after they have been in existence for two
years to determine whether it is appropriate for those product codes to be eligible for the VMSR
Program. FDA also periodically evaluates ineligible product codes for eligibility changes.

(1)

Periodic Evaluation

The FDA intends to periodically assess and update the eligibility of product codes for the VMSR
Program. As part of determining eligibility of product codes, FDA intends to consider the
device’s benefit-risk profile and available postmarket safety information, particularly related to
device malfunctions. The Agency generally considers whether quarterly, summary reporting of
device malfunctions, in accordance with the conditions of the VMSR Program, would allow
FDA to timely identify potential new or increased safety concerns for devices within the product
7

2018 Notice (83 FR 40973).

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
code at issue. If FDA determines that a product code is eligible, FDA intends to update the
Product Classification Database accordingly. In addition, FDA intends to provide information
regarding the list of eligible product codes for the VMSR Program on the VMSR webpage.8
In analyzing available postmarket safety information for devices within a certain product code,
the Agency also intends to consider, among other things, the frequency of reported serious
injuries and deaths, the number of 5-day reports, and whether the product code has any class I or
II recalls. The Agency may also consider the types of malfunctions that occur in a given product
code, the complexity of those malfunctions, and the ability for FDA to understand their root
cause. FDA may also consider whether the product code is associated with recent, ongoing, or
potential public health issues that may necessitate the detail and frequency of individual
malfunction reporting for FDA to identify and better characterize new or persistent safety issues.
When a public health issue necessitates close monitoring of individual adverse events associated
with certain devices, the Agency may determine that summary reporting under the VMSR
Program is not appropriate for product codes for those devices. For example, FDA has
determined that certain reusable devices may have a high risk of infection if they are not
adequately reprocessed. Devices listed in Appendix E of the FDA guidance document,
“Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling,” are
examples of device types associated with such risks, and FDA has determined for these product
codes that summary reporting is not appropriate.
FDA’s eligibility determinations are intended to follow the overarching principles of the VMSR
Program described in Section III above, to help ensure that summary reporting of malfunctions
for all eligible product codes allows FDA to collect sufficient information to understand the
reported events, that information can be provided in a common format and is transparent to FDA
and to the public, that imminent hazards will be communicated at the earliest time possible, and
that summary reporting for devices in any eligible product code streamlines the process of
reporting malfunctions.

(2)

Eligibility Requests

Manufacturers may send a request under 21 CFR 803.19(b) for a product code or multiple
product codes to be considered for eligibility in the VMSR Program and for manufacturers of
devices within such product code(s) to be granted the same summary reporting alternative for
reportable malfunction events associated with those devices. FDA intends to periodically review
manufacturer requests and update the eligibility of product codes for the VMSR Program based
on requests received. In addition, as noted above, FDA intends to provide information regarding
the list of eligible product codes for the VMSR Program on the VMSR webpage.9
For requests emailed to FDA at MDRPolicy@fda.hhs.gov, manufacturers should submit the
following information:
· The firm’s name, address, registration number;
· The contact person’s name, telephone number, and email address;

As part of the justification for the request, a manufacturer should provide a copy of
any prior FDA correspondence (including the references to the Document ID #)
regarding device eligibility status and describe any actions taken to address any issues
noted in prior FDA correspondence regarding device eligibility for participation in the
VMSR Program.

B. Event Types and Reporters Not Covered by the
VMSR Program
As described above, the VMSR Program is generally available for manufacturers of devices
within eligible product codes. However, the following types of MDR reportable events and
entities subject to MDR reporting requirements are outside the scope of the VMSR Program
alternative granted under 21 CFR 803.19:

V.

·

Reportable deaths and serious injuries;10

·

A reportable malfunction is associated with a 5-day report, as required in 21 CFR
803.53; and

·

Importers and device user facilities, because 21 CFR Part 803 does not require either
entity to report malfunctions to FDA.11

VMSR Program Conditions
A. Individual Reporting Conditions

As previously discussed, manufacturers participating in the VMSR Program submit summary
malfunction reports under an alternative to certain MDR reporting requirements that FDA has
granted to manufacturers of devices within eligible product codes. When FDA grants such
modifications to the MDR reporting requirements, we may impose other reporting requirements
to ensure the protection of public health (21 CFR 803.19(c)). Accordingly, FDA has imposed
10

See section III.A of the Modification Notice. The alternative granted under 21 CFR 803.19 to manufacturers
participating in the VMSR Program does not alter the requirement that reportable deaths and serious injuries must be
reported to FDA within the mandatory 30-calendar day timeframe, under 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52, or within the
5-work day timeframe under 21 CFR 803.53, as applicable. Thus, if a manufacturer participating in the VMSR
Program becomes aware of information reasonably suggesting that a device that it markets may have caused or
contributed to a death or serious injury, then the manufacturer must submit an individual MDR for that event
because it involves a reportable death or serious injury.
11
See section III of the Modification Notice. Importers are required to report malfunctions to the manufacturer
under 21 CFR 803.40(b). Unlike manufacturers and importers, device user facilities are not required under 21 CFR
Part 803 to submit malfunction reports to any entity.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
several conditions that manufacturers must follow if they elect to participate in the VMSR
Program under the alternative.12 These include conditions for “individual reporting,” submission
of supplemental reports, and the format and submission schedule for summary reports. We
describe and clarify these conditions in the following subsections.
FDA explained in the 2018 Notice that individual reporting is necessary under certain
circumstances for devices within product codes that are otherwise eligible for the VMSR
Program. For certain individual reporting conditions, as described below, manufacturers are
responsible for identifying whether the condition applies. For other individual reporting
conditions, FDA will notify manufacturers that individual reporting is necessary. Such
notifications will explain why FDA determined that individual reporting is necessary and as
appropriate, the steps necessary for a manufacturer to resume summary, quarterly reporting.
Manufacturers participating in the VMSR Program must submit individual reports in the
following circumstances, in accordance with the conditions of the program:

(1)

Reportable malfunction is associated with a 5-day report

Under 21 CFR 803.53(a), a manufacturer must submit a 5-day report if it becomes aware of an
MDR reportable event that necessitates remedial action to prevent an unreasonable risk of
substantial harm to the public health. After submitting a 5-day report required under 21 CFR
803.53(a), all subsequent reportable malfunctions of the same nature that involve substantially
similar devices13 must be submitted as individual MDRs pursuant to 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52,
unless FDA notifies the manufacturer that the issue has been resolved to FDA’s satisfaction and
individual reports are no longer required. Summary reporting of malfunctions may then resume
on the regularly scheduled summary reporting cycle.14 Submission of reportable malfunctions
associated with 5-day reports in this manner will assist FDA in monitoring the time course and
resolution of the issue presenting an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.

(2)

A reportable malfunction is the subject of certain device
recalls

When a device is the subject of a recall involving the correction or removal of the device to
address a malfunction and that correction or removal is required to be reported to FDA under 21
CFR Part 806 (this includes class I and class II recalls, but not class III recalls),15 all reportable
malfunction events of the same nature16 that involve the same device or a similar device
marketed by the same manufacturer must be submitted as individual MDRs in accordance with

12

Throughout this section, FDA uses the term “must” to describe conditions of the VMSR Program consistent with
the Modification Notice, as well as to describe statutory or regulatory requirements. The Modification Notice
republished the conditions that manufacturers must follow if they choose to participate in the VMSR Program with
the minor, technical changes described in section II of that notice incorporated.
13
For example, and as explained in the 2018 Notice, a “substantially similar” device could be a device that is the
same except for certain performance characteristics or a device that is the same except for certain cosmetic
differences in color or shape. See 2018 Notice, section II.C (83 FR 40973).
14
Modification Notice, section III.B.1.
15
See 21 CFR 7.3(m) for the definition of each numerical recall classification.
16
By “malfunction events of the same nature,” and as explained in the 2018 Notice, FDA means additional
reportable malfunction events involving the same malfunction that prompted the recall.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52 until the date that the recall is terminated by FDA.17 After the recall
is terminated, summary reporting may resume on the regularly scheduled summary reporting
cycle, unless after the recall event, FDA has revoked the VMSR Program alternative with respect
to that device product code.
The requirement to submit individual reports under this condition is triggered on the date that the
manufacturer submits a report of a correction or removal required under 21 CFR Part 806 (or the
date that the manufacturer submits a report of the correction or removal under 21 CFR Part 803
or 21 CFR Part 1004 instead, as permitted under 21 CFR 806.10(f)). This will allow FDA to
monitor the frequency of reportable malfunctions associated with the recall and effectiveness of
the recall strategy.
If a manufacturer becomes aware of reportable malfunction events before the date that the
requirement to submit individual reports is triggered and a summary report for those events has
not yet been submitted to FDA, then the manufacturer must submit any of those malfunction
events related to the recall in a summary MDR format within 30 calendar days of submitting the
required report of correction or removal. In the summary MDR, the manufacturer must include a
check box of recall in the “If Remedial Action Initiated, Check Type” of the electronic Form
FDA 3500A.18

(3)

FDA has determined that individual MDR reporting is
necessary to address a public health issue

If FDA determines that individual malfunction reports are necessary to provide additional
information and more rapid reporting for an identified public health issue involving certain
devices, manufacturers must submit reportable malfunction events for those devices as individual
MDRs pursuant to 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52. Such determination may apply to all reportable
malfunctions for a particular device or multiple devices (e.g., all devices within an eligible
product code); such determination may also apply to only certain types of malfunctions for the
particular device(s), depending on the scope of the public health issue.
FDA will provide written notification to manufacturers of relevant devices that individual MDR
submissions are necessary. FDA will also provide further written notice when manufacturers of
those devices may resume participation in summary malfunction reporting. If a manufacturer
becomes aware of reportable malfunction events before receiving written notice to submit such
events individually, and a summary report for those events has not yet been submitted to FDA,
then the manufacturer must submit malfunction events for the identified devices to FDA within
30 calendar days of receiving notification from FDA.19 For such reportable malfunctions, the
events may generally be submitted as summary reports, but if there are circumstances in which
FDA specifically recommends individual reports because of the nature of the public health issue,
the agency intends to specify that in its written notification.
Below, we have provided examples of situations where FDA has determined that individual
MDR reporting is necessary to address a public health issue, and summary reporting would not

be appropriate. However, public health issues are not uniform, can be unpredictable, and may
arise in various ways; the following are examples, and there may be other scenarios not
described below where individual malfunction reports are necessary to address or evaluate a
public health issue. As illustrated below, this individual reporting condition may apply to
reporting for a particular device or multiple devices of the same type, or only to certain types of
malfunctions for that device type.
Examples of Circumstances in which FDA has Determined Individual Malfunction Reporting is
Necessary:
· Where FDA has determined that certain reusable devices that fall within eligible
product codes may have a high risk of infection if they are not adequately reprocessed,
which FDA considers a public health issue.
· Where there is an ongoing safety signal or other safety-related investigation of a
known or potential public health concern.
· Where root causes of malfunction events are not well understood.

(4)

FDA has determined that a device manufacturer may not
report in summary reporting format

FDA may determine that a specific manufacturer may no longer participate in the VMSR
Program for reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with applicable MDR
requirements under 21 CFR Part 803, failure to follow the conditions of the VMSR Program, or
the need to monitor a public health issue such as an investigation into safety-related issues at a
specific manufacturer’s establishment.20
FDA will provide written notification to the device manufacturer to submit individual
malfunction reports in compliance with 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52. The requirement to submit
individual reports under this condition is triggered on the date the manufacturer receives the
written notification from FDA. If a manufacturer became aware of reportable malfunction events
before the date that the requirement to submit individual reports is triggered under this condition
and a summary report for those events has not yet been submitted to FDA, then the manufacturer
must submit those malfunction events to FDA within 30 calendar days of receiving notification
from FDA.21 For such reportable malfunctions, the events may generally be submitted as
summary reports, but if there are circumstances in which FDA specifically recommends
individual reports because of the nature of the public health issue, the agency intends to specify
that in its written notification.

A new type of reportable malfunction occurs for a device

If a manufacturer becomes aware of information reasonably suggesting that a reportable
malfunction event has occurred for a device that the manufacturer markets and the reportable
malfunction is a new type of malfunction that the manufacturer has not previously reported to
FDA for that device, then the manufacturer must submit an individual report for that reportable
malfunction in compliance with 21 CFR 803.50 and 803.52. After the manufacturer submits this
initial individual report, subsequent malfunctions of this type may be submitted in summary form

according to the quarterly reporting schedule described in Section V.C.2 of this guidance
document, unless another individual reporting condition applies.22

B.

Supplemental Reports

Under the VMSR Program, in general, if a manufacturer becomes aware of information required
in a malfunction summary report that the manufacturer did not submit to FDA because the
information was not previously known or was not available when the manufacturer submitted the
initial summary malfunction report, then the manufacturer must submit the supplemental
information to FDA in an electronic format in accordance with 21 CFR 803.12(a). Supplemental
information must be submitted by manufacturers to FDA by the submission deadline described
in Table 1—Summary Malfunction Reporting Schedule of the Modification Notice,23 which we
provide below in Section V.C.2 of this guidance document. Supplemental information must be
submitted by the applicable deadline according to the date on which the manufacturer becomes
aware of the supplemental information. Manufacturers must also continue to follow the
requirements for the content of supplemental reports set forth in 21 CFR 803.56, meaning that
for a supplemental or follow-up report, the manufacturer must:
a. Indicate that the report being submitted is a supplemental or follow-up report;
b. Submit the appropriate identification numbers of the report that is being updated with the
supplemental information (i.e., original manufacturer report number on which the report
was based); and
c. Include only the new, changed, or corrected information.
If a manufacturer submits a summary malfunction report and subsequently becomes aware of
information reasonably suggesting that an event (or events) previously submitted in a
malfunction summary report represents a reportable serious injury or death event, or a new type
of reportable malfunction, the manufacturer must submit an initial, individual MDR for the
identified serious injury, death, or new type of reportable malfunction event within 30 calendar
days of becoming aware of the additional information. The manufacturer must also
simultaneously submit a supplemental report to update the initial malfunction summary report
and include only the new, changed, or corrected information.24

C.

Summary Reporting Instructions

To meet the conditions of the VMSR Program alternative granted under 21 CFR 803.19,
manufacturers of devices in eligible product codes who elect to participate in the VMSR
Program must submit summary malfunction reports using the applicable sections of Form FDA

Reporting Schedule and Logistics

To meet the conditions of the alternative established under the VMSR Program, manufacturers
submitting malfunction summary reports or supplemental reports to a malfunction summary
report must submit those reports electronically30 on a quarterly basis according to the schedule in
Table 1. The summary malfunction report must include the MDR Number, which consists of the
registration number of the manufacturer, the year in which the event is being reported, and a 5digit sequence number. Information included in a malfunction summary report must be current as
of the last date of the quarterly timeframe identified in Table 1.31
All reportable malfunction events for eligible product codes may be reported in the summary
format described in Section V.C of this guidance, unless the events are excluded from the scope
of the VMSR Program or subject to one of the individual reporting conditions of the program
29

For class I devices, the universal product code (UPC) may serve as the UDI (21 CFR 801.40(d)). In these
instances, include the UPC.

Appendix: Example of Malfunction Summary Reports
The following hypothetical example is solely meant to illustrate how to summarize malfunction
events in summary reports under the VMSR Program. We note that the device identifiers
provided are not intended to represent device identifiers that are actually assigned to any device.
Real-world reporting scenarios will depend on the particular details of the malfunction(s) in
question. Please note that the example provided below is solely meant to illustrate how the form
might be filled out in the scenario described.

Multiple malfunction events with two device problems
A manufacturer receives 50 malfunction reports within the quarterly timeframe that include two
types of device malfunctions that are related to a specific model (device identifier
12345678901234) of their AC powered ABC Bed: (1) 35 events involve a tear in a disposable
cover; and (2) 25 events involve a screw that attaches the bed rail to the mounting bracket on the
bed, which loosens due to vibration. Ten of the events involve both types of device malfunctions.
None of the events involves patients. None of the events necessitates remedial action to prevent
an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health.
As stated in Section V.C.1. of this guidance, separate summary malfunction reports must be
submitted for each unique combination of brand name, device model, and MDR adverse event
device problem code(s). In this example, there is one brand of device and one device model
(device identifier 12345678901234). There are three different combinations of adverse event
codes, and therefore, three summary reports should be submitted to FDA:
Report #1: 25 events that involve torn covers only;
Report #2: 15 events that involve loose screws only; and
Report #3: 10 events that involve both torn covers and loose screws.
Manufacturers should note that the summary reporting format requires firms to identify the type
of investigation, investigation findings and investigation conclusions codes in Form FDA 3500A,
including as many codes as are necessary to describe the event problem and evaluation for the
reportable malfunction events that are being summarized. If the report summarizes reportable
events that involved more than one type of device problem, such as the example Report #3
described above, differences in the investigation conclusion code according to the different
device problems can be explained in the narrative text.32
