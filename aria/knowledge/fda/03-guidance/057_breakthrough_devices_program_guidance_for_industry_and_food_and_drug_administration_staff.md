Breakthrough Devices Program
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency)
on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.
You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and
regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this
guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction1

This guidance document describes policies that FDA intends to use to implement section 515B of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360e-3), as created by section 3051 of
the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act),2 amended by section 901 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of
2017,3 and amended by section 3001 of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act4 (the
SUPPORT Act) (the “Breakthrough Devices Program”). The Breakthrough Devices Program is a
voluntary program for certain medical devices and device-led combination products5 that provide for
more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or
conditions. It is available for devices and device-led combination products which are subject to review
under a premarket approval application (PMA), premarket notification (510(k)), or De Novo
classification request (“De Novo request”).6 The Breakthrough Devices Program may also be applicable
to certain devices that benefit populations impacted by health and/or health care disparities, thereby
promoting and advancing health equity. In addition, consistent with our obligations under the SUPPORT
Act,7 the Breakthrough Devices Program may be available for certain non-addictive medical products to

A combination product is defined in 21 CFR 3.2. For purposes of this guidance, device-led combination products
refer to combination products subject to review under a premarket approval application (PMA), premarket notification
(510(k)), or De Novo classification request.
6
Breakthrough Device designation may be requested at any time prior to the submission of a PMA, 510(k), or De Novo
request. Sponsors should only request Breakthrough Device designation if they intend to pursue one of these marketing
pathways. Other marketing pathways, such as the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program, are not eligible for
consideration under the Breakthrough Devices Program. For additional considerations for devices eligible for the HDE
Program, please refer to FDA’s guidance, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/humanitarian-device-exemption-hde-program. For additional considerations regarding Humanitarian Use Device
(HUD) Designations, please refer to FDA’s guidance, available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fdaguidance-documents/humanitarian-use-device-hud-designations.

treat pain or addiction (FD&C Act section 515B (21 U.S.C. 360e-3)).8 The Breakthrough Devices
Program is intended to help patients have more timely access to designated medical devices by
expediting their development, assessment, and review, while preserving the statutory standards for
premarket approval, 510(k) clearance, and De Novo marketing authorization, consistent with the
Agency’s mission9 to protect and promote public health.
The Breakthrough Devices Program supersedes the Expedited Access Pathway (EAP), which was
launched in 2015. The Breakthrough Devices Program contains features of the EAP as well as the
Innovation Pathway (first piloted in 2011; the pilot is now discontinued), both of which were intended to
facilitate the development and expedite the review of breakthrough technologies. Due to consistency in
vision and designation criteria between the precursor EAP Program and the Breakthrough Devices
Program, FDA now considers devices granted designation under the EAP to be part of the Breakthrough
Devices Program.
The Breakthrough Devices Program also supersedes the Priority Review Program, which implemented
statutory criteria for granting priority review to premarket submissions for medical devices10 and
included standard procedures to achieve an efficient priority review process. However, consistent with
Section 515B of the FD&C Act, devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive prioritized
review (Section II.F).
FDA provides information about this program on the Breakthrough Devices Program Webpage.11
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA
Recognized Consensus Standards Database.12 If submitting a Declaration of Conformity to a recognized
standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting documentation. For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
“Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices”13
and “Standards Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions Reviewed in the
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.”14
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead,
guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word
should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The considerations set forth in this guidance document apply to FDA’s review of devices as non-addictive methods to treat
pain or addiction.

FDA’s guidance, “Priority Review of Premarket Submissions for Devices,” issued on May 17, 2013, implemented former
section 515(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (as in effect prior to the date of enactment of the Cures Act), which applied only to PMAs.
Because of the potential public health importance of devices warranting priority review status, FDA also applied the priority
review criteria to other types of premarket submissions for devices. FDA withdrew this guidance on August 3, 2017. See

II. Program Principles
The Breakthrough Devices Program is comprised of two phases. The first is the Designation Request
phase, in which an interested sponsor of a device requests that FDA grant that device Breakthrough
Device designation (Section III). The second phase encompasses actions to expedite development of the
device and the prioritized review of subsequent regulatory submissions (e.g., Pre-Submissions,
marketing submissions) (Section IV).
The principles below describe the philosophy of the Breakthrough Devices Program and, in general, the
approach FDA intends to take in an effort to help expedite the development and
review of devices designated as Breakthrough Devices under section 515B(d)(1) of the FD&C Act (21
U.S.C. 360e-3(d)(1)). FDA intends to evaluate resource allocation in collaboration with the sponsor
throughout the development process to make the best use of FDA’s resources and maximize the impact
of the Breakthrough Devices Program. Devices designated as Breakthrough Devices, which
subsequently receive marketing authorization, have no additional limitations solely by virtue of their
designation.

A. Interactive and Timely Communication
For Breakthrough Devices, FDA intends to provide interactive and timely communication with the
sponsor during device development and throughout the review process15 for Q-Submissions,16
Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs), 510(k)s, De Novo requests, PMAs, and/or certain PMA
supplements (i.e., Panel Track Supplements, 180 Day PMA Supplements) for which the subject device
was designated as a Breakthrough Device. This applies to devices as well as to device-led combination
products.
To best facilitate collaborative dialogue, the following, where applicable, are recommended for
communications between FDA and the sponsor:
·

discussion and agreement between FDA and the sponsor regarding goals of
interactions and feasibility of response timelines;

·

use of “track changes” and redlined versions of any document being revised
interactively to efficiently and transparently communicate any updates; and

·

use of summary tables to document points of agreement and previous interactions.

FDA also intends to assign staff to be available within a reasonable time to address questions by
institutional review committees concerning the conditions and clinical testing expectations applicable to
the investigational use of a Breakthrough Device.17
Given that there may be novel scientific aspects of products in the Breakthrough Devices Program, FDA
may need to interact with external experts or an Advisory Committee to reach various regulatory
15

See section 515B(e)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(e)(1)(D)).
For information on Q-Submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance, “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical
Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program,” at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program.

decisions.18 In the event that such consultation is undertaken, FDA will disclose to the sponsor, no less
than five business days in advance, the topics for discussion. FDA will also provide the sponsor with the
opportunity to recommend external experts.19 After any consultation with external experts outside of an
Advisory Committee meeting, FDA intends to provide the sponsor with a list of any topics discussed
with external experts that differ from the topics identified to the sponsor in communications prior to the
consultation and an explanation of any decisions on the Breakthrough Device based in part on the
consultation. When FDA refers a matter regarding a Breakthrough Device to a Medical Devices
Advisory Committee panel, CDRH intends to follow the procedures described in its guidance document
entitled “Procedures for Meetings of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee.”20 CBER intends to
hold either a Blood Products Advisory Committee (BPAC) or Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies
Advisory Committee (CTGTAC) meeting when seeking Advisory Committee input on a Breakthrough
Device.

B. Pre/Postmarket Balance of Data Collection
As with all devices subject to a PMA, Breakthrough Devices subject to a PMA must still meet the
statutory standard of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness at the time of approval. For PMAs
designated as Breakthrough Devices, FDA intends to use timely postmarket data collection, when
scientifically appropriate, to facilitate expedited and efficient development and review of the device.21 In
accordance with the FDA guidance, “Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in
Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications,”22 as part of FDA’s benefit-risk
determination for Breakthrough Devices subject to a PMA, FDA may consider the amount and nature of
data that may be collected in the postmarket setting, rather than premarket, and the extent of uncertainty
that may be appropriate in the benefit-risk profile at the time of approval.23 In all FDA premarket
approval decisions, there is some extent of uncertainty about the benefits and risks of the device. We
may not have definitive answers to all questions relating to the benefits and risks of the device at the
time of approval because the time and cost of such data collection would adversely affect public health
by significantly delaying the availability of medical devices that may improve the health of patients
(e.g., to do so for a particular device may require clinical studies that enroll thousands of subjects to
more fully assess all risks, such as rare adverse events). The extent of uncertainty that may be
appropriate at the time of approval depends on, among other factors, the probable benefits of the device,
and the relevant non-clinical and clinical information about the device.
FDA will only approve a PMA if it determines that there is reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness. As part of the benefit-risk determination for Breakthrough Devices subject to a PMA,
FDA may accept a greater extent of uncertainty of the benefit-risk profile for these devices if appropriate
under the circumstances, including that the uncertainty is sufficiently balanced by other factors, such as
the probable benefits for patients to have earlier access to the device (e.g., a device that treats a life18

Under section 515B(e)(1)(G) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(e)(1)(G)), FDA must provide for advisory committee
input, as it determines appropriate for PMAs (including in response to the sponsor’s request).

Section 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(5)(C)) requires FDA to “consider the role of
postmarket information in determining the least burdensome means of demonstrating a reasonable assurance of device safety
and effectiveness” for PMAs. See section 515B(e)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e- 3(e)(2)(B)).

threatening disease when no alternative treatments are available) and adequate postmarket controls to
support premarket approval. Generally, weighing the benefits against the risks for Breakthrough Devices
for which we would accept a greater extent of uncertainty adds another dimension to the benefit-risk
calculus. Specifically, as part of FDA’s benefit-risk determination, FDA intends to weigh the device’s
impact on patient health, including the probable benefit of earlier access to the device, against the
probable risk of harm to patients from the device should subsequent data collection demonstrate that the
device is ineffective or unsafe. FDA’s guidance, “Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection
for Devices Subject to Premarket Approval”24 provides more information regarding FDA’s current
policy on balancing premarket and postmarket data collection during FDA’s review of PMAs.

C. Efficient and Flexible Clinical Study Design
FDA intends to “take steps to ensure that the design of clinical trials is as efficient and flexible as
practicable, when scientifically appropriate.”25 This may include consideration of the following (note
that the examples listed below are not intended to be an exhaustive list):
·

prespecified endpoints26 regarding the minimum clinically meaningful effect;

·

intermediate and surrogate endpoints where evidence is provided to support the endpoint
as reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a device;

·

composite endpoints with an explicit rationale for the meaningful effect size; and

·

adaptive study designs.

D. Review Team Support
For each Breakthrough Device submission received, FDA will route the submission to the appropriate
organizational unit. An FDA manager in that unit will assess the submission and assign the most
appropriate individual to lead the review team based upon training, expertise, experience, and the ability
to quickly and interactively resolve complex issues. The review team lead is responsible for
coordinating the scientific and regulatory review including developing documentation to support a
recommendation to management and interacting with the sponsor. The review team lead, in conjunction
with management, will determine the need for and assign additional staff with subject matter expertise to
review specific aspects of the submission; for example, by providing consultation on the disease or
condition at issue or on a clinical study design. Staff reviewing Breakthrough Devices will be
experienced with innovative approaches to regulatory science and clearly communicating FDA’s
expectations during the device development process.
Breakthrough Device review teams will undergo periodic training to ensure consistent and efficient
application of the principles and features outlined in this guidance document as well as to communicate
productive examples across projects. This training may include team meetings, sponsor engagement,
patient interactions, and participation at scientific and regulatory meetings to help ensure teams are up to
date in the technological advancements of their respective areas of scientific and device expertise and

prepared to apply novel approaches to regulatory and device development challenges.

E. Senior Management Engagement
Senior management (e.g., Office director or designee representing Office director) will be involved in
the review process for Breakthrough Device submissions to ensure consistent application of Program
principles and facilitate the review process. They will work with Breakthrough Device review teams to
facilitate the sponsor’s efficient development of the device and FDA’s efficient review of related
submissions. To support efficient and timely dispute resolution, senior management will be engaged in
projects when points of disagreement that cannot be quickly resolved are identified by the FDA review
team or the sponsor during the device development or review process.

F. Priority Review
All submissions for devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive priority review, meaning
that the review of the submission is placed at the top of the appropriate review queue and receives
additional review resources, as needed. Although priority review for devices is intended to help expedite
patient access to certain devices important to public health, FDA’s past experience with the Priority
Review Program indicates that review times for marketing submissions may take longer for
Breakthrough Devices than for other devices because of the novel scientific issues these devices may
raise. The review times for marketing submissions of device-led combination products may also take
longer because such products may raise unique scientific and regulatory issues. We believe that the
Breakthrough Devices Program may enable patients to have more timely access to these devices than
they would otherwise because of the earlier interaction between FDA and sponsors during the device
development process.
In order to benefit from priority review status under the Breakthrough Devices Program, the
commitment on behalf of the sponsor to resolve all scientific and regulatory issues should match that of
FDA. It will only be through effective communication (e.g., interactive review), collaboration, and a
commitment to fulfilling all regulatory and scientific requirements that FDA and the sponsor can speed
the availability of safe and effective products.

G. Manufacturing Considerations for PMA Submissions
A device must be in conformance with the Quality System regulation (“QS Reg”; 21 CFR part 820), 27
and the sponsor must submit adequate information in a PMA to meet the requirements under section
515(c)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(1)(C)) and 21 CFR 814.20(b)(4)(v). As with other
PMAs, sponsors of a Breakthrough Device should submit PMA information as described in the FDA

27

On February 23, 2022, FDA proposed to amend the device QS regulation, 21 CFR part 820, to align more closely with
international consensus standard for the Quality Management System of devices (87 FR 10119; available at
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/23/2022-03227/medical-devices-quality-system-regulationamendments). Specifically, FDA proposed to withdraw the majority of the current requirements in part 820 and instead
incorporate by reference the 2016 edition of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485, Medical devices
- Quality management systems for regulatory purposes, in part 820. As stated in that proposed rule, the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the current part 820, providing a similar level of
assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective
and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. FDA intends to finalize this proposed rule expeditiously. When the final
rule takes effect, FDA will also update the references to provisions in 21 CFR part 820 in this guidance to be consistent with
that rule.

guidance, “Quality System Information for Certain Premarket Application Reviews.”28
Section 515B(e)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(e)(1)(E)), directs FDA to expedite its review
of manufacturing and quality systems compliance, as applicable, for purposes of expediting the
development and review of Breakthrough Devices. For submission types that typically require a
preapproval inspection (i.e., PMA), FDA intends to expedite the review of manufacturing and quality
systems compliance for devices in the Breakthrough Devices Program. FDA may accept less quality
system and manufacturing information in a PMA if the sponsor satisfies the statutory and regulatory
requirements using an alternative approach to submitting all of the items listed in the FDA guidance,
“Quality System Information for Certain Premarket Application Reviews.” For example, this may occur
when the sponsor has a good track record for quality systems compliance and there are no new
manufacturing issues that could adversely impact product quality or performance.
In appropriate cases, FDA may decide not to conduct an inspection of certain manufacturing sites prior
to approval of a Breakthrough Device. In general, FDA would review the sponsor’s quality system and
manufacturing information and make a decision about inspecting finished device manufacturing sites as
follows:
·

For finished device manufacturing sites with no prior inspectional history or no
inspectional history within the five-year period prior to the filing date of the application,
FDA would generally inspect those sites before approval of the Breakthrough Device.

·

For finished device manufacturing sites that have been inspected within the two-year
period prior to the filing date of the PMA, for which the inspectional outcome was ‘No
Action Indicated’ or ‘Voluntary Action Indicated’ and for which the inspectional
coverage is relevant to the PMA at issue, FDA may determine that it is appropriate to
inspect those sites after approval of the Breakthrough Device.

·

For finished device manufacturing sites that have been inspected within a period of two to
five years prior to the filing date of the PMA, for which the inspectional outcome was ‘No
Action Indicated’ or ‘Voluntary Action Indicated’ and for which the inspectional
coverage is relevant to the PMA at issue, FDA may determine that it is appropriate to
inspect those sites after the Breakthrough Device is approved in situations where, in
addition to submitting all other information required in a PMA under section 515(c)(1) of
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(1)) and 21 CFR 814.20, the sponsor submits the
following:
o a declaration stating that all activities at the site comply with the QS Reg (21
CFR part 820); and
o information, initially developed as part of design validation (21 CFR 820.30(g))
and current as of the filing date of the PMA, demonstrating that the sponsor’s risk
analysis activities included evaluation of risk associated with the design,
manufacturing, and use of the device, and that risk has been reduced to acceptable
levels. The sponsor could do this, for example, using standards such as the currently
FDA-recognized version of ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of risk
management to medical devices.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Where an inspection is not conducted prior to approval of the PMA for a Breakthrough Device, FDA
intends to conduct an inspection within 12 months after approval. In appropriate circumstances, FDA may
consider such a post approval inspection that is classified as ‘Official Action Indicated’ and for which
deviations are not brought into QS Reg conformance within a reasonable time after receipt of written notice
to be grounds for PMA withdrawal under section 515(e)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e(e)(1)(E)).
It is important to note that there may be additional challenges to fully implementing this policy for
device-led combination products designated as Breakthrough because these products are subject to
different manufacturing requirements due to the presence of both device and drug or biologic
constituents.29
For clarification, when a PMA sponsor’s manufacturing sites are not ready for inspection, or have been
inspected and classified as ‘Official Action Indicated,’ the sponsor may receive an approvable PMA
letter pending a QS Reg decision from FDA. It should be noted that this applies to PMA sponsors that
are manufacturing their own device as well as to sponsors who intend to have another entity
manufacture their device for commercial distribution in the U.S. FDA generally would then approve the
device once there is adequate assurance of compliance regarding the applicable quality systems of the
manufacturer(s).

III. Designation Request
A Breakthrough Device designation request is the mechanism by which sponsors request entry into the
Breakthrough Devices Program and FDA renders and communicates a decision on the request. When
submitting a request for Breakthrough Device designation, sponsors should clearly indicate the proposed
indications for use for which they are seeking designation, as illustrated in Appendix 1. The proposed
indication(s) may target a subset of a broader disease population.

A. Designation Criteria
The designation criteria, as defined in section 515B(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)), provide
for a Program for devices:
“(1) that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly
debilitating human disease or conditions; and
(2)(A) that represent breakthrough technologies;
(B) for which no approved or cleared alternatives exist;
(C) that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives, including
the potential, compared to existing approved alternatives, to reduce or eliminate the need for
hospitalization, improve patient quality of life, facilitate patients’ ability to manage their own
care (such as through self-directed personal assistance), or establish long-term clinical

Therefore, devices must meet the first criterion (section 515B(b)(1) of the FD&C Act) and at least one
of the sub-paragraphs listed for the second criterion (section 515B(b)(2) of the FD&C Act) in order to be
granted Breakthrough Device designation.
In addition, section 515B(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(c)) states:
“Any such request for designation may be made at any time prior to the submission of an
application under section 515(c) [21 U.S.C 360e(c)], a notification under section 510(k) [21
U.S.C. 360(k)], or a petition for classification under section 513(f)(2) [21 U.S.C.
360c(f)(2)].”

B. Designation Considerations
(1) First Criterion
In determining whether a device meets the criterion of providing “for more effective treatment or
diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or condition,”30 FDA considers
the following three factors:
a.

Whether a Device Provides for “More Effective” Treatment or
Diagnosis

Because decisions on requests for designation will be made prior to marketing authorization of a device,
for the purposes of designation, FDA believes it is appropriate to consider whether there is a reasonable
expectation that a device could provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis relative to the current
standard of care (SOC) in the U.S. A complete set of clinical data is not required for designation.
Instead, a sponsor should demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the device could provide for more
effective treatment or diagnosis of the disease or condition identified in the proposed indications for use.
This includes a reasonable expectation that the device could function as intended (technical success) and
that a functioning device could more effectively treat or diagnose the identified disease or condition
(clinical success). Mechanisms for demonstrating a reasonable expectation of technical and clinical
success could include literature or preliminary data (bench, animal, or clinical). For example, a sponsor
might provide preliminary bench data to support the potential for technical success and literature to
support that a given principle of operation could more effectively treat or diagnose the identified disease
or condition.
The level and type of evidence needed to determine whether a device is reasonably expected to “provide
for more effective treatment or diagnosis” may vary depending on the intended use of the device, its
technology and features, and the available standard of care alternatives. When evaluating this part of the
first criterion, FDA considers the totality of information regarding the proposed device, its function,
potential for technical success, potential for clinical success, potential for a clinically meaningful impact,
and its potential benefits and risks. The determination of whether a device is reasonably expected to
“provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis” is based upon all these factors.31

30

See section 515B(b)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(1)).
The considerations set forth for whether a device is reasonably expected to “provide for more effective treatment or
diagnosis” are limited to evaluating the first Breakthrough criterion within the scope of this guidance.

b.

Whether a Disease or Condition is “Life -Threatening”

FDA considers a disease or condition life-threatening for purposes of the Breakthrough Devices
Program if it is a disease or condition for which the likelihood of death is high unless the course of the
disease is interrupted in a population or subpopulation. Examples of life-threatening diseases or
conditions include, but are not limited to, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, cancer, and trauma.
c.

Whether a Disease or Condition is “Irreversibly Debilitating”

For purposes of the Breakthrough Devices Program, FDA considers a disease or condition associated
with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning to be irreversibly debilitating for a
population or subpopulation. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient.
Irreversible disease or conditions may, in certain cases, include diseases or conditions that are persistent
or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is “irreversibly debilitating” is based on its impact on such
factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, and the likelihood that the disease or condition, if left
untreated, will progress to a more serious disease or condition. Examples include cancer, amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, and large ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; while
patients with STEMI and stroke can improve with medication and rehabilitation, the effects are not
reversible and can be debilitating).

(2) Second Criterion
As noted above, to qualify for Breakthrough Device designation, in addition to meeting the first
criterion, a sponsor must also demonstrate that its device meets one of the four sub-paragraphs under the
second criterion.
a.

Device Represents Breakthrough Technology

When determining whether a device represents a “breakthrough technolog[y],”32 FDA considers whether
the device represents a novel technology or novel application of an existing technology that has the
potential to lead to a clinical improvement in the diagnosis, treatment (including monitoring of
treatment), cure, mitigation, or prevention of the life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or
condition. Illustrative examples of technologies that would have been considered breakthrough at the
time they came to market include:

32

·

A transcatheter heart valve that is delivered transcutaneously and does not require open
heart surgery, thereby decreasing the risks of the procedure. This breakthrough
technology has the potential to provide a clinically meaningful advantage in a patient
population with few options.

·

An internal hemostatic device for the temporary control of bleeding from junctional
wounds and non-compressible wounds, which are not amenable to tourniquet application in
the battlefield. This device offers immediate care for severe bleeding wounds in a
battlefield setting until surgical care is available, offering patients a potentially life-saving
treatment when other methods of stopping severe bleeds are not an option.

·

A gene signature test that provides prognostic information for a cancer patient such that
the information helps clinicians personalize the benefit-risk profile of a variety of

See section 515B(b)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(2)(A)).

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
therapeutic options and treatment strategies.
·

A genetic test capable of identifying DNA mutations using blood from cancer patients
may offer patients a more convenient, non-invasive sampling method compared to
surgery, which has the potential for serious risks.
b.

No Approved or Cleared Alternatives Exist

When determining whether the device meets the criterion that “no approved or cleared alternatives
exist,”33 FDA considers whether there is a drug, biological product, device, or combination product that
has received FDA marketing authorization after premarket review for the same indication(s) being
considered (i.e., whether there is an alternative product that FDA has approved, cleared, or licensed, or
for which FDA has granted a De Novo request).
In addition to being an “approved or cleared” alternative, a product should be consistent with the
U.S. SOC. There may be a substantial number of currently approved or cleared medical products with
varying relevance in the diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease
in the U.S., including devices that are no longer used or are used only rarely. FDA’s determination as to
whether there is an approved or cleared alternative generally focuses only on options that reflect the
current SOC for the specific indication (including the disease stage) for which the product is being
developed.
In evaluating the current SOC, FDA considers recommendations by authoritative scientific bodies based
on clinical evidence and other reliable information, including such information submitted by the
sponsor, that reflects current clinical practice. In the absence of a well- established and documented
SOC, FDA may consult with special government employees (SGEs) or other experts for advice in
assessing whether an approved or cleared medical product is relevant to the current SOC. When a
proposed indication for the new device targets a subset of a broader disease population, the SOC for the
broader population, if there is one, generally is considered available therapy for the subset. Over the
course of new device development, it is foreseeable that the SOC for a given condition may evolve (e.g.,
because of the approval of a new device or new information about alternative treatments). For the
purpose of determinations on Breakthrough Device designation requests, FDA intends to determine
what constitutes an “alternative” at the time of the request for Breakthrough Device designation.
Examples of devices for which no approved or cleared alternative exists at the time designation is
requested include:
·

An ablation catheter that offers the potential ability to treat atrial fibrillation. Catheters
were approved for treatment of atrial flutter, and there was no legally marketed ablation
catheter indicated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, at the time of review,
the ablation catheter met the criteria for “no approved or cleared alternative.”

·

A first-of-a-kind testing device to aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease. While
devices exist to monitor tremors that may be associated with Parkinson’s Disease, no
device intended to aid in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease has received FDA
marketing authorization. A device that could differentiate between Parkinsonian and
non-Parkinsonian Disease tremor would be considered first-of-a-kind and meet the criterion for
having “no approved or cleared alternatives.”

33

See section 515B(b)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(2)(B)).

c.

Device Offers Significant Advantages over Existing Approved or
Cleared Alternatives

In determining whether a device meets the criterion of offering “significant advantages over existing
approved or cleared alternatives,”34 FDA considers the potential, compared to existing approved or
cleared alternatives, “to reduce or eliminate the need for hospitalization, improve patient quality of life,
facilitate patients’ ability to manage their own care (such as through self- directed personal assistance),
or establish long-term clinical efficiencies.”35
Examples of devices that have the potential to offer significant advantages over existing approved or
cleared alternatives include:
·

a diagnostic product intended to improve diagnosis or detection of a life-threatening or
irreversibly debilitating disease or condition in a way that would lead to improved
outcomes (e.g., an in vitro diagnostic product (IVD) for earlier diagnosis of
preeclampsia);

·

a product intended to improve or prevent a serious treatment-related side effect associated
with an available product for treating a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or
condition;

·

a product intended to treat a life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating disease or condition
that does not have a serious adverse effect associated with an available product for treating
this disease/condition; and

·

a product intended to treat or diagnose a life-threatening or irreversible disease or
condition that results in more efficient or safer clinical operation.
d.

Device Availability is in the Best Interest of Patients

In determining whether the device meets the criterion “availability [of the device] is in the best interest
of patients,”36 FDA considers whether the proposed device and indications for use provide another type
of specific public health benefit.
An example of a device, the availability of which is in the best interest of patients, could be a group of
molecular tests to identify a large number of potential pathogens simultaneously, including common,
rare, and/or emerging pathogens. More rapid access to more detailed diagnostic information can better
guide optimal patient care and may yield better patient outcomes. However, these devices also suffer
major challenges not only in comparing against reference methods but also in obtaining the appropriate
sample base to reliably verify the more rare pathogens in the panel. This can result in the target panel of
these tests being reduced in order to generate data to support FDA marketing authorization. The
Breakthrough Devices Program may facilitate the developers’ ability to test new wide-scope IVDs for
both common and rare pathogens, resulting in devices with a broader diagnostic scope being brought to
34

See section 515B(b)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(2)(C)). As noted above in Section III.B(2)b of this
guidance, for purposes of the Breakthrough Devices Program, we consider an “approved or cleared alternative” to be a
product that FDA has approved, cleared, licensed, or for which FDA has granted a De Novo request for the same indication(s)
as that being considered in the breakthrough designation request.
35
See section 515B(b)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(2)(C)).

See section 515B(b)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(b)(2)(D)).

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
market. Also, this program could facilitate more rapid marketing authorization of modifications to these
tests as new and emerging pathogens are discovered or proposed for addition to the panels.
In addition, the criterion of being in the best interest of patients may apply when the device has a benefit
for patients who are unable to tolerate available therapy, whose disease has failed to respond to available
therapy, or for whom the treatment can be used effectively with other critical agents that cannot be
combined with available therapy. This criterion may also apply if the device:
·

avoids serious harm that can occur with available therapy;

·

avoids serious harm that causes discontinuation of treatment of a life-threatening or
irreversibly debilitating disease or condition; or

·

reduces the potential for harmful interactions with other therapies.

In addition, this criterion may apply to a device that was designed or modified to address an
unanticipated serious failure occurring in a critical component of an approved or cleared device for
which there are no alternatives or for which alternative treatment would entail substantial risk of
morbidity for the patient. A device may also satisfy this criterion if it provides an additional benefit,
such as improved patient compliance that is expected to lead to a reduction in serious adverse outcomes.
Furthermore, this criterion may apply if the device addresses an emerging or anticipated public health
need, such as a device shortage or public health emergency.
A product developed by a sponsor who is working with a Federal agency on the development of medical
devices to address a national security issue may be considered to meet this criterion. To support a
request for designation under this criterion, it may be helpful to include a letter in the designation
request from the Federal agency (e.g., Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security)
identifying the specific device or device type and indicating that its commercial availability is of
particular importance to our national security.
Examples of devices for which availability would have been considered in the best interest of patients at
the time they came to the market are as follows:
·

an insulin pump that features a new mechanism to detect and respond to low
blood glucose; and

·

an IVD assay that detects a genomic variant for the purposes of identifying patients with
certain cancers who are eligible for treatment with a specific drug. In some situations,
for those patients who do not possess the variant, a therapeutic product may have severe
toxicities and be detrimental without providing benefit to the patient. For this reason,
use of the assay is necessary for safe and effective use of the drug and is therefore in the
best interest of patients. For more information on in vitro companion diagnostic devices,
please refer to the FDA guidance, “In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.”37

Finally, FDA may consider relevant patient experiences and perspectives when evaluating whether a
device meets the designation criterion of availability being in the best interests of patients. FDA may
also consider relevant patient experiences and perspectives when evaluating other designation criteria
for purposes of a Breakthrough Device designation request. This may include information on the relative

value of the perceived benefits and risks of a specific device to treat or diagnose a life threatening or
irreversibly debilitating disease or condition. Sponsors interested in presenting patient preference
information in support of their Breakthrough Device designation request may refer to the FDA
guidances “Patient Preference Information – Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket Approval
Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in
Decision Summaries and Device Labeling”38 and “Principles for Selecting, Developing, Modifying, and
Adapting Patient-Reported Outcome Instruments for Use in Medical Device Evaluation”39 for additional
information.

(3) Additional Considerations
a.

Regulatory Path

Section 515B of the FD&C Act states that Breakthrough Device designation may be requested “any time
prior to the submission of an application under section 515(c) [21 U.S.C 360e(c)], a notification under
section 510(k) [21 U.S.C. 360(k)], or a petition for classification under section 513(f)(2) [21 U.S.C.
360c(f)(2)].”40
Therefore, as part of the designation request review, FDA considers whether the expected marketing
application for the device is a PMA, 510(k), or De Novo request. Sponsors should indicate which
marketing application type (PMA, 510(k), or De Novo request) they intend to submit and include a
rationale for this approach in support of their Breakthrough Device designation request. FDA’s
designation decision does not constitute a formal decision regarding the applicable regulatory pathway
or device classification, but does indicate that, based on the information provided in the designation
request and other information known at the time, the Agency expects that submission of a PMA, 510(k),
or De Novo request will be necessary for marketing authorization. FDA does not intend to specify in its
decision on the designation request which type of marketing application the sponsor will need to submit
for the subject device.
Consistent with section 515B(c) of the FD&C Act, FDA expects sponsors to submit a request for
Breakthrough Device designation prior to submission of the marketing application. FDA will
not consider requests for designation contained within a marketing submission or submitted after a
marketing submission has been received.
b.

Multiple Devices with Same Intended Use

Breakthrough Device designation may be granted for multiple devices with the same proposed intended
use, and a Breakthrough Device designation will not be revoked solely on the basis of another
designated device obtaining marketing authorization.41 As a consequence, multiple Breakthrough Device
designations for the same intended use may be granted and have subsequent submissions pending
simultaneously. However, when a Breakthrough Device has been approved or cleared or has had a De
Novo request granted, no additional devices with the same intended use will be designated as a
Breakthrough Device, unless the criteria for designation described above are still met in light of the first

Breakthrough Device’s market availability.
For example, Devices X and Y were accepted into the Breakthrough Devices Program after FDA
determined for each device (1) that there was a reasonable expectation it could provide for more
effective treatment of a life-threatening disease and (2) that it represented a breakthrough
technology and offered significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. A De
Novo request was later granted for Device X, allowing marketing of the device. FDA will not revoke the
Breakthrough Device designation for Device Y, which is still pending premarket review after its
designation, solely based on market availability of Device X.42 However, Device Z, which has the same
intended use as Device X, is now requesting designation as a Breakthrough Device on the basis of
providing a significant advantage over Device X. Given that Device Z has the same intended use as
Device X, Device Z may be eligible for Breakthrough Device designation only if it meets the
designation criteria in light of the market availability of Device X.
Breakthrough Device designation will only be granted with respect to an intended use that meets the
designation criteria described in Section 515B of the FD&C Act. Each request for a Breakthrough
Device designation should include a description of only one proposed device and intended use, as well
as a rationale for how the criteria are met.
c.

Combination Products

Device-led combination products are eligible for Breakthrough Device designation. However, it is
important to note that these products may raise unique scientific and regulatory challenges and issues.
Further, it may not be possible to apply all of the policies described in this guidance to such combination
products that receive Breakthrough Device designation due to such challenges and issues. Interactive
review of complex issues requiring expertise from a different Center may require additional time to
resolve. When CDRH or CBER receives a Q-Submission, IDE or marketing application for a device-led
combination product that has been designated as a Breakthrough Device, CDRH or CBER intends to
notify the consulting Center(s) of its receipt and include the appropriate review staff from the consulting
Center(s) to ensure that the entire combination product review team is aware of the issues discussed and
engaged, as needed, in the review.43
d.

Reducing Disparities in Health and Health Care

Health and health care disparities exist and occur across many dimensions, including race, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, language, and location, among
others, as summarized in reports by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Department of
Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health as well as FDA

42

See Section 515B(d)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(d)(3)).

43

While the lead Center is the primary contact point for combination product sponsors, the Office of Combination Products
(OCP) is available to participate in meetings or otherwise engage on regulatory matters for these products upon request (see
section 503(g)(8) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(g)(8)). For further information on combination products and OCP, see
the OCP webpage at https://www.fda.gov/combination-products.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
guidances.44,45,46 Addressing health and health care disparities is not only important for achieving health
equity,47 but also for improving the overall quality of life and health outcomes for all patients. FDA
recognizes the urgent public health need for innovative technologies that help to reduce barriers to
achieving health equity and help to improve health outcomes across diverse populations. When assessing
eligibility for the Breakthrough Devices Program using the statutory designation criteria, 48 FDA intends
to consider technologies and device features that may help to address health and/or health care disparities
and promote health equity by providing for more effective treatment or diagnosis in populations that
exhibit health and health care disparities.
One dimension contributing to health and health care disparities is the inability to recognize and address
the ways in which treatment outcomes may differ by race, ethnicity, sex, age, disability, and/or other
factors. For some diseases, the pathophysiology, clinical features, and response to treatment may be
impacted by these factors.49 For example, differences in health outcomes may exist for pediatric and
geriatric patients due to age-related physiologic changes. Health and health care disparities can be
exacerbated due to a lack of recognition of these differences, including implicit biases, and/or the lack of
devices designed to effectively diagnose or treat the condition in a manner that addresses these
differences. The Breakthrough Devices Program can be used to help provide more timely access to
devices that address the unmet needs of populations that may experience health and/or health care
disparities. FDA considers technologies and device features tailored to address characteristic differences,
such as those arising from social factors, phenotypic variations, pathophysiology, and/or response to
treatment, when evaluating if there is a reasonable expectation that the device may provide for more
effective treatment or diagnosis as compared to the current standard of care, including the device’s
potential to be more effective in certain populations. For example, as part of FDA’s assessment of
whether a device is reasonably expected to be more effective, we consider if it is designed to address a
pathophysiological or clinical characteristic associated with certain populations that could have a
clinically meaningful impact for the treatment or diagnosis of the condition in those populations. Such a
device may, therefore, be considered as reasonably expected to offer a more effective treatment or
diagnosis as is consistent with criterion 1 of the designation criteria.
Similarly, health and/or health care disparities may also arise in populations impacted by life-threatening
or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions that are rare, such as sickle cell disease. In some cases,
patients living with these rare diseases or conditions may have limited diagnostic and treatment options.

FDA considers technologies and device features tailored to address unmet needs in these populations
when evaluating if there is a reasonable expectation that the device may provide for more effective
treatment or diagnosis.50
Another major dimension of health and health care disparities is accessibility to quality health care. For
the purposes of this guidance, we define accessibility as an individual or group’s capacity to benefit from
a medical device or procedure. This is distinct from use of the term “access” elsewhere in the guidance,
which refers to commercial availability of a medical device following marketing authorization. Certain
barriers, such as inequities in the availability of medical care, may prevent underserved populations from
receiving medical treatment or diagnosis. Often the benefit of a device cannot be realized due to this lack
of accessibility. New devices that have the potential to offer a clinically meaningful impact through
improved accessibility may provide a significant benefit to patients by, for example, including user
features that are adaptable or more easily used by diverse populations or allow for use in more diverse
settings. As described in Section III.B.1.a of this guidance, when determining whether a device is
reasonably expected to “provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis,” FDA considers the totality of
available information regarding the device, including its potential for a clinically meaningful impact and
its potential benefits and risks. Therefore, when evaluating the first Breakthrough criterion, FDA intends
to consider technologies and device features that could allow for improved accessibility when evaluating
if there is a reasonable expectation that the device may provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis
as compared to the current standard of care. For example, improved accessibility of a device may support
that the device is reasonably expected to be more effective if there is information supporting its use in
diverse settings such that a patient population with limited or no available options may have improved
adherence to a prescribed medical regimen.51

C. Designation Review Process
A request for Breakthrough Device designation should be submitted as a “Designation Request for
Breakthrough Device” Q-Submission. The procedures for submitting a Q-Submission to FDA are
outlined in the FDA guidance, “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions:
The Q-Submission Program.”52 These Breakthrough Device designation requests are not subject to an
acceptance review. An example approach53 for a request for Breakthrough Device designation is
provided in Appendix 1: Illustrative Example: Breakthrough Device Designation Request. The
designation request should be the only request contained in the Q-Submission. Other Q- Submission
topics should be submitted separately. This will help FDA meet the statutory timeframe for making a
decision on a Breakthrough Device designation request. Furthermore, if sponsors are pursuing
Breakthrough Device status and at the same time have other requests for feedback, they may wish to
consider submitting the questions after FDA renders a designation decision. This is because the
Breakthrough Device status may impact the feedback FDA provides. In addition, note that designation
50

Consistent with section 515B(c) of the FD&C Act, Breakthrough Device designation may be requested at any time prior to
the submission of a PMA, 510(k), or De Novo request. Sponsors should only request Breakthrough Device designation if they
intend to pursue one of these marketing pathways. Other marketing pathways (e.g., Humanitarian Device Exemption) are not
eligible for consideration under the Breakthrough Devices Program.
51
Consistent with the goals of promoting the development of impactful devices, FDA considers this potential for increased
benefit to patients to satisfy the “more effective treatment or diagnosis” criterion when evaluating a Breakthrough Designation
request. These considerations for determining eligibility to participate in the program are different from and do not change the
statutory requirements for safety and effectiveness to support a marketing authorization.

for requests under subsection (c).” The illustrative appendix provides an example approach.

should be requested separately from the submission of a marketing submission or IDE application.
Please note that FDA may identify devices that may be good candidates for the Breakthrough Devices
Program and recommend that sponsors of such devices consider applying to the program.
FDA will issue a grant or denial decision for each Breakthrough Device designation request within 60
calendar days of receiving such a request.54 In general, FDA intends to interact with a sponsor by Day 30
regarding any requests for additional information needed to inform the designation decision. It is helpful
when a sponsor is available and responsive to FDA requests throughout the review timeline. If FDA
does not receive additional information needed to make a decision on a designation request in a timely
manner, it may result in denial of the Breakthrough Device designation request.
Subject to the confidentiality provisions of the FD&C Act and implementing regulations, including
FDA’s Part 20 regulations covering information disclosure (21 CFR part 20),55 and the Freedom of
Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552),56 FDA generally will not disclose the existence of requests for
Breakthrough Device designation and our decisions on such designation requests. However, in certain
cases, FDA may publicly disclose a Breakthrough Device designation that has been previously publicly
disclosed or acknowledged by the sponsor of the Breakthrough Device designation request. Additionally,
once a designated Breakthrough Device obtains marketing authorization for an indication consistent with
its Breakthrough Device designation, FDA intends to publicly disclose its Breakthrough Device
designation status for that indication for use.57 Because Breakthrough Device designation is granted for a
device and its indication for use, if a designated Breakthrough Device receives marketing authorization
for an indication other than the indication covered by its designation, it is not considered a marketauthorized Breakthrough Device and would not be disclosed as such.

D. Designation Withdrawal
A sponsor may request to withdraw from the Breakthrough Devices Program at any time. Such a request
should be submitted in writing to FDA as a withdrawal amendment to the Q-Submission under which
designation was granted.
FDA will not withdraw designation on the basis of another Breakthrough Device or a device given

enactment of the Cures Act) with the same intended use receiving PMA approval, having a De Novo
request granted, or receiving clearance of a 510(k).58 However, FDA may withdraw designation at any
time upon written notice to the sponsor if FDA determines that:
·

for other reasons, the device is no longer eligible for a Breakthrough Device designation
according to the criteria outlined in section 515B(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e3(b)), based on available information; or

·

the information submitted in support of a request for Breakthrough Device designation,
including, without limitation, the designation request package or any related premarket
submission, contained an untrue statement of material fact or omitted material
information, including false statements relating to data collection.

IV. Program Features
The novelty of a Breakthrough Device can present key challenges because both the sponsor and FDA
may face more uncertainty about how best to evaluate the device’s safety and effectiveness. To expedite
the development of these devices, FDA intends to offer sponsors a menu of options that offer
opportunities for early and regular interaction with FDA as device development unfolds. A sponsor who
wishes to request feedback on a device that has been designated as a Breakthrough Device may select
one or more of the options described below in Sections A-D at any time prior to submitting a marketing
application for that device; the sponsor need not, however, pursue any of these options. We consider
options A-C to be a subset of Pre- Submissions. When submitting a Q-Submission for a designated
Breakthrough Device, sponsors should specify if they are requesting one of the special program features
available to designated Breakthrough Devices (i.e., a sprint discussion (IV.A), review of a Data
Development Plan (IV.B), or a Clinical Protocol Agreement (IV.C)). Additionally, sponsors of
Breakthrough Devices also have the option to request feedback from FDA through mechanisms that are
available for non-Breakthrough Devices and may submit more traditional Pre-Submissions whose scope
is consistent with typical requests for feedback received through the Pre-Submission Program (Section
IV.D). Sponsors of designated Breakthrough Devices requesting any of the options described in Sections
A-D should follow the processes outlined in the Q- Submission Guidance and should identify the Qsubmission in the cover letter as an “Interaction for Designated Breakthrough Device.”

A. Breakthrough Device Sprint Discussion
To support sponsors needing timely resolution of potentially novel issues, FDA offers “sprint”
discussions with the goal of reaching mutual agreement on a specific topic within a set time period (e.g.,
45 days). The number, format, and duration of interactions within a sprint discussion may vary based on
project needs and should be defined a priori by the sponsor and FDA. During a sprint discussion, the
sponsor may provide additional information or revisions to initial proposals. The schedule of such
interactions as well as the information and proposals to be discussed during the sprint discussion may be
modified during the sprint discussion as agreed upon with FDA. To facilitate this intensive level of
interaction, a sprint discussion should follow the parameters below. Points of disagreement that cannot
be resolved quickly should be expeditiously elevated to senior management. In some cases, the sponsor
may wish to consider FDA feedback after conclusion of the sprint discussion prior to determining
whether disagreement exists and whether additional discussion is needed.
58

See section 515B(d)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(d)(3)).

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(1) Single Topic with Specific Goals
To allow for a detailed discussion and timely resolution, a sprint should have only one general topic
(e.g., animal study protocol design, strategy for focused non-clinical testing, clinical protocol discussion,
statistical analysis plan review) and specific goals (e.g., determine primary and secondary endpoints for
pivotal study). In a sprint discussion request, a sponsor should propose a topic and goals(s). FDA may
work with the sponsor to refine the topic, timeline and goal(s) as needed. It is generally recommended
that a sponsor have no more than one sprint discussion open at a time. This will allow both FDA and the
sponsor to devote sufficient resources to support a highly interactive, collaborative, and dynamic sprint
process.

(2) Defined Interaction Schedule, Including Planned

Participants
Sprint discussion requests are not subject to the acceptance review described in the Q- Submission
Guidance. A sponsor should propose an interaction schedule and a defined end date (e.g., 45 days). FDA
will propose revisions to the timeline, if needed, with the goal of reaching agreement on the timeline
early in the sprint review. In general, FDA anticipates providing feedback on sprint issues in less time
than would be expected for a traditional Pre-Submission. Since progress may require the presence of key
individua ls at meetings during the sprint discussion, the sponsor should propose its planned attendees
(e.g., regulatory manager, animal study consultant, clinical consultant) and, as relevant, request FDA
attendees with specific expertise (e.g., animal study reviewer, clinician, statistician).
The sprint discussion is intended to be highly interactive, and FDA understands that, based on an early
interaction, the sponsor may choose to provide additional information to FDA to support later
interactions for the sprint. If the sponsor provides new information to FDA during the sprint, FDA will
attempt to incorporate the information into its review and feedback while still adhering to the agreedupon timeline. However, depending on the extent of the new information provided and the time
remaining for the review, revisions to the timeline may be needed.

(3) Clear Documentation of Interactions and Conclusions
FDA will provide summary feedback to the sponsor after the close of a sprint discussion. This summary
should include the points of agreement, points of disagreement, if any, and points necessitating further
discussion. To facilitate any review of new or revised information provided during the sprint, it is
recommended that the sponsor provide “track changes” versions of any revised documents and/or
clearly indicate with a summary table or timeline what changes or new information is being or has been
provided. At the conclusion of the sprint discussion, the sponsor should develop draft minutes and
provide the draft minutes as an amendment to the relevant Pre- Submission. Timing for submission of
draft meeting minutes should be addressed in the sprint discussion schedule.
FDA intends that feedback the Agency provides in response to a sprint discussion will not change,
provided that the information submitted in a future IDE or marketing application is consistent with that
provided in the sprint submission and that the data in the future submission do not raise any important
new issues materially affecting safety or effectiveness. FDA intends that modifications to its feedback
be limited to situations in which FDA concludes that the feedback given previously does not adequately
address important new issues materially relevant to a determination of safety or effectiveness that have
emerged since the time of the sprint discussion. For example, FDA may modify its previous feedback if
23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
new scientific findings emerge that indicate there is a new risk or an increased frequency of a known
risk that affects FDA’s prior advice, or if there is a new public health concern that affects FDA’s prior
advice. In such cases, FDA will acknowledge a change in the advice and will document clearly the
rationale for the change, and the changed advice will be supported by the appropriate managerial
concurrence.
Sponsors should recognize that even though the Agency may have already reviewed the sponsor’s
protocols/plans in a sprint discussion, this does not guarantee approval, clearance, or granting of future
submissions. Additional questions may be raised during the review of the future submission when all
information is reviewed and considered as a whole. Although sprint discussions are not decisional or
binding on the Agency or the sponsor, it is FDA’s intent to provide the best advice possible based on the
information provided and other information known at that point in time.

(4) Supporting Materials
To enable quick, efficient discussion of the sprint topic, it is important that the sponsor provide FDA
with, and clearly reference, all materials needed to support review and interaction (e.g., a submission
might contain an appendix with a draft protocol). FDA recommends that sponsors provide a rationale
justifying their proposed approach within their supporting materials to best facilitate review and
interactions.

(5) Example Sprint Discussion
The example sprint discussion below incorporates the concepts discussed above:
·

On Day 7, following receipt of the submission, FDA and the sponsor hold an
informational discussion to walk FDA through the sponsor’s materials and questions.
During this meeting, FDA and the sponsor discuss an interaction schedule to facilitate
collaboration and overall topics and goals for sprint interactions.

·

On Day 14, FDA emails the sponsor with initial feedback and questions for upcoming
discussion.

·

On Day 21, FDA and the sponsor meet (via teleconference or face to face) to discuss
FDA’s initial feedback and questions. FDA and the sponsor discuss initial approaches for
addressing any outstanding issues.

·

On Day 28, based on the feedback received and the prior discussion, the sponsor provides
additional information or revised supporting materials to FDA via email in response to
outstanding issues.

·

On Day 35, FDA and the sponsor meet via teleconference to discuss the revised supporting
materials provided by the sponsor. Based on this discussion, FDA and the sponsor identify
substantive areas of agreement and points necessitating further discussion, if any. The
sponsor may wish to consider FDA feedback prior to determining whether agreement or
disagreement exists and whether additional discussion is needed. However, if any
substantive points of disagreement are identified by FDA or the sponsor at this point, FDA
develops a plan for how senior management will be involved to support quick resolution of
the identified issues (see Section II.E above) which may include early notification of the
potential need for their involvement.
24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

On Day 40, the sponsor provides via email draft minutes from previous discussions
including substantive points of agreement, points necessitating further discussion or
points of disagreement, if any.

·

On Day 45, FDA provides any edits to meeting minutes, including substantive points of
agreement and points necessitating further discussion, if any. If there are no points of
disagreement, FDA will close out the sprint discussion. If points of disagreement exist,
FDA will proceed with the plan for senior management involvement to quickly address
the outstanding issues, which might include a teleconference involving senior
management by Day 50.

B. Data Development Plan (DDP)
Sponsors of Breakthrough Devices may request coordination with FDA regarding a Data Development
Plan (DDP). The DDP is a high-level document intended to help ensure predictable, efficient,
transparent, and timely device assessment and review by outlining data collection expectations for the
entire product lifecycle. It should describe the balance of premarket and, as applicable, postmarket
collection of clinical and non-clinical data. FDA intends to work with the sponsor so that the plan is
developed in a manner that is least-burdensome and predictable, while allowing for some measure of
flexibility and adjustments as appropriate. While the optimal timeframe for submission of a DDP will
vary depending on the device, and is ultimately at the sponsor’s discretion, it may be most beneficial to
initiate DDP discussions with FDA soon after a Breakthrough Device designation has been granted.
An example approach to a DDP can be found in Appendix 2: Data Development Plan (DDP)
Example Approach.
Importantly, the DDP may include both clinical and non-clinical testing approaches. In FDA’s
experience, sponsors often focus on clinical study design but tend to overlook potential hurdles raised by
non-clinical issues. FDA encourages sponsors to consider the non-clinical testing that will be needed to
support the regulatory review of their device early on and to discuss the planned approach with FDA.
The DDP should discuss the non-clinical testing that would be conducted and the timing of such testing
relative to planned clinical studies and a subsequent marketing application. It may be appropriate for
clinical testing to begin based upon preliminary non-clinical results or with some non-clinical testing
deferred, depending on the mitigations in place to protect study subjects. Please note that FDA and the
sponsor may wish to discuss a complete DDP with all planned clinical and non-clinical testing for preand postmarket data collection, if appropriate, or a component or subset of the DDP (e.g., premarket
non-clinical testing assessment plan).
FDA review of a DDP may follow a similar model as the sprint discussion described above and is not
subject to an acceptance review. In general, FDA anticipates that feedback on a DDP will be provided in
less time than would be expected for a traditional Pre-Submission.

C. Clinical Protocol Agreement
As described in section 515B(e)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360e-3(e)(2)(D)), the Breakthrough
Devices Program includes a provision for obtaining agreement in writing for clinical protocols, which
will be considered binding on both FDA and the sponsor, subject to the following:
·

Any changes to the previously agreed-upon protocol are agreed upon in writing by both
25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA and the sponsor; or
·

The director of the Office responsible for reviewing the device determines that a
substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the
device exists. In this case, the director’s decision must be provided in writing and can be
made only after FDA has provided an opportunity to the sponsor to meet and discuss the
substantial scientific issue(s). Such a meeting would need to include the Office director and
clearly document the substantial scientific issue(s) discussed.

As with the sprint discussion and DDP features described above, a request for a clinical protocol agreement
is not subject to an acceptance review. FDA will work interactively with sponsors who choose to pursue a
clinical protocol agreement. Upon reaching agreement, FDA will issue a letter documenting the agreement
reached.

D. Other Pre­Submission for Designated Breakthrough Device
FDA recognizes that some sponsors of devices designated as Breakthrough Devices may wish to engage
with FDA on multiple topics in a single Pre-Submission rather than utilize one of the options presented
above in Section IV.A-C. For these types of requests for feedback, the sponsor may submit a PreSubmission as described in the Q-Submission Guidance59 and request that it be tracked as an
“Interaction for Designated Breakthrough Device” in the cover letter. Review teams will prioritize these
submissions and develop a timeline for feedback with the sponsor,
consistent with commitments specified as part of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017.60

E. Regular Status Updates
FDA and the sponsor of a Breakthrough Device may agree to have regular (e.g., bimonthly) status
updates. Through these interactions, FDA and the sponsor may discuss general progress of the project
(e.g., timeframe for a planned marketing submission) and next steps or plans for future discussions.
These interactions may be by email, virtually (by videoconference or teleconference), or in-person (faceto-face), as agreed upon by FDA and the sponsor. These interactions may be between the primary FDA
and sponsor contacts (e.g., FDA lead reviewer) or may include additional participants as needed
including FDA managers. Regular status updates provide an opportunity for a high-level view of the
project and identification of potential hurdles, while a sprint discussion provides the opportunity for
detailed feedback to address specific sponsor goals. A Pre-Submission is not recommended or needed
for status updates.
