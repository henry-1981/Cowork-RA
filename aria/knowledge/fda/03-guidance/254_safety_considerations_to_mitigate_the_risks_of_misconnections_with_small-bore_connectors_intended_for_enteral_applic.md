Safety Considerations to Mitigate the
Risks of Misconnections with Smallbore Connectors Intended for Enteral
Applications
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate
to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies
the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an
alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If
you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the
title page of this guidance.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides recommendations to manufacturers, FDA reviewers, and other entities
involved in manufacturing devices that contain small-bore connectors designed for enteral
feeding, as well as those submitting or reviewing premarket notification submissions
[510(k)s] for these devices. Small-bore connectors provide a mechanism for the connection
between a variety of medical devices including those with enteral and non-enteral (e.g.,
intravenous) applications. The use of common connector designs, such as Luer connectors,
has led to unintended connections between devices that have different intended uses and has
resulted in serious and sometimes fatal consequences to patients. 1,2,3
This guidance recommends that manufacturers design and test enteral connectors based upon
Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI)/CN3:2014 (PS),
“Small-bore connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications — Part 3:
Connectors for enteral applications” and AAMI/CN20:2014 (PS), “Small-bore connectors for
liquids and gases in healthcare applications — Part 20: Common test methods” to ensure that
each proposed enteral connector is physically incompatible with non-enteral devices. For
enteral connectors that do not meet AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS), also known as proprietary
connectors or transition connectors, this guidance continues to recommend that manufacturers
design and test the devices based upon the AAMI/American National Standards Institute
(ANSI)/International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 80369-1 standard “Small-bore
connectors for liquids and gases in healthcare applications — Part 1: General requirements.”

Furthermore, this guidance document serves to notify manufacturers submitting 510(k)s or
modifying a device already cleared for enteral connectors that color-coding, labeling, and
tagging attached to the device, by themselves, are no longer sufficient to satisfy safety
concerns regarding misconnection hazards associated with connectors such as 6% tapered
Luer connectors. Lastly, this guidance recommends that when submitting a 510(k) or
modifying an existing product already cleared via 510(k), a manufacturer should perform a
risk assessment to assess the risks of the proposed enteral connector misconnecting to nonenteral devices.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Definitions
Adapter: A device, or a component of a device, whose purpose is to form intermediary
connections between two incompatible medical devices.
Enteral connectors: Connectors that attach to devices involved in administration of fluid
(liquid) to the gastrointestinal tract or removal of gas or fluids from the gastrointestinal tract.
These include nasogastric, nasoduodenal, gastrostomy, and gastrojejunal feeding tubes,
including enteral feeding sets, gravity and pump feeding sets, Y-ports and T-set medication
ports, enteral pouches, and syringes for feeding and/or administering enteral medication.
Luer: The AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 standard describes the Luer connector as a small-bore
“conical fitting with a 6% taper for syringes, needles, and certain other medical equipment.”
Luer connectors have a male and a female component that are joined to form a secure, yet
detachable leak-proof connection. The connection is achieved by use of a push fitting (a Luer
slip) or a screw-in threaded fitting (a Luer lock) that joins the male and the female tapered
fittings.

Misconnection: Inappropriate connections occurring between two connectors that attach
devices with different intended uses or applications, such as enteral feeding systems and nonenteral systems.
Non-enteral connectors: Small-bore connectors on devices that are not involved in enteral
(through the gastrointestinal system) feeding systems.
Non-interconnectable connectors: Connectors that have geometries and other design
characteristics that prevent secure and unintended connections.
Proprietary connector: For purposes of this guidance, small-bore connector designed to
conform to the AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 standard, but does not meet the design
requirements of AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS).
Representative market sampling: For purposes of misconnection testing (refer to Section
V.B), a sampling of small-bore connectors that are commonly marketed in the United
States, and which are representative of connectors that may be present with an enteral
connector. These select connectors should include connectors from the medical application
types that are identified in AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1.
Side port: Connecting attachment to feeding tube which allows for (1) medication
administration and/or flushing and (2) fluid or air inflation of balloons.
Transition connector: For purposes of this guidance, facilitates enteral-specific
connections between the AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS), Part 3 compliant connectors and nonAAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 compliant enteral connectors.

III. Background
Numerous publications regarding patient injury and death from tubing and catheter
misconnections indicate that reports of misconnections have increased in frequency over the
past several years.1,2, 4- 9 Misconnections occur when a connector on a medical device
performing a specific function is unintentionally or intentionally attached to a connector from
another medical device that performs a completely different function. Small-bore Luer
connectors can freely connect to many different medical devices.2-9 Human factor errors
coupled with widespread use of Luer connectors may promote misconnections of enteral to
non-enteral devices.4 To reduce the frequency of connector hazards, the FDA is collaborating
with the International Organization for Standardization to develop the AAMI/ANSI/ISO
80369 standards.
On July 9, 2010, the FDA issued a letter to healthcare professionals, hospital purchasing
departments, and manufacturers of enteral feeding tubes regarding Luer lock misconnections.
The FDA advised manufacturers to assess the risks of misconnections for their devices and
provide proposed solutions with validation for premarket review. At that time, some
manufacturers were using color-coding and labeling to reduce the risk of misconnections;
others were creating proprietary connectors designed to be incompatible with non-enteral
devices. However, recent reports of adverse events have demonstrated that reliance on color3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
coding of enteral devices alone cannot adequately mitigate the risk of misconnections,
especially with similarly color-coded intravenous PICC (percutaneously inserted central
catheter) lines with Luer connectors.8,9
AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 was published on December 15, 2010, and recognized by the FDA
on March 14, 2011, as noted on the FDA’s Recognized Consensus Standards webpage
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfstandards/results.cfm).
AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 provides general requirements for small-bore connectors for
liquids and gases in healthcare applications. It provides a framework for testing connectors of
different medical applications against each other to ensure non-interconnectability, and also
establishes specific misconnection testing methods. AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 was
published on December 2, 2014 and recognized by the FDA on February 11, 2015.
AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 specifies the dimensions and recommendations for the design
and functional performance of small-bore connectors intended to be used on medical devices
and accessories that have an enteral application. In addition, AAMI/CN20:2014 (PS) Part 20
was published on December 2, 2014 and recognized by the FDA on February 11, 2015.
AAMI/CN20:2014 (PS) Part 20 specifies test methods to support the functional requirements
for the small-bore connectors identified in AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1. The FDA’s recognition
of AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3, and AAMI/CN20:2014 (PS) Part
20, and the Agency’s concern regarding enteral to non-enteral misconnections prompted the
FDA to publish the current guidance. Through the combined efforts of industry, medical
device purchasers, healthcare professionals, and the appropriate regulatory authorities, the
risk of misconnection can be optimally mitigated.

IV. Scope
The recommendations made in this guidance are applicable to connectors that are part of, or
form connections to, enteral devices intended for administration of fluids (e.g., enteral
formulas and medications) and other nutritional substances. These products are all regulated
under 21 CFR 876.5980, and include the following devices:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Enteral feeding tubes (product code KNT);
Enteral specific transition connectors (PIO);
Gastrostomy tubes (KNT, KGC, FPD and FHT);
Gastrointestinal tubes with enteral specific connectors (PIF);
Gastrojejunal tubes (KNT);
Nasogastric tubes (KNT, BSS, FEF, FFW and FPD); and
Nasoduodenal tubes (KNT).

The recommendations also apply to connections located directly on feeding tubes:
• Extension/administration sets (KNT); and
• Feeding reservoirs/spikes, and syringes (KNT, FMF).
This guidance also addresses side ports and adapter connections. Ports for balloon inflation
are not addressed in this guidance.

V.

Recommendations

The FDA recommends that devices with connectors that are part of, or form connections to,
enteral feeding tubes conform to AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3. If such devices with an
existing 510(k) clearance have been modified in order to conform to this standard, and the
modifications would trigger the need for a new 510(k), FDA does not intend to object if firms
submit a declaration of conformity to AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 in an “add-to-file” to their
existing 510(k) rather than submitting a new 510(k). 10 Please note the devices with such
connectors remain subject to requirements such as GMP requirements (21 CFR 820),
including design controls (21 CFR 820.30), and registration and listing (21 CFR 807). 11 In
the event a manufacturer creates or modifies device connectors such that they do not fully
conform to the AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 standard, e.g., proprietary and transition
connectors, FDA expects the manufacturer to submit a 510(k) for FDA review when a 510(k)
submission is required. For more information on when to submit a 510(k), please see FDA’s
guidance, “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/
ucm080235.htm).
Given that AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 establishes a framework for testing different
connectors, but does not identify the specific connectors to be evaluated, even if devices with
proprietary or transition connectors conform to AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, the FDA
recommends that full test reports, containing the test protocol, results, any deviations, and
conclusions, be submitted as part of the 510(k) submission when a 510(k) submission is
required.

A.

Connector materials

The FDA recommends that enteral connectors be made of rigid or semi-rigid materials, as
described in the currently FDA-recognized version of AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, Clause 4 or
in AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 as appropriate. In addition, it is recommended that the
connectors be made of materials with a modulus of elasticity either in flexure or in tension
greater than 700 MPa, in accordance with AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3. Testing verifying the
materials chosen should be conducted according to ASTM D747 “Standard Test Method for
Apparent Bending Modulus of Plastics by Means of a Cantilever Beam,” ASTM D790
“Standard Test Methods for Flexural Properties of Unreinforced and Reinforced Plastics and
Electrical Insulating Materials,” or equivalent method. Use of rigid or semi-rigid materials
will reduce the likelihood of forced fits between flexible connectors that are not intended to
connect with each other.

10

Any device that is represented to conform to an FDA-recognized standard and does not conform to such
standard in all respects is adulterated under section 501(e)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(e)(2).
11

Manufacturers’ continuing obligations under the quality system regulations in 21 CFR part 820 require control
of supply and outgoing product for compliance with design specifications. Compliance with these obligations
may be evaluated during routine inspections.

B.

Mechanical testing of enteral connectors to assess
incompatibility

For connectors that do not conform to AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3, the FDA recommends
mechanical force testing of enteral connectors following AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, Clause
5.8, Annex B methods, or an equivalent alternative, to demonstrate that enteral connectors are
non-interconnectable with connectors from other health care applications. The following
components should be tested:
•

connectors for the following device types:
o intravascular devices;
o hypodermic applications;
o breathing systems and driving gas devices;
o urethral/urinary devices;
o limb cuff inflation devices; and
o neuraxial devices.

For each of the device types listed above, manufacturers should identify in their premarket
submissions the most commonly sold or used non-enteral connectors found in U.S. markets,
as determined from a representative sample analysis, against which the subject device should
be tested.
Regarding testing, to demonstrate non-interconnectable characteristics, the proposed
connector should not provide a secure connection with a non-enteral connector when
assembled with moderate force, and should easily disengage. As described in
AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, Annex B, and AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3, Clause 6, the test
connectors should be appropriately conditioned and assembled by applying a specified axial
force and torque for a specified amount of time. Then, without activating any latch or
disengagement mechanism, an axial force of separation should be applied to the assembled
connectors to verify that the connectors disengage. Threaded connectors should be tested with
both clockwise and counterclockwise rotation.

C.

Enteral connector risk assessment

When submitting a new 510(k) or modifying an existing 510(k)-cleared device, a
manufacturer should conduct a risk assessment to demonstrate that the risk of misconnection
has been effectively mitigated with the enteral product. There should be objective evidence to
demonstrate that the risks have been reduced to acceptable levels according to the currently
FDA recognized version of ISO 14971 or equivalent. For example, the manufacturer may
document selection of appropriate material (Section V.A, above) and quantitative mechanical
testing data to demonstrate that the proposed enteral connector has a reduced risk of forming
stable attachments to connectors routing into non-enteral devices (Section V.B, above).

D.

Inadequacy of color-coded and labeled connectors

AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, Clause 5.8, provides an approach and testing method (Annex B)
for reducing misconnection hazards by designing enteral connectors physically incapable of
secure attachment to connectors of non-enteral devices. As supported by AAMI/CN3:2014
(PS) Part 3, Annex A, color-coding, labeling, and tagging or imprinting (e.g., “feeding only,”
“medication only”) on the device, by themselves, are not sufficient to mitigate health
concerns from enteral misconnection.8,9 However, for connectors for which noninterconnectability has been demonstrated (Sections V.A, B, and C, above), color-coding,
labeling, and tagging or imprinting on the connector could also be incorporated into the
product design.

E.

Side ports, transition connectors, adapters, and
syringes

To reduce the likelihood of misconnections, the FDA recommends that side port connectors
that are used for flushing and/or drug administration be tested similarly to the enteral
connectors described in Sections V.A, B, and C of this guidance. This means that the
connectors should be made of rigid or semi-rigid materials, and mechanical testing should be
performed according to recommendations outlined in AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1, Clause 5.8
and Annex B, or an equivalent alternative, to demonstrate that enteral flushing/drug
administration side ports are non-interconnectable with connectors of non-enteral devices.
The use of enteral only syringes may also be used as part of the mitigation of this issue.
Side port connectors that are used with inflation devices have different risk profiles, and do
not necessarily need the same testing as other enteral connectors. However, the FDA
recommends that manufacturers identify risks and design mitigations to reduce risks of
misconnection.
If the risk of use is acceptable, transition connectors may temporarily be necessary within
GI applications (e.g., for tubes with both suctioning and feeding functions or for connection
between proprietary and AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 compliant connectors). In certain
limited circumstances, use of an adapter can provide for medication delivery until
connectors meeting the standard are in wide-spread use, in order to avoid deprivation of care.
Syringes are also often used in enteral applications. Syringes used for enteral feeding should
only attach to enteral connectors. Therefore, the FDA recommends that mechanical testing
should be performed according to recommendations described in Section V.A, B, and C of
this guidance.

F.

Labeling

In considering approaches to labeling of a specific enteral device, the interpretation of the
device name and/or claims are of high importance. The FDA recommends a simplified
labeling strategy designed for easy interpretation of connectors to avoid potential confusion.
Instructions for use might include statements such as:
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

“The ____ (device) connection is intended to connect to ___________ (compatible
devices).”

The FDA recommends that enteral labeling, including the instructions for use, not include the
terms “enteral-only” and “Non-IV.” “Enteral-only” may be misleading in that it may be
interpreted to mean compatibility with all other enteral connectors, but incompatibility with
non-enteral connectors. “Non-IV” is not appropriate because the term “non-IV” does not
encompass all the testing that is needed to demonstrate non-connectability with connectors
used in other medical applications. When a device manufacturer wants to provide information
in the instructions for use regarding the design features of their device that may mitigate the
risk of misconnections, the FDA recommends statements such as the following:
•

“The ____ (device) connection is intended to reduce the risk of misconnection
between the following connectors/applications: …”

•

“The (device/connector) was tested to demonstrate a reduced likelihood of a
misconnection in the following device applications: …”

Information regarding the potential to misconnect with other device applications should be
included as a warning in the instructions for use. Specific connector types that have the
potential to misconnect, and those that were demonstrated to misconnect, should be
specified in the instructions for use.
In addition, for the connectors for which non-interconnectability is demonstrated, labeling and
tagging or imprinting (e.g., “feeding only,” “medication only”) on the connector could be
incorporated into the product design.

G.

Usability and human factors testing

Proprietary connectors with claims of non-interconnectability to all other medical application
types should include usability and/or human factors testing to confirm there is no
unacceptable risk, as described in the currently FDA recognized version of AAMI/ANSI
HE75, Human Factors Engineering – Design of medical devices. For additional information
on this topic see FDA’s draft guidance “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering
to Optimize Medical Device Design”
(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm25
9748.htm), which represents FDA’s proposed approach on this topic. When final, this
document will supersede FDA’s guidance entitled “Medical Device Use-Safety: Incorporating
Human Factors Engineering into Risk Management”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../ucm094461.pdf) (Issued July 18, 2000).
Usability testing in relation to enteral connectors is also described in AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS)
Part 3 Annex E.

VI. Future Considerations
AAMI/ANSI/ISO 80369-1 provides general requirements for demonstrating noninterconnectability of small-bore connectors, while AAMI/CN3:2014 (PS) Part 3 specifies the
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
dimensions and requirements for the design and functional performance of small-bore
connectors intended to be used on enteral medical devices and accessories. This guidance
provides advice to manufacturers of enteral connectors on mitigation of the risk of enteral
small-bore connector misconnection hazards. As future standards are developed and
recognized for this clinical application, FDA will update this guidance as appropriate to
communicate our recommendations to stakeholders.
