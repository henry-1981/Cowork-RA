LETTER TO INDUSTRY
Dear Powered Wheelchair Manufacturer:

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received reports of
power-driven wheelchairs moving uncontrollably when in the presence
of certain radio frequencies. The purpose of this letter is to
alert you to this problem.

The FDA has performed Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) tests on
several brands of power driven wheelchairs. The tests revealed
that the wheelchairs are susceptible to interference from radio
frequency (RF) and microwave radiation. When the chairs were
exposed to common RF radiation, including frequencies emitted from
police or fire department radios, the chairs moved uncontrollably.
Such EMC-induced brake release and wheelchair movement poses a
potential injury risk to the user.

Our tests were designed to examine the radio frequency interference
(RFI) susceptibility across a wide band of frequencies, from 1 MHz
to 1000 MHz. The chairs tested were found to be susceptible to
interference from many different RF and microwave frequencies in
which the wheels and brakes of these chairs could be activated by
signals occurring over a wide range of frequencies. Consistent
wheel movement could be induced with field strengths of about 10
V/m. These levels can be encountered at a distance of more than
three (3) feet from a medium power hand-held "walkie-talkie" type
radio operating at 450 MHz, such as those used by police and
security guards.

Please provide any information that you have concerning this matter
such as incident reports, complaints, studies, etc.. We would also
appreciate receiving technical information on how this problem, if
observed, has been addressed by your firn.

We ask that you respond to this letter within twenty (20) working
days of receipt. Your response should include the actions you have
taken or plan to take to prevent unintended movement of your
powered wheelchairs as a result of radio oor microwave
interferences.
