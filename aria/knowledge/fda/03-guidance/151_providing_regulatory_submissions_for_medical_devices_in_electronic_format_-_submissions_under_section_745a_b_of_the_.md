Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

Section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), amended by section
207 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) (Pub. L. 115-521), requires that presubmissions and submissions for devices under section 510(k), 513(f)(2)(A), 515(c), 515(d),
515(f), 520(g), 520(m), or 564 of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act,
and any supplements to such pre-submissions or submissions, including appeals of those
submissions, be submitted in electronic format specified by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA or the Agency) beginning on such date as specified by FDA in final guidance. It also
mandates that FDA issue draft guidance not later than October 1, 2019, and a final guidance not
later than 1 year after the close of the public comment period, providing for further standards for
the submission by electronic format, a timetable for establishment of these further standards, and
criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the requirements.2 In addition, in the Medical Device

and Human Services to Congress, FDA committed to developing “electronic submission
templates that will serve as guided submission preparation tools for industry to improve
submission consistency and enhance efficiency in the review process” and “[by] FY [fiscal year]
2020, the Agency will issue a draft guidance document on the use of the electronic submission
templates.” In addition, the Commitment Letter states that “[n]o later than 12 months after the
close of the public comment period, the Agency will issue a final guidance.” This guidance is
intended to satisfy the final guidance documents referenced in section 745A(b)(3) and the
MDUFA IV Commitment Letter.
The Agency has concluded that it is not feasible to describe and implement the electronic
format(s) that would apply to all the submissions covered by section 745A(b)(3) in one guidance
document. Accordingly, this guidance describes how FDA interprets and plans to implement the
requirements of section 745A(b)(3), while individual guidances will be developed to specify the
formats for specific submissions and corresponding timetables for implementation. Specifically,
this guidance discusses (1) the submission types that must be submitted electronically, (2) the
timetable and process for implementing the requirements, and (3) criteria for waivers of and
exemptions from the submissions in electronic format requirements.
Under the process described in this guidance, FDA will periodically issue guidances relating to
the submission in electronic format guidelines for certain submission types to the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER). These submission types are identified in section III.A of this guidance. FDA believes
that issuing this guidance related to submissions solely in an electronic format will harmonize
and streamline the process for implementing the various requirements for submission in
electronic format under section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act. The process described in this
guidance is also intended to provide a meaningful opportunity for the public to comment on
guidances that the Agency intends to issue pursuant to section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act.
In section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, Congress granted explicit statutory authorization to
FDA to specify in guidance the electronic submissions requirement by providing standards,
criteria for waivers and exemptions, and a timetable for such submissions. Accordingly, to the
extent that this document provides such requirements under section 745A(b)(3), indicated by the
use of mandatory words, such as must or required, this document is not subject to the usual
restrictions in section 701(h) of the FD&C Act and FDA’s good guidance practices (GGPs)
regulations, such as the requirement that guidances not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. See 21 CFR 10.115(d).
This document provides guidance on FDA’s interpretation of the statutory requirement for
submission in electronic format; this document also contains guidance on additional submission
types for which submission in electronic format is anticipated to be recommended. Therefore, to
the extent that this guidance describes recommendations that are not “standards,” “timetable,” or
“criteria for waivers” and “exemptions” under section 745A(b)(3), this document does not create
or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public, but
does represent the Agency’s current thinking on this topic. You can use an alternative approach

if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want
to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff listed on the title page of this guidance.
To comply with the GGP regulations and make sure that regulated entities and the public
understand that guidance documents are nonbinding, FDA guidances ordinarily contain standard
language explaining that guidances should be viewed only as recommendations unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. FDA is not including this standard language in this
guidance because it is not an accurate description of all of the effects of this guidance. This
guidance contains both binding and nonbinding provisions. Insofar as this guidance provides
“standards,” “timetable,” or “criteria for waivers” and “exemptions” pursuant to section 745A(b)
of the FD&C Act, it will have binding effect.

II. Background
The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) was enacted on July 9,
2012, amending the FD&C Act by adding section 745A, which addresses submissions in
electronic format. Medical device submissions are addressed in section 745A(b), while section
745A(a) applies to drug and biological product submissions.4 Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act
was amended by FDARA adding section 745A(b)(3).
Section 745A(b)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to specify in guidance that submissions
(described in section III.A below) are required to be submitted solely in electronic format.
Section 745A(b)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act states that FDA shall issue draft guidance providing for
additional standards for submission in electronic format, a timetable for these future standards,
and criteria for waivers and exemptions:
(i)
any further standards for submission by electronic forma required under
subparagraph (A);
(ii)
a timetable for the establishment by the Secretary of such further
standards; and
(iii) criteria for waivers of and exemptions from the requirements of this
subsection.
Section 745A(b)(3)(C) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA will issue final guidance no later
than 1 year following the close of the public comment period for the draft guidance.

III. Submissions Under section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act
As discussed in section II above of this guidance, the requirements of section 745A(b) of the
FD&C Act apply to all submissions listed in section A below. In this section, we discuss our

interpretation of section 745A(b); specifically, its scope, the timetable and process for
implementing the requirements under section 745A(b), and waivers of and exemptions from the
submissions in electronic format requirements.

A. Which submissions must be submitted solely in electronic
format?
In accordance with section 745A(b)(3) of the FD&C Act, submission solely in electronic format
is required for the following submission types:
·
·
·

·
·
·

·

·
·

Premarket notification submissions (510(k)s) under section 510(k);
Evaluation of automatic class III designation request (De Novos) under section 513(f)(2);
Premarket approval applications (PMAs), including Transitional PMAs under section
515(c), 515(d);
· This includes all PMA submission types, including, but not limited to, original
PMAs, panel-track supplements, 180-day supplements, real-time review
supplements, manufacturing site change supplements, 30-day notices, 135-day
supplements, and post-approval study supplements and reports, as well as
amendments involving changes in the correspondent or ownership and requests
for extensions.
Modular PMAs under 515(c)(4);
Product development protocols (PDPs) under section 515(f);
Investigational device exemption (IDE) applications under section 520(g);
· This includes all IDE application types including original IDEs, IDE reports, IDE
supplements and amendments to each of those [see Exemptions below].5
Humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications under section 520(m);
· This includes all HDE application types, including, but not limited to, original
HDEs, 180-day supplements, manufacturing site change supplements, 30-Day
Notices, 135-Day Supplements, and post-approval study supplements and reports,
as well as amendments involving changes in the correspondent or ownership and
requests for extensions.
Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)6 under section 564;
Certain investigational new drug applications (INDs) under section 351 of the Public
Health Service (PHS) Act;
· Applicable only to those INDs required prior to the submission of a biologics
license applications (BLA) for devices that are regulated by CBER as biological

·

products. Such INDs are generally those intended for use in screening donated
blood for transfusion transmissible diseases.
Certain BLAs under section 351 of the PHS Act;
· Applicable only to those devices that are regulated by CBER as biological
products whether or not they also require submission of an IND prior to
submission of a BLA. Such devices are generally those intended for use in
screening donated blood for transfusion transmissible diseases and compatibility
testing. This includes Original Applications, Efficacy Supplements, Prior
Approval Supplements (PAS), Changes Being Effected in 30 Days (CBE-30),
Changes Being Effected (CBE), Labeling Supplements, and Annual Reports; and
Pre-submissions
· While section 745A(b) does not require the submission of Q-submission types
other than pre-submissions to be made in an electronic format, FDA recommends
that all Q-submissions be submitted in electronic format to facilitate efficient
review. Please refer to the Q-submission Guidance7 for additional information.

Electronic format for all subsequent submissions to an original submission, including
amendments (amendments include add-to-files and appeals), supplements, and reports (reports
include annual/periodic and post-approval reports) to the submission types identified above, as
well as amendments to supplements and reports, are also required. Please note, section 745A(b)
of the FD&C Act does not apply to Medical Device Reports submitted under 21 CFR Part 803.
Whether it is a single-page submission (e.g., a change in correspondent) or a multi-volume
submission, the submissions in electronic format requirements apply. A submission that is not in
the electronic format(s) described in the relevant guidance document will not be filed or received,
unless it has been exempted from the electronic submission requirements or the electronic
submission requirements have been waived with respect to that submission.

B. Will FDA issue waivers from the submission solely in
electronic format requirements?
The statute allows FDA to set forth criteria for waivers of the electronic submission
requirements. The criteria for any waivers, if available, will be discussed in the individual
guidances for specific submissions.

C. Which submissions are exempted from the electronic
format requirements?

Section 745A(b)(3)(B) authorizes FDA to establish criteria for exemptions from the submission
solely in electronic format requirements. As a general matter, the following types of IDE
submissions will be exempt from the requirements under section 745A(b)(3):
·

Expanded access compassionate use requests and emergency use reports Adverse event
reports (all types, e.g., serious, malfunctions, etc.)

Although submission in electronic format will not be required for these submission types, as per
this exemption, FDA encourages submission in electronic format of these submissions, as
submission templates become available, to facilitate the review process.
Additional exemptions, if applicable, will be discussed in the individual guidances for specific
submissions.
Although submission in electronic format is not required under section 745A(b) of the FD&C
Act, FDA may also identify and recommend formats for electronic submission for the following:
·
·
·

Master Access Files (MAFs);
513(g) Requests for Information (513(g)s); and
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) categorization requests
(CLIA Record; CR) and CLIA Waiver Applications (CW).8

Submission in electronic format for these submission types would be on a voluntary basis, as
submission templates become available.

D. How will FDA implement specific submissions solely in
electronic format requirements
FDA intends to use the following process to specify the electronic formats for submissions under
section 745A(b):
1. Individual draft guidance documents will be developed to specify the electronic
formats, subject matter, and scope of applicability for submissions under section
745A(b). We intend to release these guidance documents sequentially, allowing for
an eventual phased implementation. The draft guidance documents will be posted on
FDA’s Web site.
2. The Agency will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability
on the FDA Web site of a new or revised submission in electronic format guidance.
The notice will identify a comment period for the draft guidance.

8

For additional information about CR and CW submissions, please see FDA’s guidance “Administrative Procedures
for CLIA Categorization,” at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/administrative-procedures-clia-categorization.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

3. Once the Agency has completed its review of the draft guidance, including
consideration of comments submitted (if any), the Agency will publish a notice in the
Federal Register announcing the availability on the FDA Web site of the final
electronic format guidance. The notice and/or guidance will provide a date on which
the new submissions in electronic format will be required for the submission types
identified in the guidance document. We intend to consider the time period necessary
to transition to use of the electronic format when identifying the date on which
electronic format will be required. FDA will post the final guidance on its Guidance
Web page.
4. Subsequent revisions or updates to specified formats will be announced on the FDA
Web site and published in the Federal Register. The notice and/or guidance will
provide a date on which the revised or updated electronic format for submissions
specified in the guidance will be required.

E. When will submissions solely in electronic format be
required?
As described above, individual guidance documents will be developed to specify the electronic
format for each submission type under 745A(b) or identified in this guidance. The required
format(s) for the specific submissions and corresponding timetable(s) for implementation will be
specified in these individual guidances. Once an individual guidance is finalized and published on
FDA’s Web site, and the timetable for implementation described in that guidance has passed, the
guidance will be considered to have binding effect and the electronic format(s) specified in that
guidance must be used for submissions identified in section III.A above.
