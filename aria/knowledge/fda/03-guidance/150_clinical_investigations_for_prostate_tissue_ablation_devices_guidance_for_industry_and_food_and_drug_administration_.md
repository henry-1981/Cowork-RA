Clinical Investigations for Prostate
Tissue Ablation Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
This guidance document provides recommendations for (1) complying with the clinical testing
special control under 21 CFR 876.4340(b)(8) for premarket notifications (510(k)s) for high
intensity ultrasound systems for prostate tissue ablation, and (2) collecting clinical data to
support marketing submissions for new types of prostatic tissue ablation devices. High intensity
ultrasound systems for prostate tissue ablation transmit high intensity therapeutic ultrasound
energy into the prostate to thermally ablate a defined, targeted volume of tissue. Other prostate
ablation devices achieve the same clinical effect of ablating targeted tissue volumes using
different sources of energy. Regardless of the energy type used for ablation, these devices may
receive marketing authorization for a general indication for ablation of prostatic tissue. This
guidance does not address intended uses for the treatment of a specific disease (e.g., prostate
cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia).
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
In 2015, the Agency granted a De Novo request for a high intensity ultrasound system for
prostate tissue ablation.1 The special control under 21 CFR 876.4340(b)(8) includes a
requirement for clinical testing to document the adverse event profile, provide evidence of

prostatic ablation, and demonstrate that the device performs as intended under anticipated
conditions of use. The purpose of this guidance document is to provide clinical testing
recommendations for submitters seeking a general indication for ablation of prostate tissue (i.e.,
not intended for the treatment of any specific prostate disease), whether by high intensity
ultrasound to ensure compliance with the clinical testing special control or alternative
technologies.
Prior to initiating a clinical investigation, the Agency encourages manufacturers to submit a PreSubmission to obtain detailed feedback on the clinical investigation of prostate tissue ablation
devices. For details on Pre-Submissions, refer to the guidance “Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.”2

III. Scope
The scope of this guidance document is limited to the clinical investigations to support marketing
authorization for general indications of prostate tissue ablation systems, including devices that
are regulated under the product code PLP. This guidance does not address the clinical
investigations of devices that are intended to treat specific prostatic diseases (e.g., prostate cancer
or benign prostatic hyperplasia). Additionally, this document does not address recommendations
or other requirements for non-clinical testing, training, or labeling of prostate tissue ablation
systems.

IV. Clinical Investigation Recommendations
We recommend that you conduct a clinical study to (1) comply with the clinical testing special
control under 21 CFR 876.4340(b)(8) for new high intensity ultrasound systems for prostate
tissue ablation and systems with changes to the ablation energy output characteristics relative to
the 510(k)-cleared versions, or (2) to support marketing submissions for prostate tissue ablation
devices outside the scope of 21 CFR 876.4340.
Generally, we believe prostate tissue ablation devices addressed by this guidance document are
significant risk devices subject to all requirements of the Investigational Device Exemptions
(IDE) regulation, 21 CFR 812, for studies conducted in the United States (US). See the FDA
guidance titled, “Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.”3 In addition
to the requirements of 21 CFR 812, sponsors of such trials of a device conducted in the US must
comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR 56) and informed
consent (21 CFR 50).

When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the United States are submitted to
FDA for prostate tissue ablation devices, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply. 4 21
CFR 812.28 outlines the conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations
conducted outside the US when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more
information, see the FDA guidance “Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device
Applications and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.”5
In some cases, “real-world data” (RWD) may be used to support changes to the ablation energy
output characteristics for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained.
Whether the collection of RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the
particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal
course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information
regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA guidance entitled “Use of Real-World Evidence to
Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.”6
The results of the clinical investigation should be presented in a complete test report, formatted
to include the following elements:
· Executive summary/overview;
· Site/investigator identification;
· Patient demographics and baseline characteristics;
· Treatment data;
· Protocol deviations;
· Safety and effectiveness endpoints analysis (analyzed and raw line data formats);
· Conclusions; and
· Study protocol.
Specific clinical study recommendations for prostate tissue ablation devices are summarized
below. The clinical study recommendations reflect CDRH’s current thinking regarding study
design for prostate tissue ablation devices. However, consistent with least burdensome
principles,7 we recognize that, for any regulatory decision, there exists some degree of
uncertainty around benefits and risks. It is important to acknowledge and appropriately mitigate
uncertainty in benefit-risk determinations supporting FDA premarket decisions.8 As such, the

support a premarket submission, including IDEs, premarket approval applications (PMAs), and 510(k)s.

acceptable level of uncertainty in benefit-risk determinations to support premarket decisions is
flexible in some cases, and is tailored to the type and intended use of the device and the type of
decision we are making. Therefore, FDA will consider alternatives to the study design when the
proposed alternatives are supported by an adequate scientific rationale.

A. Purpose/Objective
The objective of the clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
device for its intended use – as a general surgical tool for the ablation of prostate tissue. FDA
notes that the endpoints in this clinical investigation should address safety by determining
whether the device does not ablate or damage tissue outside of the targeted volume as reflected
in the adverse event profile, and effectiveness by determining whether the device ablates tissue
within the targeted volume.

B. Study Design and Sample Size
FDA recommends that the clinical evidence to support a marketing submission consist of either
an internally- or externally-controlled trial. While a benefit of an internally-controlled trial is the
collection of robust data on the subject and comparator devices from the same patient population
that was followed in the same manner, a benefit of an externally-controlled trial is the reduced
burden of enrolling and following only a single patient cohort (study arm) to be compared to the
clinical results of an existing prostate tissue ablation device.
To adequately estimate the adverse event profile with clinically meaningful precision, including
the incidence of infrequent device- or procedure-related complications, FDA recommends that
the dataset include a minimum of 100 patients treated with the subject device and who were
clinically followed as recommended below in Sections IV.C, G, and H, respectively.
Indirect measures of ablation effectiveness, such as prostate biopsy, prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels, and prostate volume, should be analyzed in the same patient population of at least
100 patients that was followed for safety. Alternatively, if ablation effectiveness is instead
supported by “treat and resect” data (i.e., whole-mount histopathology analysis of the extent and
position of ablation, obtained from patients undergoing prostate tissue ablation prior to scheduled
radical prostatectomy) collected from a separate study cohort, the sample size of this
effectiveness population should be scientifically justified. While studies with separate safety and
“treat and resect” cohorts will, by design, enroll a greater total number of subjects than studies in
which both safety and indirect measures of ablation effectiveness are evaluated in the same

cohort, a benefit of the former approach is avoiding the burden of collecting post-ablation biopsy
data, PSA levels, and imaging.

C. Study Duration and Follow-up Schedule
FDA recommends that the minimum duration of scheduled follow-up for studies to support a
marketing submission is one year. This recommended minimum follow-up duration is based on
the delayed onset or presentation of known probable adverse events (e.g., urethral stricture, rectal
fistula, and osteomyelitis pubis), as well as the time course for potential resolution of other
anticipated complications (e.g., erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence). The protocol should
prospectively specify collection of adverse event information at regular intervals, with specific
assessment of known probable device- and procedure-related adverse events.
Effectiveness measures should be collected post-ablation at time frames that are scientifically
justified for the specific endpoint measure(s) being collected. For example, prostate biopsy, PSA
levels, and prostate volume should be analyzed one year post-ablation, while “treat and resect”
data may be collected and analyzed less than one month post-ablation. The study duration and
timing of follow-up for all endpoints should be clinically justified, and the timing of assessments
should be uniform within the study.

D. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
The study should enroll men for whom prostate tissue ablation is clinically warranted. To
minimize confounding in the review of the clinical data, patient and treatment characteristics
should be uniform with respect to:
· The underlying clinical condition for the prostate ablation (i.e., benign versus malignant
disease);
· The prostate treatment history prior to the ablation procedure (e.g., “treatment naïve,”
post-external beam radiotherapy, post-brachytherapy, post-cryotherapy);
· The prescribed extent of ablation (e.g., whole gland ablation, hemiablation, focal
ablation);
· Anatomical limitations associated with the specific technological characteristics of the
ablation device (e.g., excluding subjects with prostate volumes above a certain size); and
· General clinical safety precautions (e.g., excluding subjects with uncontrolled bleeding
disorders or active urinary tract infection).

E. Patient Demographics
Patient demographic information should be reported using descriptive statistics. Refer to the
FDA guidance “Evaluation and Reporting of Age-, Race-, and Ethnicity-Specific Data in
Medical Device Clinical Studies”9 for details on reporting this demographic information. This
information should include, but is not limited to, the following:

Imaging findings (e.g., suspicious regions on multi-parametric MRI); and
Related medical history and physical exam details (including baseline erectile function
and urinary continence status).

F. Treatment Parameters/Protocol (including post-operative
regimen)
The protocol for the clinical study should pre-specify, and the complete test report should
describe, the following treatment parameters and related information:
· Extent of ablation (e.g., whole gland ablation, hemiablation, focal ablation);
· Prostate tissue volume targeted for ablation;
· Concurrent interventions (e.g., transurethral resection of the prostate, bladder neck
incision);
· Ablation time and parameters;
· Malfunctions or interruptions;
· Anesthesia or sedation used;
· Hospitalizations; and
· Catheterizations.

G. Safety Endpoints and Data Analysis
To support a general indication for ablation of prostate tissue (i.e., not intended for the treatment
of any specific prostate disease), a clinical investigation should address safety by demonstrating
that the device does not ablate or damage tissue outside of the targeted volume. Safety endpoints
should consist of prospectively collected adverse events, with emphasis on key safety issues that
may reflect damage to the surrounding, non-target tissues. These key safety issues include, but
are not limited to, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, voiding symptoms or dysfunction,
urethral stricture, rectal fistula, and osteomyelitis pubis.
To ensure robust collection of safety information, adverse events should be:
· Prospectively collected without regard to device-relatedness;
· Defined using pre-specified, standardized criteria (such as when reporting erectile
dysfunction);

Graded for severity according to a standard adverse event grading system (e.g., Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events10);
Categorized according to whether they meet the established serious adverse event
definitions;11
Assessed for resolution status; and
Adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.12

H. Effectiveness Endpoints and Data Analysis
To support a general indication for ablation of prostate tissue (i.e., not intended for the treatment
of any specific prostate disease), a clinical investigation should address effectiveness by
demonstrating that the device ablates tissue within the targeted volume. Effectiveness endpoints
may be either direct measurements of the extent of ablation (e.g., histopathology data from a
“treat and resect” study cohort), or alternatively, indirect measurements using a composite of the
following surrogate measures of prostate tissue ablation:
· Histological findings from prostate biopsies consisting of 12-core systematic transrectal
biopsy of the entire gland, with heightened sampling in the region that was targeted for
ablation (using image-guided targeting to direct the biopsy);
· Ultrasound or MRI follow-up of prostate volume or non-perfused volume; and
· PSA levels.
FDA believes that either effectiveness endpoint (i.e., the single “treat and resect” histopathology
endpoint, or the three-part composite endpoint of histological findings from prostate biopsies,
prostate volumes from imaging, and PSA levels) is equally valid. Regardless of the endpoint
used, the data should collectively provide evidence of the extent to which the intended region of
tissue is ablated to support marketing authorization.
FDA recommends that you report the applicable effectiveness endpoints of your study as
follows:
· Biopsy results: Report the percentage of patients who had a negative biopsy postablation. For this endpoint, only biopsy cores taken within the region targeted for ablation
should be included in the negative biopsy rate analysis, and patients with missing biopsy
information post-ablation should be imputed as “positive;”
o The following biopsy information should be reported in the raw line data listing:
date of biopsy, total number of cores taken, location of each core with respect to
the region targeted for ablation (i.e., “within” or “outside” the targeted region),
number of positive cores, and the Gleason scores and sum of each positive core;
· Prostate volume results:

o Report the percent decrease in total prostate volume (from baseline), as
determined by pre- and post-ablation imaging (e.g., ultrasound, MRI). For this
endpoint, men without both pre- and post-ablation measurements should be
imputed as having a zero change in volume; or
o Compare the volume of non-perfused prostate tissue, as determined by postablation imaging (e.g., ultrasound, MRI), to the volume targeted for ablation. For
this endpoint, missing non-perfused volume measurements should be imputed
conservatively using statistically valid methods;
PSA levels: Report the overall percent reduction in PSA levels from baseline.
Additionally, studies involving whole-gland ablation should report the percentage of
patients achieving a pre-specified post-ablation PSA nadir (i.e., the lowest PSA level
measured post-ablation). For this endpoint, missing PSA data should be imputed
conservatively using statistically valid methods; and
“Treat and resect” histopathology results: Report the extent/percent volume of viable
tissue within the targeted region.

If effectiveness is assessed in a “treat and resect” study, it is impossible to determine whether
subsequent adverse events in these patients are due to the ablation procedure or the subsequent
radical prostatectomy. For this reason, safety should be assessed in a separate cohort of patients
who are similarly treated with the ablation device and prospectively followed for one year postablation. The safety assessment in this cohort should follow the recommendations in Sections
IV.B, C, and G above. In this scenario, you should demonstrate that the “treat and resect” and
safety cohorts are similar with respect to patient demographics, disease characteristics, prostate
treatment history, and extent of ablation (e.g., whole gland ablation, hemiablation, focal
ablation).

I. Statistical Analysis Considerations
The safety and effectiveness endpoints should be analyzed using an intent-to-treat (ITT)
approach. The extent of missing data should be reported and justified.
For each effectiveness endpoint, means and 95% confidence intervals should be reported in your
complete test report. The safety and effectiveness endpoints should be descriptively compared to
those reported for an existing prostate ablation device (either an internal or external control),
with the goal of clinically demonstrating that the subject prostate ablation device has an
equivalent or better benefit-risk profile.
