Acceptance Review for De Novo
Classification Requests
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

On October 5, 2021, FDA issued a final rule on the De Novo Classification Process.1 This final
rule will add new regulations at 21 CFR Part 860, Subpart D--De Novo Classification that
describe the procedures and criteria FDA will use in assessing whether a request for an
evaluation of automatic class III designation (De Novo classification request or De Novo
request) contains the information necessary to permit a substantive review.2 This guidance
provides recommendations with further detail regarding the types of information FDA believes
are necessary to conduct a substantive review for a De Novo request, as well as
recommendations regarding the acceptance review process.
Focusing the Agency’s review resources on complete De Novo requests will provide a more
efficient approach to ensuring that safe and effective medical devices reach patients as quickly as
possible. Moreover, with the enactment of the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017
(MDUFA IV),3 FDA agreed to performance goals based on the timeliness of reviews, as well as
to issue guidance that includes a submission checklist to facilitate a more efficient and timely
review process (see Section II.E. of the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter).4 Acceptance review is
important in both encouraging incoming quality applications from De Novo requesters and
allowing the Agency to appropriately concentrate resources on complete applications.

The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind
the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
The information presented in this document is intended to provide De Novo requesters with
additional transparency regarding the types of information FDA believes are necessary to
conduct a substantive review for a De Novo request as part of the acceptance review process
described in 21 CFR 860.230. To enhance consistency, the document provides FDA staff with a
clear, consistent approach to making “Accept” or “Refuse to Accept” (RTA) decisions on De
Novo requests.
The acceptance review requirements do not alter the process by which devices are classified in a
De Novo request once accepted for substantive review; however, they do alter the start of the
FDA review clock for purposes of MDUFA performance goals for De Novo requests that are not
accepted for review. Further, FDA’s decision to accept a De Novo request does not imply that
the information provided in the De Novo request, including performance data, demonstrates that
general controls, or general and special controls, are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness of your device or assure granting of the De Novo request.
As mentioned above, the purpose of this guidance is to explain the procedures and criteria FDA
intends to use to make a threshold determination that the De Novo request contains the
information necessary to permit a substantive review. This document includes an Acceptance
Checklist (Appendix A. Acceptance Checklist for De Novo Classification Requests), as
explained in further detail below.
The effective date of the final rule rule is 90 days after the publication of the rule in the Federal
Register to provide additional time for requesters to make any changes necessary, for example, to
their internal operating procedures and documents, in preparation for submission. For a De Novo
request received by FDA before the effective date of the final rule,5 FDA staff should not use the
revised checklist in this guidance when conducting acceptance reviews. Until the effective date
of the final rule, FDA staff should use the version of this guidance issued September 9, 2019.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA staff conduct acceptance reviews of De Novo requests based on objective criteria using the
Acceptance Checklist (see Appendix A. Acceptance Checklist for De Novo Classification
Requests) to ensure that the De Novo request contains the information necessary to permit a
substantive review. The De Novo request regulations identify criteria that, if not met, may serve
as the basis for FDA refusing to accept a De Novo request (21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)). For the De
Novo request to be accepted, all items identified as elements of a complete De Novo request
(“RTA items”) in the Acceptance Checklist should be present or a rationale should be provided
for those elements determined by the requester to be not applicable. To aid in the acceptance
review, it is recommended that requesters complete and submit Acceptance Checklists with their
De Novo requests that identify the location of supporting information for each acceptance
element.
The acceptance review occurs prior to the substantive review and should be conducted and
completed within 15 calendar days of FDA receiving the De Novo request. An acceptance
review will only begin for De Novo requests for which the applicable user fee has been paid and
a valid eCopy has been received.6
The acceptance review will be conducted on original De Novo requests and responses to
acceptance review communications but not supplements or amendments submitted in response to
requests for additional information after a De Novo request has been accepted for a substantive
review. FDA staff should assess whether the De Novo request should be accepted by first
answering the preliminary questions below and then verifying that the De Novo request contains
all the information identified as RTA items in the Acceptance Checklist.
The purpose of the acceptance review is to assess whether a De Novo request contains the
information necessary for FDA to conduct a substantive review (see 21 CFR 860.230(a)).
Therefore, the De Novo request generally should not be accepted and should receive an RTA
designation if one or more of the items noted as RTA items in the Acceptance Checklist are not
present and no explanation is provided for the omission(s). However, during the RTA review,
FDA staff has discretion to determine whether missing checklist items are needed to ensure that
the De Novo request contains the information necessary to permit a substantive review. FDA
staff also has discretion to request missing checklist items interactively from requesters during
the RTA review. Interaction during the RTA reviews is dependent on FDA staff’s determination
that outstanding issues are appropriate for interactive review and that adequate time is available
for the requester to provide supporting information and for FDA staff to assess responses.
If FDA refuses to accept a De Novo request, FDA will notify the requester of the reasons for the
refusal and identify the deficiencies in the De Novo request that prevent accepting (21 CFR
860.230(c)(2)). If one or more items noted as RTA items on the Acceptance Checklist are not

also provided in the FDA guidance, “FDA and Industry Actions on De Novo Classification Requests: Effect on

present and FDA staff conducting the acceptance review determine that the submission should be
refused, FDA staff should obtain management concurrence and notify the designated De Novo
contact person electronically7 that the De Novo request has not been accepted. FDA staff will
also provide the requester with a copy of the completed checklist indicating which item(s) are the
basis for the RTA designation.
The De Novo requester may respond to the RTA notification by providing the missing
information identified in the Acceptance Checklist. When providing the missing information, the
De Novo requester must submit this information to the respective Center’s Document Control
Center (DCC)8 to be included in the file under the originally assigned De Novo request reference
number (21 CFR 860.210(a)(1) and 860.230(c)(3)). A new De Novo request and new user fee are
not necessary, and it is not necessary to resend the entire De Novo request, unless FDA notes
otherwise (e.g., because the De Novo request is missing the majority of the items on the
checklist). It is sufficient to submit and address only the information requested in the RTA
notification. If a complete response to the RTA notification is not received within 180 days of
the date of RTA notification, FDA will consider the De Novo request to be withdrawn and the
De Novo request will be closed in the system (21 CFR 860.250(a)(2)).
Upon receipt of newly submitted information in response to an RTA notification, FDA staff
should conduct the acceptance review again, following the same procedure, within 15 calendar
days of receipt of the new information. This acceptance review will assess whether the new
information makes the De Novo request complete according to the checklist criteria for
completeness. If the De Novo request is still found to be incomplete, FDA staff should notify the
contact person and provide a copy of the new checklist indicating the missing item(s).
When a De Novo request is accepted, FDA will notify the requester (21 CFR 860.230(a)). FDA
staff should electronically notify the De Novo request contact person that the De Novo request
has been accepted and begin a substantive review of the De Novo request. If FDA does not
complete the acceptance review within the acceptance review period (i.e., within 15 calendar
days of receipt), FDA will accept the De Novo request for review and will notify the requester
(21 CFR 860.230(b)). In this situation, the De Novo requester should be electronically notified
that the acceptance review was not completed and the De Novo request is under substantive
review.9 FDA may request any information that may have resulted in an RTA designation during
the substantive review. Once a De Novo request has been accepted, FDA may ask for relevant

For devices regulated by the CDRH, the information must be sent to the current address displayed on the website
https://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress. For devices regulated by the CBER, the information must be sent to
the current address displayed on the website https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/center-biologics-evaluation-andresearch-cber/regulatory-submissions-electronic-and-paper.

In the case of a government closure during the 15-day acceptance review period, the review period may be
extended by a comparable number of business days that the FDA buildings are closed. If the submitter receives an
automated notice that the acceptance review was not completed because the screening period has exceeded 15 days,
FDA may send a correction notice to the De Novo requester.

information during the substantive review that may have been unintentionally overlooked during
the acceptance review.

B.

FDA Review Clock

The FDA review clock start date is the DCC receipt date of the most recent De Novo request or
additional information that resulted in an acceptance designation for the De Novo request (21
CFR 860.230(b) and 21 CFR 860.230(c)(3)). As stated above, an acceptance review will only
begin for De Novo requests for which the applicable user fee has been paid and a valid eCopy
has been received. Thus, the FDA review clock does not start when a De Novo request is placed
on eCopy or User Fee hold or is designated RTA.
De Novo requests and additional information submitted in response to an RTA designation are
received by the respective Center’s DCC. If the De Novo request is accepted for substantive
review on the first acceptance review, the FDA review clock start date is the DCC receipt date of
the De Novo request. However, if the De Novo request is designated RTA, the FDA review
clock start date will be the DCC receipt date of the De Novo request including the additional
information that results in an acceptance designation (even if FDA later requests information that
should have been requested during acceptance review). In the event the acceptance review was
not completed within 15 calendar days, the De Novo request will be considered to be under
substantive review, and the FDA review clock start date will be the DCC receipt date of the most
recently received information that was the subject of the acceptance review for the De Novo
request. Once the De Novo request is under substantive review, the calendar days used to
conduct the acceptance review (i.e., up to 15 days) are included within the calendar days to reach
a final decision for the De Novo request.

C.

Notification of Acceptance Review Result

The De Novo requester should receive an electronic notification of the acceptance review result
within 15 calendar days of DCC receipt (i.e., that the De Novo request has been accepted for
substantive review, that the De Novo request is not accepted for review (RTA), or that the De
Novo request is now under substantive review because the acceptance review was not
completed). This notification will also serve to identify the FDA lead reviewer10 assigned to the
De Novo request. The notification of either the acceptance or RTA designation will be made
only with supervisory concurrence of the lead reviewer’s acceptance review determination. The
notification of acceptance or RTA designation may occur on any day prior to the 15th calendar
day of DCC receipt. However, in the event the acceptance review was not completed within 15
calendar days, a notification that an RTA review was not completed will be sent on the 16th day.
The notification will be sent only to the designated contact person identified in the De Novo
request. In the case of an RTA designation, the notification should be accompanied by the
completed Acceptance Checklist indicating the missing elements that resulted in the RTA
designation. The completed checklists are considered part of the De Novo request’s
administrative file and are not posted publicly when FDA makes the RTA designation.
10

In the case of De Novo requests submitted to CBER, whenever the term “lead reviewer” is used in this guidance,
the equivalent CBER contact person is the regulatory project manager (RPM).

Therefore, it is imperative that the De Novo request identify complete contact information,
including the email address to which the notification should be sent as required under 21 CFR
860.220(a)(2).11

IV. Refuse to Accept Principles
In order to use this guidance appropriately, FDA staff should review the following basic
principles regarding FDA’s review policies and procedures.
Acceptance should not be based on a substantive review of the information provided in the
De Novo request.
It is important to make the distinction between the acceptance review and the substantive review.
The acceptance review is conducted to make a threshold determination of whether the De Novo
request contains information necessary, as identified in 21 CFR 860.220, 21 CFR 860.230, and
the Acceptance Checklist, to permit a substantive review. In assessing whether a De Novo
request should be accepted, submitted information is not evaluated for adequacy to support
granting the De Novo request. The Acceptance Checklist is a tool to ensure that the De Novo
request contains the necessary information to conduct a substantive review (i.e., FDA should not
refuse to accept a De Novo request if information is present but inadequate to support granting
the De Novo request). The evaluation of the quality of the content occurs within the substantive
review once the De Novo request has been accepted.
FDA staff should determine whether the requester provided a justification for any
alternative approach.
The De Novo requester may provide a rationale for why any criteria in the checklist are not
applicable to the device. It is FDA’s expectation that each item in the Acceptance Checklist will
be addressed either by including the requested information or providing a rationale for why it is
not applicable or why there is a deviation.
FDA will not consider a given criterion in the checklist to be “present” if the De Novo request
fails to include either the information identified or a rationale for omission or deviation. If a
justification to omit certain information or for taking an alternative approach is provided, FDA
will consider the adequacy of that justification or alternative approach during substantive review
of the De Novo request. See Section VI below for examples and further explanation.

V.

The Checklist – Preliminary Questions

Within 15 calendar days of receipt of the De Novo request, FDA staff should answer the
preliminary questions below, which are included on the first page of the Acceptance Checklist.
The preliminary questions are intended to be answered by the lead reviewer as an initial

11

CBER will accommodate the use of faxes; submitters may also wish to provide a fax number.

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

screening of the De Novo request. Depending upon the answers to these preliminary questions,
the remainder of the acceptance review may or may not be necessary.
If the responses to the preliminary questions and subsequent consultation with the Center
personnel identified below indicate that the De Novo acceptance review should not continue12
the CDRH lead reviewer or the CBER regulatory project manager (RPM) should promptly:
·

inform the De Novo review team (including consulting reviewers); and

·

notify the requester using proper administrative procedures.

The preliminary questions are:
1. Is the product a device (per section 201(h) of the FD&C Act) or a combination product
(per 21 CFR 3.2(e)) with a device constituent part subject to review in a De Novo
request?
If the product does not appear to meet the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the
FD&C Act, or does not appear to be a combination product with a device constituent part, then
the De Novo lead reviewer should consult with the CDRH Product Jurisdiction Officer or the
CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the appropriate action and inform management.
If FDA staff determines that the product does not appear to be a device or a combination product
with a device constituent part, the De Novo review team should stop the review and notify the
requester.
2. Is the De Novo request with the appropriate Center?
If the De Novo request is for a single-entity device and appears to be subject to review in a
Center different from the one to which it was submitted, or if it is for a combination product with
a device constituent part and it appears that a Center different from the one to which it was
submitted has the lead, the De Novo request lead reviewer should consult with the CDRH
Product Jurisdiction Officer or the CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the
appropriate action and inform management. If the De Novo request is submitted to CDRH and
CDRH staff determines that the De Novo request is not subject to CDRH review, or the De Novo
request is submitted to CBER and CBER staff determines that the De Novo request is not subject
to CBER review, the De Novo request review team should stop the review and notify the
requester.

12

FDA will not process a De Novo request unless it meets the following requirements: (a) the submission must be
sent with the user fee required by section 738 of FD&C Act and (b) a valid eCopy is provided. See sections
738(a)(2)(A)(xi) and 738(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act, and the FDA guidance, “eCopy
Program for Medical Device Submissions,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fdaguidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-device-submissions. Because any De Novo request not meeting these
two requirements will not be processed by the CDRH DCC or the CBER RPM, these requirements are not included
in the checklist.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

3. If a Request for Designation (RFD) was submitted for the device or combination
product with a device constituent part and assigned to your Center, identify the RFD #
and confirm the following:
· Is the device or combination product the same (e.g., design, formulation) as that
presented in the RFD submission?
· Are the indications for use for the device or combination product identified in the
De Novo request the same as those identified in the RFD submission?
An RFD determination is specific to the device or combination product and indications for use
for the device or combination product described in the RFD submission. If the device or
combination product has been modified or the indications for use have been modified since the
RFD, the RFD determination may no longer be applicable and jurisdiction may need to be
reevaluated by the Office of Combination Products (OCP). The De Novo lead reviewer should
consult with the CDRH Product Jurisdiction Officer or the CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to
determine the appropriate action and inform management.
4. Is the De Novo request for a combination product that contains as a constituent part a
drug that has the same active moiety as an approved drug with exclusivity as described
in section 503(g)(5)(C)(ii)-(v) of the FD&C Act?
If the De Novo request is for a combination product and contains as a constituent a drug that has
the same active moiety as an approved drug with exclusivity as described in section
503(g)(5)(C)(ii)-(v) of the FD&C Act, the lead reviewer should contact the CDRH Product
Jurisdiction Officer or CBER Product Jurisdiction Officer to determine the appropriate action
and inform management.
5. Is this device type eligible on its face for De Novo classification?
FDA staff should determine whether the subject device is a device type for which De Novo
classification is known to be an inappropriate regulatory approach. If the device does not appear
to be eligible for De Novo classification (e.g., a predicate device exists, an existing classification
regulation exists for the same device type, or an approved PMA(s) exists for the same device
type), FDA staff should make this determination during the acceptance review. This question is
not intended to identify De Novo requests for which a substantive review is required in order to
determine if De Novo classification is an inappropriate approach (e.g., FDA staff need to
conduct a substantive review of information in the request to research and analyze De Novo
eligibility or to determine if special controls can mitigate the identified risks to health). If FDA
determines the device is ineligible during the acceptance review, FDA considers this to be a basis
for refusing to accept the submission (see section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 CFR 860.200,
21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(ii), and 83 FR 63128).
We do not anticipate that De Novo requests for the same device type from different requesters
will frequently be under review concurrently. If a De Novo request for the same device from a
different requester is currently under review at the time another De Novo request for the same
device type is submitted to the Agency, this fact alone would not result in a “Refuse to Accept”
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

decision. Please see “De Novo Classification Process (Evaluation of Automatic Class III
Designation)”13 for additional information regarding this situation.
6. Is the requester subject to the Application Integrity Policy (AIP)?14
The lead reviewer should refer to the AIP list.15 If the requester is on the list, the reviewer should
consult the CDRH OPEQ: Office of Product Evaluation and Quality/OCEA: Office of Clinical
Evidence and Analysis/DCEA1: Division of Clinical Science and Quality or CBER Office of
Compliance and Biologics Quality/Division of Inspections and Surveillance/Bioresearch
Monitoring Branch (OCBQ/DIS/BMB) to determine the appropriate action.

VI. The Checklist – Acceptance Review
A.

Elements of a Complete De Novo Request (RTA Items)

The objective criteria in the Acceptance Checklist outline those elements that are essential to
FDA’s substantive review of the De Novo request and classification of the subject device under
section 513(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, and 21 CFR Part 860, Subpart D
or required under other statutory provisions or regulations.

B.

Applying the Checklist of RTA Items

Using the Acceptance Checklist, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the De Novo request, FDA
staff should answer each question for the elements identified as RTA items. For those items that
have an option of “yes,” “no,” or “not applicable” (N/A) as an answer, the item should receive an
answer of “yes” or “N/A” for the De Novo request to be accepted for substantive review. For any
element that offers more than one option to be accepted for substantive review, FDA staff should
indicate whether the De Novo request has addressed one of the options for acceptance.

C.

Elements Marked as “Not Applicable” (N/A)

The Acceptance Checklist is intended to contain elements necessary for FDA’s substantive
review of the wide range of medical devices that are appropriate for De Novo classification. All
such criteria may not be pertinent to a particular device. FDA staff should select “N/A” for those
elements that do not apply to the subject device. For example, the requirements for financial
certification and disclosure statements (21 CFR 860.220(a)(15)(iii)(E)) only apply to De Novo

13

https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/de-novo-classification-processevaluation-automatic-class-iii-designation
14
When data in a pending submission have been called into question by certain wrongful acts (fraud, untrue
statements of material facts, bribery, or illegal gratuities), FDA intends to defer substantive scientific review of such
data until completion of a validity assessment and questions regarding reliability of the data are resolved. (See FDA
Guide 7150.09 Compliance Policy Guide, Chapter 50 – General Policy – Subject: Fraud, Untrue Statements of
Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities, 56 FR 46191.)

requests with clinical data. If the De Novo request contains no clinical data, FDA staff should
select “N/A.”

D.

Adequacy of Information

In order to make the checklist criteria objective, for each RTA item, FDA should consider only
the presence or omission of the element or a rationale for the omission of the element or use of
an alternative approach during acceptance review. It is likely that FDA staff will encounter
scenarios where information is provided but is incomplete or inadequate. In such instances, FDA
staff should answer the question for the respective item as “yes” but may communicate the
inadequacy or request additional information during the substantive review. For example, the
requester may have provided information for performance testing; however, during the
acceptance review, the reviewer may note that the results of a particular test may not be
sufficient to determine if the test adequately mitigates a risk to health, and additional justification
would be needed. The performance testing criterion would be marked “yes” in the checklist, and
the full assessment of the results and communication to the requester that additional justification
is needed should occur during the substantive review.

E.

Elements Marked “No”

For any acceptance criterion designated as “no,” FDA intends to provide an explanation to
describe the missing element(s), if needed. This explanation is particularly important for a
criterion in which it may not be immediately apparent to the requester what necessary
information, specifically, is not present. FDA staff should include a list or statement of the
additional information that is necessary to meet the acceptance criteria. This list or statement can
be communicated in the “comment” section on the checklist beside each specific criterion.

F.

Combination Product Administrative Items

The 21st Century Cures Act, which amended section 503(g) of the FD&C Act, requires
requesters seeking action on a combination product to identify the product as such (section
503(g)(8)(C)(v) of the FD&C Act). Additionally, per the amended section 503(g)(5), requests for
device-led, device-drug combination products must include the patent certification or statement
as described in section 505(b)(2) and provide notice as described in section 505(b)(3) if the
combination product contains as a constituent part an approved drug(see section 503(g)(5)(A) of
the FD&C Act). De Novo requesters of products that are not combination products, as defined in
21 CFR 3.2(e), should mark “N/A” and omit this section pertaining to combination products.

G. De Novo Requesters of Combination Products That Do
Not Contain as a Constituent Part an Approved Drug
If the combination products do not include as a constituent part an approved drug as defined in
section 503(g)(5)(B), requesters of device-led, device-drug combination products should mark
“N/A” for element B.8.b.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

H. De Novo Requesters of Combination Products That
Contain as a Constituent Part an Approved Drug
De Novo requesters of combination products containing as a constituent part an approved drug
should address question B.8 by including patent information. For each relevant patent, the
requester should include certification to one of the following certifications:
i.
ii.
iii.
iv.

That such patent information has not been filed (section 505(b)(2)(A)(i)).
That such patent has expired (section 505(b)(2)(A)(ii)).
The date on which the patent will expire (section 505(b)(2)(A)(iii)).
That such patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of
the drug constituent part for which this submission is made (section
505(b)(2)(A)(iv)).

However, for a method of use patent which does not claim a use for which the requester is
seeking approval, the requester should include a statement per section 505(b)(2)(B) that the
method of use patent does not claim such a use.
Requesters including a certification under paragraph (iv) (section 505(b)(2)(A)(iv)) should also
certify that they will provide notice to the owner of the patent(s) and the holder of the approved
application that lists the patent(s) that is/are being challenged. The process for giving notice is
provided in section 505(b)(3) of the FD&C Act. De Novo requesters should submit to FDA
documentation of the date of receipt of notice by the holder of the approved application and the
owner of the patent(s).

I.
Is there an open or pending premarket submission or
reclassification petition for the same device with the same
indications for use?
If the De Novo requester has an open or pending premarket submission (510(k), PMA, HDE),16
or reclassification petition for the same device with the same indications for use, the De Novo
request should receive an RTA designation (21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(i)), and the review team
should work with the De Novo requester to clarify the appropriate regulatory pathway and
premarket submission type. The review team should also consult management and other Center
resources to determine which premarket review pathway applies to the device and the
appropriate processes for addressing the situation. FDA staff should also consult management
and other Center resources if a 510(k), PMA, HDE,or reclassification petition has been submitted
for the same device type by different applicants.

16

FDA does not intend to refuse a De Novo request on the basis that there are open or pending Investigational
Device Exemptions (IDEs) or Q-Submissions for the device.

J.

De Novo Request is for a Single Device Type

It may be appropriate for FDA to review multiple devices in a single marketing submission
under certain circumstances.17 For example, it may be appropriate for multiple sizes of a device
to be reviewed together in a De Novo request and classified together as the same type of device
under a single regulation. However, if a De Novo requester is instead proposing that multiple
device types be classified under a single De Novo request (e.g., a submission for a device with
multiple proposed indications or technologies that each have different benefit-risk considerations
and supporting datasets would likely constitute more than one device type), the De Novo request
should receive an RTA designation (see 21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(iv)) and the review team should
work with the De Novo requester to clarify which device type should be the subject of the De
Novo request. This helps ensure efficient use of FDA resources by confining the scientific and
regulatory issues in a submission to a single classification decision so that FDA can render a
timely decision and assess user fees appropriately.

K. Prior Submission(s) Relevant to the De Novo Request
Under Review
For certain De Novo requests, the requester may have previously provided other submissions for
the same device for which FDA provided feedback related to the data or information needed to
support De Novo classification (e.g., a Pre-Submission request, Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE), prior Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) determination, or prior 510(k) or De
Novo that was deleted or withdrawn). These prior submissions must be identified in the De Novo
request or the request must include a statement that there have been no prior submissions (21
CFR 860.220(a)(3)). In some cases, the requester may also have received a prior decline order
for the same device, or FDA may have identified deficiencies in another previous submission for
the same device that is the subject of the De Novo request. If the requester has not responded to,
or has failed to provide a rationale for not responding to, such deficiencies, FDA may refuse to
accept the De Novo request (21 CFR 860.230(c)(1)(v)), and the Acceptance Checklist includes a
corresponding criterion. FDA suggests designating a separate section of the De Novo request that
identifies any prior submission(s) by number, includes a copy of or cross-reference to prior FDA
feedback (e.g., letter or meeting minutes), and states how or where in the De Novo request this
prior feedback was addressed, including feedback related to any prior related De Novo requests.
Note that the adequacy of how the feedback was addressed should be assessed during the
substantive review.
To address the requirement under 21 CFR 860.220(a)(3) regarding the existence of prior
submissions and the corresponding checklist criterion, FDA recommends that requesters provide
this information in Section F of the CDRH Premarket Review Submission Cover Sheet,

indicating the submission is a De Novo request.18 Requesters should list prior submissions in
Section F of this form or state that there were no prior submissions to address this criterion.
Please be advised that leaving this section of the form blank will not be considered a statement
that there were no prior submissions. This information may also be included in the cover letter
(i.e., either as a statement that there were no prior submissions for the device, or a listing of the
number(s) of the prior submission(s)).
