TO: . ALL LASER PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF
LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Exemption of Certain Military Laser Products from the FDA
Radiation Safety Performance Standard for Laser Products.

The purpose of this memorandum is to notify all laser product manufac-
turers of an exemption granted for all laser products which are manu-
factured after August 2, 1976, and used exclusively by DOD agencies, and
which are designed for actual combat or combat training operations or
are classified in the interest of national defense (Reference FDA Docket
No. 76P-0335). The exemption does not apply to laser products intended
primarily for use in indoor classroom training and demonstration,
industrial operations, and scientific investigations; and medical laser
products. The exemption is from the FDA performance standard for laser
products in 21 CFR Part 1040.10 and 1040.11 and the associated reporting
and record keeping requirements of 21 CFR Part 1002, except for paragraph
1002.20 relating to accidental radiation occurrences.

Mr. Sherwin Gardner, Acting Commissioner of Foods and Drugs, announced
the exemption in a letter dated July 29, 1976, to Mr. George Marienthal,
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense. The exemption was granted on the
grounds that the special military requirements for such devices preclude
full compliance with the FDA performance standard. However, DOD procure
ment specifications will prescribe compliance with the FDA standard to
the extent practicable and will be supplemented with safety controls and
procedures utilized by DOD. All exempted products are also to be clearly
identified either by the label set forth below, or by other approved
means:

“CAUTION

This electronic product has been exempted from FDA radiation safety
performance standards prescribed in the Code of Federal Regulations,
Title 21, Chapter I, Subchapter J, pursuant to Exemption No. 76EL~
O1DOD issued on July 26, 1976. This product should not be used
without adequate protective devices or procedures.”

In addition, DOD will restrict surplus disposal of these devices and
report annually to FDA on the types of devices procured under the
exemption, their manufacturers, and means of identification if different

than the above label.

The exemption may be withdrawn or amended if any of the terms of the
agreement between the Food and Drug Administration and Department of
Defense are not adhered to, or if other information becomes available
that indicates that the public health and safety are not adequately
protected from electronic product radiation emitted by products exempted
pursuant to this exemption.

Correspondence concerning the exemption should be directed to the Office
of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Installations and Logistics),
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Environment and Safety,
Pentagon Building, Washington, D.C. 20301; the office phone number is
