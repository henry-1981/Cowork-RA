Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical
Devices
Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

1. Introduction
FDA reviews pediatric devices through all of its premarket pathways, including
premarket notification (510(k)), premarket approval (PMA), biological license
application (BLA), and humanitarian device exemption (HDE). A manufacturer may
show substantial equivalence to a predicate device, or may seek marketing approval by
demonstrating with reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its
intended use. Clinical evaluation may be needed to support marketing of a device
indicated for pediatric use. If such studies are needed, they should be conducted in
accordance with the investigational device exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR Part
812). FDA has jurisdiction over significant risk studies, whereas Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs) have oversight responsibility for non-significant risk studies.
On October 26, 2002, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002
(MDUFMA) was signed into law. Among other things, MDUFMA amends the Federal,
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) by adding several new provisions intended to
promote the development of safe and effective pediatric devices and to protect this vulnerable
patient population during the course of clinical trials involving such products. This guidance,
as well as a collateral guidance on procedures for ensuring that pediatric expertise is available

1

to FDA Advisory Panels when appropriate, 1 will help the agency achieve the intent of the
pediatric provisions of MDUFMA.
This guidance should be used in conjunction with other device-specific guidances to help
ensure that medical devices intended for use in the pediatric population provide reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Stakeholder Input
In developing the draft and final versions of this guidance, FDA considered comments from
its stakeholders. On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register (FR) notice
entitled, “Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2003, Establishment of a
Public Docket” (68 FR 5643) (hereinafter referred to as the MDUFMA Docket). In this FR
notice, the agency identified several statutory provisions for which FDA was particularly
interested in receiving stakeholder input, and this pediatric provision 2 was one of them.
While no comments were submitted to the MDUFMA Docket on this topic, three comments
were submitted in response to the draft of this guidance.
One comment questioned why the guidance did not reference the least burdensome provisions
of the Act (Sections 513(a)(1)(D) and 513(a)(3)(D)(ii)) or encourage the use of early
collaboration meetings to help ensure that the least burdensome approach is followed in
determining safety and effectiveness for pediatric devices. For more information on the least
burdensome provisions of the Act, please refer to FDA’s guidance “The Least Burdensome
Provisions of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997: Concept and Principles ; Final Guidance
for FDA and Industry”
(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm0
85994.htm). For more information on the pre-submission program and meetings with FDA
staff, please refer to FDA’s guidance “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device
Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug
Administration Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm3
10375.htm).
Another comment asked how devices that are already legally marketed for pediatrics with an
upper age limit of 18 would be affected by the guidance since this document extends the

definition through age 21. As stated in the guidance, the Agency recognizes that the age
descriptions presented here are somewhat arbitrary and that other factors, such as the
subject’s weight, body size, and physiological and neurological development may be more
appropriate indicators than chronological age. The intent of this guidance is to identify those
issues that should be considered by sponsors conducting clinical trials involving pediatrics to
ensure that the studies are appropriately designed and that measures are taken to protect this
vulnerable patient population. Similarly, the Agency hopes this guidance will help
manufacturers develop clear labeling for their products and take into account the above
physiological and neurological factors, when appropriate.
Finally, two comments sought clarification of how State and Federal law pertaining to the
age of consent relates to the clinical definition of the pediatric population put forth in the
guidance. The draft guidance was revised to clarify this distinction.

III. Objectives
1. To help define the pediatric population and pediatric use for medical devices.
2. To help identify the types of information needed to provide reasonable assurance of
the safety and effectiveness of medical devices intended for use in the pediatric
population.
3. To help define the guiding principles and protections sponsors should consider for
pediatric subjects in device clinical trials.

IV. Pediatric Population and Use
A. Definition of Pediatric Population Subgroups
For purposes of this guidance, we are proposing the following ranges of pediatric
subpopulations to be used as a guide for manufacturers in developing medical
devices:
Table 1. Age Ranges of Pediatric Subgroups

Pediatric Subgroup

Approximate Age Range

Newborn (neonate)

from birth to 1 month of age

Infant

greater than 1 month to 2 years of age

Child

greater than 2 to 12 years of age

Adolescent

greater than 12 through 21 years of age
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Although the upper age limit used to define the pediatric population varies among
experts, including adolescents up through the age of 21 is consistent with the
definition found in several sources. 3, 4 FDA interprets pediatrics as individuals who
are 21 years of age or younger (that is, from birth through the 21st year of life, up to
but not including the 22nd birthday). 5 Given the scope of medical devices and the
impact that a device could have on a growing adolescent, as well as the effect growth
could have on the device, we believe that including the upper age limit identified
above may be useful for some devices and device clinical trials. The agency
recognizes, however, that the descriptions are somewhat arbitrary and that, in fact, the
subject’s weight, body size, physiological development, neurological development,
and neuromuscular coordination may often be more appropriate indicators than
chronological age.
Additional pediatric subpopulations include:
-

low birth weight describes newborns less than 2.5 Kg
very low birth weight describes newborns less than 1.5 Kg
preadolescent age group typically ranges from 11 to 13 years.

Although these pediatric subpopulations are not included in Table 1, device labeling
and clinical studies should address, as applicable, any issues that pertain to these or
other pediatric subpopulations, such as low birth weight newborns.
It is important to note the distinction between the clinical age limit of 21 described in this
guidance and the legal age for consent. For the purposes of informed consent,
manufacturers must comply with all federal and state regulations governing age and
mental capacity. 6 A detailed discussion of informed consent issues as they pertain to the
pediatric population is presented in Section X.

B. Definition of Pediatric Use
For purposes of this guidance, FDA will consider a pediatric use to be any use of a
medical device in a pediatric population, as defined above, in which there is a
primary pediatric indication. General indications, where considerable pediatric
application is anticipated, are also included in this definition.
3

21 U.S.C. § 360j(m)(6)(E)(i) and (ii) (Section 520m(6)E of the FD&C Act) defines pediatric
patients as age 21 years or younger at the time of diagnosis or treatment and specifies
categories of pediatric subpopulations.
4
21 U.S.C. § 360e-1(a) (Section 515A of the FD&C Act), which requires sponsors of PMA
and HDE applications and supplements to submit information on pediatric subpopulations
and pediatric patients, uses the same definition of “pediatric subpopulations.”

V. General Principles in Medical Device Evaluation
In general, FDA assesses safety and effectiveness of devices in the pediatric population
using the same regulatory bases, scientific approaches, and processes used to assess all
devices. Device considerations that are also germane to pediatric devices include, but are
not limited to, the following pre-clinical and clinical testing as well as other regulatory
controls:
-

-

biocompatibility, including toxicity and carcinogenicity
sterility and infection control
environmental factors related to location of use, such as electromagnetic fields
and radiation
design controls and good manufacturing practices (GMP)

Because the pediatric population represents a particularly vulnerable group, specific
measures are needed to protect the safety of pediatric study subjects. Adult devices may be
inappropriate for use in pediatric subjects for a variety of reasons, or may require specific
design changes and/or specific labeling to accommodate their use in pediatric subjects. We
recommend that you consider the following when you develop devices or plan a clinical
trial for devices intended for pediatric subjects:
-

height
weight
growth and development
disease or condition
hormonal influences
anatomical and physiological differences from the adult population
activity and maturity level
immune status.

VI. Pre-clinical Studies
Given the wide spectrum of devices, the necessary pre-clinical testing may vary
considerably. FDA may request bench or animal data depending on the type of device, the
target population, and the extent of existing knowledge about the device. In many cases,
FDA has developed device-specific guidance documents that will provide information on
the types of pre-clinical testing that should be completed either to support marketing or to
support initiation of a clinical trial. We recommend that you contact the reviewing division
or visit the CDRH or CBER websites for a complete listing of relevant guidances.

VII. Clinical Studies
As is true for medical devices in general, FDA does not believe that clinical data will be
necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for all devices intended for pediatric
populations. The agency recognizes that the amount and type of evidence required will
depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the device, what is already known
about the product in the adult population (if relevant), what is known or can be
extrapolated about the device to the pediatric population, and the underlying disease or
condition being treated. In some cases, well-designed bench and animal testing will be
sufficient to evaluate the device. In others, clinical data may be needed to evaluate the
safety and effectiveness of the device.
FDA is committed to following the least burdensome principles as described in the
guidance document entitled, “The Least Burdensome Provisions of the FDA Modernization
Act of 1997: Concept and Principles.” This commitment applies equally to pediatric
devices. We recommend that sponsors of pediatric device clinical trials take advantage of
the pre-submission program to obtain feedback on their investigational protocol before
initiating the trial and to discuss the least burdensome regulatory path.
If it is determined that clinical data are needed, it may be that the course of the disease and
the device's effects are similar in adult and pediatric patients. In such a situation, the
pediatric indication may be supported by the adult data with limited additional safety data
in the pediatric population. In other cases, the prognosis, severity, or symptoms of the
disease in the adult population may be significantly different than in the pediatric
population, the device's effects may not be well understood, or there may be risks specific
to the pediatric population necessitating clinical data in this population.
In some situations, devices that are already approved and indicated for adult populations are
modified for pediatric uses. To support the modifications, the manufacturer should conduct
a risk analysis of the changes and develop methods to adequately address or mitigate the
identified risks. This may require verification testing alone, or validation testing may be
needed in the intended pediatric population.
Finally, because weight, body size, and physiological and neurological development all
vary among pediatric subpopulations and change as the child grows, clinical data may be
needed to assess safety and effectiveness in the various subgroups. In other cases, it may
be possible to extrapolate from one group to another, thus limiting or obviating the need
for clinical data. When clinical trials in a pediatric population are necessary to support a
marketing application, these trials should follow existing scientific approaches and
methods to ensure the safety of subjects.
In summary, FDA believes clinical data are appropriate when any of the
following circumstances apply:

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

-

-

supporting information from sources, such as pre-clinical bench or animal testing,
literature, or adult clinical trials, are inadequate to establish safety and
effectiveness for the pediatric indication
adult data are inadequate to predict pediatric risks and adverse events
pediatric data are needed for validation of design modifications
pediatric data are needed to develop an age-appropriate treatment regimen.

When the above circumstances exist, clinical data from pediatric subjects help ensure
that manufacturers:
-

design the device properly for the intended population
perform accurate risk assessments
provide clear instructions for use.

Compared to drugs, devices present additional challenges due to the range of technology
they incorporate and their varying applications. It is difficult to outline a prescriptive
approach that would be appropriate for evaluating all devices. For example, some devices
are relatively simple in terms of design and use, such as blood pressure cuffs and
bilirubinometers. FDA generally recommends only pre-clinical testing to support adult and
pediatric use of these types of products. Other devices may present additional risks, e.g.,
intraosseous access devices. For devices of this kind, the supporting information included
performance studies in animals and cadavers, clinical experience in the adult population,
and a clinical trial in a pediatric population. The study design addressed issues relating to
differences in bone density and depth of penetration requirements in children of various
ages and between children and adults. The study also addressed issues related to the growth
plate and epiphyseal closure in children.
If clinical data are needed, other sources of data, such as published studies and reports and
actual use information, may help reduce the burden. FDA advises sponsors to consider
these alternative sources of information when designing their clinical trial. Sponsors
should also consider if adequate data may be gathered by including pediatric patients as
well as adults in the original studies conducted on the device. Finally, the type and extent
of the studies needed, especially in different age groups, is often best decided on a case-bycase basis. FDA encourages you to discuss your clinical trial plan with the reviewing
division.
FDA recommends that when developing medical devices for pediatric use, you consider
the following:
Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Because the risk posed by the device may vary depending on the particular pediatric
subgroup, you should determine the types of risk for each targeted pediatric subgroup
by conducting a risk assessment. When assessing risk, you should consider the
following critical factors:
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•
•
•
•

•

age and degree of physiological maturity of the child
nature and natural history of the clinical condition to be treated
presence of complicating clinical conditions
safety and effectiveness of the device that may have been demonstrated in
older patients, or that is expected on the basis of other clinical or preclinical
investigations
likely duration of device use and its impact on the growth and development of
the child.

Using the results of the risk analysis, you should develop methods to address or
mitigate the identified risks. In many cases, well-designed bench and animal studies
may accomplish this. In others, clinical data will be necessary.
Pediatric Subgroups
If clinical data are needed to support a pediatric indication, you should make every
effort to gather data that adequately addresses each targeted pediatric subgroup. In
some cases, the expected benefit and safety can be determined without separate studies
in each subgroup. That is, it may be extrapolated from one age group to another. In
other cases, such as with neonates, clinical data gathered specifically in that subgroup
will likely be needed. You should be prepared to provide data for each targeted
subpopulation or a justification as to why it is either not needed or can be extrapolated.

VIII. Unique Host Characteristics
We recommend that you specify relevant subsets of the pediatric population in your
intended use and indications rather than pooling them all into a single pediatric population.
You should address the factors discussed below with respect to your device design, clinical
study design, and labeling for each population. We recommend that you address these
factors in devices specific to pediatrics and in general use devices with pediatric
indications, where there may be unique issues when used in the pediatric population.
Age
As discussed in Section IV, the identification of specific age limits for pediatric
subpopulations is somewhat arbitrary. Characteristics such as the subject’s weight,
body size, physiological and neurological development, and neuromuscular
coordination may be more appropriate when deciding upon the appropriate
subpopulation for a device. For example, the use of cochlear implants in certain
pediatric subgroups may not be advisable due to the size of the implant or may be
inappropriate due to the stage of the neurological development of the child. Therefore,
when designing the clinical trial or the device labeling, age may be used as a
preliminary approximator, but other factors should be considered to further define the
appropriate population.
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Size
We recommend that you determine if design modifications are necessary based
on subject size (e.g., weight, height, body mass, or surface area).
Growth and Development
We recommend that you consider the following:
-

impact of growth on the device and vice versa
if the child will outgrow the device, and if so, at what rate
if adjustments to the device will be necessary
if further intervention may be needed
impact of technological advances in the device (e.g., will the device be
easily upgraded?)

Body Habitus
We recommend that you consider the following:
-

-

normal as well as abnormal variations in the targeted pediatric group
normal anatomic landmarks for each subgroup and anticipated deviations
based on the targeted population
impact of anomalies, particularly congenital anomalies.

Developmental Milestones
We recommend that you consider the following:
-

impact of the device on the child
activity level of the child
ambulatory status of the child
maturity level of the child
stage of puberty (for example, in the pre-adolescent and adolescent, breast
bud development may influence device placement).

Pathophysiology
We recommend that you determine the impact of the disease/condition on the
pediatric patient and take into account the following:
-

-

-

maturity or immaturity of various organ systems, including the immune system
impact of materials, chemicals, electromagnetic radiation, electrical
stimulation, and other agents
hormonal influences, for example, effects of puberty in the preadolescent
and adolescent population
short-term and long-term effects of device use.

Behavioral factors
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend that you consider the behavior expected in the targeted pediatric
subgroup and anticipate the potential impact of the device. For example, an
adolescent with a learning disorder may not be able to interface very well with certain
devices and may require additional help or an alternative therapy.
Psychosocial factors
We recommend that you consider the psychosocial factors of the pediatric subgroups.
For some pediatric devices or device trials, the family structure and environment,
including how supportive the various family members are and who the primary
caregiver will be, are important factors to consider.
Human Factors
Each pediatric subgroup will have different needs; therefore, you should consider these
in the design and use of the device. We recommend that you consider the following for
each targeted subgroup:
-

invasiveness of the device
optimal size of the device
manual dexterity and strength required
resistance to damage from wear and tear
portability
clarity of the labeling
ease of use
level of interaction required for the proper functioning and use of the device
age-appropriate usability of the user interface
age and maturity level needed to safely and effectively operate the device,
particularly in adolescents and especially with regard to placement,
compliance, and use of the device.

Surgical Factors for Implantable Devices
For each targeted pediatric subgroup, we recommend that you assess:
-

-

the surgical site and anatomical landmarks
surgical technique and level of expertise needed
short-term and long-term effects of the surgery and the device
immune status and update immunizations, if indicated
special issues pertaining to combination products, such as the possibility
of drug/device interactions
the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

IX. Labeling
Labeling requirements for medical devices are defined by regulation. 7 In general, the
goal of medical device labeling is to provide the user with the following information:
What the device is
What the device does
When the device should and should not be used
How the device should be used to achieve maximum benefit and minimal risk.
To this end, we recommend that labeling for devices intended for use in pediatric
subgroups incorporate the information discussed below.

A. Basic Elements of Labeling
The following list identifies some of the basic elements of labeling and discusses ways
to address these elements for pediatric populations.
Device Description
Many devices and device accessories come in different models, sizes, shapes,
and materials, as well as different modes of operation and different levels of
sophistication requiring varying degrees of user interface. The labeling should
describe various options recommended for use in pediatric subgroups and, when
feasible, present these options in tabular form by age, weight, or other
appropriate criteria.
Indications for Use
If your device is intended for use in a pediatric population, you should clearly
define the indication(s) as well as the target population in the labeling. The
indication may be general (e.g., cut, coagulate, ablate), or specific (e.g., treatment
of vesicoureteral reflux). The target population may be broad (e.g., children and
adults of all ages) or narrow (e.g., infants between the ages of 6-9 months). You
should be prepared to explain and, when necessary, support the indication and
targeted population(s) with appropriate data.
Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions
Contraindications, warnings, and precautions, respectively, alert the potential user
to situations where the device should absolutely not be used; data suggest that
there is increased risk associated with use of the device; or data are lacking to
define risk/benefit for a particular aspect of use or in a particular subgroup. Given
the vulnerability of the pediatric population and specific host concerns described
7

For premarket notification submissions, see 21 CFR 807.87(e). For PMAs and HDEs, see
21 CFR 814.20(b)(10) and 21 CFR 814.104(b)(4)(ii).
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
above, it is especially important that the contraindications, warnings, and
precautions in labeling provide clear descriptions and well-defined actions and
consequences. Contraindications, warnings, and precautions for devices intended
for pediatric use should clearly address the risks associated with age, size, and
maturity of the pediatric subject and alert the user to specific hazards associated
with the use of the device in the target population.
Adverse Events
Another key element of labeling is a discussion of device-related adverse events
that have been reported from clinical investigations or literature pertaining to the
use of medical devices. Device-related adverse events could be captured in many
different ways: by severity, frequency, indication, sex, etc. If your device is
intended for use in pediatrics, you should make a concerted effort to obtain and
report the frequency of device-related adverse events according to the various
pediatric subgroups in which the device will be used. This information will assist
health care providers in assessing age-specific risk profiles and may be useful in
mitigating the risks.
Clinical Studies
As discussed above, gathering clinical information directly on the targeted pediatric
subgroup may be necessary. The importance of summarizing that information in
labeling warrants special attention. Your labeling should present information in a
way that is clear, objective, and meaningful. You should report study results in a
format that allows the user to recognize easily substantive differences in
performance between children and adults and between various pediatric subgroups.
Labeling should summarize these data using appropriate qualitative or quantitative
analyses, recognizing that subgroups may be too small to show statistical
significance using standard tests.
Instructions for use
Understanding how to use a medical device correctly can be as important as the
design, manufacturing, and testing of the device. Instructions may be provided
for the health care practitioner, as is the case with prescription products, or the
patient, as is the case with over-the-counter products, or both. Labeling provided
for the healthcare practitioner or caregiver should be written to provide the user
with instructions for safe and effective use. This includes addressing anatomic,
developmental, educational, and other age-related factors in this section of the
labeling to help ensure proper use of the device and prevent avoidable devicerelated adverse events. Any instructions provided specifically for the pediatric
patient should be age-appropriate with respect to written language and other
visual and auditory tools.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

B. Pediatric Information
You should submit appropriate information and summarize it adequately to ensure that
labeling is satisfactory for all pediatric subgroups or specific pediatric subgroups
(e.g., all pediatric subgroups except neonates) targeted in your intended use.
If you did not include a particular subgroup, or did not include sufficient numbers in
that subgroup in your clinical trials, and there is reason to expect that there may be
differences in safety and effectiveness among subgroups, your labeling should indicate
that the device was not tested in the particular subgroup or that there is insufficient
information to establish safety and effectiveness for that subgroup.
We recommend that you describe the specific age ranges rather than using “pediatric”
in a broad sense. Please see Table 1. Age Ranges of Pediatric Subgroups.

C. Special Considerations
We recommend that you ensure the instructions for use are clear, take into
consideration different pediatric subgroups, and address any special issues, where
appropriate. For example, including a precaution to consider future breast bud
development in female pediatric subjects when selecting a site on the chest for
placement of a port or catheter may be appropriate. Another example may be including
a precaution that provides advice on the appropriate activity level for the child,
especially with respect to participation in certain sports.

X. Protections for Pediatric Populations in Clinical
Trials
The pediatric population represents a vulnerable subgroup of research subjects. Therefore,
it is important that special measures be taken to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the
pediatric study participant. Every effort should be made to ensure that adequate protections
are provided to these subjects during the conduct of clinical trials. The roles and
responsibilities of the clinical investigator, sponsor, and the Institutional Review Board are
crucial in protecting the rights and welfare of the pediatric subject.
FDA regulations governing IRBs identify children as subjects who may be vulnerable and
subject to coercion. In such cases, IRBs must determine that additional safeguards are in
place to protect their rights and welfare (21 CFR 56.111(b)). FDA’s guidance document
entitled, Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators,
http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/default.htm addresses issues regarding informed consent
and the assent of children. The basic requirements of 21 CFR 50.20 regarding informed
consent apply to the pediatric population. See also the guidance entitled, E11 Clinical
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population,
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm129477.pdf . We
recommend that you consult 21 CFR Part 50 - Subpart D Additional Safeguards for
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Children in Clinical Investigations (discussed below) and other referenced resources
dealing with informed consent, assent, permission, financial remuneration, direct benefit,
and minimal risk.

A. Relevant Definitions
The following terms are defined in FDA’s and the Department of Health and Human
Services’ human subject protection regulations and guidance:
Assent means a child’s affirmative agreement to participate in a clinical
investigation. Mere failure to object may not be construed as assent. 21 CFR
50.3(n).
Children means persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments
or procedures involved in the clinical investigations, under the applicable law of the
jurisdiction in which the clinical investigation will be conducted. 21 CFR 50.3(o).
Emancipated Minor: A legal status conferred upon persons who have not yet attained
the age of legal competency as defined by state law, but who are entitled to treatment as
if they had by virtue of assuming adult responsibilities, such as self-support, marriage,
or procreation. 8
Family member means any one of the following legally competent persons: Spouse;
parents; children (including adopted children); brothers, sisters, and spouses of
brothers and sisters; and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close
association with the subject is the equivalent of a family relationship. 21 CFR
50.3(m).
Guardian means an individual who is authorized under applicable state or local law to
consent on behalf of a child to general medical care when general medical care
includes participation in research. For purposes of subpart D of 21 CFR Part 50, a
guardian also means an individual who is authorized to consent on behalf of a child to
participate in research. 21 CFR 50.3(s).
Legally authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body
authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject to
the subject’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research. 21 CFR
50.3(l).
Mature Minor: Persons who have not reached adulthood (as defined by state law) but
who may be treated as an adult for certain purposes (e.g., consenting to medical care).
Note that a mature minor is not necessarily an emancipated minor. 11

Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological
examinations or tests. 21 CFR 50.3(k).
Parent means a child’s biological or adoptive parent. 21 CFR 50.3(p).
Permission means the agreement of parent(s) or guardian to the participation of their
child or ward in a clinical investigation. Permission must be obtained in compliance
with subpart B of 21 CFR Part 50 and must include the elements of informed consent
described in §50.25. 21 CFR 50.3(r).

B. Study Design Considerations
As discussed above, FDA recommends that sponsors identify the subgroup(s) in which
to evaluate the device, unless the device is intended for the entire pediatric population.
When deciding whether a clinical trial is needed for a particular pediatric population,
the following points are important to consider:
•

•

Does the research have an identifiable prospect of direct benefit to the
individual child participant? Can that benefit be achieved through alternative
means?
Does the research have an identifiable prospect of risk to the individual child
participant? What safeguards are proposed to minimize these risks? When
procedures involving greater than minimal risk to children are anticipated,
are convincing scientific and ethical justifications given?

It is important when designing the study that every attempt is made to anticipate and
reduce possible study hazards. Investigators should be knowledgeable of all relevant
pre- clinical data and be properly trained and experienced in the pediatric population and
medical procedures used for this population.
We recommend that you ensure appropriate pediatric expertise is reasonably available
during the entire trial. We also recommend all clinical sites have staff and equipment
appropriate for pediatric care. Your clinical sites should also have pediatric-specific
emergency measures, such as properly sized oxygen, suction, and resuscitation devices
as well as medications to treat severe anaphylaxis and adverse reactions.
Because many procedures used during clinical trials are often new to the child, every
effort should be made to ensure the participants’ experiences in the study are positive
and to minimize discomfort and distress. Additionally, before studies are undertaken, an
evaluation should be made to determine if the needed information can be obtained from
less vulnerable populations. When studies are conducted in the pediatric population,
every attempt should be made to include individuals representing the demographics of

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the region and the disease being studied. Studies in handicapped or institutionalized
pediatric subjects should be limited to diseases or conditions found principally in
these populations.
To be of benefit to those participating in a clinical study, the study should be properly
designed and conducted to ensure that quality data are obtained. Following Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) is crucial to obtaining quality and reliable data from the
study.

C. The Role of the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
The principal role of the IRB is to protect the rights and welfare of human research
subjects; this is especially true when studies involve children as subjects. To safeguard
the child’s interests and to protect children from harm, special ethical and regulatory
considerations are in place for reviewing research involving children. The regulations
at 21 CFR Part 50 Subpart D Additional Protections for Children Involved as Subjects
of Research describe these considerations.
IRBs reviewing research involving children as subjects should consider the benefits,
risks and discomforts inherent in the proposed research and assess their justification in
light of the expected benefits to the child subject or to society as a whole. The IRB
should weigh the circumstance of the subject under study, the magnitude of risks that
may accrue for the research procedures, and the potential benefits the research may
provide to the subjects.
The regulations require IRBs to classify research involving children into one of
four categories and to document their discussions of the risks and benefits of the
research study. The four categories are:
•

Clinical investigations not involving greater than minimal risk (21 CFR 50.51)

•

Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk but presenting
the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects. (21 CFR 50.52)

•

Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk and no prospect of
direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable
knowledge about the subjects’ disorder or condition. (21 CFR 50.53)

•

Clinical investigations not otherwise approvable that present an opportunity to
understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious problem affecting the health or
welfare of children. (21 CFR 50.54)

In all cases, IRBs must determine that adequate provisions have been made for
soliciting the assent of children and the permission of their parents or guardians. (21
CFR 50.55)

D. Consent and Assent
We recommend that you ensure that the informed consent document is clearly
written and that the risks and benefits are thoroughly explained. FDA recognizes
that consent depends on a number of factors, including:
-

-

age
maturity level
legal status of the subject (emancipated or mature minor)
applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted and which
in turn determines legal age of consent
comprehension level of the pediatric research participant, parents, guardians,
and legally authorized representative.

We also recommend that you consider:
-

-

prognosis and life expectancy of patients with certain diseases or disorders
mental capacity, intellectual quotient, and level of functioning
differing ages and maturity level
direct benefits and risks of the pediatric participant’s research involvement
(research versus therapeutic treatment)
ethical issues
proper monitoring (data and safety monitoring).

When children or minors are involved in research, the regulations require the assent of
the child or minor and the permission of the parent(s) in place of the consent of the
subjects. 21 CFR 50.55. While children may be legally incapable of giving informed
consent, they may possess the ability to assent to or dissent from participation. The
regulations do not require that assent be sought from children starting at a specific age,
but that their assent should be sought when the children are capable of providing their
assent. Therefore, children should be asked whether or not they wish to participate in
the research particularly if the research: (1) does not involve interventions likely to be
of benefit to the subjects and (2) the children can comprehend and appreciate what it
means to be a volunteer for the benefit of others.
Researchers may seek assent of children of various ages. Older children may be well
acquainted with signing documents through prior experience with testing, licensing,
and other procedures normally encountered in their lives. Signing a form to give their
assent for research would not be perceived as unusual and would be reasonable.
Younger children, however, may never have had the experience of signing a document.
For these children, requiring a signature may not be appropriate, and some other
technique to verify assent could be used. For example, a third party may verify, by
signature, that the assent of the child was obtained.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Although there is no requirement that the informed consent document contain a space
for assent by children, many investigators and IRBs consider it standard practice to
obtain the agreement of older children who can understand the circumstances before
enrolling them in research. The basic requirement of 21 CFR 50.20 applies, i.e., the
legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized
representative must be obtained before enrollment. Parents, legal guardians and/or
others may have the ability to give permission to enroll children in research, depending
on applicable state and local law of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted.
(Note: permission to enroll in research is not the same as permission to provide medical
treatment.) IRBs generally require investigators to obtain the permission of one or both
of the parents or guardian (as appropriate) and the assent of children who possess the
intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved. Some IRBs
require two documents, a fully detailed explanation for parents and older children to
read and sign, and a shorter, simpler one for younger children.
For some research activities, IRBs may require that either an IRB member or an
advocate for the child be present during the assent and permission procedures to verify
the child understands and to support the child’s preferences. The IRB may also require
that the parent(s) or a close family member be present during the research, especially if
a young child will be exposed to significant discomfort or inconvenience, or if the child
will be required to spend time in an unfamiliar place (i.e., study site).
In all cases where assent is required, the proposed research should be explained to the
child in language that is appropriate to the child’s age, experience, maturity, and
condition. This explanation should include a discussion of any discomfort and
inconveniences the child may expect to experience if he or she agrees to participate.
The subject should also be made aware of his or her rights to decline to participate or to
withdraw from the study at any time. Additionally, the safety of the subject is always
an overriding factor in the continuation of a subject in any study. If a subject wishes to
withdraw from a study and, in the opinion of the investigator and the IRB, the safety
and welfare of the pediatric subject would be jeopardized by his/her removal from the
study, continued parental or legal guardian consent should be sufficient to allow
participation in the study.

CFR 46.407 ("407") Review Process”
