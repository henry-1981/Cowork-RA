Intravascular Catheters, Wires, and
Delivery Systems with Lubricious
Coatings - Labeling Considerations
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document addresses labeling considerations for devices containing lubricious
coatings used in the vasculature. The purpose of this guidance document is to provide
recommendations for information to be included in the device labeling, as submitted in
premarket applications (PMAs) or premarket notification submissions (510(k)s) for Class III and
Class II devices, to enhance the consistency of coating-related information across these product
areas, as well as to promote the safe use of these devices in the clinical setting. Medical devices
such as intravascular catheters, guidewires, balloon angioplasty catheters, delivery sheaths, and
implant delivery systems are commonly used during minimally invasive diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures in the cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and peripheral vascular systems.
These devices often have hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic lubricious coatings (e.g.,
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), silicone) to reduce friction
between devices, and between device(s) and blood vessels. It is commonly believed that these
coatings may offer physicians greater maneuverability and may result in less trauma to blood
vessels for patients.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic coated devices have been used for more than 20 years in
minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, and peripheral
vascular procedures. Both of these types of coatings decrease friction between the device and
blood vessels. These devices facilitate the ability for physicians to provide minimally invasive
treatment options to patients.
Although these devices may offer patient benefits, recent evidence indicates that the coating may
separate from intravascular devices in some circumstances. The FDA has received and analyzed
information concerning serious adverse events associated with hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic
coatings separating (e.g., peeling, flaking, shedding, delaminating, sloughing off) from
intravascular medical devices. This information has included voluntary recalls of guidewires,
sheaths, retrieval devices, and embolization device delivery wires, as well as Medical Device
Reports (MDRs) describing separation of hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic coatings from medical
devices such as guidewires, catheters, and introducers that have been used for cerebrovascular,
cardiovascular, and peripheral vascular procedures.
The FDA has also evaluated other relevant information, including peer-reviewed medical
literature1,2,3,4 and physician surveys5. Serious adverse events reported in these MDRs and in the
medical literature include pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, myocardial embolism,
myocardial infarction, embolic stroke, tissue necrosis, and death. Serious injuries associated with
the peeling of coatings reported in MDRs included the persistence of coating fragments in
patients, some of which required surgical intervention to mitigate the consequences, adverse
tissue reactions, and thromboses. Additional information related to these analyses may be found
in the FDA Safety Communication for Lubricious Coating Separation from Intravascular
Medical Devices issued on November 23, 2015 (http://wayback.archiveit.org/7993/20170722215712/https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/uc
m473794.htm). This safety communication was issued to make health care providers aware of
the possibility that hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic coatings may separate from medical devices

and potentially cause serious injuries to patients. The safety communication also includes
information physicians may consider to reduce the potential of adverse events.
The FDA has not concluded that any specific manufacturer or brand of these devices is
associated with higher risks than others. The cause of coating separation is multifactorial, and
can be associated with factors including device design, device manufacturing (including
formulation and raw material sourcing) and clinical use. Current FDA analysis suggests that
clinical use-related issues may be mitigated through proper device selection, preparation,
adequate premarket testing and other labeling considerations that are addressed within this
guidance document. For recommendations on premarket testing, please refer to the FDA
guidance titled “Class II Special Controls Guidance Document for Certain Percutaneous
Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Catheters,” 6 the FDA guidance titled “NonClinical Engineering Tests and Recommended Labeling for Intravascular Stents and Associated
Delivery Systems”7, and the guidance titled “Performance Tests and Recommended Labeling for
Coronary, Peripheral, and Neurovascular Guidewires.”8

III. Scope
This guidance document provides labeling recommendations for both Class III and Class II
devices such as intravascular catheters, wires, and delivery systems with lubricious coatings used
in the vasculature. Due to higher risks that are associated with use of these devices in the neuro-,
coronary, and peripheral vasculature, FDA has focused the scope of this guidance on devices
used in those vascular regions, although some of these considerations could be applicable to
devices with similar coatings used in other types of interventional procedures. The scope of this
guidance document includes a variety of devices and product codes including the following
Class II and Class III devices (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). The devices are listed in
alphabetical order (not risk- or event-based).

IV. Recommended Labeling Considerations
This guidance is intended to help develop labeling that will provide information for use and other
information in accordance with 21 CFR Part 801.109 and other applicable requirements in 21
CFR 801. FDA recommends including the following information in the device labeling for
intravascular devices with lubricious coatings. We intend for this information to supplement and
enhance the information that is already in the device labeling for these device types, and do not
intend for it to replace information already included in the labeling. Since these
recommendations are based on known safety issues, FDA recommends that this information be
considered for inclusion as current product labeling is updated, and that labeling included as part
of future premarket submissions for intravascular devices with lubricious coatings incorporate
the recommendations. For currently 510(k)-cleared intravascular devices with lubricous coatings,
please refer to FDA’s guidance “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing
Device,”9 which provides guidance to 510(k) holders on deciding when to submit a 510(k) for a
change to an existing device.

A.

Device Description
In addition to the device description currently provided for the device, the device
labeling for a coated device should include a statement to identify that the device
is coated, as well as a brief description (e.g., hydrophilic, hydrophobic) of the
coating, its location on the device (e.g., proximal or distal end), the length of the
coating, and its purpose.
We recommend the device description prominently note the presence of the
coating and refer the user to additional critical information.

If the device is intended for use with specific ancillary device(s) dimension(s), we
recommend specifying this information because size mismatch may result in
coating damage and adverse events.

B.

Indications for Use Statement
All indications for use described in the labeling should be supported by
information in the premarket submission. For intravascular devices, this includes
identifying any specific regions of the vasculature for which the device is cleared
or approved for use.

C.

Warnings, Precautions and Preparation Steps
Many devices are designed, labeled, and indicated for specific uses. FDA
acknowledges that the specific warnings and precautions may depend on the
specific design and intended use of the device. For example, the coating and
performance of a device intended to be used in the peripheral vasculature may be
different than a device intended to be used in the cerebral vasculature. If
information regarding safety is not available or has not been established for
indications other than those specified in the regulatory submission, it may be
appropriate to consider the inclusion of a precaution statement reflecting such. For
example: “The safety and effectiveness of the coated device has not been
established, or is unknown, in vascular regions other than those specifically
indicated.”
In addition, we recommend that the labeling include any other specific
considerations such as device compatibility, storage conditions, specific
preparation steps, and any appropriate troubleshooting or tips that should be
conveyed to the device user in order to enhance the safe use of the device. Table 1
provides a listing of the information suggested for inclusion.
The preparation steps should include information that will guide the user in a
clinical setting. Some of these items may be included as warnings or precautions
in the instructions for use or on the outer label. Please refer to Table 1 for specific
recommendations to consider when developing the labeling. If you believe one or
more of these considerations are not applicable to your device, we recommend
you provide a brief rationale in your premarket submission. We recommend that
you include any additional warnings and precautions not identified below that you
determine are necessary to promote the safe use of the device based on your
device design and intended use.

g.

Any instructions, warnings, or precautions necessary to ensure the
safe and effective use of the lubricious coating should be addressed.
We recommend including a warning, such as: “Warning: Failure to
abide by the warnings in this labeling might result in damage to the
device coating, which may necessitate intervention or result in
serious adverse events.”
We recommend a warning against reuse or re-sterilization of the
device, which could damage the coating and affect coating
performance, for example, “This device is intended for single use.
Do not reuse or re-sterilize.”
If applicable, we recommend specification of the appropriate
duration for pre-conditioning. If applicable, include a precaution
against soaking for extended periods when the device is not in use.
If the coating integrity or performance could be negatively
impacted by extended soaking or pre-conditioning, we recommend
alerting the user of the maximum soaking or pre-conditioning time.
For example, alert the user to avoid pre-soaking devices for longer
than instructed, as this may impact the coating performance.
If applicable, we recommend a specification of any known
incompatibility with specific media or solvents (e.g., alcohol or
antiseptic). If the coating integrity or performance could be
negatively impacted by preparation with incompatible media, we
recommend including a precaution in the labeling alerting the user.
If applicable, we recommend inclusion of a warning or precaution
regarding the swelling behavior of the coating when exposed to
aqueous media and any impact on device use.
We recommend that the labeling instruct and warn users to use
caution when manipulating, advancing and/or withdrawing these
devices through needles, metal cannulas, stents, or other devices
with sharp edges, or through tortuous or calcified blood vessels.
Manipulation, advancement, and/or withdrawal past sharp or
beveled edges may result in destruction and/or separation of the
outer coating, which may lead to clinical adverse events, resulting
in coating material remaining in the vasculature or device damage.
This may result in adverse events (section D below) requiring
additional intervention.

h.
If the device is anticipated to be used with other devices and/or
accessories, sufficient information to identify a safe combination of
devices and/or procedure-specific components should be included
due to abrasion between devices.
1) For example, it is important that the user is informed of key
device dimensions (e.g., French size, inner diameter, outer
diameter) and potential compatibility issues with other
devices based on these key dimensions. A tight fit between
the subject device and ancillary devices may exacerbate
frictional forces during use which could contribute to
unanticipated coating loss such as peeling, flaking,
shedding, delamination, or sloughing off.
2) If the device coating swells when exposed to aqueous media
(e.g., saline, heparinized saline), which could impact its use
with other devices, we recommend communicating this in
the instructions for use.
i.
We recommend that any special storage and/or handling conditions
are described. For example, any storage conditions needed to
ensure the integrity of the coating over the labeled shelf-life should
be described (e.g., limits related to light exposure, temperature,
and/or relative humidity during storage, expiration date).
j.
The device’s expiration date should be included on the package
label. The date should be presented in a format consistent with 21
CFR 801.18.
k.
We recommend the specification of appropriate conditioning media
(e.g., normal saline, sterile water, or heparinized saline) prior to and
during clinical use. It should be stated when solutions may not be
interchangeable, for instance if different media could affect the
hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic coatings differently; this is
important because coatings may vary from the proximal to the
distal end on a single device.
l.
We recommend that any practices that should be avoided during
preparation or device use that could result in misuse scenarios or
coating damage be identified. Some examples may include:
1) Avoid wiping the device with dry gauze as this may damage
the device coating.
2) Avoid excessive wiping of the coated device.
3) Avoid using alcohol, antiseptic solutions, or other solvents
to pre-treat the device because this may cause unpredictable
changes in the coating which could affect the device safety
and performance.
4) Avoid pre-soaking devices for longer than instructed, as this
may impact the coating performance.

m.
If the distal tip of the device is flexible and designed to be shaped
by the physician, the labeling should instruct the user of appropriate
shape configurations and shaping techniques. If applicable, it
should also inform the user that attempting to alter the shape of
devices by bending, twisting, or similar methods beyond instructed
methods may compromise the coating integrity and that damage to
the coating may not always be noticeable to the naked eye.
n.
In the event that the device should not move freely, it may be
appropriate to recommend that the user determine the source of
resistance, exercise caution when removing the device and/or other
components as a unit, and exchange the device for a new one to
complete the procedure.
For more information on warnings and precautions, please refer to the Device
Labeling Guidance #G91-1 (blue book memo) (https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/device-labeling-guidance-g91-1blue-book-memo).

D.

Potential Adverse Events
Potential adverse events that could be attributed to coating loss should be
described in the labeling. FDA acknowledges that the specific adverse events may
depend on the specific design and intended use of the device. Such adverse events
may include, but are not limited to:
