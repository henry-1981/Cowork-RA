Convenience Kits
Interim Regulatory Guidance

This document is intended to provide guidance regarding a new premarket notification regulatory
strategy for convenience kits. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both. Public input on
this document was not obtained prior to implementation because it is believed that this guidance
presents a less burdensome policy that is consistent with public health.

submitted at any time for Agency consideration by contacting the Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Section at 301-796-5640. For questions regarding the use or interpretation of this

Convenience Kits
Interim Regulatory Guidance
As part of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's organizational transformation
initiative, the 510(k) Process Reengineering Team has been carefully examining the Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Program to insure that it is operating at peak efficiency and that the
optimum public health benefit is achieved given the allotted resources.
During the preliminary examination of the requirements and execution of the 510(k) Program, the
Team identified a change to the Program that may reduce the regulatory burden for assemblers of
convenience kits. Outlined below is a new regulatory approach to be applied to convenience kits
which could result in a decrease in the number of 510(k) submissions for these devices and, in so
doing, will save ODE review resources. It is estimated that the Office of Device Evaluation
(ODE) receives approximately 300 510(k) submissions per year that could be impacted by this
regulatory approach.
Background
Under the current regulations, first time marketers of devices must submit a premarket
notification and obtain clearance for a device before it can be lawfully introduced into interstate
commerce. Assemblers/manufacturers of convenience kits who intend to market these devices for
the first time are subject to these requirements.
Many of the kits that have been the subject of 510(k) review are comprised of legally marketed
devices that are simply being assembled in kit form strictly for the "convenience" of the purchaser
or user, thus the term "convenience kit." During the review of convenience kit 510(k)s, ODE has
traditionally focused its efforts on the intended use(s) of the particular type of kit, the device
components that are included in the kit, and the impact that any further processing may have on
the kit and/or its components. The labeling for these kits tends to be rather basic, identifying the
assembler or manufacturer of the particular kit and the intended use(s). Additional processing
typically involves affixing the label to the outside packaging of the kit and terminal sterilization of
the kit and its components.
New Regulatory Approach
Based on this experience, FDA believes that under certain circumstances premarket clearance for
convenience kits may not be necessary to ensure protection of the public health. Accordingly,
FDA intends to propose rulemaking to exempt certain, specifically identified convenience kits
from the requirement of premarket notification. Until such a rule is in effect, FDA intends to
exercise enforcement discretion regarding the requirement for premarket clearance for

convenience kits that conform with the specific limitations regarding intended use, components,
and processing described below.
1.

Intended Use - Using the 510(k) database, ODE has developed the attached list of generic
types of kits that the Agency believes represents established intended use(s) for convenience
kits and that does not modify the intended use(s) of the individual kit components. FDA
recognizes that additional types of kits may currently exist that should be subject to this
guidance. Likewise, FDA anticipates that other types of kits may become eligible for
consideration in time. Thus, the list may be periodically updated based on the Agency's
experience with this new regulatory approach as well as on comments received from
interested parties.

2.

Components - Convenience kits subject to this guidance should only include components
that are either: (1) legally marketed preamendments devices, (2) exempt from premarket
notification, or (3) have been found to be substantially equivalent through the premarket
notification process. The components should be purchased in finished form, i.e., they should
be packaged, labeled, etc., consistent with their legal marketing authorization.

3.

Processing - This guidance only applies in instances where the kit assembler/manufacturer
concludes that further processing, if any, of the kit does not significantly affect the safety or
effectiveness of any of the kit's components. In making this determination, FDA
recommends that kit manufacturers follow the procedures described in FDA's guidance
document entitled, "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device."
It is the responsibility of each kit assembler/manufacturer to carefully consider the impact
that any processing may have on the kit's components.

In the past, sterilization has been a focus of the 510(k) review for convenience kits; therefore, kit
assemblers should carefully consider the impact of the sterilization process on individual kit
components. If the kit's components may be sensitive to further processing, e.g., surgical sutures,
the assemblers/manufacturers should take measures necessary to ensure that the components are
not adversely affected by the reprocessing procedures.
In summary, FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion, i.e. not require 510(k) clearance,
for convenience kits of a type matching one of those included on the attached list, consisting of
components that have been cleared through the 510(k) process, and where the
assembler/manufacturer is able to reasonably conclude that any further processing of the kit and
its components does not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of any of its components.
Documentation to support each of these determinations should be maintained in the
assembler's/manufacturer's files in accordance with the Quality System regulation (21 CFR 820)
and should be available for FDA review if needed. It should be noted that while FDA intends to
exercise enforcement discretion with respect to premarket notification requirements,
assemblers/manufacturers of convenience kits are still required to comply with other general
controls including registration, listing, prohibition against misbranding, and good manufacturing
practices. In the future, FDA intends to propose rulemaking to formally exempt these types of
kits from the requirement of premarket notification.

Limitations
FDA does not intend to propose regulatory changes relating to drug requirements for convenience
kits. For convenience kits that contain components subject to regulation as drugs, the
assembler/manufacturer should contact the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Division of
Prescription Drug Compliance & Surveillance, at (301) 594-0101 regarding premarket requirements
for the drug components in the kit.
This guidance is not intended to apply to kit 510(k)s that are under the jurisdiction of the Center
for Biologics Evaluation and Research. For information regarding kits reviewed by CBER, the
assembler/manufacturer should contact the Office of Blood Research and Review, Division of
Blood Applications, Biologics Devices Branch at (301) 827-3524.
Effective Date
This guidance is effective immediately.

Types of Convenience Kits
The attached list of convenience kits was developed based on FDA's database and is organized by
medical speciality. For purposes of this document, the terms "kit," "set," and "tray" are
considered synonymous. This list may be periodically updated based on the Agency's experience
with this guidance as well as on comments received from interested parties.
