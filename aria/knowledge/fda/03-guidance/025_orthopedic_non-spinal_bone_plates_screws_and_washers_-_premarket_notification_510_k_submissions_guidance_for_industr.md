On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Orthopedic Non-Spinal Bone Plates,
Screws, and Washers - Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Submissions
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document provides recommendations for premarket notification (510(k))
submissions for non-resorbable bone plate, screw, and washer devices. These devices are
indicated for orthopedic bone fixation and exclude indications for spinal, mandibular,
maxillofacial, cranial, and orbital fracture fixation.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, refer to the FDA guidance document titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary
Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II.

Background

Non-spinal, non-resorbable bone plates, screws and washers are implants intended for bone
fixation. These are class II medical devices for which the safety and effectiveness are wellestablished. This guidance is intended to facilitate consistency in information provided in
submissions by addressing common deficiencies related to device description and performance
testing and by identifying applicable cross-cutting guidances and consensus standards. Certain
orthopedic non-spinal metallic bone screws and washers under product codes HTN, HWC, and
NDG and non-spinal bone plates under product code HRS (see Section III. Scope below for more
information) may also be appropriate for submission of a 510(k) through the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway. For more information, refer to FDA’s guidance document titled
“Orthopedic Non-Spinal Metallic Bone Screws and Washers - Performance Criteria for Safety
and Performance Based Pathway” and “Orthopedic Fracture Fixation Plates - Performance
Criteria for Safety and Performance Based Pathway.”
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements
of a premarket notification (510(k)) submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and
FDA’s guidance document titled “Electronic Submission Template for Medical Device 510(k)
Submissions.”

IV. Premarket Submission Recommendations
A.

Indications for Use

For each subject device, the intended use(s)/indications(s) should be stated, and a comparison of
the intended use/indications for use to one or more legally marketed predicate device(s) should
be included in your submission. Please note that differences in indications for use (e.g., disease,
condition, patient population) may prompt a request for additional information to support the
new indication. 1
Indications for use statements should include the specific anatomical location to be treated (e.g.,
femur, tibia, fibula, clavicle, humerus, ulna, carpal bones, tarsal bones), along with the intended
use of the device, such as:
• long or short bone fracture fixation
• small bone 2 fragment or fracture fixation
• arthrodesis of a joint or osteotomy of the small bones
We recommend that the indications for use statements for these devices avoid vague language
(e.g., "bone fixation" as an intended use, or "small bones" as an anatomical location) to help
reduce ambiguity and clarify appropriate device use. In the context of this example, an
indications for use statement such as, "[The subject device] is intended for fracture fixation of
small bones of the hand and foot" can be more appropriate as it more specifically describes the
condition intended to be treated and the associated anatomical location. Additionally, 510(k)
submissions involving any spinal or non-orthopedic uses should be submitted in a separate
510(k) submission to the appropriate review group or Office of Health Technology (OHT).
If seeking an indication for use in patients with osteopenia, osteoporosis, or other forms of poor
bone strength, 3 comparison should be made to one or more legally marketed predicate device(s)
intended for use in the same anatomical location with similar indications. If comparing to a
predicate device that is indicated for a more general patient population, additional information
and/or testing may be requested to demonstrate adequate performance to support the intended
use.
For bone plates or screws with pediatric indications, we recommend you identify the pediatric
subpopulation(s) (e.g., newborn, infant, child, and adolescent) along with the associated age
Within the 510(k) paradigm, any change in indications for use that raises different questions of safety and
effectiveness and therefore precludes a meaningful comparison with the predicate device constitutes a new intended
use and the subject device would be deemed “not substantially equivalent” to the predicate device. See also FDA’s
guidance document titled “The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications
[510(k)]”.
2
For the purposes of this guidance, the term "small bone" refers to bones of the wrist, hand, and foot.
3
For the purposes of this guidance, “poor bone strength” is a clinically relevant increased susceptibility of bone to
fracture or hardware failure, where bone strength is a function of bone quantity (measured as mass = density x
volume), quality (e.g., microarchitecture, material properties), and turnover (Licata A. Bone density vs bone quality:
what's a clinician to do? Cleve Clin J Med. 2009 Jun;76(6):331-6).

groups that the devices are intended to treat. The risks associated with growth plate disturbance
are generally related to the expected growth remaining. Supplemental information may be
requested to support marketing submissions for devices indicated for skeletally immature
patients (defined as patients with relevant open epiphyseal growth plate(s)). For additional
guidance, please refer to the guidance document entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric
Medical Devices”.

You should submit engineering drawings for each size and part number that include critical
dimensions and tolerances. Alternatively, you should supply representative drawings with a table
of each part number that includes critical dimensions, as follows, for each size:
• Plates: plate angulation (if applicable), minimum and maximum length, minimum and
maximum width in the structurally critical region, minimum and maximum thickness in
structurally critical region, screw hole diameter, and distance between screw holes.
• Screws: minimum and maximum length, threaded diameter, core diameter, axial thread
length, thread pitch, screw head diameter, height, and thread feature if applicable.
For devices incorporating embedded fibers, such as carbon fiber reinforced PEEK (CFR PEEK),
the following material parameters should be included in the device description: percent fiber
used, length of fibers (average and distribution), fiber direction, and sizing agent used (for
interfacial adhesion between fiber and polymer). These parameters may impact the conditions
under which delamination between fiber and matrix occurs, which could impact device
performance. This is further discussed in Section IV.K below.

If the device is provided with surgical instrumentation, the instruments should also be identified
in the submission, along with the associated classification regulation(s). For example, many
instruments that are for general use and can be used in any generic orthopedic bone plate or
screw implantation procedure, are regulated under 21 CFR 878.4800 Manual surgical instrument
for general use or 21 CFR 888.4540 Orthopedic manual surgical instrument. These instruments
are considered class I and are exempt from 510(k) review. Descriptive information, as shown in
Table 6, for class II, device-specific instruments 4 should be included in the device description

Predicate Comparison

For devices reviewed under the 510(k) process, manufacturers should compare their new device
to a similar legally marketed predicate device to support its substantial equivalence (section

513(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act); 21 CFR 807.87(f)) unless
utilizing the optional approach identified in the FDA’s guidance document titled “Safety and
Performance Based Pathway.” (See “Orthopedic Non-Spinal Metallic Bone Screws and Washers
- Performance Criteria for Safety and Performance Based Pathway” and “Orthopedic Fracture
Fixation Plates - Performance Criteria for Safety and Performance Based Pathway”). This
comparison should provide information to show how your device is similar to and different from
the predicate. Side by side comparisons, whenever possible, are desirable. See Tables 7, 8, 9, and
10 below for examples of how this information can be organized. These tables are not intended
to represent an exhaustive list of comparative parameters; ensure you provide all relevant device
descriptive characteristics as outlined in Section IV.B, above. The predicate device comparison
section of your submission should also include a discussion of why any differences in
technological characteristics identified in the table(s) below do not raise different safety and
effectiveness questions, and how the subject device is substantially equivalent to the predicate(s).
In the case that information from a previous clearance is being leveraged to support substantial
equivalence of the subject device, changes to certain parameters can be omitted if they are not
expected to impact technological characteristics, biocompatibility, or sterilization methods. In
such cases, engineering rationale or scientific justification can be considered in lieu of detailed
comparative information as outlined below. We recommend you submit a Pre-Submission to
discuss your justification with FDA. For more information refer to the Q-Submission guidance.

Additional specific considerations for your predicate comparison are as follows:
• The materials used for bone plates and bone screws impact the mechanical performance
of these devices. If your plate and/or screw components use different manufacturing
methods, processing steps and/or materials than the predicates you have identified,
additional material characterization may be requested, such as fatigue performance of the
plate, or mechanical evaluations of the plate/screw interface. We recommend you submit
a Pre-Submission to discuss the testing plans with FDA, per the Q-Submission guidance.
• Metallic fracture fixation hardware components that are generally in contact with
components made of dissimilar metals may result in galvanic corrosion. Additionally,
novel materials may raise questions regarding corrosion in that corrosion may cause
premature failure of the device and adverse biological reactions. If your plate or screw
system contains metallic components that are different from the predicate device, or if the
combination of metals in the subject system is different or has known susceptibility to
corrosion (e.g., connections of nitinol and stainless steel components), additional
information may be necessary to demonstrate that corrosion susceptibility over the entire
surface of the final finished device and interfacing components is equal to or less than
that measured in a legally marketed device with the same intended use. ASTM F2129
Standard Test Method for Conducting Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization
Measurements to Determine the Corrosion Susceptibility of Small Implant Devices may
be appropriate to analyze corrosion susceptibility of your device. We recommend you
submit a Pre-Submission to discuss the testing plans with FDA, per the Q-Submission
guidance.
• For bundled submissions 5 such as those seeking clearance for combinations of plates,
screws, and/or washers (i.e., plating systems) intended for one or more anatomical
locations, we recommend providing a comparison table that includes all of the devices in
the submission organized into groups by anatomical location and corresponding
indications for use, and identifying worst-case subject and predicate devices within each

titled, "Bundling Multiple Devices or Multiple Indications in a Single Submission.”

group. For example, grouping by the intended anatomical locations for a wide range of
plate designs can facilitate determination of the worst-case subject plate(s) for each
identified anatomical location based on the expected load-bearing capacity. These
comparison tables should provide a comprehensive comparison of the subject device(s)
technological characteristics in comparison to a legally marketed predicate. Evaluation of
mechanical performance (e.g., bench testing) should be also conducted utilizing the
worst-case subject device within each group. The type of performance evaluation along
with the reference document for those evaluations (e.g., 510(k) number, relevant
guidance) should be provided in the comparison table. To ensure the test results can be
adequately evaluated, information for each group should be provided in a tabular format,
as outlined in Section IV.K of this guidance document. Examples of recommended
information to include in a bundled submission and an example format for critical
dimensions for bone plates and bone screws are provided in Table 11 (note that a similar
approach could be taken for washers/bolt nuts as well).

Labeling

The premarket notification must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). Proposed labels and labeling, sufficient to describe the bone
plates, screws, and washers, their intended use, and the directions for use should be provided.
As prescription devices, bone plates, screws, and washers are exempt from having adequate
directions for use under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act as long as the conditions in 21 CFR
801.109 are met. For instance, labeling should include adequate information for practitioner use
of the device, including indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of
administration and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR
801.109(d)).
In addition to requirements in 21 CFR part 801, labeling should include the following
information:
• Device description (including material and sterility status);
• Device use (including single-use/reusable, intended users or specific patient populations);
• Contraindications (e.g., active infection, inability to comply with post-operative weight
bearing instructions, inadequate bone stock or poor blood supply);
• Warnings (e.g., not to use the device across an active growth plate for devices indicated
for pediatric use);
• MR safety information (refer to Section IV.J);
• Cleaning and sterilization instructions, if applicable (refer to Sections IV.E and IV.F);
and
• Removal instructions (particularly for devices indicated for pediatric use), as appropriate.
Additionally, since plating systems can contain many different plate types and components for
creating a fracture fixation construct, we recommend that you provide information in the labeling
to aid the surgeon in proper construct selection (e.g., identification of materials for system
components, description of screw range compatible with the plating system, and a surgical
technique that describes how to select system components for that particular technique).
For plate(s) made of anisotropic materials, if the submission includes labeling that instructs users
to contour plates to fit varying patient anatomies, we recommend also including in the 510(k)
submission testing and/or justification demonstrating that the plate(s) maintains adequate
strength following such bending. This is further discussed in Section IV.K.1 below.

E.

Sterility

Significance: Bone plates, screws, washers, and patient contacting instrumentation should be
adequately sterilized to minimize infections and related complications.
Recommendation: For bone plates, screws, and washers, and instruments labeled as sterile, we
recommend that you provide information for the finished device in accordance with FDA’s
guidance document titled “Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile.”

F. Reprocessing (including single-use devices provided nonsterile and intended for sterile processing)
Significance: Many of the patient contacting instruments associated with bone plates, screws,
and washers are reused, and should be adequately cleaned and sterilized between uses to
minimize infections and prevent device degradation. Bone plates, screws, and washers can also
be single-use medical devices initially supplied as non-sterile to the user and necessitate the user
to process (clean and sterilize) the device prior to its use.
Cleaning instructions in the labeling should clearly identify their applicability for reprocessing
soiled reusable instruments or their applicability to new and uncontaminated implants and
instruments prior to sterilization.
Recommendation: Instructions on how to reprocess a reusable device or process a single-use
device that is provided non-sterile to the user are critical to ensure that a device is appropriately
prepared for its initial and/or subsequent uses and should be included in the labeling.
Instructions for cleaning should be designed and validated for the type of contamination
anticipated on the device, based on its intended use. Accordingly, there may be separate,
dedicated cleaning instructions; for new, uncontaminated single-use devices prior to sterilization,
as well as separate, dedicated instructions for routine cleaning of contaminated reusable medical
instruments prior to sterilization. In these circumstances, such instructions should indicate that
single-use devices such as implants, should be cleaned separately from soiled reusable devices to
prevent cross contamination.
The removal of all residues of manufacturing materials such as lubricants, oils, particulates, and
other debris should occur during the manufacturing process, as part of Good Manufacturing
Practices (see 21 CFR Part 820). Additionally, health care facilities are unlikely to have the
capacity, materials, or adequately trained personnel to remove residues of manufacturing
materials from medical devices. Validated cleaning steps should be performed for removing
manufacturing contaminants from your implants at the site of manufacture, in accordance with
your quality management system.
For recommendations regarding the development and validation of reprocessing parameters and
the reprocessing instructions in your proposed device labeling, refer to FDA’s guidance
document titled “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods
and Labeling.”
The following list includes some additional considerations for reprocessing instructions that are
included in the labeling for bone plates, screws, and washers provided non-sterile to the end user:
• Final rinse water quality should include specifications qualified for the device’s intended
use. For example, Critical Water, as currently defined by ANSI/AAMI ST108 Water for
the processing of medical devices, is recommended to address various concerns for
implantable devices.

•

We recommend that the labeling include a statement to warn against use of devices that
may have become damaged or contaminated. For example: “If the device has become
damaged or contaminated, it should NOT be reprocessed and should be properly disposed
of.”
If the labeling instructs the end user to reprocess (sterilize, or clean and sterilize)
“opened-but-unused” devices, validated instructions (for sterilization, or cleaning and
sterilization) should be included in the labeling. In these circumstances, we recommend
that labeling designated for “Opened-but-Unused” products include comprehensive
instructions that:
1. explicitly define “contaminated” and characterize the conditions under which a
device would be considered “unused.”
Note: FDA considers that:
• a statement such as "no contamination with body fluids" is not adequate,
as not all contamination is necessarily visible;
• a device which has been introduced to the sterile field, even if “unused,”
may be contaminated as such items may have been subjected to
aerosolized contaminants or other sources of contamination; and
• all handling should be considered a potential source of contamination.
2. provide validated reprocessing instructions for “Opened-but-Unused” product that
are consistent with definitions as recommended above.
We recommend that reprocessing validation activities for bone plates, screws, and
washers account for the use of sterilization trays, and instructions in the labeling should
be consistent with these validation activities (e.g., if trays were not stacked during the
validation activities, then a “Do Not Stack Trays” warning should be included).
We recommend that information about the sterilization trays be included in the
submission for bone plates, screws, and washers. If a third party, general use sterilization
tray is utilized, the 510(k) number should be provided. For dedicated sterilization trays
that are unique to a particular orthopedic system, adequate device description information
should be provided, including an explanation of the tray dimensions, material, and load
configuration and contents. If you intend to leverage information from a previously
validated worst-case system, you should also include an explanation of how the challenge
device is applicable to the subject system, in accordance with FDA-recognized consensus
standard, ISO 17665: Sterilization of health care products – Moist heat – Requirements
for the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for medical
devices.

G.

Pyrogenicity

Significance: Pyrogenicity testing is used to help protect patients from the risk of febrile reaction
due to gram-negative bacterial endotoxins and/or chemicals that can leach from a medical device
(e.g., material-mediated pyrogens).
Recommendation: To address the risks associated with the presence of bacterial endotoxins,
bone plates, screws, and washers provided sterile should meet pyrogen limit specifications by
following the recommendations outlined in FDA’s guidance document titled “ Submission and
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices
Labeled as Sterile.” You should also follow the recommendations in “Guidance for Industry
Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers.” To address the risks associated with
material-mediated endotoxins, follow the recommendations in FDA’s guidance document titled
“Use of International Standard ISO-10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1:
Evaluation and testing within a risk management process’.”
For devices intended to be labeled as “non-pyrogenic,” we recommend that both bacterial
endotoxins and material-mediated pyrogens be addressed.

H.

Shelf Life and Packaging

Significance: Package stability (shelf life) and package performance (integrity) testing is
conducted to support the proposed package shelf life (expiration date) and performance. Testing
should also be conducted to evaluate any changes to device performance or functionality.
Recommendation: For devices provided sterile, you should provide a description of the
packaging, including how it will maintain the device’s sterility, a description of the package
validation test methods and/or declaration of conformity to relevant package validation test
standards, but not the package test data. We recommend that package integrity test methods
include simulated distribution and associated package integrity testing, as well as simulated
(and/or real time) aging and associated seal strength testing, to validate package integrity and
shelf life claims. We recommend you follow the methods described in ISO 11607-1 Packaging
for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier
systems and packaging systems and ISO 11607-2 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical
devices – Part 2: Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes.
We recommend that you provide a summary of the test methods and/or declaration of conformity
to relevant standards used for your shelf life testing and the conclusions drawn from your results.
If accelerated aging methods are used for shelf life testing, we recommend that you specify the
way in which the packaged devices were aged and provide a rationale to explain how the results
of shelf life testing, based on accelerated aging, are representative of the results if the packaged
device were aged in real time. We recommend that you age your packaged devices as per ASTM
F1980 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems for Medical Devices and
specify the environmental parameters established to attain the expiration date. For devices or
components containing polymeric materials or coatings, you should conduct testing on real-time
aged samples to confirm the results of the accelerated aging study. This testing should be
conducted in parallel with 510(k) review and clearance, with results documented to file in the
design history file (i.e., the complete test reports do not need to be submitted to FDA).
With respect to evaluating the effects of aging on device performance or functionality, shelf life
studies should evaluate the critical physical and mechanical properties of the device to ensure it
will perform adequately and consistently during the entire proposed shelf life. To evaluate device
functionality, we recommend that you assess each of the bench tests described in Section IV.K
and repeat all tests that evaluate design components or characteristics that are potentially affected
by aging.

I.

Biocompatibility

Significance: Bone plates, screws, washers, and accompanying surgical instrumentation contain
patient-contacting materials, which, when used for their intended purpose, (i.e., contact type and
duration), may induce a harmful biological response.
Recommendation: You should determine the biocompatibility of all patient-contacting materials
present in your device (this includes implants and device-specific instrumentation). If your
device(s) in its final finished form is identical in chemical composition, manufacturing, and
processing methods, and any differences in geometry or surface properties are not expected to
adversely impact the biological response compared to a legally marketed bone plate(s), screw(s),
washer(s), or instrument(s) with a history of successful use, you may reference previous testing
experience, or the literature, if appropriate. For metallic devices it may be appropriate to
reference a recognized consensus standard, while for polymeric devices, a Letter of
Authorization (LOA) for a device Master File (MAF) could be provided. You should refer to the
following FDA webpage for additional information on using device MAFs:
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-approval-pma/master-files. In addition to the
device material information, you should provide information to demonstrate that the subject
device is identical to a legally marketed device with respect to manufacturing material
formulations, processes, packaging, and sterilization methods (if applicable) in its final finished
form. Attachment F of the FDA’s guidance document titled “Use of International Standard ISO
10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process’,” includes example documentation language that may be utilized.
If you are unable to identify a legally marketed predicate device with the same nature of contact
and contact duration that uses the same materials and manufacturing process as used in your
device, we recommend that you conduct and provide a biocompatibility evaluation as
recommended in FDA’s guidance document titled “Use of International Standard ISO-10993-1,
‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process’.” The evaluation should explain the relationship between the identified
biocompatibility risks, the information available to mitigate the identified risks, and any
knowledge gaps that remain. You should then identify any biocompatibility testing or other
evaluations that were conducted to mitigate any remaining risks. We recommend that you
consider the recommendations in this guidance, which identifies the types of biocompatibility
assessments that should be considered and recommendations regarding how to conduct related
tests.
Per ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing
within a risk management process and Attachment A of FDA’s guidance document titled “Use of
International Standard ISO-10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1:
Evaluation and testing within a risk management process’,” bone plates, screws, and washers are
implant devices in contact with tissue/bone for a permanent contact duration. Therefore, the
following endpoints should be addressed in your biocompatibility evaluation:
• cytotoxicity;
• sensitization;
17

•

irritation or intracutaneous reactivity;
acute systemic toxicity;
material mediated pyrogenicity;
subacute/subchronic toxicity;
genotoxicity;

chronic toxicity; and
carcinogenicity.

For device-specific, patient-contacting device instrumentation in contact with tissue/bone for a
limited contact duration, the following endpoints should be addressed in your biocompatibility
evaluation:
• cytotoxicity;
• sensitization;
• irritation or intracutaneous reactivity;
• acute systemic toxicity; and
• material mediated pyrogenicity.

J. Magnetic Resonance (MR) Compatibility for Passive
Implants
Significance: MR imaging of patients with bone plates, screws, and washers poses the following
potential hazards:
• movement of the implant, resulting in tissue damage or displacement of the device;
• heating of the tissue surrounding the implant and subsequent tissue damage; and/or
• image artifacts that may render the MR images uninterpretable or misleading.
Recommendation: We recommend that you address the issues affecting safety and compatibility
of your device in the MR environment as described in the FDA’s guidance document titled
“Testing and Labeling Medical Devices for Safety in the Magnetic Resonance (MR)
Environment.”
For devices anticipated for use in the MR environment that have not been evaluated for safety in
the MR environment, we recommend you follow FDA’s recommendations in Section VIII.D. of
the above referenced guidance document.
If you would like to market bone plates, screws, or washers of various sizes and shapes as “MR
Conditional,” then we recommend you follow our recommendations in the FDA’s guidance
document titled “Assessment of Radiofrequency-Induced Heating in the Magnetic Resonance
(MR) Environment for Multi-Configuration Passive Medical Devices.”

K.

Non-Clinical Testing

The 510(k) submission should include information to demonstrate that the subject device
provides substantially equivalent fixation of a fracture site. We recommend that you conduct the
testing recommended below to evaluate the material and performance characteristics of your
worst-case device in its final finished form. If your plate, screw, or washer system is indicated
for use in multiple anatomical locations or if the system encompasses a large variety of device
designs, there may be more than one worst-case device that should be supported with mechanical
performance data. Please see Section IV.C for additional recommendations regarding bundled
submissions.
A sample size of five (5) units has historically been accepted as the minimum for bench testing.
Additional issues in testing (e.g., large inter-sample variability) or device design may warrant a
larger sample size.
For information on the recommended content and format of test reports for the testing described
in this section, refer to FDA’s guidance document titled “Recommended Content and Format of
Non-Clinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.”
For the FDA-recognized consensus standards identified below, supplemental documentation to
support a Declaration of Conformity is likely necessary as discussed in FDA’s guidance
document titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices,” as these standards contain variable methods and do not include acceptance
criteria for all testing recommended in this guidance. The supplemental documentation should
include the items specified in the report section of each testing annex in the consensus standard
(and listed below in Appendices A and B) used to support the premarket submission. Acceptance
criteria, if not included in the applicable FDA-recognized consensus standard(s), should be
provided with a supporting rationale to justify how the performance testing results support a
determination of substantial equivalence. We recommend that you can provide a comparison of
the subject device test results to the test results of a legally marketed predicate device with the
same intended use, in a tabular format such as the examples in Appendices A and B.
The following sections describe the recommended mechanical performance testing endpoints for
bone plates and screws. When a plating system’s overall construct and plate designs are similar
to the identified predicate, individual analysis of the worst-case plate and screw components as
listed below may be sufficient to establish substantial equivalence of the construct. When the
overall subject construct differs in fixation method or raises concerns about strength or stability
at the fracture site, additional construct evaluations such as bench testing or in vivo data may be
needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Additional endpoints or testing information may
be needed depending on the device design and comparison to the predicate device(s). Devices
which are made from polymers, metals, or metallic alloys with different properties compared to
the identified predicates, especially resorbable materials, may warrant additional performance
information such as component interface analysis (e.g., wear, corrosion) or fatigue strength
analysis. Technological characteristics that appear to create worse mechanical performance

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

compared to the identified predicates may warrant additional information to demonstrate
equivalent fracture fixation in construct strength, construct stiffness and fatigue performance.
Submissions for devices made of anisotropic materials should address shear strength of the
devices and risk for crack propagation through additional testing and/or scientific justification.
When evaluating a device(s) containing fibers, such as CFR PEEK, device parameters including
percent fiber used, length of fibers (average and distribution), fiber direction, and sizing agent
(for interfacial adhesion between fiber and polymer) should be taken into consideration as these
parameters can impact the mechanical performance of the device. Specific recommendations for
plate(s) made of anisotropic materials are discussed in Section IV.K.1 below.

(1)

Plate Mechanical Performance

Significance: Loss of fracture reduction or construct stiffness can cause
incomplete or absent osteosynthesis leading to device failure and revision surgery.
Mechanical performance testing of plates provides assurance of the device’s
ability to perform as intended.
Recommendation: Single cycle bend testing should be conducted on the worstcase subject plate in the worst-case load bearing region. When assessing the
mechanical performance of plates with a worst-case structurally critical region
(that can physically fit between the loading rollers of a four-point bend test), we
recommend performing testing per ASTM F382 Standard Specification and Test
Method for Metallic Bone Plates. The worst-case design selection should consider
plate thickness, second moment of area, length, and overall shape. Depending on
the particular plate geometry and dimensions, modifications to the test setup
outlined in ASTM F382, with appropriate justification, could be considered.
Outcomes for the single cycle (quasi-static) bend testing should include the
bending structural stiffness and the bending strength.
To ensure the test results can be adequately evaluated, we recommend you
provide testing information per ASTM F382 for subject and predicate tests in
tabular format, identifying any differences in test methods and providing a
justification for why these differences do not impact the comparability of results.
See Appendix A, Example Table of Plate Test Methods and Data Summary, for
an example of how test summary information could be organized.
Plates with similar design features and materials to predicate devices typically do
not warrant fatigue bend testing per ASTM F382. However, devices with
differences in technological features compared to traditional plating systems (e.g.,
different material selection, complex designs, plate modularities) may warrant
fatigue testing to demonstrate substantial equivalence. Plates with their worst-case
structurally critical region present in the uniform portion of the plate shaft are
expected to show similar trends when comparing static performance and fatigue
performance (if applicable).

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

If you use an alternative method to ASTM F382, the following should be taken
into account when designing the test setup to determine component or construct
equivalence: the worst-case clinically relevant loading, clinically relevant loading
modes (e.g., axial compression, bending, torsion), differences in material
properties, and differences in dimensions and geometry of the subject and
predicate devices.
For a plate(s) made of anisotropic materials, if bending/contouring is not
explicitly discouraged in the labeling, the submission should include additional
testing and/or a scientific justification to confirm the plate(s) is able to maintain
mechanical performance following worst-case contouring consistent with the
instructions provided in the labeling and common clinical practice.

(2)

Screw Mechanical Performance

Significance: Inadequate mechanical performance can cause screws to fracture
during insertion or during healing. Torsional strength analysis provides assurance
of strength. Loss of fixation can lead to premature failure of the screws or backout
causing pain from increased prominence. Pullout strength analysis provides
assurance of fixation strength.
Recommendation: When assessing the mechanical performance of screws, we
recommend performing 1) insertion/removal torque testing, 2) torsional strength
testing, and 3) pullout strength testing per ASTM F543 Standard Specification
and Test Methods for Metallic Medical Bone Screws. For screws with
technological characteristics (e.g., screw thread designs) that conform to FDArecognized consensus standards (e.g., ASTM F543), an engineering analysis using
the thread geometry, based upon the equation described by Chapman, et al, 6 can
also be utilized to demonstrate equivalence for pullout strength in lieu of testing.
Insertion/removal torque testing, torsional strength testing, and pullout strength
testing should each be conducted on the corresponding worst-case screws. The
worst-case design selection should consider critical parameters such as
major/minor screw diameters, thread pitch and trailing angles, polar moment of
inertia, thread length, flute design. Reported results for torsional strength testing
should include the torsional yield strength and maximum load. Reported results
for insertion/removal torque testing should include, respectively, the maximum
recorded insertion and removal torques. Reported results for pullout testing
should include the maximum load recorded during screw pullout. If pullout
testing is not physically performed, then insertion and removal torque testing can
be leveraged to confirm that the threads are adequately designed and attached to
the screw core diameter.

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

To ensure the test results can be adequately evaluated, we recommend you
provide reportable information per ASTM F543 for subject and predicate tests in
tabular format, identifying any differences in test methods and providing a
justification for why these differences do not impact the comparability of results.
See Appendix B of this guidance, Example Table of Screw Test Methods and
Data Summary, for an example of how test summary information can be
organized.
Screws with traditional characteristics (e.g., fully threaded) and materials (e.g.,
stainless steel, titanium alloy) as described in the consensus standards referenced
in this guidance typically do not warrant additional evaluation beyond the test
methods described in ASTM F543. However, screws with differences in
technological characteristics compared to traditional screws (e.g., different
material selection, complex designs, modularities) may warrant additional static
and fatigue testing to demonstrate substantial equivalence. We recommend you
refer to ASTM F1264 Standard Specification and Test Methods for
Intramedullary Fixation Devices for information on fatigue three- or four-point
bending evaluation methods for screws.
If you use an alternative method to ASTM F543, the following should be taken
into account when designing the test setup: worst-case clinically relevant loading
conditions, differences in material properties, and differences in dimensions and
geometry of the subject and predicate devices.

(3)

Computational Modeling and Engineering Analysis

Significance: Computational modeling (e.g., finite element analysis) and
engineering analysis (e.g., dimensional comparison and theoretical calculation of
mechanical performance based on empirical models) can be used as an alternative
to demonstrate that the mechanical behavior of the worst-case subject plates and
screws are expected to be equal to or better than the predicate devices.
Recommendation: If computational modeling or engineering analysis is used to
address some or all of the endpoints identified in Sections IV.K.1 and IV.K.2,
modeling should be performed on the worst-case plate(s) and screw(s). Specific
subject plate geometries, such as changes in geometries over the plate length,
curvatures, and differences in material, can make static and fatigue comparisons
difficult to account for in engineering analysis alone. Therefore, we recommend
validation testing to confirm the accuracy of your computational modeling,
especially for unique design features/components interfaces.
If no physical testing of specimens is conducted, your computational modeling
and/or engineering analysis should address all endpoints identified in Sections
IV.K.1 and IV.K.2. Refer to FDA’s guidance document titled “Reporting of
Computational Modeling Studies in Medical Device Submissions” for additional
details regarding model validation and reporting numerical simulations.
22

Specifically, refer to Subject Matter Appendix II of the referenced guidance for
details concerning computational solid mechanics.
An engineering analysis can be used in lieu of bench testing to support substantial
equivalence of the yield strength and structural bending stiffness of a plate if the
predicate plate dimensions and material properties (modulus and yield strength)
are known, and if the predicate plate is manufactured utilizing the same device
material and manufacturing materials and processes as the subject device. The
second moment of area and material properties at multiple cross-sections for both
the subject and predicate plates can be used to calculate the worst-case theoretical
structural bending stiffness and yield moment of each plate.
Similarly, for screws, an engineering analysis can be used in lieu of bench testing
to support substantial equivalence of a screw’s torsional performance if the
predicate screw dimensions (e.g., core diameter, cannulation diameter) and
material properties (modulus and yield strength) are known and if the predicate
screw is manufactured utilizing the same material and manufacturing processes as
the subject device.
As referenced above in Section IV.K.2, an engineering analysis based upon the
equation described by Chapman, et al, can be used in lieu of testing to evaluate
pullout strength of the screw if the predicate screw dimensions are known, and if
the material ultimate shear stress (S) and failure modes of the bone foam substrate
are equivalent between the subject and predicate devices. For example, a material
ultimate shear stress value of 3.395 MPa can be used to represent 20 pcf bone
foam in your analysis. Note that for this analysis to be appropriate, the
instrumentation identified in the associated surgical technique manual should
allow for close to idealized thread engagement. If this assumption is not accurate
for your scenario, then the identified engineering analysis may not be appropriate
for the assessment of the subject device.
For all screws, extract the relevant dimensions below (i.e., screw major diameter,
screw minor diameter, screw pitch, and axial thread length). These dimensions
will be used to quantify thread engagement and calculate the theoretical pullout
strengths for the smallest axial thread lengthened screws in the device system
using the following equation:
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐴𝐴 = {𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐿𝐿 ∗ 𝜋𝜋 ∗ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇}

Fs = predicted shear failure force (N)
S = material ultimate shear stress (MPa)
A = thread shear area (mm2)
L = axial thread length (mm) including only threads that have the nominal major
diameter where complete purchase is expected (e.g., excluding the screw tip) of
thread engagement in material
23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Dmajor = major diameter (mm)
TSF = Thread Shape Factor (dimensionless) = (0.5 + 0.57735 d/p)
d = thread depth (mm) = (Dmajor – Dminor)/2
Dminor = minor (root) diameter (mm)
p = thread pitch (mm)
A justification should be provided to support why the evaluated screws selected
are worst case and also for each variable used in the Chapman analysis (e.g., bone
foam per ASTM F1839 Standard Specification for Rigid Polyurethane Foam for
Use as a Standard Material for Testing Orthopaedic Devices and Instruments).
Axial pullout performance is heavily influenced by amount of interface and the
failure mechanism at the interface with bone foam. Factors such as decreasing
outer diameter and decreasing axial thread length may help identify the worst
case.
Dimensions used for calculations should be clearly listed for each theoretical
outcome. Dimensional values used in this calculation should be consistent with
the values listed on the screw engineering drawings.

L.

Non-Clinical Animal and/or Clinical Performance Testing

Non-clinical animal studies 7 and/or clinical evidence are generally unnecessary for most bone
plates and screws; however, such testing may be requested in situations such as the following:
• indications for use dissimilar from legally marketed devices of the same type;
• new technology, i.e., technology different from that used in legally marketed devices of
the same type (e.g., dynamic or flexible fixation systems that differ in stiffness or
strength to other predicates), yet does not raise different questions of safety or
effectiveness; or
• cases where engineering and/or animal testing raise issues that warrant further evaluation
with clinical evidence.
We encourage manufacturers to take advantage of the Q-Submission Program to ensure that the
animal study protocol addresses safety concerns and contains elements which are appropriate for
a regulatory submission. Additionally, for information and recommendations regarding animal
studies used to support medical device submissions, refer to the FDA guidance document titled
“General Considerations for Animal Studies Intended to Evaluate Medical Devices.” If you are
proposing to use a non-animal testing method in lieu of an animal study, we recommend that you
discuss the proposal using the Q-Submission Program.
We will consider alternatives to clinical testing when the proposed alternatives are supported by
an adequate scientific rationale. If a clinical investigation involving one or more subjects is
7

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.

conducted to demonstrate substantial equivalence, the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE)
regulation, 21 CFR Part 812 applies unless the investigation is excepted from the IDE
requirements (see 21 CFR 812.3(a) and (c)). Generally, we believe bone plates and screws
addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of
21 CFR 812. See the FDA’s Guidance document titled “Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk
Medical Device Studies.” In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 812, sponsors of such trials
may also be subject to FDA regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR Part 56)
and informed consent (21 CFR Part 50).
When data from clinical investigations conducted outside the U.S. are submitted to FDA for
these devices, the requirements of 21 CFR 812.28 may apply. 8 21 CFR 812.28 outlines the
conditions for FDA acceptance of clinical data from investigations conducted outside the U.S.
when submitted to support premarket submissions. For more information, see the FDA’s
guidance document titled “Acceptance of Clinical Data to Support Medical Device Applications
and Submissions: Frequently Asked Questions.”
In some cases, “real-world data” (RWD) may be used to support expansion of indications,
changes in surgical technique, or changes in design/prominence for a device for which 510(k)
clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of RWD for a legally marketed
device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the situation. Specifically, if a cleared
device is being used in the normal course of medical practice, an IDE would likely not be
required. For additional information regarding this topic, please refer to the FDA’s guidance
document titled “Use of Real-World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for
Medical Devices.”

21 CFR 807.81(a)(3) provides that a device change or modification “that could significantly
affect the safety or effectiveness of the device” or represents “a major change or modification in
the intended use of the device” requires a new 510(k). 9 The changes or modifications listed
below are examples of changes that may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is
not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that are likely to require submission of a

This applies to data from clinical investigations that began on or after February 21, 2019, and are submitted to
support a premarket submission, including IDEs, premarket approval applications (PMAs), and 510(k)s.

Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), enacted as part of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2023, added section 515C “Predetermined Change Control Plans for Devices” to the FD&C Act
(Pub. L. No. 117-328). Section 515C provides FDA with express authority to approve or clear PCCPs for devices
requiring premarket approval or premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that supplemental
applications (section 515C(a)) and new premarket notifications (section 515C(b)) are not required for a change to a
device that would otherwise require a premarket approval supplement or new premarket notification if the change is
consistent with a PCCP approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides that FDA may require that a PCCP
include labeling for safe and effective use of a device as such device changes pursuant to such plan, notification
requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan, and performance requirements for
changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your marketing submission, we
encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH. See FDA’s guidance
“Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.”

new 510(k). For additional details, see FDA’s guidance document titled “Deciding When to
Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.”
Such changes or modifications include:
• The addition of a thinner or thicker bone plate, or screws with lower pullout strength than
a legally marketed predicate device – FDA considers this change to be a significant
change in design. These types of changes could significantly affect the safety and
effectiveness of the device by introducing a new potential worst-case scenario for some
failure modes (e.g., mechanical failure of the plate, pain and irritation from prominence,
loss of screw stability).
• A change in sterilization method from “Established Category A” sterilization methods to
“Established Category B” or “Novel” sterilization methods – this type of change could
significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of the device by introducing a new or
increased risk of device contamination. See FDA’s guidance document titled
“Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k))
Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile” for a discussion of sterilization methods.
• A change in material – a change in material type (except changes from a weaker common
metal to a stronger common metal, as discussed below), formulation, chemical
composition, or material processing could significantly affect the safety and effectiveness
of the device. The change may introduce new or increased biocompatibility concerns or a
change in the risks associated with device failure.
• A change in compatibility of system components – this change could significantly affect
the safety and effectiveness of the device by introducing a new worst-case scenario for a
failure mode or expand the indications for use of a cleared component.
FDA believes that the following modifications would generally not require a new 510(k):
• The addition of a bone plate, screw, or washer of identical design, material, and
processing to a legally marketed device, but of an intermediate size because this would
not generally introduce new or significantly modified risks or new worst-case failure
modes.
Modification in the sterilization process from one category A method to another category
A method as defined in FDA’s guidance document titled “Submission and Review of
Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled
as Sterile” (e.g., steam sterilization, gamma irradiation sterilization), if the change in
sterilization method can be justified as having no significant deleterious effect on the
mechanical or material properties of the device throughout the duration of its shelf life.
• A change in material from a weaker common metal to a stronger common metal which
conforms to an FDA recognized standard(s) and has a history of safe use for the same
indications (e.g., change in device from commercially pure titanium to stainless steel per
ASTM F138 or a change from commercially pure titanium to titanium alloy per ASTM
F136) where no new or increased biocompatibility concerns have been introduced.
• A change in compatible screws to include larger diameters within the range of legally
marketed screws with the same intended use and anatomical location (e.g., a wrist plating
system cleared with 2.0mm screws is modified to also include a 2.7mm diameter screw of

26

the same type), if it can be justified that the larger diameter screw does not introduce
changes to the plate interface or other factors affecting worst case.
