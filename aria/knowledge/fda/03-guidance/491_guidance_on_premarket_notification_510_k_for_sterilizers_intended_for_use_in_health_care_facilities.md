  title: Guidance on Premarket Notification 510(k) for Sterilizers Intended for Use
    in Health Care Facilities
---

This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA's 
Good Guidance Practices, GGP's. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person 
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if 
such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both. 
This guidance will be up dated in the nstt  vision to include the standard elemnts of GGP 's.

Preface 
This guidance was developed by the Infection Control Devices 
Branch, Division of General and ~estorative Devices (DGRD), 
Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health (CDRH), Food and Drug Administrati~n (FDA). 
FDA regulates the introduction of medical devices into interstate 
commerce. A person intending to market a sterilizer intended for 
use in a health care facility must submit a premarket 
notification [510(k)J submission to FDA at least 90 days prior to 
its introduction into interstate commerce. Regulations governing 
the general content and format of 510(k) submissions are codified 
under 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 8 0 7 .  
These general 
510(k) regulatory requirements are further discussed in guidance 
documents available from the CDRH Division of Small Manufacturers 
Assistance (DSMA). The intent of this guidance document is to 
provide additional direction regarding information and data which 
should be submitted to FDA in a 510(k) submission for a 
sterilizer intended for use in a health care facility- 
Sterilizer technology is expanding at an accelerating pace. 
Sterilizers can be complex in design and methods of sterilization 
are diverse. In spite of the complexity and diversity there are 
some common considerations that can be applied to virtually all 
510(k) submissions for sterilizers. 
FDA believes it is prudent 
to provide 510(k) applicants, and other interested parties, 
information describing these common elements in order to improve 
the .quality of submissions and subsequently reduce the regulatory 
review processing time. 
The guidance is based upon current publications, the literature, 
the combined experience and expertise of agency personnel 
involved in the evaluation of sterilization processes. Science 
.and the evaluation of medical devices are not static, rather they 
are evolutionary. As such, FDA may periodically update this 
- guidance, as necessary, to keep it current: Any comments on the 
content of this document are welcome and should be sent to the 
address noted under Section R.

D e f i n i t i o n s  
Bioburden: The naturally occurring microbial contaminatio- 
on a medical device prior to exposure to a microbicidal 
process. 
Bioburden Based Sterilization: A sterilization process wi--h 
parameters based upon the predetermined type and 
concentration of bioburden on the medical devices to be 
sterilized. This method is used in manufacturing processes 
and is not appropriate for health care facilities where the 
bioburden may fluctuate. 
Biological Indicator (BI): 
A measured and calibrated number 
of microorganisms with high resistance to the node of 
sterilization being'monitored, placed in or on a carrier a d  
packaged to maintain the integrity of the carrier and 
microorganisms. The microorganism count is known and is 
higher than the bioburden on the medical device to be 
sterilized. The BI is used to test the effectiyeness of the 
sterilization process by assessing the microbial lethality 
of the process. 
Chemical Indicator (CI): 
A carrier impregnated or filled 
with a chemical compound which, when exposed to specific 
chemical and/or physical conditions, will undergo a known 
reaction, such as a color change, or produce a measurable 
quantity of reaction products. A CI indicates that the 
medical device has been exposed to one or more process 
conditions, and unless the CI integrates ALL process 
conditions, it is not an adequate test for assessing the 
effectiveness of the process. 
Death Rate Curve (or Survivor Curve): 
The graphic 
representation of the microbial sterilization kinetics for a 
specific microbicidal agent on a defined microbial 
population. 
D-value (Dlo): 
The time required to kill 90%. (one 
logarithmic cycle) of a homogeneous population of 
microorganisms. For calculation purposes it is assumed tk?: 
the killing rate follows first-order kinetics. 
Inorganic and Organic Load: The naturally occurring or 
artificially placed inorganic (e-g., metal salts) or organic 
(e.g., proteins) contaminants on a medical device prior tc 
exposure to a microbicidal process. The naturally occurrizq 
organic load is also known as bioburden. 
Microbial Sterilization Kinetics: The quantitative 
mechanisms and effects of physical or chemical sterilizati~a 
agents on the death of microbes. 


Overkill Sterilization: 
A sterilization process that is 
based upon an arbitrarily established higher initial 
concentration and resistance of bioburden than that actually 
expected on the medical devices to be sterilized. Overkill 
processes typically are based upon a lo6 colony forming unit 
(CFU)/unit level of bioburden. This method is to be used 
for establishing process parameters for sterilizers used in 
health care facilities. 
Process and Product Qualification: Elements of the 
sterilization validation program consisting of selected 
engineering and microbiological demonstrations performed 
according to predefined protocols to show process' 
reproducibility and product acceptability. 
- 
Precleaning: The removal of foreign material, e.g:, organic 
or inorganic contaminants, from medical devices prlor to a 
decontamination, disinfection, or sterilization process, 
Process Residue: The microbicidal agent or by-products of 
sterilization remaining on a medical device after completion 
of the sterilization process. 
Spore: A dormant state of an organism, typically a 
bacterium or fungus, which exhibits a lack of biosynthetic 
activity and reduced respiratory activity. 
Sterilant: The active agent(s) which achieves 
sterilization. 
Sterile: The absolute state where all forms of life have 
been eliminated. In a practical sense absolute sterility 
cannot be proven, therefore sterility is considered achieved 
when organisms are eliminated, inactivated, or destroyed 
such that they are undetectable in standard media in which 
they have previously been found to proliferate. 
Sterility Assurance Level (SAL): A value indicating the 
probability of a survivor after a sterilization process. 
For example, an SAL of 
is the probability of one in one 
million nonsterile units after exposure to a sterilizat-ion 
process. 
Sterilization: An act or process which completely 
eliminates or destroys all forms of life, particularly 
microorganisms. 
Unit: The specified substrate or carrier upon which the 
specified number of test organisms are inoculated. A unit 
may be a specified volume, weight, or surface area. For 
example, a unit could be specified as an entire device, a 
component of a device (if the device must be disassembled 
prior to sterilization), or a portion of a device. 


19. Vegetative state: A n  active growth phase of an organism. 
20. 
Validation: 
A documented program which provides a high 
degree of assurance that a specific process will 
consistently produce a medical device that meets its 
predetermined specifications and quality attributes.

11. Documentation 
Presubmission Considerations for Applicants 
Establish that the sterilizer is a medical device subject to 
510(k) submission, i-e., it is intended for use in a health 
care facility to sterilize medical products. 
Discuss new technologies with FDA prior to 510(lc) submission 
to identify any unique aspects of testing or documentation. 
Contact the Chief, Infection Control Devices Branch as 
indicated in Part 11, Section Q. 
Determine whether the sterilant must comply with EPA 
regulations. Prior EPA certification, or concurrent EPA/FDA 
review is desirable to minimize data redundancy. 
Ensure that the 510(k) addresses all sections 21 CFR 807.87, 
Information Required In A Premarket Notification Submission. 
Ensure that the 510(k) submission addresses all-relevant 
elements of this guidance, or subnit a thorough 
justification for omission of information or data. Use the 
checklist in Section S. 
Ensure that there are marketed accessories necessary to 
achieve a functional system, or concurrent submission of 
510(k)s for necessary accessories. For example, acceptable 
sterilization wraps (except for a flash node), biological . 
and chemical indicators are necessary to provide a complete 
system for the user. FDA will not find a sterilizer 
equivalent until a functional system is in place. 
Prereview submissions. 510(k)s for sterilizers can be 
extensive. FDA review of a document is facilitated when the 
document is arranged in a well-structured format that has 
undergone a thorough presubmission critique by the applicant 
to eliminate documentation deficiencies. 
Recommendations for Protocols and Data Analysis 
Provide all test protocols which include the objectives, 
experimental methods, controls, observations, statistical 
analyses, if possible, or other quantitative analysis, and 
conclusions and coments. 
Clearly define the aicrobial challenge and justify that it 
is appropriate for the system under examination. 
Specify the recove- media and ensure that it contains all 
the elements for abundant qro.~th. Validace the recovery 
efficiency of the cedia and submi: a sumrzry of the 


v a l i d a t i o n .  
Define the n e u t r a l i z e r  f o r  t h e  s t e r i l a n t ,  i f  needed, and

The applicant must unequivocally demonstrate that the device 
can sterilize, to an acceptable SAL, all the medical 
products identified in the labeling, when used.in -accordance 
with the directions for use. 
2. 
Test Organisms 
Since a consistent type and concentration of bioburden 
cannot be assured or realistically evaluated in a health 
care facility, an overkill sterilization is necessary. The 
sterilization cycle is based upon an initial concentration 
of at least lo6 CFU (or Plaque Forming Units - PFU)/unit of 
a highly resistant organism to the process. Typically, the 
most resistant organism to a sterilization process is used 
based upon determination of D-values. Table 1 lists the 
commonly recognized test organisms for the classified

Sporicidal screening Test 
The applicant must provide a summary of the American Association 
of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Sporicidal Test, Section 
966.04, Volume 1, Page 141 [Horowitz, William, ed. Sporicidal 
test - official final action. Official Methods of Analysis of 
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Current 
Edition. Association of Official Analytical Chemists, 
Washington, D.C.]. 
This test is also used for EPA registration 
purposes. If EPA accepts or requests another test for 
registration purposes for an EPA regulated sterilant used with 
the subject device then a summary of the results from that test 
should be provided. Indicate the specified time for 
sterilization. 
. - 
Sterilization Process Equivalent Time 
Thermal resistance.of microorganisms can be considered in terms 
of equivalent process times (F,) at a given temperature. 
Saturated steam and dry heat sterilizers are special~cases 
where 
equivalent times are useful for evaluating the acceptability of 
the process conditions. 
Typically, dry heat and gravity steam sterilizers each employ 
similar operating modes and process conditions as a group (e.g., 
121° C and 15 psi for a regular steam cycle). Some dry heat and 
steam sterilizers may vary from the norm. As a general rule, a 
higher temperature results in a higher rate of death of 
microorganisms. Still, there are constraints to saturated steam 
and dry heat process conditions in order to maintain acceptable 
lethality conditions. 
Physical parameters and microbicidal effectiveness with standard 
test organisms have been extensively characterized for steam and 
'dry heat sterilizers. Actual operating temperatures can be 
correlated to a sterilization process equivalent time, or Fo 
-value (a special case equivalent time), at standard temperatures. 
Saturated steam operating temperature can be converted to 
equivalent microbial lethality anticipated at 121°C while dry 
heat temperatures can be converted to 170°C equivalent process 
times. An Fo of 12 (minutes) for both processes is minimally 
acceptable (12 log reduction). The method for conversion of 
proc=ss parameters is beyond the scope of this document. 
Mathematical methods are extensively described in the literature. 
Submit the equivalent process time and its method of derivation 
for the saturated steam or dry heat sterilizer for all modes of 
operation. 


D-Valuc Determination 
The D-value of an organism exposed t o  a s p e c i f i c  s t e r i l i z a t i o n

analysis o r  fraction negative analysis. 
For unclassified 
s t e r i l i z e r s  t h e  resistance p r o f i l e  of a battery of t e s t  organisms 
should be determined using survivor curves. 
Once the most 
r e s i s t a n t  test organism is identified ( o r  possible candidates 
t h a t  require more testing) with preliminary D-values from 
survivor curves, then tests should be conducted using t h e

In Use Tests 
Sterilizer performance must also be verified under in-use 
conditions. Articles sampled.after use should be precleaned (or 
decontaminated) according to the normal operationat reprocessing 
protocol of the health care facility where the samples are 
obtained. Assurance of meeting a stringent precleaning protocol 
is not a precondition since the robustness of the sterilization 
pr.ocess is part of this evaluation. Multiple tests with 
differing load conditions as indicated in labeling should be 
reported. 
'fter 
processing, the test articles are neutralized, if 
. necessary. The articles are immersed in the growth media, if 
possible, or subjected to an extraction method with the extract 
placed in growth media. Publications and the literature contain 
suitable extraction methods. 
Derivation of the Process Parameters 
The process parameters for the sterilizer shall be derived from 
the screening test, process equivalent times, D-value- 
calculations, simulated or actual use testing, 1/2 cycle and End 
Point tests, and any additional safety factors. For process 
validation an SAL of at least 
based upon the most resistant 
test organism, shall be demonstrated. Provide a thorough 
description of the derivation of the process parameters.

Processed Device/Naterial Qualification 
Introduction 
Labeling for a sterilizer indicates the types of medical devices 
and other medical products and/or the component materia-1s of a 
medical device or product that are compatible with the 
sterilization process (noted in this section as "articles"). 
Data shall be provided which attest to the compatibility of each 
of the listed articles with the sterilization process. The data 
shall address the effects of the process on the safety and 
effectiveness, e-g., functionality/specifications, of the claimed 
compatible articles, and the effects on the biocompatibility of 
the articles. 
The applicant must carefully consider labeling and the 
implications of the scope of the compatible articles on the 
potential test regimen. If the articles in the intended use 
statement in labeling are limited and specifically characterized 
then the scope of testing is a relatively simple matter. As the 
intended use becomes more generalized the scope of testing 
becomes more complex. For example, if ASTM 316 stainless steel 
instruments are indicated as compatible devices then the test 
article is basically defined. On the other hand, reference to 
"metal" instruments connotes a plethora of material 
possibilities. The same is true regarding a general reference to 
"polymers" rather than a specific class and type of polymer. 
When the labeling indicates a general class of articles that 
could be differentially affected by the sterilization process, 
the applicant must specify and justify a representative sample of 
articles from the class for testing. Even after 510(k) 
submission the applicant should- continue with a vigorous program 
to analyze new products and those articles that were not tested 
in the defined class. These data may serve as a basis for 
'labeling revisions or as a resource for users on the 
compatibility of the sterilizer- A s  noted in the labeling 
' ssction, users should be directed to call the manufacturer to 
obtain any current information on devices and materials not 
listed in the labeling. 
Even though testing may qualify an article for the'subject 
sterilization process the labeling ef the article may identify a 
specific type of sterilization process to be used. In this case, 
the labeling for the subject sterilizer cannot supersede the 
device labeling. The applicant may choose to communicate with 
the manufacturer of the qualified arricle to modify the labeling 
for the article. 
Ic may be possible that certain elt.:...-ents 
of this battery of 
testing can be combined with the bi>loqical tests noted in 
S2cticn K in order to minimize tes'
