This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA's
Good Guidance Practices, GGP's. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if
such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be up dated in the nstt vision to include the standard elemnts of GGP 's.

Sterilizers
Intended for Use in Health Care Facilities

Preface
This guidance was developed by the Infection Control Devices
Branch, Division of General and ~estorativeDevices (DGRD),
Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Center for Devices and
Radiological Health (CDRH), Food and Drug Administrati~n(FDA).
FDA regulates the introduction of medical devices into interstate
commerce. A person intending to market a sterilizer intended for
use in a health care facility must submit a premarket
notification [510(k)J submission to FDA at least 90 days prior to
its introduction into interstate commerce. Regulations governing
the general content and format of 510(k) submissions are codified
under 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 8 0 7 . These general
510(k) regulatory requirements are further discussed in guidance
documents available from the CDRH Division of Small Manufacturers
Assistance (DSMA). The intent of this guidance document is to
provide additional direction regarding information and data which
should be submitted to FDA in a 510(k) submission for a
sterilizer intended for use in a health care facilitySterilizer technology is expanding at an accelerating pace.
Sterilizers can be complex in design and methods of sterilization
are diverse. In spite of the complexity and diversity there are
some common considerations that can be applied to virtually all
510(k) submissions for sterilizers.
FDA believes it is prudent
to provide 510(k) applicants, and other interested parties,
information describing these common elements in order to improve
the .quality of submissions and subsequently reduce the regulatory
review processing time.

-

The guidance is based upon current publications, the literature,
the combined experience and expertise of agency personnel
involved in the evaluation of sterilization processes. Science
.and the evaluation of medical devices are not static, rather they
are evolutionary. As such, FDA may periodically update this
guidance, as necessary, to keep it current: Any comments on the
content of this document are welcome and should be sent to the
address noted under Section R.

Definitions

Bioburden: The naturally occurring microbial contaminatioon a medical device prior to exposure to a microbicidal
process.
Bioburden Based Sterilization: A sterilization process wi--h
parameters based upon the predetermined type and
concentration of bioburden on the medical devices to be
sterilized. This method is used in manufacturing processes
and is not appropriate for health care facilities where the
bioburden may fluctuate.
Biological Indicator (BI): A measured and calibrated number
of microorganisms with high resistance to the node of
sterilization being'monitored, placed in or on a carrier a d
packaged to maintain the integrity of the carrier and
microorganisms. The microorganism count is known and is
higher than the bioburden on the medical device to be
sterilized. The BI is used to test the effectiyeness of the
sterilization process by assessing the microbial lethality
of the process.
Chemical Indicator (CI): A carrier impregnated or filled
with a chemical compound which, when exposed to specific
chemical and/or physical conditions, will undergo a known
reaction, such as a color change, or produce a measurable
quantity of reaction products. A CI indicates that the
medical device has been exposed to one or more process
conditions, and unless the CI integrates ALL process
conditions, it is not an adequate test for assessing the
effectiveness of the process.
Death Rate Curve (or Survivor Curve): The graphic
representation of the microbial sterilization kinetics for a
specific microbicidal agent on a defined microbial
population.
D-value ( D l o ) : The time required to kill 90%. (one
logarithmic cycle) of a homogeneous population of
microorganisms. For calculation purposes it is assumed tk?:
the killing rate follows first-order kinetics.
Inorganic and Organic Load: The naturally occurring or
artificially placed inorganic (e-g., metal salts) or organic
(e.g., proteins) contaminants on a medical device prior tc
exposure to a microbicidal process. The naturally occurrizq
organic load is also known as bioburden.
Microbial Sterilization Kinetics: The quantitative
mechanisms and effects of physical or chemical sterilizati~a
agents on the death of microbes.

Overkill Sterilization: A sterilization process that is
based upon a n arbitrarily established higher initial
concentration and resistance of bioburden than that actually
expected on the medical devices to be sterilized. Overkill
processes typically are based upon a lo6 colony forming unit
(CFU)/unit level of bioburden. This method is to be used
for establishing process parameters for sterilizers used in
health care facilities.
Process and Product Qualification: Elements of the
sterilization validation program consisting of selected
engineering and microbiological demonstrations performed
according to predefined protocols to show process'
reproducibility and product acceptability.

-

Precleaning: The removal of foreign material, e.g:, organic
or inorganic contaminants, from medical devices prlor to a
decontamination, disinfection, or sterilization process,
Process Residue: The microbicidal agent or by-products of
sterilization remaining on a medical device after completion
of the sterilization process.
Spore: A dormant state of an organism, typically a
bacterium or fungus, which exhibits a lack of biosynthetic
activity and reduced respiratory activity.
Sterilant: The active agent(s) which achieves
sterilization.
Sterile: The absolute state where all forms of life have
been eliminated. In a practical sense absolute sterility
cannot be proven, therefore sterility is considered achieved
when organisms are eliminated, inactivated, or destroyed
such that they are undetectable in standard media in which
they have previously been found to proliferate.
Sterility Assurance Level (SAL): A value indicating the
probability of a survivor after a sterilization process.
is the probability of one in one
For example, an SAL of
million nonsterile units after exposure to a sterilizat-ion
process.
Sterilization: An act or process which completely
eliminates or destroys all forms of life, particularly
microorganisms.
Unit: The specified substrate or carrier upon which the
specified number of test organisms are inoculated. A unit
may be a specified volume, weight, or surface area. For
example, a unit could be specified as an entire device, a
component of a device (if the device must be disassembled
prior to sterilization), or a portion of a device.

19.

Vegetative state:

A n active growth phase of an organism.

20.

Validation:
A documented program which provides a high
degree of assurance that a specific process will
consistently produce a medical device that meets its
predetermined specifications and quality attributes.

Documentation

Presubmission Considerations for Applicants
Establish that the sterilizer is a medical device subject to
510(k) submission, i-e., it is intended for use in a health
care facility to sterilize medical products.
Discuss new technologies with FDA prior to 510(lc) submission
to identify any unique aspects of testing or documentation.
Contact the Chief, Infection Control Devices Branch as
indicated in Part 11, Section Q.
Determine whether the sterilant must comply with EPA
regulations. Prior EPA certification, or concurrent EPA/FDA
review is desirable to minimize data redundancy.
Ensure that the 510(k) addresses all sections 21 CFR 807.87,
Information Required In A Premarket Notification Submission.
Ensure that the 510(k) submission addresses all-relevant
elements of this guidance, or subnit a thorough
justification for omission of information or data. Use the
checklist in Section S.
Ensure that there are marketed accessories necessary to
achieve a functional system, or concurrent submission of
510(k)s for necessary accessories. For example, acceptable
sterilization wraps (except for a flash node), biological .
and chemical indicators are necessary to provide a complete
system for the user. FDA will not find a sterilizer
equivalent until a functional system is in place.
Prereview submissions. 510(k)s for sterilizers can be
extensive. FDA review of a document is facilitated when the
document is arranged in a well-structured format that has
undergone a thorough presubmission critique by the applicant
to eliminate documentation deficiencies.
Recommendations for Protocols and Data Analysis
Provide all test protocols which include the objectives,
experimental methods, controls, observations, statistical
analyses, if possible, or other quantitative analysis, and
conclusions and coments.
Clearly define the aicrobial challenge and justify that it
is appropriate for the system under examination.
Specify the recove- media and ensure that it contains all
the elements for abundant qro.~th. Validace the recovery
efficiency of the cedia and submi: a sumrzry of the

validation.

Labeling

The applicant must submit labeling for the sterilizer. Labeling
describes the intended use of the device, its operating
characteristics, and limitations. These factors are essential in
establishing whether the device is equivalent to other legally
marketed sterilizers.
1.

Device Markings
Indicate the information affixed to the device. Markings
may include identifying information, warnings, directions
for use, or system requirements. Provide labeling for any
accessory sterilants used with the sterilizer, e-g., a
chemical agent. Chemical agents regulated by EPA also
require mandatory labeling in accordance with EPA
regulations.

2.

Information Manual
Submit the instructions for use manuals which shall include:
the intended use of the sterilizer (listing the medical
devices, specific types of materials, and other
compatible medical products that can be sterilized by
the process) ;
limitations of use (medical devices,types of materials,
and medical products that are incompatible);
name and address of the manufacturer;
type and model designation;
.installation instructions;
detailed operating instructions for all modes;
storage and preparation of the sterilant, if
applicable;
error or fault indications, their cause; and response;
interpretation and use of indicator gauges:
how to prepare articles for processing including
precleaning recommendations and required packaging;

Equivalent Devices and Previous submissions

,

Identify and compare the subject sterilizer to another legally
marketed sterilizer. A finding of equivalence is facilitaked the
closer the technology of the legally marketed device matches the
subject sterilizer. Reference the 510(k) numbers for the claimed
predicate devices, if known. Side bv side comparisons, whenever
possible are desirable (See Attachment 1).
1.

Submit labeling for the claimed equivalent sterilizer, if
possible.

2.

Compare and contrast the technologies.

3.

Compare and contrast the specifications.

1.

Traditional Steam, Dry Heat, and EtO Sterilizers
Certify that the sterilizer will achieve and maintain the
relevant physical cycle specifications (time, temperature,
sterilant concentration, humidity, pressure, etc.)' within
specifications under appropriate test load conditions. The
required lethal conditions are those determined by
biological performance tests (see following sections).

2.

Other Sterilizers
a.

Describe the rationale for the process parameters and
specifications. Briefly summarize how the biological
performance test results described in the following
sections were used to define the parameters.

b.

Provide a summary of physical tests which demonstrate
that the sterilizer achieves and maintains the required
physical/chemical process lethality conditisms within
specifications. These data should be from repeated
runs with varying load conditions.

1.

General
The applicant must unequivocally demonstrate that the device
can sterilize, to an acceptable SAL, all the medical
products identified in the labeling, when used.in -accordance
with the directions for use.

2.

Test Organisms
Since a consistent type and concentration of bioburden
cannot be assured or realistically evaluated in a health
care facility, an overkill sterilization is necessary. The
sterilization cycle is based upon an initial concentration
of at least lo6 CFU (or Plaque Forming Units - PFU)/unit of
a highly resistant organism to the process. Typically, the
most resistant organism to a sterilization process is used
based upon determination of D-values. Table 1 lists the
commonly recognized test organisms for the classified
.sterilizers.

Sporicidal screening Test

The applicant must provide a summary of the American Association
of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) Sporicidal Test, Section
966.04, Volume 1, Page 141 [Horowitz, William, ed. Sporicidal
test - official final action. Official Methods of Analysis of
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists. Current
Edition. Association of Official Analytical Chemists,
Washington, D.C.].
This test is also used for EPA registration
purposes. If EPA accepts or requests another test for
registration purposes for an EPA regulated sterilant used with
the subject device then a summary of the results from that test
should be provided. Indicate the specified time for
.sterilization.
Sterilization Process Equivalent Time
Thermal resistance.of microorganisms can be considered in terms
of equivalent process times (F,) at a given temperature.
Saturated steam and dry heat sterilizers are special~caseswhere
equivalent times are useful for evaluating the acceptability of
the process conditions.
Typically, dry heat and gravity steam sterilizers each employ
similar operating modes and process conditions as a group (e.g.,
121° C and 15 psi for a regular steam cycle). Some dry heat and
steam sterilizers may vary from the norm. As a general rule, a
higher temperature results in a higher rate of death of
microorganisms. Still, there are constraints to saturated steam
and dry heat process conditions in order to maintain acceptable
lethality conditions.
Physical parameters and microbicidal effectiveness with standard
test organisms have been extensively characterized for steam and
'dry heat sterilizers. Actual operating temperatures can be
correlated to a sterilization process equivalent time, or Fo
-value (a special case equivalent time), at standard temperatures.
Saturated steam operating temperature can be converted to
equivalent microbial lethality anticipated at 121°C while dry
heat temperatures can be converted to 170°C equivalent process
times. An Fo of 12 (minutes) for both processes is minimally
acceptable (12 log reduction). The method for conversion of
proc=ss parameters is beyond the scope of this document.
Mathematical methods are extensively described in the literature.
Submit the equivalent process time and its method of derivation
for the saturated steam or dry heat sterilizer for all modes of
operation.

In Use Tests
Sterilizer performance must also be verified under in-use
conditions. Articles sampled.after use should be precleaned (or
decontaminated) according to the normal operationat reprocessing
protocol of the health care facility where the samples are
obtained. Assurance of meeting a stringent precleaning protocol
is not a precondition since the robustness of the sterilization
pr.ocess is part of this evaluation. Multiple tests with
differing load conditions as indicated in labeling should be
reported.
'fter

processing, the test articles are neutralized, if
The articles are immersed in the growth media, if
possible, or subjected to an extraction method with the extract
placed in growth media. Publications and the literature contain
suitable extraction methods.

. necessary.

Derivation of the Process Parameters
The process parameters for the sterilizer shall be derived from
the screening test, process equivalent times, D-valuecalculations, simulated or actual use testing, 1/2 cycle and End
Point tests, and any additional safety factors. For process
validation an SAL of at least
based upon the most resistant
test organism, shall be demonstrated. Provide a thorough
description of the derivation of the process parameters.

Processed Device/Naterial Qualification

Introduction
Labeling for a sterilizer indicates the types of medical devices
and other medical products and/or the component materia-1s of a
medical device or product that are compatible with the
sterilization process (noted in this section as "articles").
Data shall be provided which attest to the compatibility of each
of the listed articles with the sterilization process. The data
shall address the effects of the process on the safety and
effectiveness, e-g., functionality/specifications, of the claimed
compatible articles, and the effects on the biocompatibility of
the articles.
The applicant must carefully consider labeling and the
implications of the scope of the compatible articles on the
potential test regimen. If the articles in the intended use
statement in labeling are limited and specifically characterized
then the scope of testing is a relatively simple matter. As the
intended use becomes more generalized the scope of testing
becomes more complex. For example, if ASTM 316 stainless steel
instruments are indicated as compatible devices then the test
article is basically defined. On the other hand, reference to
"metal" instruments connotes a plethora of material
possibilities. The same is true regarding a general reference to
"polymers" rather than a specific class and type of polymer.
When the labeling indicates a general class of articles that
could be differentially affected by the sterilization process,
the applicant must specify and justify a representative sample of
articles from the class for testing. Even after 510(k)
submission the applicant should- continue with a vigorous program
to analyze new products and those articles that were not tested
in the defined class. These data may serve as a basis for
'labeling revisions or as a resource for users on the
compatibility of the sterilizer- A s noted in the labeling
' ssction, users should be directed to call the manufacturer to
obtain any current information on devices and materials not
listed in the labeling.
Even though testing may qualify an article for the'subject
sterilization process the labeling e f the article may identify a
specific type of sterilization process to be used. In this case,
the labeling for the subject sterilizer cannot supersede the
device labeling. The applicant may choose to communicate with
the manufacturer of the qualified arricle to modify the labeling
f o r the article.
Ic may be possible that certain elt.:...-entsof this battery of
testing can be combined with the bi>loqical tests noted in
S2cticn K in order to minimize tes' 'J .
