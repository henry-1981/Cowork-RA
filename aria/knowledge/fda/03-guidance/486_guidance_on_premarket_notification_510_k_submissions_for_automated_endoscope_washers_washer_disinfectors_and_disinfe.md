This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA's
Good Guidance Practices, GGP's. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if
such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be up dated in the next revision to include the standard elemnt s of GGP 's .

Guidance on
Premarket Notification [5 10(k)] Submissions
for
Automated Endoscope Washers, WasherIDisinfectors, and Disinfectors
Intended for Use in Health Care Facilities

Infection Control Devices Branch
Division of General and Restorative Devices

August, 1993

Preface
This guidance was developed by the Infection Control Devices Branch, Division of General
and Restorative Devices (DGRD), Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Center for Devices
and Radiological Health (CDRH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
FDA regulates the introduction of medical devices into interstate commerce. A person
inicnding to mark&: an endoscope washerldisinfector must submit to FDA, and have clear&,
a premarket notification [510(k)] submission prior to its introduction into interstate
commerce. Regulations governing the general content and format of 5 lo@) submissions are
codified under 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 807. These and other regulatory
requirements pertaining to the marketing of a new medical device are discussed in guidance
documents available from the CDRH Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA).
The intent of this guidance document is to provide 5 1 0 0 applicants specific additional
directions regarding information and data which should be submitted to FDA in a 510(k)
submission for an endoscope washerldisinfector. In this guidance, the term
washerldisinfector will be used to refer to endoscope washers, washerldisinfectors, and
disinfectors.
A safe and effective system to disinfect endoscopes intended for use in other than normally
sterile areas of the body is important in preventing nosocomial infections. Comprehensive,
scientifically sound criteria for the evaluation of endoscope washers, washerldisinfectors, and
disinfectors is essential to help ensure that these devices are safe and effective for their
intended use when used according to their labeling. FDA recognizes the importance of
providing applicants, and other interested parties, the agency's 510(k) submission criteria for
endoscope washers, washerldisinfectors, and disinfectors in order to facilitate assembly of
necessary data, to maintain consistency of review, and to provide for a more efficient
regulatory process.

The document expresses FDA's recommendations as of the date noted on the cover page.
There is ongoing research and debate with regard to endoscope design and test methods.
Despite this state of flux, FDA finds it necessary at this time to document its 51 0 0
submission criteria in order to'expedite the availability of safe and effective
washerldisinfectors. FDA expects that this document will stimulate andlor accelerate
development of test methods and specific validation procedures by the scientific community
and regulated industry. The document is not static but will be periodically revised to keep it
current with state of the art developments in this area. Comments on the document are
welcome and should be sent to the address noted on page 17.

Advisory Concerning Accessories Used with Washer/Disinfectocs

FDA regulates the accessories used with endoscope washerldisinfector~as medical devices.
These include detergents, enzyme cleaners, and liquid chemical germicides that are intended
for reprocessing medical devices. Liquid chemical germicides must be cleared under the
510(k) process. FDA is considering how to regulate the detergents and enzyme cleaners.
The endoscope washerldisinfector, combined with legally marketed accessories, acts as a
system tc, clmi and disinfect endoscopes safely and effectively.
Since safe and effective cleaning and disinfection depends upon the combined performance of
all elements in the system, FDA will not find an endoscope washerldisinfector substantially
equivalent unless legally marketed, compatible accessories are identified in the
washerldisinfector labeling, and the performance of the system is validated. The guidance
provides detail on the validation process.
Manufacturers of products that are used in combination should work together to develop data
to demonstrate that the products work as claimed in the system. This minimizes costs and
time expended in obtaining market clearance for a device used in the system.
How does the washerldisinfector manufacturer have to address the accessories in their 510(k)
notification? It depends on (1) the marketing status and labeling for the accessory, (2) who
markets the accessory, and (3) the labeling for the washerldisinfector.
Generally, if the accessory is already a legally marketed medical device, then supplemental
data must be submitted to FDA on performance of the accessory in the system, and the
machine must be labeled for use with that accessory. If the accessory is not a legally
marketed medical device, then comprehensive data must be submitted to establish substantial
equivalence. For example, if the washerldisinfector indicates the use of Germicide X with
their washerldisinfector for high level disinfection, and Germicide X is a legally marketed
device, then data must be submitted validating use of Germicide X with the
washerldisinfector. If Germicide X is not legally marketed, the data must meet all the
relevant requirements of the FDA Guidance for Liquid Chemical Germicides, including
performance in the washerldisinfector.
Until such time that the liquid chemical germicides with sterilizationlhigh level disinfection
claims are cleared for marketing by FDA, we are considering implementation of interim
measures to facilitate the clearance of endoscope washerldisinfector~. FDA recommends that
a person considering the submission of a 5 10(k) to FDA for an endoscope washerldisinfector
should contact the Chief, Infection Control Devices Branch at (301) 594-1307 for the most
up-to-date information concerning the status of our procedures.

Guidance on Premarket Notification [510(k)] for Endoscope Washers,
WasherIDisinfectors, and Disinfectors Used in Health Care Facilities
I.

Introduction

A.

Scope

This document estzblishes the 510(kj review requiremcrlis for endoscope washers,
washerldisinfectors intended for use in health care facilities, e.g., hospitals, clinics,
health care professional offices. The types of devices within this generic class are
those washerldisinfectors which are electromechanical and may be microprocessor
controlled. They are used to process endoscopes which are not normally used in
sterile areas of the body, which can not be processed by a terminal sterilization
process, or in which the recognized professional standard of practice permits highlevel disinfection, when sterilization is not practicable. Some machines may not
include a washing step.
Exclusions
This document does not include manual endoscopic cleaning accessories such as
brushes, buckets, etc.

B.

Purpose

This guidance is intended to:

C.

1.

assist persons (manufacturers, distributors, or importers) in organizing
premarket notifications for endoscope washerldisinfectors;

2.

achieve consistency in meeting the requirements and in the presentation of
information; and

3.

guide FDA revkw staff in conducting and documenting the review of
premarket . notifications;

Definitions
1.

Bioburden: The naturally occurring microbial contamination on a medical
device prior to exposure to a microbicidal process.

2.

Inorganic and Organic Load: The naturally occumng or artificially placed
inorganic (e.g., metal salts) or organic (e.g., proteins) contaminants on a
medical device prior to exposure to a microbicidal process. The naturally
occurring organic load is also known as bioburden.

Process and Product Qualification: Elements of the validation program
consisting of selected engineering and microbiological demonstrations
performed according to predefined protocols to show process reproducibility
and product acceptability.
Precleaning: The removal of foreign material, e.g., organic or inorganic
contaminants, from medical devices prior to a decontamination or disinfection
process.
Process Residue: The microbicidal agent or by-products of the
cleaning/disinfection process remaining on a medical device after completion
of the cleaningfdisinfection process.
Disinfection: The process that kills a defined scope of pathogenic organisms,
not necessarily all microbial forms (e.g., bacterial endospores).
Disinfectant: A chemical agent that eliminates a defined scope of pathogenic
organisms, not necessarily all microbial forms (e.g., bacterial endospores).
High Level Disinfectant: A germicide that kills all microbial pathogens,
except large number of bacterial endospores, when used according to labeling.
Unit: A specified substrate or carrier upon which a specified number of test
organisms are inoculated. A unit may be a specified volume, weight, or
surface area. For example a unit could be specified as an entire device or a
component of a device, (if the device must be disassembled prior to
disinfection), or a portion of a device.
Validation: A documented program which provides a high degree of assurance
that a specific process will consistently meet its predetermined specifications
and quality attributes.
Intended Use: I t is the objective intent of the persons legally responsible for
the labeling of the .device. The intent is determined by their expressions or
may be shown by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the device.
The objective intent may, for example, be shown by labeling claims,
advertising matter, or oral or written statements by such representatives. It
may be shown by the offering or the using of the device, with the knowledge
of such persons or their representatives, for a purpose for which it is neither
labeled nor advertised (21 CFR 5801.4).
D.

Principles Regarding Presentation of Data

1.

Editorial Considerations: The 510(k) should be carefully edited, as well as
scientifically reviewed before it is submitted to FDA. It should be proofread

to assure that all pagedsections are included and are properly indicated,
consecutive, distinctly copied, and legible.
2.

Abbreviations: Standard abbreviations acceptable to a significant peer
reviewed journal should be used wherever possible. All other abbreviations
should be identified at the beginning of each section in which they are used or
in footnotes to tables and graphs.

3.

Data Availability: This document outlines typical circun~stancesof data
review. It is not possible to anticipate all situations that may require FDA
review. Thus, those submitting applications should be aware that they may be
asked to submit additional data, to present data in another format or to provide
more detailed explanations of the information submitted, if required to
establish equivalence.
Applicants should keep data used for the 5 1 0 0 submission on file in a
controlled and well organized format. This will allow the applicant to
expeditiously supply FDA with additional information or analysis if required.
Errors in data that are identified by the applicant after submission to FDA
should be brought to FDA's attention immediately.

4.

Tables and Graphs: Well-constructed tables are fundamental to the reporting
and evaluation of data. All tables should be clearly identified and captioned
with symbols keyed to a footnote or accessible reference page which
adequately indicates the nature of the data.
Graphs should supplement, not replace, data tables. They should be of
publication quality.

5.

Published Literature: Published methods or data referenced in study reports
should be appended to the study report. Reprints of other referenced published
reports or data should be appended to the section in which they are referenced.
A11 referenced reports and data should be summarized including an explanation
of how it .relates to: the current submission. Reference citations should be
complete (e.g., title, author, journal, volume, year).

6.

Protocols and Data Analysis:
Test reports must include the protocol (objectives, precise description of
materials, experimental methods, controls, observations, statistical methods
and analyses, conclusions and comments. Do not submit raw data. Additional
specific directions on protocols are included in sections that follow.

7.

Reference to Submitted Data:
The applicant may reference any information previously submitted to FDA in
support of the 510(k). If the applicant did not submit the referenced data, the
applicant either must provide the referenced information, or have the original
submitter provide a letter of authorization to FDA. Often, if the data are not
extensive, resubmitting data in the 510(k) will facilitate the review of the
document.

8.

Other Considerations
a.

The 510(k) should include a response to all elements in Part I1 below or
include an explanation of why data or information has not been
supplied, or why alternative information is justified. Original 5 10Qs
that are grossly incomplete following a cursory review may be placed
immediately on a hold status by notification to the applicant.

b.

Under Section 807.87(h), the 510(k) must include any additional
information regarding the device requested by FDA that is necessary to
make a finding as to whether the device is substantially equivalent to a
legally marketed device.
During the review period FDA may identify deficiencies in the
submission that cause FDA to be unable to determine whether the
device is equivalent. Notification of the existence and specifics of the
deficiencies may be made either by telephone or in writing or both,
depending upon the number and complexity of the deficiencies.
Telephone contact will be used to clarify minor deficiencies.
The applicant may elect to do one of the following: respond to the
deficiencies, submit a premarket approval application under section 5 15
of the act, formally withdraw the submission, or allow the submission
to be administratively deleted if a response to the deficiencies is not
received by.FDA within 30 days.
Responses to the deficiency letters or telephone calls must be in writing
and shall include a restatement of the deficiency (or copy of the
deficiency letter) and the complete response. A response to
deficiencies that is on its face grossly incomplete may not be considered
for reevaluation and FDA may place the file on hold once again after
the applicant is notified.
Amended information may raise additional significant questions,
therefore, it is essential for the applicant to fully consider the
deficiencies and provide a comprehensive response.

c.

E.

Nonclinical laboratory studies that will be submitted as part of a
premarket notification submission should be conducted according to
FDA GLP regulations (21 CFR Part 58). Compliance with these
regulations supports the quality and integrity of the data submitted.
Variances and the reason(s) for the variances from the GLP regulations
should be noted in the submission.

Performance Data
In general, endoscope washerldisinfectors work in combination with detergents,
enzyme cleaners, and liquid chemical germicides to eliminate scope contamination.
The electromechanical aspects of an endoscope washerldisinfector can be evaluated on
the basis of engineering specifications and tests. However, since the device must
work in combination with other products as a system to achieve its intended use, FDA
believes that test data must be produced showing the ability of the device to produce a
disinfected scope.

1.

Process Parameter Tests: Provide a summary of the data from tests which
demonstrate that the machine achieves and maintains the specified physical
process parameters, These data should be from repeated runs using
representative types of endoscopes (at least 3 runsltype) identified in the
labeling as being compatible with the washer, i.e. gastroscopes, colonoscopes,
sigrnoidoscopes, etc.

2.

Simulated-use Tests: The applicant must provide microbiological and chemical
test data to demonstrate that the machine can deliver a high level disinfectant
for the contact conditions necessary for high-level disinfection for all
endoscopes identified in the labeling, when used in accordance with the
directions for use. The simulated-use testing must evaluate the worst case
conditions for the washerldisinfector, the disinfectant, and the endoscopes.
For example, worst case conditions for the washerldisinfector could be

prolonged use at its minimum performance standards and just prior to any
scheduled maintenance such as filter changes. The worst case conditions of
the disinfectant could be an organically stressed disinfectant which is tested at
the end of its shelf-life and reuse life against a resistant organism (e.g., a
mycobacterium test species). The worst case conditions for an endoscope
would be testing with an old scope as opposed to a new scope. The simulateduse testing must include the following:
a.

the protocols for the methods of inoculating and handling of the
endoscopes prior to processing and the protocols for validating the
recovery methods (the draft I S 0 standard "Sterilization of health care
products - Validation and routine control - Microbiological methods
contains examples of acceptable validation methods);

b.

replicate runs with representative types of endoscopes (at least 3
mnsltype) as indicated by the labeling claims including a pediatric
endoscope, if appropriate;

c.

a separate evaluation of the effectiveness of each process step (washing,
disinfection, rinsing, etc) over time either based upon the maximum
number of days of reuse as stated upon the labeling for the disinfectant
or as directed by the machine's labeling if the number of days of reuse
is less than that stated on the labeling for the disinfectant. For
example, microbiological and chemical testing would be done after the
first cycle on day 0, at intervals during the testing period, and after the
final cycle on the last day of the testing period as determined by either
the germicide labeling or machine labeling. Reduced testing which
concentrates on the initial and longest process days (e-g., day 0 and 14
day) must be justified such as demonstrating the linearity of the
variables and performance.
(1)

an evaluation of the washing parameters to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the washing step, including a fiberoptic
examination of the endoscopes before and after washing to show
that the washing cycle removes all visible organic soil;

(2)

determination of the effectiveness of disinfection phase of the
washerldisinfector separate from the washing phase; this would
require inoculation of the endoscopes at the start of the
disinfection phase; refer to the FDA's Guidance for Liquid
Chemical Germicides for the requirements for high level
disinfection;

(3)

an evaluation of the rinse phase(s) to show that the
washer/disinfector-reduces any disinfectant residues to safe

levels and that the rinse cycles reduce any detergent residues to
levels that do not interfere with the effectiveness of the
disinfectant (see the discussion on Toxicological Evaluation of
Residues);
(4)
.

(5)

3.

evaluation of any other parameters, i.e., alcohol rinse, air
drying, self-disinfection process, etc. to demonstrate that they
achieve their intended use, and;
evaluation of the combined process including the effectiveness of
the self-disinfection stage for the washerldisinfector, if
applicable, to demonstrate that the washerldisinfector achieves
its intended use; the testing protocol should reflect the use
conditions that a washerldisinfector would experience in an
endoscopy setting such as multiple cycles over the period of
time recommended between selfdisinfection or after the
machine has set over the period of time recommended between
self-disinfection; microbiologically evaluate the condition of all
areas which could be a source of contamination before and after
the self-disinfection cycle.

In-use Testine;: Because of the increasing public health concern about the
transmission of diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, and tuberculosis, and due to
the lack of correlation of simulations to actual use, FDA is requiring not only
simulated-use testing but also in-use testing data.
The in-use (clinical) testing data must include an evaluation of the
washerldisinfector to clean and high level disinfect various scopes taken from
actual patient use. The test report must include:
a.

the complete protocol indicating sampling, pretreatment @recleaning),
handling, posttreatment (type of rinse), etc.;

b.

evaluation of the major types of scopes indicated in labeling for the
washerldisinfector;

c.

a statistically derived sample size for each of the major types of scopes;

d.

control and treated scopes for each of the major types of scopes;

e.

colle&on of specific data on the scope including, but not necessarily
limited to, scope type and condition of scope;

f.

microbiological information such as the bioburden loads on the control
and treated scopes prior to use, immediately after use, and just prior to

placement in the machine, and the extraction method;

H.

g.

a rigorous statistical evaluation, including explanation of any skips in
the data (residual growth); and

h.

comparative data on equivalent machines, if claims are made.

Software Documentation
Describe the validation of any software (or firmware). Refer to the FDA Software
Reviewers Guide (available from FDA Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance)
for 510(k) software documentation recommendations. Unless otherwise directed by
FDA, automated endoscope washers are considered in the "major" risk category
described in the software guidance.

I.

Toxicological Evaluation of Residues
1.

Introduction
The 510(k) submission must include an assessment of the level of any
residues, (e.g. detergents, germicides) remaining on the endoscope after
processing in the endoscope washerldisinfector and a toxicological evaluation
of these residues. This can be satisfied by reviewing the available toxicity
data of the particular residual chemical from animal toxicity studies sponsored
by the manufacturer of the chemical or from published literature. This
evaluation is needed to determine the potential health risk of the residues
remaining on the endoscope to the patient and the user.

2.

Hazard Evaluation
In ensuring safe conditions of use of the endoscope, the applicant must present
data which defionstrate that there are no residues remaining on the endoscope
or that the process .cycle removes the residues to a nontoxic level. The
applicant must also present data which demonstrate that there is no
accumulation of residues over the use-life of the endoscope which could
present a health risk to the patient and the user.

J.

Summary of Information Regarding Safety and Effectiveness or Statement of
Availability of Such Information
Under the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990, the 5 10(k) shall include either (1) an
adequate summary of any information respecting safety and effectiveness on which
equivalence is based, or (2) a statement that information regarding safety and
effectiveness will be made available upon request to any person.

A summary shall be in a separate section and be clearly indicated as the summary

respecting safety and effectiveness as required by the amended act.
Implementing regulations establishing the requirements for the summary and statement
are forthcoming and will supersede this section. Notification of the requirements will
be published in the Federal Register.
