Orthopedic Non-Spinal Metallic Bone
Screws and Washers – Performance
Criteria for Safety and Performance
Based Pathway
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for non-spinal metallic bone screws and their
associated washers in support of the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. Under this
framework, submitters planning to submit a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway for non-spinal metallic bone screws and washers will have the option to use the
performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence, rather than a
direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity (DOC) to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate
supporting documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in
regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary
Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.
In general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

Intended Use/Indications for Use: The bone screws that fall within the scope of this guidance
document are intended for orthopedic non-spinal fracture fixation, osteotomy, or small joint
fusion or arthrodesis. The washers that fall within the scope of this guidance document are
intended for use with bone screws only to aid in load distribution at the screw head/bone
interface. Bone screws or washers that are intended for mandibular, maxillofacial, cranial and
orbital fracture fixation or for use in the spine are outside the scope of this guidance document.
Devices intended for use with suture or chord components (e.g., bone anchors, syndesmosis
tight ropes) as part of an implant system are also outside the scope of this guidance document.
Device Design Characteristics: Bone screws of varying designs (e.g., cancellous screws,
cortical screws, cannulated screws, fully threaded screws, partially threaded screws) are
included within the scope of this guidance. Devices that fall within the scope of this guidance
document consist of bone screws and washers manufactured solely from one of the following
materials in conformance with the associated FDA-recognized consensus standard:

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The inner diameter of a washer should be larger than the compatible screw’s thread diameter to
allow screw passage and smaller than the diameter of the compatible screw’s head to allow for
cortical load distribution.
Implants with the following features are outside the scope of this guidance:
• Combination products
• Resorbable devices
• Additively manufactured devices
• Devices that utilize surgical techniques or associated instruments outside the standard of
care
• Devices with complex geometries or modularities (e.g., segmented, fenestrated)
• Devices with other unique technological characteristics (e.g., screw thread designs that
differ substantially from recognized consensus standards for orthopedic bone screws)
Recommendations for information to be submitted in a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance
Based Pathway but not otherwise outlined in this guidance document (e.g., labeling) can be
found in the FDA guidance Orthopedic Non-Spinal Bone Plates, Screws, and Washers Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion with FDA prior
to submission of the 510(k) as described in the FDA guidance Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

III. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, you do not need to provide direct comparison testing against a
legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DOC) 1) identified for each test or evaluation
below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions under
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the submission information sections
below, test information such as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should
be submitted as part of the 510(k) as described in the FDA guidance Safety and Performance
Based Pathway. For additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench
When you provide a DOC you are certifying that you are in conformance with that standard as defined in the
guidance Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.

testing information, please see the FDA guidance Recommended Content and Format of NonClinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.
Mechanical Bench Testing
The following mechanical tests should be performed in conformance with the FDA currentlyrecognized version of ASTM F543 Standard Specification and Test Methods for Metallic
Medical Bone Screw. We recommend that you perform all testing on screw designs that
represent worst-case (e.g., most likely to loosen or fail) final design versions. You should also
provide a rationale identifying how you identified the worst-case design. Additionally, axial
pullout strength should be evaluated using an engineering analysis method described below.
Acceptance criteria are listed below for each test. 2
For each mechanical test below, you should provide a report as specified in the relevant reporting
sections of ASTM F543, in addition to a DOC to the consensus standard. Any protocol
deviations should be thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol
deviations may invalidate comparison to the performance criteria listed below, resulting in the
need for submission of a Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k), as appropriate.
1.

Test name: Torsional Strength
Methodology: ASTM F543 Standard Specification and Test Methods for Metallic
Medical Bone Screws
Performance Criteria: The worst-case bone screw should be selected for mechanical
testing:
Nominal Major Torsional Yield
Diameter (mm) Strength (Nm)
1.5

0.35
2.5

It should be noted that although ASTM F543 is FDA-recognized in full, FDA believes that for the purposes of the
Safety and Performance Based Pathway, the testing, methods and criteria identified in this section on mechanical
bench testing represent the least burdensome approach to demonstrating substantial equivalence for this pathway,
although alternative or additional methods or acceptance criteria are identified in the recognized consensus standard
for some tests. See the supplementary information sheet for ASTM F543 for information on extent of recognition.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Note that the acceptance criterion is based on the torsional yield strength, which is a more
conservative indicator of screw failure strength than the maximum torque strength
identified in ASTM F543.
Screws should be compared based on nominal diameter. For screws with nominal
diameters that do not match a value in the table above, a comparison should be made to
the next highest major diameter listed (e.g., a 4.25 mm screw should utilize the 4.5 mm
acceptance criteria).
Performance Criteria Source: Criteria are based on aggregated mechanical testing data
submitted to FDA in 510(k) submissions for orthopedic bone screws previously found to
be substantially equivalent. It should be noted that the values in the table above were
rounded to be the most inclusive and accurate based on the final data.
Additional Considerations: As specified in ASTM F543, a minimum of five samples
should be tested. In addition, analysis of the data available to FDA on existing devices
has shown that five samples should be adequate based on the mean torsional yield
strength testing results compared to the criteria for each nominal diameter. To be
considered a successful result, either: (1) All samples should meet or exceed the
acceptance criteria listed above, (2) the average of all samples should meet or exceed the
criteria above and the standard deviation should be ≤ 10% of the calculated average, or
(3) the criteria derived from ASTM E122 Standard Practice for Calculating Sample Size
to Estimate, With Specified Precision, the Average for a Characteristic of a Lot or
Process should be met, as suggested in ASTM F543. The table value selected for the
acceptance criterion should be based on the worst-case screw nominal major diameter. If
the nominal major diameter is not listed in this table, the next highest diameter torsional
strength value should be used as the acceptance criterion.

Test name: Driving Torque
Methodology: ASTM F543 Standard Specification and Test Methods for Metallic
Medical Bone Screws
Performance Criteria: The screw with the highest risk of failure during insertion (i.e.,
the screw with the lowest safety factor between the insertion torque and the yield torque)
should be evaluated with Driving Torque testing results. Typically, the worst-case bone
screw used in torsional strength testing should be tested in insertion and removal testing.
However, tip geometry and surgical technique should also be considered in establishing
the worst case. The maximum torque recorded in insertion and removal testing into a
minimum of 20 pcf bone foam should be 50% of or less than the torsional yield strength
of the bone screw. Additionally, visual inspection should be performed on screws
following their removal, and images of the final test samples should be provided to
demonstrate that the screw threads adequately resist damage, such as disassociation of the
screw thread from the screw body.
Performance Criteria Source: Criteria are based on aggregated mechanical testing data
submitted to FDA in 510(k) submissions for orthopedic bone screws previously found to
be substantially equivalent.

Additional Considerations: A minimum of five samples should be tested. In order to be
considered a successful result, all samples should meet or exceed the acceptance criteria
listed above.
Submission Information: Results summary and DOC
3.

Test name: Axial Pullout Strength
Methodology: An engineering analysis is recommended to assess axial pullout strength
using the equation described by Chapman et al., 1996. 3 Note that for this analysis to be
appropriate, the instrumentation identified in the associated surgical technique manual
should allow for close to idealized thread engagement. If this assumption is not accurate
for your scenario, then the identified engineering analysis may not be appropriate for the
assessment of the proposed device as identified in this guidance.
For all screws, extract the relevant dimensions below (i.e. screw major diameter, screw
minor diameter, screw pitch, and axial thread length). These dimensions will be used to
quantify thread engagement and calculate the theoretical pullout strengths for the smallest
axial thread lengthened screws in the device system using the following equation:
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 = 𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐴𝐴 = {𝑆𝑆 ∗ 𝐿𝐿 ∗ 𝜋𝜋 ∗ 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 ∗ 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇}

Fs = predicted shear failure force (N)
S = material ultimate shear stress (MPa)
A = thread shear area (mm2)
L = axial thread length (mm) including only threads that have the nominal major diameter
where complete purchase is expected (e.g., excluding the screw tip) of thread engagement
in material
Dmajor = major diameter (mm)
TSF = Thread Shape Factor (dimensionless) = (0.5 + 0.57735 d/p)
d = thread depth (mm) = (Dmajor – Dminor)/2
Dminor = minor (root) diameter (mm)
p = thread pitch (mm)
Use a material ultimate shear stress value of 3.395 MPa (representative of 20 pcf bone
foam) in your analysis. The resulting theoretical pullout strength value obtained for the
device should be equivalent or greater to the following values depending on the nominal
major diameter of the worst-case screws. A justification should be provided to support
why the evaluated screws selected are worst case. Axial pullout performance is heavily
influenced by amount of interface. Factors such as decreasing outer diameter and
decreasing axial thread length may help identify the worst case.
Dimensions used for calculations should be clearly listed for each theoretical outcome.
Dimensional values used in this calculation should be consistent with the values listed on
the screw engineering drawings.

Biocompatibility Evaluation:
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
“Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process,” referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
Implanted Devices in contact with tissue/bone with a prolonged or “permanent” contact duration
of > 30 days and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the FDA
Biocompatibility Guidance.
• Cytotoxicity

Sensitization

Chronic Toxicity

Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: In rare cases, if you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the
identified biocompatibility endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided
for all tests performed unless a DOC without supplemental information can be appropriately
provided, per Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive,
negative, and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below and require submission of a Traditional,
Special, or Abbreviated 510(k).

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected, as specified above for the subject device samples.
Submission Information: Refer to FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
