Developing and Labeling In vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices for
a Specific Group of Oncology Therapeutic Products
Guidance for Industry
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance describes considerations for the development and labeling of in vitro companion
diagnostic devices (referred to as “companion diagnostics” herein) to support the indicated uses
of multiple drug or biological oncology products, 1 when appropriate. This guidance builds upon
existing policy regarding the labeling of companion diagnostics. In a prior guidance issued in
2014, the Agency stated that if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion diagnostic
is appropriate for use with a specific group of therapeutic products, the companion diagnostic’s
intended use/indications for use should name the specific group of therapeutic products, rather
than specific products. 2 This guidance expands on the policy statement in the 2014 guidance by
recommending that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors, including but
not limited to those discussed in this guidance, when determining whether their test could be
developed, or the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a
supplement, to support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology
therapeutic products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)).
For the purpose of this guidance, a specific group of oncology therapeutic products would be
identified based on sufficient and consistent clinical experience with the therapeutics with the
same approved indications, 3 including molecular alteration(s), for which a companion diagnostic
could potentially be labeled (as discussed in this document). To illustrate FDA’s current
For purposes of this guidance, drug and biological oncology products are referred to as therapeutic products or
oncology therapeutic products.

group of oncology therapeutic products” rather than “therapeutic class” because depending on the indication, a
specific group could be a therapeutic class, a subset of a class, or broader than a class.

thinking on this topic, the guidance discusses a specific example, companion diagnostics that
identify patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have the most common
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R)
substitution mutations.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.
II.

BACKGROUND

A companion diagnostic is an in vitro diagnostic device that provides information that is
essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding therapeutic product. The use of a
companion diagnostic with a therapeutic product is stipulated in the instructions for use in the
labeling of both the companion diagnostic and the corresponding therapeutic product, including
labeling of any generic 4 version of the therapeutic product. 5
In oncology, precision medicine (also referred to as “personalized medicine”) aims to match
therapeutic products to those patients (and only those patients) who will positively respond to
that therapeutic product, to maximize benefits and minimize risks from the therapeutic product
received. Precision oncology therefore depends on 1) understanding the molecular
pathophysiology of cancer and 2) the ability of companion diagnostics to accurately and reliably
detect and measure molecular biomarkers. These companion diagnostics inform both the
development and the approved use of therapeutic products.
Trials designed to support approval of a specific therapeutic product and a specific companion
diagnostic have led to companion diagnostic labels that reference only a specific therapeutic
product(s). Such specificity in labeling can limit a potentially broader use of a companion
diagnostic that may be scientifically appropriate. In some cases, there are multiple companion
diagnostics approved by FDA to detect the same molecular alterations in the same specimen
type. Similarly, in some cases, there are multiple FDA-approved therapeutics within a specific
group of oncology therapeutic products. 6 This results in, in some cases, not all of the oncology
For the purpose of this guidance, the term generic refers to a new drug product approved in an abbreviated new
drug application (ANDA) submitted under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
5
FDA has previously issued guidance to define companion diagnostics, clarify the goal of contemporaneous
approval of the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic, provide guidance on premarket regulatory
pathways and FDA’s regulatory enforcement policy, and describe statutory and regulatory requirements for labeling;
FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices.

The specific group refers to the indication that the therapeutic products have in common which is captured in the
therapeutic products’ labeling (including sections other than the indications and usage section). A therapeutic
product could have other indications than those within the specific group that a companion diagnostic is labeled to
identify. Likewise, a companion diagnostic could have other intended uses outside of the specific group of oncology
therapeutic products or for other specimen types. Broader labeling may be appropriate regarding the indications that
the specific group of oncology therapeutic products have in common.

therapeutic products in a specific group being included on all of the labels of approved
companion diagnostics to detect molecular alteration(s) that define the specific group (see Table
1). FDA is concerned that the current situation is not optimal for patient care because a clinician
may need to order a different companion diagnostic (i.e., one that includes other therapeutic
products on the label), obtain an additional biopsy(ies) from a patient, or both, to have additional
therapy treatment options. FDA is interested in discussing with sponsors wishing to pursue
labeling a companion diagnostic to reference a specific group of oncology therapeutic products,
when the evidence would support expanding the indication.
An example in precision oncology, which illustrates the issue regarding companion diagnostic
labeling in oncology, is the identification of specific EGFR mutations in tumors of patients with
NSCLC. There are five FDA-approved therapeutic products indicated for the treatment of
patients with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R)
substitution mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test: afatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib,
osimertinib, and dacomitinib (see Table 1). 7,8 However, the FDA-approved companion
diagnostics that identify these specific mutations in EGFR in tissue samples are only indicated
for a subset of the five FDA-approved therapeutic products.

While EGFR is just an example, it could be possible for companion diagnostics that are
adequately validated to detect the biomarker(s) of interest and to identify appropriate patients for
treatment to be indicated more broadly for use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic
products. In this example, the oncology community would be better served by a companion
diagnostic that detects EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations
For purposes of this example, we are focusing on the indication described in the guidance. However, examples of
products in the illustrative example with indications that are other than the indication described in the illustrative
example are 1) afatinib which, at the time of this guidance, is indicated for a broader population, i.e., those “whose
tumors have non-resistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved
test” and 2) the Cobas EGFR Mutation Test V2 which is also approved for identifying EGFR exon 19 deletions or
exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations in plasma specimens.

indicated for “identifying patients with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or
exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations and are suitable for treatment with a tyrosine kinase
inhibitor approved by FDA for that indication.” This could enable greater flexibility for
clinicians in choosing the most appropriate therapeutic product based on a patient’s biomarker
status. However, labeling for such a broader use is not as simple as just matching diagnostic
targets with therapeutic targets. Different diagnostics for the same target may utilize different
cut-offs, filters, or other design features that impact the patient populations they identify and,
consequently, the likelihood of a biomarker positive patient to respond to a given therapy. Any
potential differences should be evaluated to ensure it is clinically appropriate to take a broader
labeling approach. See section IV for considerations regarding broader labeling.
III.

DEVELOPMENT AND LABELING OF COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS IN
ONCOLOGY

Some companion diagnostics in oncology could be developed in a way that results in labeling for
a specific group of oncology therapeutic products. Similarly, for sponsors seeking to broaden the
labeling of already approved or cleared companion diagnostics, sponsors may submit a
marketing application supplement in support of broader labeling (see section V). These
approaches will help ensure the resulting indication optimally facilitates clinical use. This
approach is consistent with FDA’s labeling for in vitro diagnostic product regulations, which
requires, among other things, “the intended use or uses of the product” 9 be included in the label
and labeling. In addition, this approach aligns with FDA’s guidance regarding therapeutic
product labeling, which states that “the therapeutic product labeling should specify use of an
FDA approved or cleared IVD companion diagnostic device, rather than a particular
manufacturer’s IVD companion diagnostic device. This will facilitate the development and use
of more than one approved or cleared IVD companion diagnostic device of the type described in
the labeling for the therapeutic product.” 10
When it is scientifically appropriate, FDA supports developers of companion diagnostics to
develop their products (or pursue broader labeling for approved companion diagnostics) in a way
that results in broader labeling for their products (i.e., for a specific group of oncology
therapeutic products). FDA acknowledges that such an approach may require collaboration with
therapeutic product developers and encourages this to enable the companion diagnostic labeling
to provide greater flexibility for clinicians in choosing the most appropriate therapeutic product
based on a patient’s biomarker status. Additional benefits of broader labeling in product
development include 1) the applicability of the broader labeling to future oncology therapeutics
in the specific group and 2) the ability to use a broadly labeled companion diagnostic in
oncology therapeutic product development programs in the specific group.

CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING BROADER LABELING

The label and labeling for a companion diagnostic is required to specify its intended use (21 CFR
809.10(a)(2) and 809.10(b)(2)). Therefore, a companion diagnostic that is intended for use with
a therapeutic product must specify the therapeutic product(s) for which it has been approved or
cleared for use. In some cases, however, if evidence is sufficient to conclude that the companion
diagnostic is appropriate for use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products, the
intended use/indications for use should name the specific group, rather than each specific product
within the group.
FDA recommends that companion diagnostic developers consider a number of factors, including
but not limited to those listed below, when determining whether their test could be developed, or
the labeling for approved companion diagnostics could be revised through a supplement, to
support a broader labeling claim such as use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic
products (rather than listing an individual therapeutic product(s)). In addition, these
considerations include examples of when companion diagnostics may not be appropriate for
broader labeling because such labeling could lead to incorrect identification of patients for
therapeutic treatment. These considerations or factors do not change the relevant regulatory
standards for evaluating whether broader labeling for companion diagnostics should be approved
or cleared, including whether any information to support such labeling meets the standard of
valid scientific evidence under 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2). When a companion diagnostic has been
approved or cleared for use with a therapeutic product(s), a PMA supplement or new 510(k), as
appropriate, containing the needed information, will be needed if the companion diagnostic
manufacturer chooses to expand the companion diagnostic labeling to broaden the indication for
use with a specific group of oncology therapeutic products. Given considerations including, for
example, evolving and complex biomarkers and potential device to device variation in
identifying these biomarkers and evidence needed, we encourage sponsors considering
development of a companion diagnostic for broader labeling to meet with CBER, CDRH, or
CDER, in coordination with the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE), as appropriate, early in
development, to discuss. Developers of approved companion diagnostics considering broader
labeling should contact CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, to discuss (see section V).
1. Whether a specific group of oncology therapeutic products can be defined for which
a companion diagnostic will identify an appropriate patient population for potential
treatment. A key issue for such development and labeling will be identifying the
specific group of oncology therapeutic products to be included in the labeling for the
companion diagnostic. For the purposes of this guidance, a specific group of oncology
therapeutic products are those approved for the same indications, including the same
molecular alteration(s), such as mutation(s), amplification(s), and fusion(s) 11 for which
clinical evidence has been developed with at least one device for the same specimen type
for each therapeutic product. In some cases, the indications may be for different lines of
treatment. As demonstrated by the identification of the specific group in the illustrative
example (see section II), the identification of the specific group will include the level of
11

detail needed to identify an appropriate patient population and will be informed by the
clinical and analytical evidence supporting the companion diagnostic indication.
Developers of companion diagnostics should discuss the specific group of oncology
therapeutic products with CBER, CDRH, or CDER, in coordination with OCE, as
appropriate, early in development.
FDA recognizes that as science evolves, our understanding of the mechanism of action of
therapeutic products and of the interaction between therapeutic products and biomarkers
will evolve, which may impact how specific groups of oncology therapeutic products are
defined. For example, the definition of “wildtype” for RAS, which is included in the
labels of drugs such as cetuximab and panitumumab, has significantly changed over time.
2. Whether there is a detailed understanding of a) the mechanism of action of the
specific group of oncology therapeutic products being considered for use with the
companion diagnostic and b) the interaction between the therapeutic products and
the biomarker(s), at the molecular alteration level, detected by the companion
diagnostic. The mechanism of action for a therapeutic product can be influenced by a
number of factors, including the molecular alteration itself. Therapeutic products may
target different areas of a protein and can therefore be differentially influenced by, for
example, the resultant tertiary structure changes from various amino acid substitutions.
Similarly, a therapeutic product may target a unique genetic alteration or be influenced by
surrounding genetic mutations. Additionally, an understanding of the prevalence of the
biomarker in the population or the relationship between the expression or level of the
biomarker and the therapeutic response is important and can greatly influence whether it
would be scientifically appropriate to consider a broader labeling approach. Having a
detailed understanding of the mechanism of action for the therapeutic is critical to
support broader labeling identifying the specific group of therapeutics for which a
companion diagnostic could be safely and effectively used.
A detailed understanding of the interaction between the therapeutics and biomarker could
be achieved through clinical studies, retrospective analyses of clinical data, or both,
supported or extended by nonclinical information to support approval or clearance of
broader labeling for the companion diagnostic. The sponsor of the companion diagnostic
could use sources of valid scientific evidence as described in 21 CFR 860.7(c)(2), such as
the therapeutic product labeling or therapeutic product study data or peer-reviewed
scientific literature, or the sponsor could perform clinical studies as needed. For
example, EGFR exon 19 deletions and exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations are
known to upregulate EGFR phosphorylation and respond to treatment with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors of EGFR based on functional studies. 12 Special care, however, should
be taken to identify aspects of biomarkers which would exclude them from being

included in a labeled use with a group of oncology therapeutics. For example, many
mutations in EGFR exon 20 are tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistant (e.g., EGFR T790M).
3. Whether there is sufficient clinical experience with at least two therapeutic products
for the same biomarker-informed indications. The sponsor of the companion
diagnostic could utilize currently available information, such as that published in peerreviewed literature, or perform new clinical studies, if necessary, to show that there is
sufficient and consistent clinical experience with the group of oncology therapeutic
products for the same biomarker-informed indications. There should generally be
experience with at least two FDA-approved therapeutic products that would comprise the
group that the broader companion diagnostic indication would apply to. For example,
afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, osimertinib, and dacomitinib are all indicated for the
treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon
21 (L858R) substitution mutations, so they will all fall under one specific group (tyrosine
kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with NSCLC whose tumors have
EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations). Also, it would not
be appropriate to include therapeutic products in this specific group that only target
resistant mutations, such as EGFR T790M and C797S, for which there may not be
sufficient or consistent clinical experience.
4. Whether analytical validity of the companion diagnostic has been demonstrated
across the range of biomarkers that inform the indication. Analytical validity is the
ability of a companion diagnostic to perform as intended in terms of its sensitivity,
specificity, accuracy, precision, and other relevant performance characteristics using a
specified technical protocol. Multi-marker companion diagnostics that already have an
approval or clearance of a test for use with a therapeutic product in a potential group may
be able to leverage the information in their already cleared or approved submission to
demonstrate analytical validity of the companion diagnostic across the range of
biomarkers that inform the indication, depending on which specific biomarkers and
molecular alterations were included in analytical studies. Future sponsors of companion
diagnostics that do not already have an approval or clearance of a test for use with a
therapeutic product in a potential group should demonstrate analytical validity of the
companion diagnostic across the range of biomarkers that inform the indication,
including the specific molecular alterations for which a companion diagnostic claim is
being sought. The sponsor should discuss with CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, to
determine the criteria for analytical validation.
It is important to ensure that the companion diagnostic can detect the specific molecular
alteration(s) of interest that would identify which patients would benefit from the
therapeutic products that are included in the defined group. Using a test that is validated
to detect the specific analyte(s) of interest is critical to ensuring that false negative or
false positive results are not driving clinical decisions or therapeutic choices. Further,
since technologies used to detect a biomarker can vary widely with significant
performance differences between them, differences in technology should be considered

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
as some molecular alterations might not be equally detectable by every technology. For
example, a non-trivial difference in discordance rate between next generation
sequencing-based mutation profiling and immunohistochemistry could lead to differences
in the number of patients identified as biomarker positive depending on the technology
used.
5. Whether clinical validity of the companion diagnostic has been demonstrated with
the therapeutic products in the disease of interest. Clinical validity is the ability of a
companion diagnostic to identify, measure, or predict the presence or absence of a
clinical condition or predisposition for which the companion diagnostic is intended (i.e.,
the companion diagnostic’s ability to predict treatment responses or to select patients for
the treatment). Companion diagnostics that already have an approval or clearance of a
test for use with a therapeutic product in a potential group can generally leverage the
information in their already cleared or approved submission to demonstrate clinical
validity of the companion diagnostic with the other therapeutic products in the disease of
interest. Future sponsors for companion diagnostics that do not already have an approval
or clearance of a test for a therapeutic product in a potential group could perform, for
example, concordance studies with a previously approved companion diagnostic for that
indication to demonstrate high agreement, or prospectively-defined retrospective sample
analyses to demonstrate comparable clinical performance (i.e., that the drug efficacy in
the follow-on companion diagnostic positive or negative population is similar to that in
the positive or negative population for the approved or cleared companion diagnostic).
Alternatively, the sponsor could, for example, choose to do a clinical study establishing
the link between the result of the companion diagnostic and patient outcomes for that
indication.
In an evaluation of clinical validity, the defined cut-off for a specific companion
diagnostic is important to consider when assessing whether broader labeling is
appropriate. For example, a challenge with gene expression tests is that they may have
differing thresholds by which a tumor sample is called positive or negative in a specimen.
These assays may also have their own scoring algorithm and method of measuring cells
which may impact what is needed regarding clinical validation. For companion
diagnostics that detect the same marker of interest and have similar analytical
performance, different cut-offs may identify different groups of patients. A cut-point that
is set too high could mean that patients will be determined to not be candidates for a
therapeutic or the cut-point may be too low and a patient be put on a therapeutic course
that confers limited or no benefit. Differing thresholds need to be resolved, for example
during the performance concordance testing and analysis.
We encourage the sponsor to discuss with CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, to determine
the criteria for clinical validation to support broader labeling.

PROCESS FOR BROADENING LABELING FOR APPROVED OR CLEARED
COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS

For companion diagnostics that may be appropriate for broader labeling that describes use with a
specific group of oncology therapeutic products (rather than listing individual therapeutic
product names), the companion diagnostic developer should contact CDRH or CBER, as
appropriate, to discuss, using the appropriate approval or clearance pathway. 13 Such
submissions should generally include information justifying that the diagnostic can be used with
a specific group of oncology therapeutic products and valid scientific evidence under 21 CFR
860.7(c)(2) to support the broader labeling claim for the companion diagnostic, in accordance
with appropriate requirements for approval or clearance.
For providers’ and other stakeholders’ reference, FDA maintains a website that includes a list of
cleared or approved companion diagnostic devices (in vitro and imaging tools) and the
therapeutic product(s) stipulated in the instructions for use. FDA will include on this website
details of any in vitro companion diagnostic device that is approved for use with a specific group
of oncology therapeutic products, including the names of the therapeutic products within the
specific group. 14
A companion diagnostic sponsor that submits a PMA supplement or new 510(k), as appropriate,
requesting FDA approval or clearance for a broader labeling claim should include in the
proposed label the relevant specific group of oncology therapeutic products and a reference to
FDA’s website for the most current information on the therapeutic products in the group.

Companion diagnostic developers should submit a PMA supplement or a new 510(k), as appropriate. If
developers have specific questions, they can also submit a pre-submission request through which developers may
obtain information concerning the appropriate submission. See FDA’s Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff:
Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program, May 2019,
