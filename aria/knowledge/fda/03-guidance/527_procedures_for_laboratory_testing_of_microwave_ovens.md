Microwave Measurements-General

1. Ovens shall be tested at their rated line voltage as
shown on the microwave oven unit, + 5%.

2. The same microwave power density measuring instru-
ments should be used for ail tests on a given sample.
Record the manufacturer, model number, and serial
number of the probe and survey meter, Record the
calibration factor for the power density measuring
unit.

3. Due to calibration schedules, ovens that are
endurance tested may not have the final compliance
tests performed using the same ‘instrument; this
should be noted on the data sheets.

4, Record manufacturer, model number, and serial number
of the iine voltage monitor or other instrumentation
used in the determination of compliance status.

5. Microwave leakage measurements shall be performed
according to procedures described in Appendix 8.

CAUTION: Microwave and electrical hazards are present.

Leakage Measurements-Door Closed

1. Study Appendix 8 and survey the following oven
surfaces for microwéve leakage:

a. The circumference cf the door/cavity seal.
Should be performed while pulling on the door or
door handle in order to pull the door snug

against the door latchies).

b. The area of the docr screen.

c¢. The area of the control panel.

d. The tine cord at the point where it enters the
oven.

e. Alf vent openings.

f. Ali cabinet seams.

g. Any other suspected openings.

Record the value and location of the maximum leakage.
Us2 codes as shown in the location identification
guide in Appendix C.

Lae)

3. Record the line voltage under which the test was
performed.

Leakage Measurements-Door Fixed

This test applies To any oven 7
positive fate interiock (ane tha

+o

-3-


before door movement can begin). 'f an oven does fot
have a positive latch interlock, the following procedure
shall be followed:

1. Turn the oven on, slowly open the door, and determine
the distance the door must open before the primary
interlock interrupts the oven operation.

2. Make as many measurements as required to determine
the location of the maximum leakage using the fast
response position on the microwave power density
measuring instrument.

3. Using the slow response position, of the microwave
power density measuring instrument, determine the
maximum leakage. Record the value and location of
the maximum leakage using the codes on the location’
guide in Appendix C.

4. Record the line voltage at which the test was
perfor.aed.

secondary Interlock Leakage Measurements

This test is intended to determine the lteakage control
limit of non-positive (those which ailow door motion
before actuating) secondary interlocks. lf it is deter-
mined that the secondary interlock is a positive inter-
lock, the portion of the preprinted data sheet for the
secondary interlock leakage measurement will indicate
that this test is not applicable (N/A).

1. Defeat the primary and other interlocks as necessary
so that microwave power is controlled by the action
of the secondary interlock only.

2. It may be necessary to defeat the interlock monitor
before this test can be performed. “

3. Proceed as described previously in Section 11.0.

4. Record the value and location of the maximum leakage.

Safety Interlock Tests

1. Verify that there is @ minimum of two functional
interlocks.

2. Test ali interlocks for defeatability by:
a. Any part of the body, and/or
Dd. A rod with useful length of 10 centimeters,
and/or

”

A test maqnet, for magnetic interlocks.

-5-


H.

Only the force necessary to activate the interlock

switch itself shal! be used.

3. Verify that the interlock actuators are not removable
without disassembly of the oven or its door.

4, Review the electrical and mechanical design of the
interlocks to determine if any single electrical or
mechanical failure could cause al} safety interlocks
to become inoperative.

3. Perform individual function tests for all interlocks
whose function has not been determined by previous
tests. This will inetude tertiary and higher order
interlocks. lf necessary, a high impedance neon lamp |
may be placed in series with the power transformer to
indicate interlock function and prevent possible door
open operation. In some cases other interlocks and
the monitor may have to be defeated to perform this
test. If appropriate the procedure of G.2.a. may be
used. .

6. Record the following information for al] safety in-
teriocks:

a. Whether or not it is monitored (see G below)
b. Whether or not it is concealed (see #2 above)
c. Whether or not it is positive.

Monitor Function Test

1. Review the schematic diagram as wel! as the physical
components of the monitored safety interlock(s)
circuit and determine whether the monitor would cause
the oven to become inoperable and remain so unti!
repaired if the required sefety interlock(s) should
fail to perform required functions. Determine if
interlock failures would disrupt the monitoring
function. Comment on inadequate operation.

2. The following techniques may be used to determine

whether the monitor wil] perform its function if the
monitored intertock(s) should fail.

Neon indicator method - for monitors using the
"crow-bar" techniques or using fuses and/or
thermal elements.

PART 8 - ENDURANCE LABORATORY TESTING

Introduction

The DHHS Performance Standard for microwave ovens requires
that the plane wave power density of the microwave radiation
emitted by a microwave oven not exceed 5 mW/cm* at any point
9 cm or more from the external surface of the oven after
acquisition by a purchaser (21 CFR 1030.10(c)). This
statement has been interpreted to require that this limit
shall apply throughout the useful life of the oven. in order
to evaluate the potential for leskage of the oven as a
function of use, the oven door and interlocks shall be cycled
at least 100,000 cycles of operation for household ovens and
200,000 cycles for commercial appliances. A cycle consists-
of closing door, energizing power and allowing the microwave
energy source to operate and stabilize, shutting off the
power by opening the door, and closing the oven door to
restart the cycle.

Preperatory Procedures

A. Test Stand Preparation

Endurance testing is performed on special test stands.
These test stands provide the means of operating the door

and its latching mechanisms as well as any operator con-
trols that are necessary to place the oven in the cook
mode.

Controls are provided to adjust the sequence, Speed of
operation, and the pneumatic devices required to operate
the particular model of oven being tested. Electro-
mechanical registers are provided to: display the total
number of. door closings, display the total number of
operating cycles, automatically terminate tne door
cycling after 10,000 cycles, and indicate the number of
cycles since the last 10,000 cycle termination.

B. Gven Preparation

1. Remove the oven wrapper and disconnect the timer
drive mechanism if it cannot be operated by the
endurance test stand mechanism. Make connections ;o
both sides of the high voltage transformer primary
(or equivalent) to drive the operating cycle counting
register. Replace the wrapper.

NY

Mount The oven on the endurance test stand and adjust
the operation of The endurance test stand so that The
door closure force simulates normal ooeration. The
docr shaii swing, where applicable, from the closed


ttl.

position to 90 + 10 degrees. Make connection to the
operating cycle register.

3. Place the carbon loaded, synthetic rubber endurance
load supplied by 8RH, or other suitable microwave
energy absorbing heat dissipating load in the oven
cavity. (The BRH load shall be placed with the solid
side up.)

4. Adjust the test stand controls so that the power
source operates and stabilizes without causing the
load to overheat.

Endurance Tests

CAUTION: lf at any time during ne 8 the microwave
radiation leakage exceeds 5 mW/cm STOP and notify
Supervisor.

A. Initial Set-up

1. Disconnect the door from the test stand and ‘perform a
microwave leakage survey following procedures de-
scribed in Appendix 8. The microwave leakage survey
in the compliance testing report may be used as the
initial survey.

2. Record the value of the maximum microwave leakage and
the location of the maximum leakage and your initials
on the preprinted worksheet.

3. Install the BRH endurance test toad and connect
endurance test stand oven operating mechanisms. Set
the counters to zero.

B. Daily Operational Procedure

ad -

1. Check toad placement.

2. Check registers for previous days counter readings.
3. Periodically throughout the day the stands and ovens
should be checked for proper operation. The test

loads should be warm but not hot. A cool test load
usually indicates oven malfunction.

4. At the end of each day record the following: (a)

accumulated number of cycles, (b) the date, and (c)
your initials on the preorinted worksheet.

Final Test

1.

Disconnect the door from the endurance test stand at
the completion of the scheduled number of cycles (at
feast 100,000 for household and at least 200,000 for
commercial ovens).

Perform microwave energy leakage survey as prescribed
in Attachment 68.

Determine if the interlocks are still funetioning by
making voltage or resistance checks at the end of the
test. ln some cases there will be test stand

monitors to indicate interlock operation.

Test the interlock monitor to see that it is capable
of disabling the microwave generator. If completion
of this test would cause current to flow in the
transformer the two leads on the primary may be dis-
connected. {See Part A, Section G of this document.)

Enter the results obtained above and the data accum-

ulated from each 10,000 cycle test on the endurance
test data sheet.

APPENDIX B

TEST PROCEDURES FOR MEASUREMENT OF
MICROWAVE ENERGY LEAKAGE FROM MICROWAVE OVENS

I. Purpose
To obtain the microwave radiation characteristics of a

microwave oven in order to determine whether the oven is
in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 1030.10.

‘1. Apparatus

A. Microwave Survey Meter

The microwave survey meter shall comply with the
requirements of 21 CFR 1030.10(c)(3)¢i).

The instrument shall reach 90% of its steady-state
reading within 3 seconds when it is subjected to a
stepped input signal.

The instrument shall have a ragiation detector with
an effective aperture of 25 cm” or {less as measured
in @ plane wave, said aperture having no dimension
exceeding 10 cm. This aperture shall be determined
at the fundamental frequency of the oven.

The instrument shali be capable of measuring the
power density limits of 21 CFR 1030.10 with an
accuracy of plus 25% and minus 20% (plus or minus 1}
decibel).

Exampies of instruments which fulfil these
requirements are the Narda model 8110 modified such
that when the Response Switch is itn’ the Slow

position, it reaches 90% of the steady-state value
in approximately 3 seconds; and the Holaday model
1501.

Ww

Line Voltage Mever

The instrument shall measure the AC line voltage
within + 1% of the reading.

itl. Testing Procedure for Microwave Leakage

A. Obtain a standard 600 mi glass beaker having an
inside diameter cf approximately 8.5 cm filled with

-B1-

“

tap water to a level of 275 + 15 ml, the water being
at a temperature of 20°C + 5°.

Place the beaker in the center of the toad carrying
surface of the oven. lf there is an adjustable
shelf, place it so that the center of the water
volume is as near the center of the cavity as
possible.

Set the microwave survey instrument up to measure
2,450 MHz signals. lf the oven operates at any
other frequency, consult Supervisor. Select the
appropriate range on the meter. Turn on and zero
the meter. Re-zero the meter any time the range is
changed. Check the battery and probe with their
respective "Test" switches. Check to make sure that
movement of the probe cable wil! not cause erratic
readings on the meter.

tf the power output of the oven is adjustable
(Hi-Low Power Switch or multipie magnetrons), set
the oven controls so that the maximum microwave
power output is obtained,

Close the oven door normally and activate any
latching mechanisms.

Turn the oven on, setting the timer for sufficient

operating time to complete the survey. Set the line
voltage with a Variac to the rated line voltage.
Should the water load begin to boil during the
leakage survey, it shall be replaced with water at

tne specified initial temperature before continuing
with the survey.

Survey the oven using the microwave survey meter in
the following manner:

1. Set the response switch to the fast position.

2. At all times the probe shal! be held in such a
manner as to be perpendicular to the surface
being surveyed. The probe shal! be held only by
the handle portion of the probe.

3. Survey around the door seal and notes locations
of all high leakage points. The maximum orobe
survey speed shal! not exceed one inch oper
second.

4. At several locations in the vicinity of each
hign leakage point, hold the probe stationary
until a steady state value is reached on the
microwave survey meter, Cosarve the maximum
