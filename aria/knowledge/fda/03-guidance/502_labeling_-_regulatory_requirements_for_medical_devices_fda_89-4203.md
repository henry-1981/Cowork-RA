FOREWORD

In October 1982, the Food and Drug Administration established the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) by merging the Bureau of Medical Devices and
the Bureau of Radiological Health.
The Center develops and implements national programs to protect the public health
in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to
assure the safety, effectiveness and proper labeling of medical devices, to control
unnecessary human exposure to potentially hazardous ionizing and nonionizing radiation,
and to ensure the safe, efficacious use of such radiation.
The Center publishes the results of its work in scientific journals and in its own
technical reports. These reports provide a mechanism for disseminating results of
CDRH and contractor projects. They are sold by the Government Printing Office and/or
the National Technical Information Service.
We welcome your comments and requests for further information.

PREFACE

This publication explains label and labeling regulations and requirements for
medical devices. The Food and Drug Administration has many labellfig-related
requirements to help assure that devices are used safely and effectively, including,
but not limited to, provisions on misbranding in Section 502 of the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic (FDhC) Act. This publication explains such topics as advertising matter
as labeling, what is false and misleading labeling, how prominent labeling
information must be, what inforfiation must appear on containers as well as outside
labels, adequate directions for dbe, prescription device requirements, and special
labeling for particular devices or types of devices and uses.
The Medical Device Amendmhts to the FD&C Act mandated the establishment
of "...an identifiable office to ptovide technical and other non-financial assistance
to small manufacturers of medical devices to assist them in complying with the
requirements of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act." The Division of Small
Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) was established to meet these requirements. In
addition to providing individual guidance and workshops, DSMA distributes a wide
variety of printed materials such as regulations, policy statements, question-andanswer booklets, and other FDA documents that help manufacturers understand the
substance and impact of FDA requirements, as well as the simplest or most
effective ways to meet them. This publication contains explanations and examples
of ways that companies can readily comply with labeling requirements. We hope the
information contained in this publication will alert manufacturers to FDA labeling
requirements, and prompt them to ask any questions they may have. Feel free to
visit, write, or call DSMA toll free at 800-638-2041. The local phone number is
(301) 443-6597.

INTRODUCTION

The United States Food and Drug Administration develops and administers regulations
under authority granted by laws passed by Congress that apply to food, drugs, cosmetics,
biologics, radiat~on-emitting electronic products, and medical devices. Of the fourteen
laws currently administered by FDA, three directly address the labeling of medical
devices:
o The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act - The FD&C Act applies to food, drugs,
cosmetics, biologics, and medical devices. Section 201 defines the terms "label"
and "labeling" as they ap ly to medical devices and draws a distinction between
these terms. Section 502( ) ( I ) and (2) requires that device labeling bear adequate
directions for use, operating and servicing instructions, and either adequate
warnings a ainst dangerous uses to health, or information necessary for the
protection o users.

?

B

o The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) - Because medical devices had previously
been defined and regulated by the FD&C Act, Section 5 of the subsequently
implemented FPLA Act refers to and makes use of the terms "label" and "labeling."
Requirements of the FPLA apply to over-the-counter medical devices distributed by
retail outlets.
o The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act (RCHSA) - Section 358(h) of the
RCHSA requires manufacturers or distributors of radiation-emitting electronic
products, including medical devices, to place certification labeling on their
devices.
The specific requirements of the above laws are implemented by the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in the form of regulations. Initially, FDA
whlch is a part of DHHS, drafts proposed regulations. These proposed regulations are then
submitted by the Commissioner of the FDA to the Office of Management and Budget. After the
required time frames for public comment have elapsed, these regulations are redrafted or
resubmitted, and may eventually result in finalized labeling regulations. Final
regulations are published in the FEDERAL REGISTER (FR) and have the force of law.
Labeling regulations promulgated under the above Acts which pertain to medical devices
are currently found in the following Parts of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR).
o
o
o
o
o

General Device Labeling - 2 1 CFR PART 801
In Vitro Diagnostic Products - 21 CFR PART 809
Investigational Device Exemptions - 2 1 CFR PART 8 12
Good Manufacturing Practices - 2 1 CFR PART 820
General Electronic Products - 2 1 CFR PART 1010

Each of these parts or categories will be covered in detail in following sections of
this chapter; however. before continuing, a few brief concepts and definitions from each
Act applicable to labeling are discussed.
The FD&C Act is the primary law under which the FDA takes action against regulated
products. Specifically:
o Sections 20 I (k) through 20 1 (m) of the FD&C Act address labeling "definitions. "

o Sections within Chapter 111 of the FD&C Act address prohibited acts with respect to
food, dru s, cosmetics, and medical devices. These prohibitions deal with two major
areas: "a ulteration" and "misbranding."

f

o Sections within Chapter V of the FD&C Act set forth specific instances whereby
dru s or devices will be considered to be adulterated or misbranded by the FDA. The
Ra lation Control for Health and Safety Act applies both to medical and other
radiation-emitting electronic devices. Labeling regulations based on this law
pertain to FDA certification of electronic products and are found under 21 CFR Part

C

10 10.

The medical aspects of the FPLA ap ly only to medical devices intended for sale to
consumers from retail outlets. This Act re ers to many sections of the FD&C Act. Labeling
regulations based on the FPLA are found under 2 1 CFR Part 801.

P

The RCHSA applies both to medical and other radiation-emittin electronic devices.
Labeling regulations based on this law pertain to FDA certification o electronic products
and are found under 2 1 CFR Part 1010.

f

LABELS AND LABELING
Section 201 of the FD&C Act distinguishes between label and labelin
Certain
provisions in Chapter V of the FD&C Act apply specifically to the "label" of t e device,
others are related to its "labeling." These terms are related, but not interchangeable. Of
the two, the term "label" is more restricted. Generally, it consists of that art of the
display confined to the device itself. On the other hand, "labeling" deals wit the label
on the device, and descriptive and informational literature that accompanies the device.

t

R

Section 201 (k) defines "label" as a:
o "display of written, printed, or graphic matter upon the immediate container of any
article.. ."
The term "immediate container" does not include package liners. Any word, statement,
or other information appearing on the immediate contamer must also appear "on the outside
container or wrapper, lf any there be, of the retail package of such article, or is easily
legible through the outside container or wrapper. "
Section 20 1 (m) defines "labeling" as:
o "all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter
( 1 ) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or
(2) accompanyin such article" at any time while a device is held for sale after
shipment or elivery for shipment in interstate commerce.

d

The term "accompanying" is interpreted liberally to mean more than physical
association with the product. It extends to posters, tags, pamphlets, circulars, booklets,
brochures, instruction books, direction sheets, fillers, etc. "Accompanying" also includes
labeling that is brought together with the device after shipment or delivery for shipment
in interstate commerce.

Labeling and Advertising
The distinction between labeling and advertising, both of which draw attention to the
article to be sold, is often superfic~alor nebulous. Both are used for a similar purpose,
i.e.? to provide information about the product. Thus, according to an appellate court
decision: "Most, if not all advertising, is labeling. The term 'labelint' is defined in
the FD&C Act as including all printed matter accompanyin any article. ongress did not,
and we cannot, exclude from the definition printed matter w ich constitutes advertising."

t

MISBRANDING
Section 502 of the FD&C Act contains provisions on misbranding and false or misleading
labeling. Specific re uirements and exemptions are contained in regulations promulgated
under this Act as wi 1 be discussed in forthcoming sections in this chapter. A device is
misbranded if:

9

o Its labeling is false or misleading in any particular;
o It is in packa e form and its label fails to contain the name and place of business
of the manu acturer, packer, or distributor; and an accurate statement of the
quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count;

B

o Any required wording is not prominently displayed as compared with other wording on
the device, or is not clearly stated;
o Its label does not bear adequate directions for use including warnings against use
in certain pathological conditions; or by children where its use ma be dangerous
to health; or against unsafe dosage, or methods, or duration of a ministration or
application ;

B

o It is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner or with the frequency
or duration prescribed, recommended or suggested in the labeling; or
o It does not comply with the color additives provisions listed under Section 706 of
the Act.
Sections 502 and 706 of the FD&C Act predate the medical device amendments and apply
equally to food, drug, cosmetic, veterinary drugs, and biolo ics. The Medical Device
Amendments of 1976 provided new authority for dealin specifica ly with the misbranding of
medical devices. These additional provisions liste below state under what further
circumstances a device is misbranded.

d

f

o If the device's established name (if it has one), its name in an official
compendium, or any common or usual name is not prominently printed in type at least
half as large as that used for any proprietary name;
o If the device is subject to a performance standard and it does not bear the
labeling prescribed in that standard;
o If there is a failure or refusal to comply with any requirement rescribed under
the FD&C Act, Section 5 18 on notification and other remedies, or ailure to furnish
any materials or information requested by or under Section 519 on reports and
records; or

F

o If it has any representation that creates an impression of official approval
because of the possession by the firm of an FDA registration or premarket
notification number.
FALSE OR MISLEADING LABELING
Section 502(a) declares that a drug or device is misbranded if its labeling proves
false or misleading in any particular. The phrase "false or misleading" is not confined in
meaning to untrue, forged, fraudulent, or dece tive. In fact, the word, statement, or
illustration may be true in the strict sense of t e word; however, the labeling can be
deemed by the FDA to be in violation of the law if it proves deceptive to the customer. It
is not a necessary condition that the labeling should be flatly and baldly false; the word
"misleadin!"
in the Act means that labeling is deceptive if it is such as to create or
lead to a alse impression in the mind of the reader. A "false im ression" may result not
only from a false or deceptive statement, but may also be insti led in the mind of the
purchaser b ambi uity or misdirection. It may also be caused by failure to inform the
consumer o facts t at are relevant to those statements actually made. In other words, the
label that remains silent as to certain consequences may be as deceptive as the label that
contains extravagant claims.

g

r

P

1

A device can be misbranded by making reference to a medical device registration, or a
510(k) premarket notification number assi ned by FDA in response to a firm's filing
requirements under the FD&C Act. Section tf07.39 of 21 CFR, Misbranding by reference to
establishment registration or registration number, and 807.97 of 2 1 cfr, misbranding by
reference to premarket notification, state that the assigned numbers do not constitute
official FDA approval of the device. Additionally, any representation that connotes FDA
approval as a result of complying with the devlce regulations is misleading and
constitutes misbranding.
Similiarly, a device can be misbranded by reference to an Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) or Premarket Approval (PMA). Section 301 (I) prohibits the use on labeling
of any device, or in any advertising relatin to such device, of any representation or
suggestion or approval of an application wit respect to such device is In effect under
Section 5 15, IDE or Section 520(g), PMA.

1

Examples of false representations are:
o incorrect, inadequate or incomplete identification;
o unsubstantiated claims of therapeutic value;
o inaccuracies concerning condition, state, treatment, size, shape or style;
o substitution of parts or material; and
o use of the prefix "U.S." or other similar indication suggesting Government or
Agency approval or endorsement of the product.
Examples of misleading labeling include:
o ambiguity, half-truths, and trade puffery;
o expressions of opinion or subjective statements; and

o failure to reveal material facts, consequences that may result from use, or the
existence of difference of opinion.
Examples of other objectionable labeling practices include:
o
o
o
o

deceptive pictorial matter;
misleading testimonials;
misleading list of parts or components; and
use of brand or trade names instead of "established names."

GENERAL DEVICE LABELING
INTRODUCTION
The general labeling re uirements for medical devices are contained in 21 CFR Part
801. These regulations speci y the minimum requirements for all devices. Later sections in
this chapter discuss any additional requirements needed for specific categories of
devices.

B

GENERAL LABELING PROVISIONS
Name and Place of Business (801.1)
o The label of a device shall contain the name and place of business of manufacturer,
packer, or distributor including the street address, city, state, and zip code.
o If the firm's street address is in the local telephone directory, the street
address can be omitted.
o If the firrn listed on the label is not the manufacturer, the firrn information must
be qualified by an appropriate statement such as, "Manufactured for ..." or
"Distributed by.. .."
Intended Use (801.4)
o If a packer, distributor, or seller intends a device for uses other than those
intended by the person from whom he received the device, these parties must furnish
adequate labeling in accordance with the new intended use.
o If a manufacturer knows or has information indicating that his device is to be used
for conditions or purposes other than which it was intended, he is required to
provide adequate labeling in accordance with such other uses. (An example of this
might be a manufacturer of dental X-ray equipment who is routinely selling his
product to podiatrists.)
Adequate Directions (80 1.5)
o "Adequate directions for use" means directions under which the layman can use a
device safely and for the purposes intended. This includes:
-

Statements of all purposes for which and conditions under which the device can
be used;

- Quantity of dose for each use and usual quantities for persons of different ages
and physical conditions;
-

Frequency of administration;

-

Duration of application;

-

Time of administration in relation to other factors;

-

Route or method of application; and

-

Any preparation necessary for use.

False or Misleading Statements (801.6)
o A device is misbranded if it makes a false or misleading statement with respect to
another device, drug, food, or cosmetic.
Prominence of Statements (80 1.15)
o A word, statement or other required information may lack the required prominence
and conspicuousness for the following reasons:
-

If it fails to appear on the part or panel that is displayed under customary
conditions of purchase;

-

If the package contains sufficient space and the required information fails to
appear on two or more panels, each of which is designed to render it to be
d~splayedunder customary conditions of purchase;

-

Failure to extend required labeling over package space provided;

-

Lack of sufficient label space for required labeling due to placement of nonrequired labeling on the package; or

-

Smallness or style of type, insufficient contrast between labeling and package
background, designs which obscure labeling, or overcrowding of labeling which
renders it unreadable.

o Exemptions may be granted in those instances where device labeling lacks sufficient
space for required labeling provided that:
-

Existing label space is not taken up by includin non-required information or by
giving prominence to a portion of the required la eling; and

-

Existing label space is not used for any representations in a foreign language.

%

o All labeling shall be in English with the exception of products distributed solely
within Puerto Rico or a U.S. territory where the predominant Ian uage is other than
English. In these instances the predominant language may e substituted for
English.

%

-

If any representation on the device label or labeling a pears in a foreign
language, then all required labeling shall also appear in that oreign language.

P

LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR OVER-THE-COUNTER (NON-PRESCRIPTION)
DEVICES
Principal Display Pane1 (80 1.60)
o The principal display panel is that portion of the label which is intended to be
displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions for retail
sales. The area of the principal display panel is considered to be:
-

In the case of a rectangular package, the height x width of one side;

-

In the case of a cylindrical or nearly cylindrical package, 40% of height x
circumference; or

-

In the case of any other shapes, 40% of the total surface area of the container,
unless a more prominent site exists.

Statement of Identity (80 1.61)
o The statement of identity of the device must be listed on the principal display
panel.
-

It must list the common name of the device followed by a statement of its
principal intended action(s);

-

Indications for use must be listed in the directions for use: and

- The statement must be in bold t pe, reasonably related in size to the most
prominent printed matter on the isplay anel, and must be in lines generally
parallel to the base of the package on whic it rests.

!

Net Quantity of Contents Statement (80 1.62)
o The label of an over-the-counter (OTC) device in ackage form must contain a statement of net quantity of contents in terms of weig t , measure, numerical count; or a
combination of numerical count and weight, measure, or size, which are described
below:

i'

-

Count - If the declaration by count does not give accurate information as to the
quantity, it shall be augmented by statements of weight, measure, or size;

-

Measure - In cases of established customer usage and trade custom where units of
linear measure or measure of area are used, they shall be augmented when
necessary with statements of weight measure or size. Liquid measure is to be
expressed in terms of the U.S. gallon of 23 1 cu. in. and quart, pint, and fluid
ounce subdivisions, and shall express the volume at 68 degrees Farenheit; and

-

Weight - Terms of weight are to be expressed in avoirdupois ound and ounce.
Units of metric weight or measure are considered su plement.!a The declaration
may contain common or decimal fractions. Common ractions shall be reduced to
the~rlowest terms.

P

-

Placement - The declaration shall appear as a separate item on each principal
display panel; and be separated by at least a space equal to the height of the
lettering used in the declaration, from other information appearin above and
below, and separated by at least twice the width of the letter "N" rom labeling
to the left or nght.

B

o The height, ratio, and placement of letterin required on the principal display
panel are a function of a number of variab es related to package slze, shape,
composition, and the method of affixing the required labeling. This is described in
deta~lunder 2 1 CFR 80 1 .62 (g) to (k).

f

EXEMPTIONS FROM ADEQUATE DIRECTIONS FOR USE
Prescription Device (80 1.109)

0 A device which, because of any potentiality for harmful effect, or the supervision
of the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary to its use is not
safe unless under a practitioner licensed by law to direct use of this device, and
hence for which "adequate directions for use" cannot be written, is exempt from
such provided:
-

It is in the possession of either a licensed practitioner or persons lawfully
engaged in the manufacture or distribution of the product;

-

Its labeling bears an Rx statement, i.e., "Caution: Federal law restricts this
device to sale by or on the order of a
(insert name of physician, dentist,
or other licensed ~ractitioner) :"

-

Its labeling bears information for use including, indications, effects, routes,
methods, and frequency and duration of administration, and an relevant hazards,
contraindications, side effects, and precautions under whici the device can
safely be used; and

- All labeling other than labels and cartons bears the date of issuance or date of
the latest revision.
Retail Exemption (801.110)
o A device which is delivered to the ultimate user by a licensed practitioner in the
course of his practice or upon prescription are requlred only to bear the name and
address of the practitioner, directions for use, and any required cautionary
statements.
Commonly Known Directions (80 1.1 16)
o A device is exempt from adequate directions for use if adequate directions for
common uses are known to the ordinary individual.
In Vitro Diagnostics (80 1.1 19)
o Are exempt from adequate directions for use provided that they meet those
requirements found in 809.10 (covered in the "In Vitro Diagnostic Product Labeling"
section of this chapter).

Medical Devices Used in Manufacturing (80 1.122)
o Devices used for processing, repacking, or manufacturing of another drug or device
are exempt from adequate directions for use if they bear the statement: "Caution:
For manufacturing, processing, or repacking."
Medical Devices Used in Teaching, Research, or Law Enforcement (801.125)
o Devices for use in teaching, law enforcement, research, and analysis are exempt if
the device is shipped or sold to, or in the possession of, persons lawfully engaged
in instruction in pharmacy, chemistry, or medicine (not involving clinical use),
law enforcement, or chemical analysis or physical testing.

IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCT LABELING
INTRODUCTION
In vitro diagnostic products (IVD's) are those reagents, instruments, and systems
intended for use in diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of
the state of health, In order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its
sequelae. Such products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and
examination of specimens taken from the human body. In vitro diagnostic (IVD) labeling
requirements are located in 21 CFR Part 809. Numbers appearing in parentheses next to
subject headings are the corresponding sections of 21 CFR. This section contains the basic
requirements for label and labeling (package insert) as specified in the labeling
regulations for in vitro diagnostic products.
Specific information on the development and drafting of labels and labeling is
contamed in the "Development of Device Labeling" section in this chapter.

LABELING FOR INVESTIGATIONAL AND 5 10(K) DEVICES

INTRODUCTION
An "investigational device" is a device that is the object of a clinical investigation
or research involving one or more human subjects to determine its safety and effectiveness. This definition also includes "transitional devices" which are devices that had been
previously regulated by the FDA as drugs prior to the passage of the Medical Device
Amendments, for example, pregnancy test kits.

All newly registered medical device establishments and existin medical device firms
introducing new or significant1 modified devices must notify F A of their intent to
market the device at least 9 days before introducing the devices into commercial
distribution. This is done via a 510(k) Premarket Notification submission which is
required by that corresponding section of the FD&C Act. The purpose of this submission,
which includes copies of proposed device labeling, is so that FDA can determine whether or
not the device as labeled is substantially equivalent to one that was in commercial
distribution prior to May 28, 1976. This includes Class I , 11, and 111 devices, or a
device that was laced onto the market after that date that was classified by FDA as Class
I or Class 11. T e 510(k) process does not require manufacturers to demonstrate that their
devices are identical to marketed devices; only that the devices and their labeled uses be
substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness. Clinical data may be
re uired before FDA can determine whether a device is substantially equivalent under a
51 (k).

R

If a device is found by the FDA to be not substantiall e uivalent and
Class 111, the firm must demonstrate proof of safety andl e&cacr
marketing. This demonstration is done via a Premarket Approval application
must contain data which show the device to be safe and effective. An approved
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) enables a device to be shipped to researchers in
order to collect data before the device is cleared by FDA for commercial distribution.
FDA must approve IDE applications for significant risk devices. Non si nificant risk
devices are subject only to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. The DE exempts
device sponsors and investigators from certain regulatory requirements, i .e., those
related to: performance standards, misbranding, premarket approval, registration, and
, for the duration of the study. The IDE application will contain an investigalistinr protocol which details the nature of the study, and the nature of the data to be
tiona
obtained and furnished to FDA as proof of safety and efficacy. The sponsor provides
detailed information on device labeling in the investigational plan. This information may
vary depending on the device and the nature of the study, and can extend to such items as
any advertisements placed in order to recruit human subjects for the investigation.

f

PREMARKET NOTIFICATION [ 5 1O(K)] LABELING
There is no application form, but there is a format for the 5 10(k) submission
contained in 2 1 CFR 807.81 to 807.97. Information required in the submission includes: a
descri tion of the device and its specifications, the class into which the device has been
place by FDA, the firm's registrat~onnumber, a statement comparing the device to others
of comparable type, and copies of labeling and promotional literature. The proposed device
labeling submitted in the 5 10(k) plays an important role.

cJ'

Labeling information to be included in a 5 10(k) submission may include:
o device labels;
storage conditions;
instruction manuals;

o service manuals;
o promotional literature such as advertisements, publications, etc. ; and
o other labeling requirements such as UL, F.C.C., etc.

If the device labeling makes new, previously unsubstantiated claims or romotes use of
the device for purposes or conditions other than currently marketed simi ar devices. the
FDA would most likely place the device into Class I11 and it would need premarket approval
prior to marketing. In those instances where a device is substantially equivalent to an
existing device, or technology currently in use, a firm should attempt to obtain 510(k)
clearance rather than go for premarket approval. The savings in time and cost could be
considerable.

P

IDE DEVICE LABELING REQUIREMENTS (21 CFR PART 812.5)
If a device is found by the FDA to be not substantially equivalent and placed into
Class 111, the firm must submit a PMA to FDA prior to marketing to demonstrate proof of
safet and efficacy. The firm must first apply for an Investigational Device Exemption
( I D d to exempt them from certain regulatory requirements for the duration of the study.
The IDE appl~cationwill contain an investigational rotocol which details the nature of
the study, and the nature of the data to be obtaine and furnished to FDA as proof of
safety and efficacy. The firm provides detailed information on device labeling in the
investigational protocol. This information may vary depending on the device and the nature
of the study, and can extend to such items as any advertisements laced in order to
recruit human subjects for the investigation. For example, product abeling should be
sufficient to insure stability of the test article for the duration of the study (storage
requirements, recalibration procedures), bear sufficient directions for proper administration, alert the user of the investigational status of the article, and detail procedures
to follow in the event of patient injury.

f

P

In addition to any labeling requirements specified in the IDE study protocol, the
following general labelmg is required:
o Information required in 801.1, i.e., name and place of business of the firm,
quantity, and in 80 1.109, the following statement: "CAUTION: Investigational
Device. Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use."
o A description of all relevant contraindications, hazards, adverse effects, interfering substances or devices, warnings and precautions.
o Absence of any statements that are false or misleading, or that represent the
device as safe and effective for its investigational purpose.
o Any device shipped solely for use on laboratory animals must be labeled: "CAUTION Device for investigational use in laboratory animals or other tests that do not
involve human subjects."
GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE LABELING REQUIREMENTS
INTRODUCTION
Medical device manufacturers must incorporate in their quality assurance (QA) pro ram
several elements that relate to labelin in order to meet the requirements of the bMP
regulation. The QA program must be a equate to assure that labeling meets the GMP device
master record requirements with respect to legibility, adhesion, etc., and assure that
labeling operations are controlled so that correct labeling is always issued and used.

d

Because many activities must be performed and controlled during the development and
use of lahelin , Table 5.1 is presented as a checklist. It contains a typical sequence of
events require to develop and control labeling.

f

Labeling includes equipment labels, control labels, package labels, directions for
use, maintenance manuals, etc. The displays on CRT's and other electronic message panels
are considered labeling if instructions, prompts, cautions, and parameter identification
information are given.
Various sections of the GMP regulation have an impact on labeling:
Section
820.20(a)(2) requires approval or resection of packaging materials and labeling; and
Section 820.40 requires buildings to ke of suitable desi n and have sufficient space for
packaging and labeling operations. Section 820.120 dea s with specific requirements for
the design and control of labelin It ap lies to the design application of labeling to
assure legibility under normal con% *itions o use over the ex ected life of the device; and
also to inspection, handling, storage, and distribution o labeling. FDA considers a
device to be adulterated if these requirements are not met. These requirements do not
appl to the adequacy of labeling content, except to make sure the content meets the
labe lng specifications contained in the device master record. However, failure to comply
with GMP requirements such as proofreading and change control could result in labeling
content errors. In such cases, the device is misbranded and adulterated. Labeling content
is covered in the section on "Development of Labeling."

f

!

!

T

Specifications are required in the device master record (820.181, 182) for the content
and physical design parameters of labels. Labeling specifications are: engineering drawing
andlor artwork for each label, ap ropriate inspection or control procedures, and appropriate procedures for attaching the abels. All procedures, drawings, and artwork must have
the name of the preparer, an a proval signature, and a date. The approval signature, date,
etc., may be on the backside o artwork or on a label approval form. Further, artwork may
contain only an identification code or title if the "content" of the artwork is duplicated
on approved engineering drawings or adequately identified (cross-referenced) with respect
to the label approval form.

P

f)

Hardcopy labels, package inserts. and similar labeling are specified and urchased as
components. For correct purchase and use of labeling, specificat~onsare usua ly stated on
engineering drawings andlor purchase specifications. Thus, artwork or "copy" alone will
not fulfill the device master record requirements for labeling except or the most
simplistic labeling such as brief errata sheets.

P

The engineering drawings or purchase specifications and mounting procedure must
specify, as ap ropriate, the label substrate, dimensions, ink, finish, mounting method,
etc., so that t e purchased label will remain attached and legible during the customary
conditions of processing, storage, handling, distribution, and use.

R

Front panels, other instrument panels, meters, fuses, pushbuttons, and the like often
are labels or contain labels and must, as appropriate, meet GMP master record and control
requirements. Component specifications, assembly drawings, and testlinspection procedures
are appropriate GMP controls to prevent mixup of meters, pushbuttons, and other labeled
instrument controls. Controls to prevent mixups are generally not needed for front and
other instrument panels.
Whether a firm considers a software driven display to be labeling or data makes little
difference under the GMP regulation, because either way, the finished device labeling or
data must meet the device master record specifications. When firms develop and validate

meets all applicable requirements, such as adherence to specifications in the master
record, correct parameter identification, agreement with the ~nstruction manual, and, of
course, correct d~splayof performance data.
When reviewing or auditin labeling operations, it is wise to keep in mind that the
GMP regulation contains flexi le requirements and thus allows flexibility in a quality
assurance program. The degree of labeling control needed to satisfy the GMP regulation
varies considerably for different devices and operations. In order to avoid wasting money
and increasin the cost of health care. manufacturers need to give considerable and
prudent thou i t to the appropriate level of control needed for their operations as allowed
by 820.5. In ormation and guidelines presented in this chapter should aid manufacturers in
making these decisions. The level of control needed should be reconsidered when products
are added or changed. Likewise, the controls needed and success of the existing control
program must be reviewed during QA system audits.

f

GENERAL DEVICE LABELING REQUIREMENTS
Label Integrity
All labels must be designed and applied to devices and containers so that the labels
will remain in place and le ible during the customary conditions of distribution, storage.
and use. Likew~se,other la eling such as user instructions should remain legible durmg
customary storage and use. Note that 820.120(a) which states "Labels shall be designed,
printed, and applied so as to remain legible ..." refers to the actual design of the label
and mounting method--not just testing or inspection of these to show that design requirements have been met. [Inspection is covered by the second sentence of 820.120(a). and by
820.120(e), 820.20(a), 820.80 and 820.160.1 For example. labeling printed by machines onto
plastic in vitro diagnostic media plates is sometimes smeared and thus is inadequate [FD&C
502(f)]. The manufacturers of such devices must assure that the print is legible and will
remain legible until used.

%

Some magazines use "wet" ink which smears when touched by sweaty or oily fingers.
Obviously, thls type ink will not meet the GMP design requirements for package inserts.
instruction manuals, etc.
Labels may be mounted by adhesives. screws, rivets. drive screws. etc.. or printed or
etched onto panels andlor onto controls. The labels should be located so that they will be
seen but not be abraded during use. (Some of us have seen the unbelievable cases where
safety labels on ladders and riding lawnmowers were placed in the foot rest areas. Of
course, they were scrubbed off after a few uses!)

Receipt and Inspection
reprinted containers.
Upon receipt, all packaging and labeling materials.
jncluding
inserts. and preprinted packaging materials must be examined
and. i deemed necessary by
the company. tested to assure conformance with specifications. Also. samples of labels
must be proofread by a designated individual(s). After being accepted by a responsible
individual. these components may be placed into inventory or into production. These
inspections must be recorded in the device history record as required by 820.80(a) and
820.120 to show that inspection and proofreading were performed. The inspection record for
device labeling should be kept simple.

P

Area Separation and Inspection
All labeling and packaging operations should be separated to the de ree necessary
(820.5 and 820.40) to make certain there are no mixups between similar pro ucts or labels.
Separation may be either a physical or spatial separation or by performing the labeling
and packaging at different tlmes for different devices. Separation is not required when
mixups are impossible such as the case of labeled front panels that only fit the intended
family of instruments (devices).

ti

The likelihood of a labeling mixup determines how stringent production area controls
should be. For example, label control need not be stringent if only dissimilar products
and labeling are processed. Before beginning any packa ing and labeling operation In which
mixup could occur, the production area and equipment or the operation must be thoroughly
exammed to make certain that any devices and labeling materials remaining from prevlous
operations have been removed. It is important to make certain that the surrounding area,
tables, packa ing lines, printing machines, and other equipment are cleared of labels and
other materia s used in the prevlous operation.

?

f

Unused labeling that contains pre-coded serial numbers, manufacturing date, expiration
date, control number, etc., should be destroyed and not returned to the label storage
area. The GMP regulation does not require reconciliation of the number of labels used
versus the number issued, although this control is recommended for some devices, such as
when different sizes of the same product are being packaged or otherwise labeled.
Storage
All printed packaging and labeling materials, including preprinted containers, inserts
and preprinted packaging materials, must be stored in an area and manner suitable to
prevent mixups (820.40, 820.120). Labeling should be identified and segregated to the
degree necessary to prevent mixing of similar labeling. Access to labeling should be
limited to authorized personnel.
Storage control should be appropriate for the number and kind of devices. For example,
a firm that manufactures only one product with one label does not need an elaborately
controlled storage area. Similarly, a firm with only a few types of devices having
dissimilar labeling would not normally require stringent control.
One case that requires dedicated attention to storage and control is prelabeled
"sterile" but "not-yet-sterilized" devices. Firms must make absolutely certain that mixups
cannot occur. Also make certain that all such samples, if used for market promotion. are
sterile or stamped with a manifest caution statement because a packaged and labeled
market- romotion sample might be used by the recipient. Quality awareness training is
requirel by Section 820.25 and marketing personnel must be informed of labeling control
requirements and the consequences of a violation.
Label Check and Record
When issued for use, labeling must be carefully examined to make certain the contents
of the labeling comply with the labeling specifications in the device master record for
the specific device being produced. This examination must include any control numbers or
expiration dates used on the labels. A record of this issuance check, including the date
and name of the person performing the examination, must be made in the devlce history
record.

If used, expiration dates must reflect the time after final packaging during which the
device is fit for its intended use when stored and used per its labelrng. The manufacturer
should have stability test data which establishes the interval that the device remains fit
for use.
If label mixups cannot occur--for example, a firm makes only one device or uses only
one label--and there are no control numbers or ex iration dates, the original inspection
when the labeling was placed into inventory is an a equate check for compliance with the
master record specifications. A second check need not be performed because it serves no
purpose (820.5). If, however, there is any possibility that incorrect labeling can be
used, a second check must be made when the labeling is issued for application, packaging,
or shipping.

i

Changes
Labeling is part of the device master record; therefore, all changes to labelin
must
be made under a formal change control system similar to that required for speci ications
[820.100(a)(2)]. Any changes to labeling must be formally reviewed and authorized before
implementation.

?

When making changes to primary aspects of a device and to primary documentation, the
review group must determine if any secondar items such as labels or instructions are
affected and also need changing. There should e a check-off block on change-order forms
for recording that the effect of the primary change on labeling was considered and
appropriate action was taken.

g

Relabeling and Over-labeling
Over-labeling by placing a new label over an old label is discouraged by FDA but is
acceptable as long as the new label and its use meet GMP requirements (820.120, 820.1 15)
for attachment, legibility, reprocessing, and change control. (Over-labeling is also
discouraged in some foreign countries.)
ADDITIONAL LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR CRITICAL DEVICES
Labeling for critical devices must meet the noncritical device labeling requirements
and meet the three additional requirements in 820.121 as covered below.
Control Number
Critical device labeling must contain a control number, serial number, letters, etc.,
for traceability. This means a control number for the finished device, and not the label
itself. Most labeling, however, also contains another number, such as a drawing number,
for control of labeling configuration and procurement.
The control number for traceability need not be on every label on the deviw; however,
the control number must appear on the unit label that goes to the ultimate user. The label
on a shipping carton for bulk items does not meet this requirement because bulk items may
o to a central distribution point in the user-facility and the shipping carton would most
ikely be discarded. In order to meet this traceability requirement, a label that would
most likely reach the nurse or other user station must have the control number.

Proofreader's Signature
Before releasing labeling for critical devices to invento , samples of labeling must
be proofread as required for noncritical devices. In ad ition, the signature of the
proofreader and the date of the proofreading must be recorded in the device history
record.

?'

Access Restriction
Access to labeling must be restricted to authorized personnel. Labeling also should he
stored in an adequately segregated area to minimize the chance of mixups. Although the
access re uirement ap lies to labeling for critical devices, it is also recommended for
labeling or noncritica! devices because it increases the control over the label storage
area with no significant increase in cost.

?

STERILE DEVICE LABELING
Special attention should be given to the labeling of sterile devices. Devices that are
not sterile in their entiret (for example, sterility may be needed only for the lumen of
certain devices) must be abeled to properly inform users what is actually intended to be
"sterile" in the package. For example, a possible limiting statement might be:

Y

"Caution: Only the fluid path of the set is sterile and nonpyrogenic. Do not use in a
sterile or aseptic area without proper precautions. "
Some devices are intended to be sterilized by the user before use. In this situation,
the labeling should provide adequate information as to at least one suitable method of
sterilization and any precautions or safeguards to be followed. For example, the labeling
should describe any:
o special cleaning methods required;

r

o changes in the ph sical characteristics of the device that may result from
reprocessing which a fect its safety, effectiveness, or performance; and
o limit on the number of times resterilization and reuse can be done without
affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device.
In the case of single-use sterile devices, some manufacturers include labelin to
advise against resterilization and reuse. Some devices are simply not designed or
constructed to be recleaned, and may not be capable of withstanding the necessary
recleaning and resterilization procedures. Where reuse is common practice, manufacturers
are encouraged to provide the mformation described in the above list.
The label of multi-device kits or packages containing a comhination of sterile and
nonsterile products must not state or imply that all contents are sterile.
The need for users to have instructions on how to open a sterile device package to
avoid contamination of the device also needs to be evaluated, and when necessary, such
instructions should be included in the labeling.

When a manufacturer modifies a device, the manufacturer must also review the labeling
to make certain that it reflects current revisions and specifications. Some manufacturers
identif labeling with a drawing number plus a revision code or date as an aid in
identi ying current labeling. The package insert or other labeling for in vitro diagnostic
products is required to contain the revision date [21 CFR 809.10(b)(lS)J.

f"

Shelf-life datin solely for packa e integrity and sterility is not usually re uired
by FDA for genera medical devices. #here may be a need for expiration dating w en a
particular component of a device, such as a battery or diagnostic reagent, has a finite
useful life. Labeling for in vitro diagnostic devices [809.10(a) and (b)] requires an
expiration date or some other means by which users may be assured of quality at the time
of use. This requirement applies to both sterile and nonsterile in vitro diagnostic
devices.

k

1

Althou h not required by regulation, most manufacturers of complex devices and sterile
devices vo untaril use lot or serial numbers for production control and, if the need
arises, to expe ite failure investigations, repairs, modifications, or recalls. Lot,
batch, or other control numbers are required for:

f

d:

o critical devices (820.12 1);
o some products subject to radiological health standards; and
o in vitro diagnostic devices [809.1O(a)(9)J.
Adequate labeling for a medical device requires proper design and procurement of the
labels and labeling. Design includes labeling content that meets the requirement of the
GMP regulation as well as the needs of the customer. To achieve these goals a number of
concepts must be kept in mind such as: writing to the reader, referrmg to the actual
device in labeling, obvious identification of the controls used, etc.
CONTRACT STERILIZATION
Finished devices that are terminally sterilized by a firm other than the manufacturer
pose a unique labeling problem. A common industry practice is to send the finished device
In its final packaging to a contractor for sterilization. The final packaging is labeled
as sterile even though the goods are unsterile during shipment from the manufacturer to
the contractor. Specific restrictions apply in this instance, and a written agreement
between the parties must be in effect [820.150(e)]. The requirements for the labeling of
in process sterile goods in transit to the contract sterilizer are addressed in detail by
Section 80 1.150, and covered previously under Other Exemptions in this booklet. Extreme
care must be taken in this situation to eliminate the possibility of an unsterilized
product being mistaken for a sterilized product. A firm should seriously consider the use
of "visual indicator" labeling to distinguish between product before and after sterilization, e.g., the use of indicator tape with bands that develop color upon exposure to
steam or ethylene oxide, or stick-on "dots" which change color upon exposure to radiation.
Bear in mind that visual indicators will provide confidence that the product has been
exposed to a sterilant and not that the product is sterile. A firm should also consider
the use of dosimeters, i.e., a product that undergoes an irreversible change in physical
or chemical properties that is proportional to the amount of exposure to a sterilant. Some
contract sterilizers affix labeling to a contractor's product in the form of a
sterilization number stamped upon the device container, or outer shipping containers.
Firms who use the contract sterilizer's lot number as assurance that their devices have
undergone sterilization should determine, via an audit of the facility if possible, that
sterilization lot numbers are applied after, not before, being subject to sterilization.

Regulations on distribution are contained in 21 CFR 801, Subparts A and E; and GMP
Sections 820.150, 820.160 and 820.16 1. Devices that have been sterilized. held. or ship ed
to the manufacturer's warehouse or other controlled distribution point before &a1
release must be properly labeled. The pallets, or designated unit, must be marked to
indicate the status of the device such as "sterilized: awaiting test results," or an
equivalent statement. The company must be able to show that it has control of the devices
until final release and, if necessary, could have them destroyed or returned
for
reprocessin . For this reason, a distributor's warehouse or facility is not considered a
controlled istribution point.

RADIATION-EMITTING DEVICE LABELING
INTRODUCTION
Labeling of radiation-emitting products applies to medical devices; all products which
emit ionizing, or nonionizing electromagnetic or particulate radiation; and products which
emit sonic, infrasonic, or ultrasonic radiation as the result of operation of an
electronic circuit. Radiation-emitting devices include products that emit radiation either
by desi n (e.g., X-ray equipment) or as a consequence of operation (e.g., television set),
but exc ude products that emit radiation as a result of the decay of a radioactive element
or isotope (e. ., an ionization type smoke detector). Section 358 of the Radiation Control
for Health an Safety Act (RCHSA) of 1968 authorizes the development of Federal standards
for these ty es of radiation producing products. These standards are contained within the
regulations isted under 2 1 CFR Part 1000. The corresponding regulations are listed by
product ty e in subse uent headings of this section. This booklet will cover only those
portions o these stan ards related to product labelin and will not attempt to address
technical specifications contained in the standards. T us, the nature and placement of
labeling may vary from those previously discussed under General Device Labeling; however,
the concepts of "label" and "labeling" remain the same, e.g., the "label" of a device
might consist of a warning label on the console of an X-ray system, as well as a red
indicator light on the panel: the "label" of a television receiver might consist not only
of the name of the manufacturer. date of manufacture, and user caution statements, but
also of labels inside the receiver related to high voltages and X-ray shielding.

At the present time, as a matter of choice and practicality, FDA does not choose to
actively regulate some common household products such as radios and incandescent light
bulbs; however, if such products were found to pose a consumer hazard, the FDA could
choose to regulate them. A good example of a hazard to consumers is the cordless
telephone. As a result of consumer complaints, and confirmed injuries due to the
placement, volume, and frequencies of ringers in certain brands of telephones, FDA set and
enforced guidelines to prevent hearing injuries.
This section will cover labeling of radiation-emitting medical and other electronic
devices. Due to the amount of technical data contained in the corresponding sections of
the CFR, reprints of the CFR sections pertaining to laser labeling will be used where
appropriate to demonstrate format requirements. Numbers appearing in parentheses next to
subject headings are the corresponding sections of 21 CFR.

GENERAL LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS ( 1010.3)
Manufacturers of electronic products covered under a performance standard shall
provide the followin information on a tag or label permanently affixed or inscribed on
the product. The fo lowing information should be readily viewable when the product is
fully assembled:

f

o The full name and address of the manufacturer of the product.
-

Alternately, the product can contain the full name and address of a compan or
individual other than the manufacturer, provided that the full name and ad ress
of the actual manufacturer has been previous1 identified to the Director of
the Center for Devices and Radiolo ical Healt (CDRH). (This alternative is
necessary so that CDRH can identi y manufacturers of particular models of
devices in those instances where the listed distributor uses different
manufacturers for each model.)

d'

B

-

K

Abbreviations such as Co., Inc., or their foreign equivalents, and the initials
of the first and middle names of individuals may be used.

o The place and month and year of manufacture.
-

The place of manufacture may be expressed in a code if the code has been
previously supplied to the Director of CDRH.

-

The month and year of manufacture cannot be coded or abbreviated. The month and
a four di it number for the year must appear as follows:
"MAN FACTURED: (Insert Month and Year of Manufacture)"

8

In a case where it is not feasible to affix identification labeling in accordance with
the above, the Director of CDRH may approve an application for an alternate means of
identification.
The manufacturer must furnish the Director of CDRH with a complete listing of all
brand names and the names and addresses of the individuals or companies for which
electronic products are manufactured under a standard.
Electronic products intended for United States Government use may be exempted from the
above upon application to the Director of CDRH by the manufacturer, assembler, or a U.S.
department or agency.
All products intended solely for export shall be labeled or tagged to show that they
are intended for export.
The manufacturer of any electronic product covered by an exemption from performance
standards (i.e., standards, other than labeling, which are not covered in this chapter)
must permanently attach a tag or label stating:

"This electronic product has been exempted from the Food and Drug Administration
radiation safety performance standards prescribed in the Code of Federal Regulations,

LIGHT-EMITTING PRODUCTS
Lasers ( 1040.1 0)
Lasers are devices capable of producing intense radiation at a specific wavelength
both for medical and industrial purposes. In addition to the general labeling requirements
for firm name, street address, state, and zip code, lasers require labeling specific to
their type, class, wavelength, and power output. Due to the numerous combinations of

labeling types dictated by class, wavelen th, and power output, it would not be practical
to cover each in specific detail in this %ooklet. Instead. use the following sample label
types in conjunction with the following- reprints of CFR sections to demonstrate specific
labeling requirements.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACT DEVICE LABELING REQUIREMENTS
INTRODUCTION
Agencies of the U.S. Government such as the Department of Defense and the Veterans
Administration are major purchasers, users, and warehousers of medical equipment. Lar e
stockpiles of medical equipment are maintained in warehouses located throughout t e
country. In addition to working stock drawn by the military services, reserves are needed
to maintain a state of war preparedness. Their varied needs and the logistics of
distribution necessitate extraordinary packaging and labeling requirements. For example,
supplies of hemostatic forceps must be readily available for immediate shipment, or use
after prolonged storage, anywhere in the world, which includes d desert. humid jungle
environments, or sub-zero Arctic conditions. In addition, the met od of transport could
include droppirig from an airplane, or floating the supplies to shore. FDA requirements for
labeling, size, and placement are not enough; labelin must be appropriately saltwater
proof and fade resistant. and may even include camou age markings. In order to assure
conformity with their needs, the U.S. Government has established military standards, or
s ecifications, for about every imaginable piece of equipment including hardware.
e ectronics, and medical equipment.

LABELING SPECIFICATIONS MIL-STD-l29H
MIL-STD- 129H is the most commonly used labeling standard for U.S. Government medical
equipment purchases. This document IS generally not a stand alone specification. but
rather is used in conjunction with the device specification. For example, the military
specification for a radiographic grid (known as #GG-G-00650a, Grid, Radio raphic,
Strai ht, Wafer Ty e) contains a heading entitled "Labeling Specifications." The abeling
speci cations liste call for Fed Std No. 123 (essentially a commercial package) for
c~vilianagencies such as the General Services Administration, and requires MI L-STD- 129H
for the military services. When filling a Government contract these specifications take
precedence over FDA requirements.

The number, size, placement, and color of the labeling would be specified in the the
product specification by referring to the appropriate section of MIL-STD-129H.
The interior or unit label and exterior or shelf package label requirements contained
in MIL-STD- 129H are as follows:
NSNINATO stock number (National Serial Number)--a unique number assigned to a
specific product type, regardless of manufacturer;
Manufacturer's part number (when specifically required by the contract);
Item description (as specified in the contract);
Quantity and unit of issue;
Contract, purchase, or delivery order number; and
Level of protection and date preservation was applied.
The outer packaging requirements are:
NSNINATO stock number;
Manufacturer's part number;
Item description (as specified in the contract);
Gross weight and volume in cubic feet;
Level of protection and date preservation was applied;
Proper shipping names (for hazardous items only);
Contract, purchase order, or delivery order number; and

LOGMARS*

* On 7/1/82 the Department of Defense had amended MIL-STD-129H to include a
requirement for LOGMARS (Lo istics A plication of Automated Markin and Reading
Symbolog ) on device labels. lghis labe ing is the same form as the U C (Universal
Product ode) or bar code which has become an integral part of consumer items.
LOGMAR labeling includes a series of digitally encoded lines containing the NSN and

DEVELOPMENT OF DEVICE LABELING
INTRODUCTION
Labeling is very important to medical device firms because there is often a direct
relationship between dev~cemisuse and the labeling, especially in the directions for use.
In many cases the labeling may meet the requirements of the regulations; but it may fail
to fully take into consideration the user needs, possible uses other than that indicated,
or other factors that may contribute to misuse of the device.
It is significant that a proximately 40% of Mandatory Device Reporting (MDR) filings
involve user error. FDA, t e medical device industry, and the users must become more aware
of this situation and work together to resolve it. One of the problem areas is labeling.
In addition to the cases where there is a primary association between labelin and MDR
reports, labeling can also be an "underlying" or secondary cause of misuse t at leads to
MDR reports.

R

g,

There are three general problem areas with labeling that FDA has encountered:

Misbranding - The failure of the labeling to meet the re uirements of the labeling
regulations. This includes misleading statements, inadequate irections for use, or the
exclusion of warning statements or contraindications;

i!

Poor Labeling Control - This situation occurs during the manufacturing process due to
a failure in the quality assurance or GMP program. Poor labeling controls result in
incorrect activities such as a "mixup" in the labeling for different devices, the use of
outdated labeling, or the improper application of the labeling to the device; and
Inadequate Labeling - Labeling that does not constitute misbranding but could be
improved to prevent misuse or mishandling of the device.
The first two points, misbranding, and poor label control violate the letter of the
law. The last, inadequate labeling, or labeling that is less than it can or should be, may
not always violate the law, but can result in problems which the law was desi ned to
prevent. Previous sections in this chapter have addressed two aspects of device fabeling
necessary to comply with the law. The first section in this chapter discusses the
definition and causes of misbranding; the second section (Section 5) discusses areas of
poor label control as addressed in the medical device GMP's. This section will address
madequate labeling and concentrate on techniques for generating and presenting text that
is easy to read. It will also cover how to correlate text with figures, and how to
correlate text with the device.

LABELING PROBLEMS
Two of the most important aspects to consider in labeling devices is to he cognizant
of WHO will be using the device and HOW it is to be used. Once this is realized, suitable
labeling can be drafted.
Often we have heard stories of parents unable to assemble "easy-to-assemble" toys on
Christmas eve. Identical products with identical labeling (the instructions) may have
other than the same results after assembly. Why? Because the manufacturer had failed to
consider WHO. The instructions had been written at the level of someone moderately skilled
in mechanics, whereas some assemblers might be confused by the operation of an electric
drill. How could the problem be corrected? By the use of labeling! A simple way would be

to change the labeling to read "difficult-to-assemble;" however, this mi ht well have a
negative impact on sales. The proper way, as we'll cover later, woul he to draft a
detailed set of instructions, using pictorials where necessary, directed at the expected
experience level of the purchaser.

f

A manufacturer of aluminum porch awnin s in Florida had been successfully marketing
his product locally for over 20 years. He o tained capital and expanded his
along the Eastern Seaboard. Soon he began to receive numerous complaints
colla se from the Northeast. Why? Because he failed to consider HOW. The
attac ment recommended in the instructions was insufficient to hold the added weight of
predictable northeastern snowfall. In a manner similar to the above problem, the solution
could be to either restrict sales to states below in the Sunbelt, or to provide an
explanation and a ictorial that detailed a method of securing the awning properly to
support the expectec f additional weight.

f

R

The same arguments hold true for medical devices whether they be catheters, heart
valves, or in vitro diagnostic products. Labeling not only can be used to assure proper
use of the device, but can be used to compensate for design deficiencies or alert the user
to abnormal conditions.
A firm who marketed an external ri id splint began to receive reports from hospitals
that patients had suffered bums and Elislering on limbs where the splint had been
applied. The splint consists of a coated fabric sandwiched between polymeric film and
foam. In use, the foam side is placed against the limb. Water is then applied to initiate
a chemical polymerization which releases heat and causes the splint to become rigid.

The label on the s lint read: "Place Opposite Side on Limb." In one hospital personnel
stated that the label ad been improperly placed on the limb side of the splint. As a
result, the patients limbs were burned during the polymerization reaction. It was then
discovered by the firm that some lots had the label on the wrong side of the splint, and
these lots were associated with the hospitals' complaints.

\

In fact, this entire sequence of events probably could have been avoided by proper
label content. The phrase "Place Opposite Side on Limb" is an ambiguous statement and does
not identify any component of the splint. A more helpful descriptive statement would
state:
"Place the (insert color, texture, etc.) Film on Outside, Away from Limb. Caution:
Film Gets Hot!'
A positive statement with the film identified by color or texture would tend to
reinforce the instructions for proper placement of the label during manufacture, and
placement of the splint during use on the limb.

Let's take another look at the original labeling on the splint: "Place Opposite Side
on Limb." Note the geometric term, "side." In general, be very careful when using top,
side, end, bottom, edge, and other geometric terms in labeling as these are often
ambiguous. Always make sure the intent is obvious when the user is looking at the device.

REDUCING LABELING PROBLEMS
Adequate labeling for a medical device requires proper design of labelin$, controlled
procurement of the labels and labeling, and proper application of labeling.
includes labeling content that meets the requirement of the GMP regulation as well as t e
needs of the user. One should emphasize the second point: needs of the user. To help meet
the needs of the user, there are some basic uidelines, rules. and practices that can be
used to immediately improve the writing of labe s and instructions.

Desil"

f

Writers are encouraged to obtain a copy of 40,000 Words or a similarly titled book by
any of the reference-book publishing companies. Most of these reference books have about
four pages of punctuation rules. Using the four small pages of rules can immediately
improve your writing. For example, you can avoid the common unctuation error of not using
semi-colons to replace commas when needed. Also, one shou d obtain and use a standard
college-level text on technical writing.

I'

Further, to achieve our goals a number of concepts must be kept in mind such as:
writing to the reader, referring to the actual device in labeling, obvious identification
of the controls used, etc. Following is a review of these points with emphasis on how they
can be used to make labeling clear and comprehensible.
Write to Reader
The most serious problem is that writers tend to write to themselves. Their material
is clear to them--and they mistakenly think it is as clear to others. For example, the
sensitivity control on an instrument is called: "gain" control on page one of the
instruction manual, "amplitude" control on page two, and "level" control in the next
section. Further, the photograph in the Introduction shows the same control with a
call-out labeled "Signal Adjust". No wonder readers are confused! Yet the author of the
example knew what he was trying to write about and, most certainly, he was writing to
himself.
For some devices such as home-use devices, it may be necessary to determine the
reading level of the intended users.
Refer to Actual Device
One simple way to reduce control identity confusion as described above, reduce other
types of labeling errors, and increase clarity is for authors to keep a labeled
instrument, kit, or photograph(s) nearby and refer to it as they write. It is easier to
write the truth when you know the truth. Make sure the terminology and descriptions in the
labeling matches that on the device. Always use the same title for each given item or
control throughout the manual, insert, label, or advertisement. Likewise, the same title
should be used in charts, figures, or screen displays such as cathode-ray tubes, etc.
Remember to:
o write to your intended readers;
o write with a labeled device or photographs in sight; and
o use consistent titles.

Obvious Identification of Controls
Because the title of controls or other items on labels and screen displays should be
exactly the same as in the labels on equipment, reagents, accessories, etc., authors may
need to develop and use an appropriate correlation technique for corresponding titles in
instruction manuals, packa e inserts, etc. One common technique is to use all capitals for
the titles of controls in labe ing. For example:

f

Flip the POWER switch to ON.
Press the HEAT button to switch the heater on.
In about three seconds, the READY lamp will illuminate.
With this correlation technique, the words "on" and "off" are capitalized in the
labeling only when they actually appear on the instrument control panel. Note that "ON" is
capitalized in "POWER switch to ON" as the actual switch has "POWER", "ON", and "OFF"
printed by it. In contrast, note that "on" would not be capitalized in the example "to
switch the heater on" as it is not a label of a control on the device. Also, be careful to
use a simple correlation system for names of controls that is readily apparent to the
intended reader.
4

Don't Distract Reader

a:

Readers are very busy t ing to learn how to use a new device. They should not be
annoyed by any unnecessary ~stractionssuch as:
o
o
o
o

changes in format;
unusual typeface;
incorrect age numbers, and
incorrect igure numbers.

F

For a person trying to read in a hurry, a font or typestyle that the author may
consider to be routine, such as script, can be a major distract~on;therefore, don't use
script, italics, or any other unusual or hard-to-read typefaces. Remember. you have
dec~ded to write for the benefit of the intended user. Forget about your personal
preferences and use only the most common print fonts. Also, select a type size that is
readable at the intended distance. For exam le, labeling displayed on the screen of a
wall-mounted heart monitor must be readable rom several feet away. Also, use a consistent
format throughout the document. Also, check the format and section titles against
information on the contents page. In some cases, such as for in vitro diagnostic products,
the arrangement of information in the labeling may be dictated by regulation.

f

Page numbers should not be referenced in instruction or service manuals. It is very
easy for the actual page numbers to be changed during the original writing or when the
manual is updated. It is much better to refer to paragraph titles or para raph numbers as
they are less likely to change; and. if changed, titles are more noticeab e by writers and
typ~ststhan are page numbers. The use of correct figure numbers is easy--just check them.

f

Short and to the Point
It is im ortant to use sentence structure that will convey the intended message with a
minimum o misinterpretation or need to reread. Tests have been conducted to determine the
ability of readers to follow instructions in a sentence based on the number of activities
to be performed. The average person's ability to follow instructions decreases rapidly
when a sentence contains more than two facts. (Keep in mind your own experiences in

P

reading instructions.) Therefore, sentences in labeling need to be short and to the point.
Avoid long strin s of adjectives and be specific. In many cases, a list of activitres to
be performed is etter than buryin the facts in long sentences. If it takes lots of words
to get to the point, the reader wil probably miss the point! Short, choppy sentences or
lists are acceptable in instruction manuals and other labeling. You are not trying to
entertain readers with beautiful, flowing prose--rather, you want to "shock" them into
remembering key facts until they correctly perform the specified instructions. Thus:

%

f

o use short sentences;
et to the point; and
o e specific.

i

Try to be as specific as possible with your instructions. For example, "ambient" or
"room temperature" generally should not be used. Instead specify the desired or necessary
range of operating conditions.
Gobbledygook
Another way to be more specific and shorten sentences is to avoid "gobbledygook." The
following terms were collected from actual instruction manuals:
ORIGINAL
Makes provisions for
Serves to

In conjunction with

*

In most cases, the equivalent term in the list can replace the original term. For the
asterisked items, the equivalent is simply a direct statement of what IS intended. Of the
terms listed, the combination most often used is "makes provision for." Simply eliminating
"makes provision for" and "be provided for" from labeling will result in an immediate
improvement for readers.
Introduce Each Item
Always introduce each control, indicator, device, or subject before they are discussed
in the text. The introductions should be brief and may be very brief. Keep in mind the
items will be described in more detail later. Abbreviations and new or uncommon terms must
be defined. The introductions and definitions prevent the reader from goin into mental
shock, breaking their train of thought, and asking: What is this? By then t e reader has
probably forgotten the last two or three facts read. Also, the reader may wonder about any
"cliff-hanging" item when they resume reading. This disturbance may detract the person
from fully assimilating the next instructions being read. To avoid distractions and
confusion, a writer of labeling should always:

1

o introduce each item; and
o define new or uncommon terms.
With respect to definitions, a writer should never give a new meaning to an existing
term. For example, quality assurance personnel of medical device firms can no longer use
the word "critical" in their routine technical conversations because "critical" was given
a specialized definition in the GMP regulation. To avoid this disservice, coin a special
term or code number such as Class C, Code 1, or Level 2.
Accentuate Key Terms
Whenever it is stated in instructions that something must be done, then "must" should
be underlined, set in bold type, or otherwise delineated. Likewise, caution and warning
statements should be delineated by underlining, boxing, bold type, etc. Refer to any
regulations or standards for a specific product and use the recommended or required
caution statements. When standard terminology exists, creating new caution statements is
not the best way for a writer to be creative.
Select Words Wisely
When large print is needed for reading at a distance or to attract attention, signs,
caution labels, screen prompts, and control labels generally must be short in order to fit
the available space. This situation places a burden on the writer to select terms that
convey the desired message. Consider the following wording from two actual highway signs:
PLANT TRAFFIC
ENTERING HIGHWAY
Have you ever been run over by a
that mean you are allowed to fish on
intended messages are: "Traffic entering

NO FISHING
OFF BRIDGE
can't fish off the bridge, does
bridge? Better choices for the
fishing from bridge. "

Try Labeling
Finally, always have someone not familiar with the product operate it exactly
according to the draft instructions and screen displays, if an . No coaching--this is the
"acid" test--good luck! During the trials, note any signi lcant problems and make
appropriate corrections to the instructions, prompts, or other labeling. You may also wish
to solicit in ut from actual users of the product with respect to clarity, reading level,
etc. The in ormation received will reflect the problems encountered by persons tryin
follow the instructions without any preconceived knowledge of the actual operation o the
product.

r

?

B

Approval Policy and Procedure
Before release for use, labeling should be reviewed and approved by product
develo ment, service, marketing, quality assurance, and other appropriate managers.
Manu acturers need to have a policy/procedure which covers the draftmg, review, and
approval of labeling. This procedure is usually used with an approval form such as the
sample that follows. This form is intended for use by a medium-to-large firm; however, the
checklist style can be adapted to a small firm. In the form, the areas of concern are
listed under the group that is responsible for that concern. Thus, every department in the
firm has input into the acceptability of the labeling.
