Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for
Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical
Studies, Including Certain First in Human
(FIH) Studies
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

1. Introduction
This document is intended to provide guidance to FDA staff, clinicians, medical device
innovators, and industry on the development and review of Investigational Device Exemption
(IDE) applications for early feasibility studies of significant risk devices.1 Early feasibility
studies allow for early clinical evaluation of devices to provide proof of principle and initial
clinical safety data. These studies may be appropriate early in device development when clinical
experience is necessary because nonclinical testing methods are not available or adequate to
provide the information needed to advance the developmental process. As with all clinical
studies, initiation of an early feasibility study must be justified by an appropriate benefit-risk
analysis and adequate human subject protection measures.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should

Significant risk device is defined at 21 CFR 812.3(m) as an investigational device that:
(1) Is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;
(2) Is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;
(3) Is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise
preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a
subject; or
(4) Otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.

be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2. Regulatory Background
Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 360j(g)]
establishes a framework for FDA to grant devices for investigational use an exemption from
certain requirements so that experts qualified by scientific training and experience can
investigate their safety and effectiveness. This exemption is known as an Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE). For significant risk devices, the sponsor must first submit an IDE application
and obtain FDA approval.2
The FD&C Act expressly recognizes that information to be included in an IDE application may
vary depending on the investigation. Section 520(g)(2)(C) states:
Procedures and conditions prescribed [for granting investigational device exemptions] may
appropriately vary depending on:
· the scope and duration of clinical testing to be conducted under such exemption,
· the number of human subjects that are to be involved in such testing,
· the need to permit changes to be made in the device subject to the exemption during
testing conducted in accordance with a clinical testing plan required under paragraph
(3)(A) [in section 520(g) of the FD&C Act], and
· whether the clinical testing of such device is for the purpose of developing data to obtain
approval for the commercial distribution of the device.
As with all clinical studies of investigational devices, an early feasibility study must comply with
21 CFR part 812, including the requirements outlined below:
· Application (21 CFR 812.20): explains when a sponsor must submit an IDE application
and the information that the IDE application must contain, including the investigational
plan and report of prior investigations.
· Investigational Plan (21 CFR 812.25): explains what information the Investigational Plan
must contain, including the purpose of the investigation, the protocol, risk analysis,
description of the device, monitoring procedures, labeling, consent materials, and
information about the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) reviewing the investigation.
· Report of Prior Investigations (21 CFR 812.27): explains what information the Report of
Prior Investigations must contain, including reports of all prior clinical, animal, and
laboratory testing of the device.
· Supplemental applications (21 CFR 812.35): explains when changes to the device and
Investigational Plan must have prior FDA approval and the appropriate manner to notify
FDA of changes that do not require prior approval.

Adopting the principles set forth in section 520(g)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act, Sections 5-8 of this
guidance clarify how some of these requirements should be applied to early feasibility study
IDEs.

3. Definitions and Scope
For the purposes of this guidance, clinical study types are defined as follows:3
 An early feasibility study is a limited clinical investigation of a device early in
development, typically before the device design has been finalized, for a specific
indication (e.g., innovative device for a new or established intended use, marketed device
for a novel clinical application). It may be used to evaluate the device design concept
with respect to initial clinical safety and device functionality in a small number of
subjects (generally fewer than 10 initial subjects) when this information cannot
practically be provided through additional nonclinical assessments or appropriate
nonclinical tests are unavailable. Information obtained from an early feasibility study
may guide device modifications. An early feasibility study does not necessarily involve
the first clinical use of a device.
 A first in human (FIH) study is a type of study in which a device for a specific
indication is evaluated for the first time in human subjects. This document only discusses
FIH studies that meet the definition of an early feasibility study.
 A traditional feasibility study is a clinical investigation that is commonly used to
capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information on a near-final or final device
design to adequately plan an appropriate pivotal study. Because the study of a near-final
or final device design takes place later in development than an early feasibility study,
FDA would expect to see more nonclinical (or prior clinical) data in a traditional
feasibility study IDE application.4 A traditional feasibility study does not necessarily
need to be preceded by an early feasibility study.
 A pivotal study is a clinical investigation designed to collect definitive evidence of the
safety and effectiveness of a device for a specified intended use, typically in a statistically
justified number of subjects. It may or may not be preceded by an early and/or a
traditional feasibility study.
Early feasibility studies may be conducted for multiple reasons, such as obtaining initial insights
into:
 the clinical safety of the device-specific aspects of the procedure;
 whether the device can be successfully delivered, implanted or used;
 operator technique challenges with device use;
 human factors (e.g., difficulties in comprehending procedural steps);
 the clinical safety of the device (e.g., evaluation of device-related serious adverse events);
 whether the device performs its intended purpose (e.g., mechanical function, making
intended measurements);
3

In this guidance, the term ‘feasibility’ is considered synonymous with ‘pilot.’ For consistency purposes,
‘feasibility’ is the term that should be used in reference to the types of clinical studies that precede the pivotal study
phase.
4
Additional nonclinical testing could be completed concurrent with conducting the early feasibility study if needed
to support the conduct of a traditional feasibility or pivotal study.



device failures;
patient characteristics that may impact device performance (e.g., anatomical limitations);
and
therapeutic parameters (e.g., energy applied, sizing, dose released) associated with device
use.

Unlike traditional feasibility studies, which are focused on providing initial clinical safety and
effectiveness information for a near final or final device design or capturing data to guide the
development of a pivotal study, early feasibility studies have a broader purpose. Early clinical
experience obtained from an early feasibility study increases the efficiency of the device
development process, as it may be used to:
 identify appropriate modifications to the procedure or device;
 optimize operator technique;
 refine the intended use population;
 refine nonclinical test plans or methodologies; and
 develop subsequent clinical study protocols.
To determine which type of clinical study (early feasibility, traditional feasibility, or pivotal) is
appropriate to pursue, certain factors, such as the novelty of the device, its intended clinical use,
the stability of the device design, and the amount of test data available to support the IDE
application should be considered. An early feasibility study is appropriate when device changes
are expected and when, due to the novelty of the device or its intended use, a clinical study is
expected to provide information that cannot be practically obtained through additional
nonclinical assessments. An early feasibility study may be appropriate even if a device or a
prototype of the device has previously been used clinically for the intended clinical use. Note
that not all novel devices or uses warrant an early feasibility study, nor would FDA mandate that
an early feasibility study be conducted. A traditional feasibility study or a pivotal study may be
more appropriate if the device design is near-final or final, respectively, depending on the
amount of data available to justify the study. Prior to IDE submission and to avoid preventable
delays, it is advisable to contact FDA to determine whether the proposed investigation can be
classified as an early feasibility study.
The guidance provided herein is specific to early feasibility study IDEs only and is not
applicable to other types of clinical studies. As discussed above, excluded from the scope of this
document are studies involving the first human use of a device that do not otherwise meet the
definition of an early feasibility study. For example, the first human use of a non-innovative
device for a well-understood clinical use could appropriately be evaluated under a traditional
feasibility or a pivotal study rather than an early feasibility study.

4. Overview
FDA recognizes the value of encouraging medical device innovation to address clinical needs
and improve patient care, particularly when alternative treatments or assessments are
unavailable, ineffective, or associated with substantial risks to patient safety. This guidance has
been developed to facilitate the early clinical evaluation of medical devices in the United States
under the IDE regulations, using risk mitigation strategies that appropriately protect human
subjects in early feasibility studies.
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

An early feasibility study IDE application must comply with section 520(g) of the FD&C Act
[21 U.S.C. § 360j(g)] and 21 CFR part 812; however, the procedures and conditions prescribed
for IDEs may vary depending on the type of clinical study (see Section 2).
This guidance outlines new policy regarding the application for and approval of early feasibility
study IDEs. The essential elements of this policy are as follows:
1.

FDA approval of an IDE application for an early feasibility study, including certain first in
human studies, may be based on less nonclinical data than would be expected for a traditional
feasibility or a pivotal study (see Section 5). This is because early feasibility studies are only
appropriate when additional nonclinical testing would not provide the information needed to
advance the developmental process. Identification of the data necessary to support an early
feasibility study should be based on a thorough device evaluation strategy that describes the
device procedure, performance, and basic safety-related attributes and addresses the potential
failure modes (see Section 6.3). This policy is intended to facilitate initiation of clinical
studies in the United States earlier in the device development process than has historically
occurred.5

2. This guidance introduces new approaches to facilitate timely device and clinical protocol
modifications during an early feasibility study (see Section 8), while still requiring
compliance with the IDE regulations in 21 CFR part 812, as follows:
· more types of modifications that can be made under a 5-day notification without prior
FDA approval, as compared with other types of studies;
· a contingent approval process that permits changes contingent upon acceptable
nonclinical test results without requiring additional FDA action; and
· interactive review of IDE supplements and amendments.
This guidance document highlights and reviews key principles unique to an early feasibility
study IDE with respect to the Report of Prior Investigations, the clinical protocol, risk mitigation
strategies, and subject protection measures (see Sections 6 and 7).
Throughout this early feasibility study guidance, there are recommendations for sponsors to
interact with FDA, utilizing the Pre-Submission (Pre-Sub) process to optimize the preparation
and quality of early feasibility study IDE applications.6 Appendix 1 summarizes the key
elements for an early feasibility study Pre-Sub.7

5

Note that this guidance does not recommend that sponsors prematurely initiate clinical testing when further useful
and appropriate nonclinical testing can be performed for the particular device the sponsor is developing.
6
For more information on the Pre-Submission process, see FDA’s draft guidance “Medical Devices: The PreSubmission Program and Meetings with FDA Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm310375.htm).
FDA’s draft guidance represents FDA’s proposed approach on this topic.
7
In the context of this guidance, the term “Pre-Sub” means a request for informal FDA feedback on information,
such as a proposed non-clinical testing plan or a draft clinical study protocol, submitted prior to the formal
submission of an original IDE (to initiate an early feasibility study) or IDE supplement (to request changes to the
device or study protocol).

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
This guidance is not intended to address all required elements of IDE applications or to provide a
comprehensive tutorial on best clinical practices for investigational medical device studies.
Furthermore, while this document outlines the general principles for preparing and reviewing
early feasibility study IDE applications, it is not intended to provide guidance on the devicespecific nonclinical information needed to justify initiation of an early feasibility study, or the
specific data required to progress to other phases of clinical study for a particular device type or
clinical indication. It is recommended that discussions regarding justification for study initiation
take place during the Pre-Sub process.

5. Targeting approval for an Early Feasibility Study IDE
Application
Because there are differences in the amount and type of information that is needed for an early
feasibility study as compared to a traditional feasibility or pivotal study, the IDE application
should clearly state that the proposed study is an early feasibility study and provide justification
for conducting this type of study. To improve the likelihood of IDE approval, the following
questions should be addressed with supporting information in the original early feasibility study
IDE application:
1. What is the clinical condition to be treated or assessed by the device?
2. What is the standard of care for the clinical condition and expected clinical outcomes
associated with the standard of care?
3. What are the anticipated benefits associated with use of the study device?
4. Is the information included in the Report of Prior Investigations (Section 6) adequate to
support initiation of the study?
5. Does the Investigational Plan include a thorough risk analysis, sufficient risk mitigation
strategies, adequate human subject protection measures, and an appropriate clinical study
protocol (see Section 7)?
6. Are the potential risks associated with the device use likely to be outweighed by the
anticipated benefits of the early feasibility study, that is, is initiation of the clinical study
justified based on the clinical need for the device, Report of Prior Investigations and
Investigational Plan?
FDA may approve an investigation as proposed, approve it with conditions, or disapprove it.8
FDA will generally disapprove an IDE if there is reason to believe that the foreseeable risks to
the study subjects are not outweighed by the anticipated benefits to the subjects and the
importance of the knowledge to be gained.9 When addressing benefit/risk for an early feasibility
study, the concepts discussed in the FDA guidance, “Factors to Consider When Making BenefitRisk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm2
67829.htm) should be considered. For early feasibility studies, in addition to the potential risks
and anticipated benefits to the study subjects and the knowledge to be gained, relevant
benefit/risk considerations may include the availability of safe and effective alternative therapies;
8
9

See 21 CFR 812.30(a).
See 21 CFR 812.30(b)(4).

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
prospective study subjects’ tolerance for risk; risk mitigation strategies included in the clinical
protocol; and information indicating that the device should perform as intended and catastrophic
failure will not likely occur.
Early feasibility studies are designed to gain initial clinical insights when additional nonclinical
testing methods are not available or adequate to provide the information needed to advance
device development. These studies may be initiated before the design of the device is finalized
and, in light of the early stage of device development and the small number of subjects, may be
justified based on less evidence than for other types of clinical studies. As a result, they may
carry greater unknown risk than traditional feasibility and pivotal studies. This makes human
subject protection measures, such as adequate informed consent and IRB review, all the more
important in an early feasibility study (see Section 7).10 At the same time, benefits deriving from
the knowledge to be gained may be substantial during the early phase of device development,
particularly for innovative devices or intended uses. Even though early feasibility studies are not
designed or intended to generate statistically valid results, they should be conducted for specified
purpose(s), enroll the appropriate subjects, utilize meaningful endpoints, and capture relevant
information so that the results can be used to further device development. Importantly, although
early feasibility studies can begin before the design of the device is finalized, there still should be
reason to believe that the device will function as intended.
Compared to a traditional feasibility or pivotal study, less nonclinical data would generally need
to be included in the Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study IDE application.
For example, nonclinical testing using small sample sizes or short implant durations for in vivo
animal studies may be sufficient to justify initiation of an early feasibility study. Under this
approach, if additional and longer-term bench and animal testing are needed to support a larger
clinical study of a near-final or final device design, these tests could be completed concurrently
with the early feasibility study.
Some essential elements of a pivotal study, such as a prospective definition of study success and
a prespecified data analysis plan, are not necessary for early feasibility study IDE applications.
In addition, an early feasibility study protocol may be subject to fewer constraints as compared to
a pivotal study protocol. For example, for early feasibility studies, sequential enrollment
typically would not be necessary.

6. Report of Prior Investigations
The requirements in 21 CFR 812.27 apply to the Report of Prior Investigations for early
feasibility study IDE applications. The information in this section is intended to clarify how
certain of these requirements apply to early feasibility studies and to provide guidance on the
content of the Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study IDE.
The Report of Prior Investigations must include the information needed to justify a clinical
investigation of a device.11 For early feasibility studies, this information should:

·

·

support an expectation of acceptable clinical use (e.g., successful device placement using
a benchtop model that simulates clinical conditions and/or a suitable animal model) and
that the device will function as intended;
address basic device safety, including, but not limited to, sterility, biocompatibility,
software verification and validation, electromagnetic compatibility, chemical
compatibility (e.g., with concomitant drugs); and
characterize catastrophic failure modes and identify risk mitigation approaches.

When adequately justified, the information may be generated from tests utilizing nonstandardized methodologies (e.g., using loading conditions that are not specified in a guidance
document or voluntary standard to evaluate fatigue properties of a device for a new intended use,
or using less sensitive testing equipment than specified in a standard). In determining the testing
needed, the sponsor should consider the clinical significance of potential failures and the ability
to predict clinical performance based on nonclinical testing. A sponsor may be able to justify
deferral of certain testing until later stages of device development.

6.1 Content of the Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study
IDE
The information to be provided in the Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study
IDE application should be presented in three main sections: (1) Background, (2) Executive
Summary, and (3) Detailed Reports:12
(1) The Background section should emphasize the unique aspects of the device design and
intended patient population that will be considered when FDA evaluates whether the
information provided justifies the initiation of an early feasibility study. This section should
describe:
 the clinical context for the early feasibility study:
- the clinical condition the device is intended to treat or assess;
- the standard of care, including the types and severity of risks and the benefits
associated with current treatment options;
- the types and severity of potential risks and the anticipated benefits that may be
associated with the study device; and
- the rationale for exposing the target population to the potential risks (i.e., whether the
anticipated benefits that may be associated with the use of the study device justify the
potential risks, recognizing the benefits and risks posed by current treatment or
assessment options);
 the design concept; and
 a summary justification regarding the amount and type of information/data needed to
support initiation of the early feasibility study in the specified patient population, with
comment on, or comparison to, what may be expected to support the initiation of a larger
clinical study.

12

Please consult 21 CFR 812.27 for the elements that must be included in a Report of Prior Investigations.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(2) The Executive Summary section should provide a summary of the information provided and
an explanation as to why this information is adequate to support study initiation. This section
should include:
· a summary description of the nonclinical testing that has been performed and relevant
clinical information;
· a device evaluation strategy table, as described below, that references the relevant
individual test reports for the data and/or information collected to address each device or
procedure-related attribute; and
· a table describing the purpose of each test or analysis, test sample description, sample
size, acceptance criteria (if available), test results, any potential clinical significance of
the results, and cross reference to the test reports.
(3) The Detailed Reports section should include the reports for tests conducted and additional
information available to support the initiation of the early feasibility study. This section
should include:
· individual reports for each bench and laboratory test, computational modeling analysis
(e.g., finite element analysis), and in vivo animal study:
o each test report should include the purpose, test method, sample selection, results,
discussion of the acceptability of the results, and when appropriate, justification
and clinical applicability of the acceptance criteria;13
· a summary of leveraged nonclinical information in appropriate detail, depending on the
source of the information, such as:
o individual test reports not previously submitted to FDA;
o references to previously reviewed regulatory submissions;
o reports in the published literature
· a summary of any relevant clinical information, with references, if available.
The following sections provide further guidance on the purpose and preparation of the key
elements of a Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study IDE.

6.2 Design concept
The Background section of a Report of Prior Investigations for an early feasibility study IDE
should include information to clearly describe the design concept, such as the:
· device description (e.g., physical description, figures, materials of construction, software
documentation), principles of operation, what the device key design features are intended
to do, and how the key design features accomplish the intended objective;
· intended clinical use, designated by the medical condition or lesion type to be treated or
assessed, and any associated anatomical locations and limitations;
· conditions of use/intended in vivo environment; and
· minimum design-life of the device (i.e., the minimum duration for which a device has
been designed to function as intended).

13

Characterization tests (i.e., testing conducted to describe the device) may not have specified acceptance criteria
and it may not be possible to establish acceptance criteria until clinical data are obtained.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The device design concept provides the basis for identifying the appropriate testing and test
methodologies and guides the device evaluation strategy.

6.3 Device evaluation strategy
The device evaluation strategy in the Executive Summary section of a Report of Prior
Investigations should describe and justify the leveraged information and testing conducted to
support initiation of an early feasibility study, with cross-references to the Detailed Reports
section of a Report of Prior Investigations. The purpose of the device evaluation strategy is to
facilitate FDA's understanding of the value of the leveraged information and why the information
included in the Report of Prior Investigations is adequate to support IDE approval. To maximize
the efficient use of sponsor and FDA resources, it is desirable for the sponsor to consult with
FDA and for both parties to reach agreement on the strategy before the sponsor conducts the
proposed testing. Therefore the device evaluation strategy would optimally be discussed during
Pre-Sub interactions. This is particularly important when:
· the sponsor is providing less nonclinical data as compared to what would be expected for
a traditional feasibility or pivotal study;
· there is no FDA guidance or voluntary standard specific to the device and intended use
proposed to be studied; and/or
· certain nonclinical tests are more relevant than others in addressing basic safety and
potential catastrophic failures, or to support basic device functionality.
Section 6.3.1 describes a systematic method for presenting the device evaluation strategy for an
early feasibility study. This method involves identifying the key information necessary to justify
initiation of the study based on a risk assessment, taking into consideration the anticipated
benefits that may be associated with the device.
Even if testing has been done in accordance with a guidance document or voluntary standard, a
justification should be provided to explain why the testing specified in the guidance or standard
applies to the device and its intended use. This may involve a modification of the device
evaluation strategy process described in Section 6.3.1, focusing on the unique aspects of the
device or intended use as compared to those specifically addressed by the guidance or standard.
Section 6.3.2 presents an option for obtaining early FDA feedback on a comprehensive device
evaluation strategy that extends beyond the early feasibility phase.
6.3.1 Device evaluation strategy for an early feasibility study
The device evaluation strategy for an early feasibility study should be based on a risk/benefit
assessment.14 In general, for an early feasibility study, the evaluation strategy should be focused
on identifying the information needed to address significant safety concerns and support basic
device functionality.
The device evaluation strategy is best outlined in a table, with the following column headings:

14

At the early feasibility stage, a descriptive assessment may be more informative than a formal failure modes and
effect analysis (FMEA), which provides a quantitative ranking of risks.

Column 1, Device Attribute: Each procedure-related function, performance-related
function, and basic safety-related feature required for the device to achieve the desired
performance (i.e., benefit).
Note: For the purpose of the device evaluation strategy, a function is defined as the
ability of the device to accomplish a goal and a feature is defined as an essential property
of the device.
Column 2, Potential Failure Modes: For each Device Attribute, the types of problems or
failures that might occur and could result in consequences to the device or study subject
if the function or feature is not attained.
Columns 3 and 4, Potential Device and Clinical Effects of Failure: For each Potential
Failure Mode, the potential effects of the failure mode on the device and/or study subject
(i.e., risks).
Column 5, Device Design Information: For each Potential Failure Mode, the design
characteristics intended to provide the function or feature or to address or mitigate the
potential failure mode. Relevant anticipated benefits associated with the design
characteristics may be highlighted in this column.
Columns 6 and 7, Leveraged Nonclinical Information and Supportive Clinical
Information: For each Attribute and/or Potential Failure Mode, the information from
internal or external sources to supplement the assertions that:
a) the function or feature will be attained; and/or
b) the failure mode will not likely occur or will not be catastrophic if it does occur.
Column 8, Nonclinical Device Testing: The bench, laboratory, analytical, and/or animal
testing of the study device (i.e., the device that will be used in the clinical study) to
complete the evaluation of the attribute and the potential failure mode(s).
Column 9, Clinical Study Mitigation Strategies: For each Potential Clinical Effect of
Failure, the mitigation strategies included in the clinical protocol intended to minimize
the frequency or severity of the potential clinical effects resulting from a failure to attain
the attribute.
Note: Although the Clinical Study Mitigation Strategies are a subset of the risk mitigation
strategies included in the risk analysis section of the Investigational Plan, they should be
presented within the device evaluation strategy table to emphasize their applicability to
specific failure modes and effects of failure.

Table 1 defines the device evaluation strategy column headings and Table 2 describes the

The process of constructing the device evaluation strategy table can be divided into four parts:
1) Device Deconstruction – identify the attributes needed for the device to achieve the
design goals (Column 1), the potential failure modes (Column 2), and the effects of
failure (Columns 3 and 4).
2) Knowledge Base and Mitigation Strategies – describe what is known from the device
design (Column 5), leveraged nonclinical and clinical information from internal or
external sources (Columns 6 and 7), and the clinical study mitigation strategies (Column
9) applicable to the attributes and failure modes.
3) Evidence Gaps – identify gaps in the existing information indicating that additional
testing may be needed to justify study initiation, considering the Knowledge Base and
focusing on the following:
a. attributes most important for the intended use;
b. potential failure modes most likely to be associated with catastrophic failures; and
c. basic safety requirements (e.g., biocompatibility).
4) Filling the Gaps – identify in Column 8 the bench, laboratory, analytical, and/or animal
testing to complete the evaluation of the device attributes and the potential associated
failure modes, considering the following:
a. Evidence Gaps;
b. clinical context for the early feasibility study [see Section 6.1(1)];
c. potential types, frequency, and severity of the clinical effects of failure that may
be associated with the device or procedure; and
d. Mitigation Strategies.
Any implications of the unique aspects of the device or the proposed intended use should be
emphasized in the device evaluation strategy table. Similarly, the items listed under the
Evidence Gaps (3a-c), above should be highlighted in the table.
Submitting the draft device evaluation strategy table in a Pre-Sub will maximize efficiency. In
the draft table, the Nonclinical Device Testing (Column 8) may include proposed or completed
testing, but reaching consensus with FDA on the appropriate testing prior to completion is
preferable. Pre-Sub discussions on the device evaluation strategy table may focus on the
following:
· whether Columns 1-4 (the Device Deconstruction) are complete,
· the applicability and usefulness of the information in Columns 5-7 and Column 9 (the
Knowledge Base and Mitigation Strategies),
· whether the right information was considered when identifying the Evidence Gaps, and
· whether the additional proposed (or completed) testing described in Column 8 (Filling the
Gaps) will likely complete the evaluation of the attribute or failure mode.
These discussions should continue under the early feasibility IDE, when the device evaluation
strategy table has been further refined, and should focus on whether the information and data
provided adequately address the specific attributes or failure modes.
For the early feasibility IDE, the level of detail to include in each row of the device evaluation
strategy table should be proportional to the importance of the attribute to the intended use, the
potential severity of the failure modes, and whether the method of assessing the attribute or
failure mode is generally understood. A summary of Knowledge Base and Mitigation Strategies

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
information should be included in the rows of the table for the most critical attributes for
achieving the intended function of the device and for the potentially catastrophic failure modes.
Descriptive information should be included for novel methods of assessment. Conversely, for
less critical attributes, less clinically relevant failure modes, and standardized methodologies, it
may be adequate to simply identify the applicable information or tests without providing
descriptive information in the table. A comprehensive presentation of all leveraged information
and completed testing should be included in the Detailed Reports section of the Report of Prior
Investigations. Interaction between the sponsor and FDA is encouraged to establish consensus
on the most important attributes and to determine the appropriate level of detail that should be
included in the rows of the table.
It is understood that there may be uncertainty regarding some elements of the device evaluation
strategy, depending on the novelty of the device or intended use. The device evaluation strategy
table should be updated as new information emerges about the potential risks and the appropriate
assessment of the device.
Depending on the device and intended use, it may be appropriate and acceptable to defer some
device testing until after the early feasibility study, if the testing will not provide additional
meaningful information regarding basic device safety or functionality. For some devices or
intended uses, particularly for highly innovative devices, FDA recognizes that appropriate
nonclinical test methodologies to assess some critical parameters may not be available or are
impractical to complete, and therefore, these parameters would need to be evaluated clinically.
An example of a portion of a draft device evaluation strategy table for a hypothetical
permanently implanted, percutaneously delivered, covered metallic device is presented in
Appendix 2.
6.3.2 Overall device evaluation plan (at the sponsor’s discretion)
It may be useful to obtain FDA feedback on the overall device evaluation plan. The plan would
identify the types of information or levels of testing that may be needed to progress beyond an
early feasibility study and propose the timing of deferred or additional testing.
The additional information/data that may be used to support progression to each of the planned
developmental phases (e.g., traditional feasibility study, pivotal study, marketing application)
can be listed in Column 8 (Nonclinical Device Testing) of the device evaluation strategy table. It
should be noted that not all developmental phases may be necessary for every new device or
intended use.

6.4 Bench and laboratory testing and computational modeling
For early feasibility studies, the full battery of tests that would be expected for evaluation of a
final device design is not required for IDE approval. As outlined in Section 6.3 FDA encourages
sponsors to consider the relationship between a device attribute or failure mode and the
anticipated clinical consequences to determine the testing needed to support the IDE application.
This approach may be used when justifying the device evaluation strategy, including the use of
preliminary results or deferral of certain testing at the early feasibility phase of device
development.

18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Computational modeling (CM) can be used for a variety of purposes to support the initiation of
an early feasibility study. For example:
 For long-term implants in which the boundary and loading conditions are known, CM
may be used to predict the long-term durability of the device.
 For long-term implants in which the boundary and loading conditions are not welldefined, CM may be useful for iterative design modifications, where simulations can be
used to optimize the device design or enhance the design of prototypes.
 For certain test scenarios, which cannot be evaluated using other nonclinical methods or
clinically, CM may be used. For example, to aid in assessing MRI safety, CM may be
used to simulate certain worst-case MRI conditions that cannot be replicated in an animal
model and cannot be tested ethically in humans.
Discussions with FDA regarding protocols for complex and novel testing are strongly
encouraged.

6.5 In vivo animal studies
In vivo animal studies provide unique anatomic and clinical pathologic information on the local
and systemic responses to device use. An animal study may be conducted to support the
initiation of an early feasibility study when an animal model is needed to further assess basic
safety or device functionality beyond the information provided from non-animal testing.
An animal study should involve the use of a validated animal model, when available, for which
the results are likely to predict risks in humans. In cases in which a validated animal model is
unavailable, a focused animal study to address a limited range of safety issues may be conducted
to complement the non-animal testing. A rationale for addressing questions typically answered
by animal studies with alternative methods or data should be provided in the IDE application.
Animal studies should not be viewed as an alternative to adequate bench testing, and whenever
possible, protocols should apply the principles of reduce, replace, and refine. For example,
substitutions for the use of live animals, such as in vitro methods (e.g., validated cell culture
experiments), cadaveric studies, or the use of computer simulation may be considered. The size
of the animal study depends on the device and how well the animal model provides anatomic,
physiologic, and procedural similarities to humans. Recognizing the inherent variability of
results, animal studies should be large enough to show consistent results. Short-term animal
studies may be adequate for the initiation of an early feasibility study. However, additional
animal study data may be needed to support a larger clinical study with a near-final or final
device design.
Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) for animal care and study conduct as specified in 21 CFR part
58 assure the quality and integrity of safety data to support IDE applications. Non-GLP study
data may be used to support an early feasibility study IDE application only if the deviations from
GLP are identified and justified and do not compromise the validity of the study results. 15 For
example, if an independent quality assurance unit is not utilized, a sponsor should describe how
bias was mitigated and how the study was verified to be authentic and complete. Both GLP and
15

See 21 CFR 812.27(b)(3).

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
non-GLP studies should include independent monitoring and assessments with full disclosure of
study findings.
Discussions with FDA on study protocols, including the evaluation of operator technique, safety
outcomes, and the effects of the biological system on the device, are encouraged prior to the
initiation of in vivo animal studies.

6.6 Prior clinical information
For all IDEs, a summary of any prior clinical studies of the device used for the proposed
intended use must be provided in the Report of Prior Investigations.16 For early feasibility
studies, although clinical data may not be available for the test device for its proposed intended
use, any relevant background clinical information should also be provided. Relevant information
includes data or publications on:
 similar or related devices utilized for the proposed intended use; or
 the subject device or similar devices used for a different purpose.
This information may come from clinical use outside of the United States and may be used to
support proof of principle and/or to address the likelihood of potential failure modes that may be
observed during the early feasibility study. If such information is available, it should be
summarized in a format appropriate for the type of information (e.g., clinical study reports,
summaries of publications with copies of the citations, individual experience with the device or
prototype outside of a clinical study).

7. Investigational Plan
The requirements in 21 CFR 812.25 apply to the Investigational Plan for early feasibility study
IDE applications. The information in this section is intended to clarify how certain of these
requirements apply to early feasibility studies. In the IDE application, the study should be
clearly designated as an early feasibility study. The proposed study should reflect the novelty of
the device and medical need. Use of the Pre-Sub process to discuss the Investigational Plan with
FDA is highly recommended.
Note that small clinical trials to determine device feasibility are specifically excluded from the
definition of “applicable device clinical trials” requiring registration on
www.ClinicalTrials.gov.17 FDA is interpreting this exception to apply to early feasibility
studies.

7.1 Risk analysis and mitigation
The Investigational Plan must include a thorough risk analysis which describes the type and
estimated severity of risks to the subjects, how risks will be minimized, and a justification that
the risks are reasonable in relation to the expected benefits.18 The risk analysis should include
the anticipated benefits and potential clinical effects of failure identified in the device evaluation
strategy, as well as risks independent of the device that may be related to the underlying disease,
16

See 21 CFR 812.27.

17

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
comorbidities, or inherent to the procedure, and benefits unique to the device concept. For
example, a risk analysis may include the risks associated with use of anesthetic and contrast
agents and the benefits of a less invasive intervention.
For an early feasibility study, the methods to minimize risks may include the use of standard
approaches, with additional mitigation strategies to protect individual study subjects and future
study participants during the ongoing early feasibility study. Examples of both standard and
additional risk mitigation strategies include:
• use of study sites that have sufficient expertise and resources to manage adverse events
and provide appropriate alternative therapies if needed;
• identification of qualified investigators with adequate training to conduct the early
feasibility study;
• a plan to capture human factors information during the course of the study to modify the
procedures or device as necessary based on the information obtained;
• specifying appropriate study inclusion and exclusion criteria;
• limiting the sample size to a reasonable number for an early feasibility study (e.g., 5-10
initial subjects);
• follow-up assessments at regular intervals to monitor subject safety and device
effectiveness (i.e., potentially more frequent than for a traditional feasibility or pivotal
study);
• timely reporting of serious adverse events (e.g., after each occurrence rather than only in
a periodic progress report);
• timely reporting of device performance parameters, which help determine whether the
device functions as intended (e.g., measurements of deliverability, stability, handling,
visualization, patency, integrity);
• non-sequential enrollment, that is, initial device use in subjects with more favorable
anatomical characteristics as compared to the population otherwise eligible for the early
feasibility study (e.g., selecting subjects that meet study eligibility requirements but do
not have anatomic features that may increase the difficulty of device use); and
• a pre-specified plan for periodic patient outcome assessments and reporting prior to
enrollment of additional patients (e.g., as frequently as after each use of the device).

7.2 Clinical protocol
The Investigational Plan for an early feasibility study must present objectives that reflect the
purpose of the clinical study.19 The study protocol should include study endpoints, endpoint
assessment methods, and adverse event definitions as appropriate for an early feasibility study.
The study protocol must also clearly describe the methodology to be used in the investigation.20
This should include a comprehensive description of the subjects to be enrolled in the study.
When identifying the appropriate study population, subject risk tolerance (based on the severity
of the underlying condition and limitations of alternative treatment options) and the ability to
utilize the standard of care if the study device does not function as intended should be
considered. The subjects may have different clinical characteristics as compared to the
population to be included in a future pivotal study (e.g., the early feasibility cohort may have
more comorbidities, or a more advanced stage of disease). However, to ensure that the study
19
20

21 CFR 812.25(a).
21 CFR 812.25(b).

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
will provide information useful for the device development process, and to avoid exposing
subjects to risks in the absence of any anticipated benefit, the study should avoid enrolling
subjects for whom success is unlikely due to general health issues.
To allow for appropriate flexibility with respect to patient selection and data interpretation, the
early feasibility study protocol generally does not need to include the same level of detail as a
pivotal study protocol (see Section 5), but it needs to ensure adequate capture of adverse clinical
events and device performance information.

7.3 Human subject protection measures
Any early feasibility study involving human subjects must comply with FDA human subject
protection requirements, including obtaining informed consent and Institutional Review Board
(IRB) (or ethics committee) oversight.21 These measures should be tailored to the subject
population and the risk profile of the device under investigation.
7.3.1 Informed consent
Sponsors, investigators, and IRBs should pay particular attention to the adequacy of informed
consent in early feasibility studies. The informed consent process for early feasibility studies, as
for all clinical investigations, must adhere to the requirements described in 21 CFR part 50
subpart B – Informed Consent of Human Subjects. An informed consent form for early
feasibility studies must comply with the requirements in 21 CFR 50.25 and should address the
distinctive aspects of an early feasibility study. For example, subjects must be told that the study
involves research and must be provided an explanation of the purposes of the research,22
including that the proposed investigation is an early feasibility study (e.g., a small study of an
innovative device or innovative clinical use of a device for which there may be less nonclinical
data than would be required for a larger study). The novelty of the device or procedure must also
be described in language understandable to the subject.23
As discussed above, an early feasibility study may carry greater unknown risk as compared to
traditional feasibility and pivotal studies. Subjects must be made aware during the informed
consent process that there may be unforeseeable risks associated with participation in the study
due to limitations in available data and experience with the device.24 A description of any
benefits to the subject or to others which may reasonably be expected from the research must be
provided during the informed consent process in accordance with 21 CFR 50.25(a)(3). For
example, the form should note that even if there is limited or no expected personal benefit to the
study subject, future patients with the disease or condition may benefit from the information
obtained during the early feasibility study. The consent form should not include language that
could lead subjects to overestimate the chance of personal benefit.
Additional guidance on the information to include in an informed consent form for an early
feasibility study can be found in Appendix 3.
21

See 21 CFR parts 50 and 56.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
7.3.2 Institutional Review Boards
As with all clinical investigations, early feasibility studies must adhere to the requirements for
study oversight by an IRB, as described under 21 CFR part 56. For example, IRBs must
determine if the risks to the subjects are minimized to the extent possible, and consider whether
the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits and the importance of
the knowledge that may be obtained.25
IRBs must conduct continuing review of research at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk,
but not less than once per year, as required by 21 CFR 56.109(f). It is likely that more frequent
oversight by the IRB to assure human subject protection may be appropriate for early feasibility
studies. This may include, for example, continuing review on a more frequent basis than
annually, continuing review after a small target number of subjects have been studied, and/or
graduated enrollment based upon a safety analysis of the preceding subjects.

7.4 Monitoring
7.4.1 Monitoring procedures
Detailed monitoring procedures, appropriate for an early feasibility study, must be included in
the Investigational Plan, as required by 21 CFR 812.25(e). For more information on standard
monitoring procedures, see FDA’s draft guidance, “Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A
Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/
UCM269919.pdf). FDA's draft guidance represents FDA's proposed approach on this topic.
Due to the limited number of study sites and subjects, and the expected close oversight of each
study subject, the monitoring procedures for early feasibility studies may deviate from standard
procedures and should be tailored to the particular study being conducted.
7.4.2 Data monitoring committee (DMC)
FDA’s guidance, “Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees,”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127073.pdf) notes that:
[E]arly studies are often exploratory in nature; they are frequently not randomized or
controlled and therefore accumulating results are known to the investigators and sponsor.
Issues regarding statistical interpretation of interim data, or confidentiality of interim
data, are therefore generally less relevant in this setting. Nevertheless, for difficult
situations in which the potential scientific gain from continuing a study must be evaluated
in the context of ethical considerations for ensuring subjects’ rights and welfare,
particularly in settings such as those described above, DMCs may be helpful to
investigators, sponsors, and IRBs by providing independent, objective expert counsel.
For certain early feasibility studies, a DMC composed of clinicians, scientific experts, and
individuals with ethical expertise may be helpful in evaluating data relatively early in the course
of the study and would provide an additional layer of human subject protection. Use of a DMC

could be proposed by a sponsor as a risk mitigation strategy element, particularly for studies
where additional independent oversight would be of value.

8. Iterations during early feasibility studies
Because modifications to the Investigational Plan are expected during early feasibility studies,
discussions with FDA to facilitate timely implementation of changes are particularly important
throughout the Pre-Sub and IDE processes. The requirements outlined in 21 CFR 812.35 and
explained in, “Changes or Modifications During the Conduct of a Clinical Investigation;
Final Guidance for Industry and CDRH Staff” (http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegu
lationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm082145.htm), regarding changes to a device or
clinical protocol apply to all types of investigational studies. However, this guidance describes
new policy, interpreting the requirements differently for early feasibility studies.
To facilitate timely device and/or clinical protocol modifications during an early feasibility
study, this guidance introduces the following approaches:
1. Permitting a broader array of modifications to the device and the clinical protocol under
5-day notification without prior FDA approval during an early feasibility study as
compared to other types of studies;
2. For anticipated changes that would require prior FDA approval, allowing a sponsor to
seek contingent approval beforehand, which would permit changes contingent upon
acceptable nonclinical test results without requiring additional FDA action;
3. For early feasibility study IDE supplements and amendments, utilizing a new interactive
review process that encourages communication with FDA during the 30-day review
cycle.
Note that annual progress reports to the FDA are required by 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5) for studies
of significant risk devices. Some minor changes to the purpose of the study, risk analysis,
monitoring procedures, labeling, informed consent materials, and IRB information are not
required to be submitted in supplemental applications but must be identified in these annual
progress reports. 26

8.1 Changes requiring FDA notification (5-day notice)
For all IDEs, a sponsor may make certain changes to an investigational device or clinical
protocol during the study without prior FDA approval of a supplemental application by
submitting a notice to FDA within 5 working days of making the change.27 A sponsor may make
changes with 5-day notice if: (i) the changes to the device are made in response to information
gathered during the course of the investigation, and the changes do not constitute a significant
modification in design or basic principles of operation; or (ii) the changes to the clinical protocol
do not affect: (a) the validity of the data or information, or the relationship of likely patient risk
to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol, (b) the scientific soundness of the plan, or (c) the

26
27

See 21 CFR 812.35(a)(4).
21 CFR 812.35(a)(3).

24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
rights, safety, or welfare of the human subjects involved in the investigation.28 The information
to be included in such a notice is described in 21 CFR 812.35(a)(3)(iv).
Device developmental changes that do not constitute a significant change in design or basic
principles of operation are generally appropriate for 5-day notices. For early feasibility studies,
FDA would consider a broader range of changes not to be significant as compared to other types
of studies. This is in part because the evaluation of an early feasibility study does not depend on
statistical analyses of data collected or the pooling of data among study subjects, which would
require the use of a consistent device design. However, the changes should be expected not to
adversely affect device performance or pose additional risk to the study subjects.
For changes to an early feasibility study clinical protocol, the most relevant requirements for
application of the 5-day notification option are that the changes: (1) not alter the relationship of
likely subject benefit and risk relied upon to approve the protocol, and (2) not affect the rights,
safety or welfare of study subjects.29 Since, as discussed above, early feasibility studies are
expected to have enhanced risk mitigation strategies and patient protection measures directed
toward each study subject, sponsors should explain how these instruments provide additional
support when considering changes appropriate for implementation under a 5-day notice. The
other criteria, specifically that changes to the clinical protocol not affect the validity of the data
or the scientific soundness of the investigational plan,30 should generally be much easier to meet
for early feasibility studies than for other studies, because these studies are not intended to obtain
statistically valid data or test statistical hypotheses.
The types of changes that may be considered for 5-day notices may be discussed during Pre-Sub
interactions and prospectively identified within the IDE application to facilitate timely
implementation of device and clinical protocol modifications. For changes that are appropriate
for implementation under a 5-day notice, the contingent approval process (described below), in
which the information needed to justify a change is identified, may be used as an alternative
approach.
Appendix 4 includes examples of the types of changes that may be appropriate for 5-day
notification during an early feasibility study.

8.2 Changes requiring FDA approval
The first step in obtaining FDA approval of changes during the early feasibility study should be
informal discussion with FDA, using the Pre-Sub process when appropriate, to identify the
proposed modifications, the reasons for the modifications (e.g., adverse events observed during
the clinical study), the purpose of the modifications, and the evaluations needed to support use of
a modified device and/or changes to the clinical protocol.
Following the informal discussion, there are two new approaches for obtaining timely FDA
approval of changes to early feasibility studies: 1) contingent approval and 2) interactive review.
28

21 CFR 812.35(a)(3)(i) and (ii). These changes must be supported by credible information as defined at 21 CFR
812.35(a)(3)(iii). 21 CFR 812.35(a)(3).
29
See 21 CFR 812.35(a)(3)(ii).

1) Contingent approval. When device iterations or changes to the clinical protocols are
anticipated, identified, and explained prospectively, the contingent approval process may
be used. This process may be informally discussed during Pre-Sub interactions and
formally proposed during the original early feasibility study IDE application or in IDE
supplements.
In order to obtain contingent approval, during the 30 day review cycle the sponsor and
FDA should reach final concurrence on the nonclinical test plan and associated
acceptance criteria to evaluate the anticipated changes. Once these are agreed upon, FDA
may approve the anticipated changes contingent on the sponsor’s successful completion
of the test plan and the reporting of the test data to FDA within 10 calendar days of
implementing the change.
If the sponsor deviates from the conditions of FDA’s approval, the contingent approval
would no longer be valid, and the sponsor would need to renegotiate the test plan with
FDA and obtain a new contingent approval. Alternatively the sponsor could seek
approval through the submission of a 30-day IDE supplement.
If the sponsor is able to anticipate multiple changes to the clinical protocol or potential
device iterations, a proposal that covers these changes may be provided in the original
early feasibility IDE application or in a single supplement. For device modifications, the
sponsor would need to prospectively identify the appropriate testing plan and acceptance
criteria for each type of change to allow for contingent approval of all of the proposed
changes. For example, if a sponsor anticipates iterations of the materials of construction
based on clinical data generated during the early feasibility study, they may present their
strategy in a single IDE supplement and receive approval for the iterative plan, contingent
on successful completion of the test plan for each material type. Within 10 days of
implementing each change, an IDE supplement should be submitted to provide the data
and to report to FDA the current device iteration being used in the study.
For the clinical protocol, the sponsor could propose changing several clinical parameters
during the early feasibility study to determine the most relevant parameters for future
evaluation of the device. If the sponsor can adequately justify the use of each parameter
within the initial IDE submission or in an IDE supplement, the approval of the changes
would be contingent only on reporting to FDA, within 10 days of implementing each
change, that the changes were made. This report should include a copy of the clinical
protocol currently being used. For other changes to the clinical protocol, it may be
necessary to collect additional information (e.g., outcomes for the initial patients treated)
to support the changes. In this case, FDA concurrence with the information to be
collected and the results needed to support the change would need to be obtained prior to
FDA granting contingent approval. The approval would be contingent on reporting the
information, in addition to providing a copy of the protocol currently being used.
Appendix 4 includes examples of the types of changes that may be appropriate for
contingent approval during an early feasibility study.

2) Interactive review. Interactive review involves the continuation of informal discussions
with FDA during the 30-day IDE supplement review cycle. This process may be used in
situations where the sponsor has completed nonclinical testing to evaluate device
modifications, or where changes to the clinical protocol do not meet the criteria for a 5day notice, and FDA decides that the additional information needed to address
outstanding questions can be provided and reviewed within the 30-day review cycle.
For this process, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement that requests the
modifications and addresses any prior FDA feedback. During the interactive review,
FDA may request, and the sponsor may provide, additional information to enable the
approval of the supplement within 30 days. The success of the interactive review process
depends on the availability of FDA and sponsor resources to provide timely and high
quality feedback, as well as the acceptability of the test results.

9. Design controls
The current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation (21 CFR
part 820) govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design,
manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of all finished devices
intended for human use. An approved IDE exempts a device from the good manufacturing
practice requirements under section 520(f) of the FD&C Act except for the requirements found
in 21 CFR 820.30 (design controls).31
When complying with the requirements of 21 CFR 820.30 under an IDE, a device manufacturer
shall establish and maintain a plan that describes or references the design and development
activities specific to the medical device being designed or manufactured. This plan does not
need to be submitted in the IDE application. The design plan shall describe or reference the
following design and development activities in accordance with 21 CFR 820.30.
-

Definition of responsibility for the implementation of the design and developmental
activities;
Identification and description of the interfaces with different groups or activities that
provide or result in input to the design development process;
Verification that the design outputs that are essential for the proper functioning of the
device were identified;
Formulation of a plan to conduct design reviews to assess the progress of the design,
and confirm the design is ready to move to the next phase of development;
Assurance that the design outputs met the design input requirements as part of the
design verification;
Completion of a design validation to show that the approved design met the
predetermined user needs and intended uses;

31

See section 520(g)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act; 21 CFR 812. 1. See also
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevice/InvestigationalDevic

-

Performance of a risk analysis and consideration of risk throughout the design
process;
Documentation and control of design changes occurring during pre-production and
post-production of the device; and
Documentation of the design transfer into production specifications.

Appropriate documentation and establishment of the aforementioned elements of the device
design plan will facilitate meeting the design control requirements in 21 CFR 820.30 as the
device design evolves.

10. Next steps in clinical evaluation
After obtaining clinical information from an early feasibility study, the type of subsequent
clinical evaluation will depend on whether changes in the device design are expected, the
availability of adequate data to justify the next study, and the purpose of the clinical study. Early
feasibility studies involve the investigation of devices that may be in a rapid phase of device
iteration. If clinical information is needed after device modification and further device iterations
are expected, a sponsor may submit an IDE supplement including a request for expansion of the
early feasibility study. Once approved, the sponsor may enroll additional subjects in the early
feasibility study. If the device design is near-final or final, and the results of the early feasibility
study support the initial safety of the device and proof of principle, it may be more appropriate
for the sponsor to pursue either a traditional feasibility study or a pivotal study. Progression to a
traditional feasibility or pivotal study should be requested under an IDE supplement and should
include the information needed to justify initiation of the larger study. The approval of any IDE
supplement will ultimately depend on the availability of nonclinical and clinical data to justify
initiation of the specific type of study requested.
Informal communications with FDA are important to help determine the most appropriate next
step in the clinical evaluation of a device.

11. Conclusion
Early feasibility studies may be used to provide proof of principle and initial clinical safety data.
Data from an early feasibility study may lead to device modifications and be used to refine the
bench, analytical, and in vivo animal studies and future clinical study protocols.
Conducting an early feasibility study under an IDE provides a unique opportunity to obtain
clinical experience with a new or modified device or new clinical use, while utilizing appropriate
subject protection measures and good clinical study practices. Vital clinical information can be
captured and used to optimize the device design, design evaluation, and clinical investigation
plans.
Initiation of an early feasibility study and progression toward a pivotal study benefit from a
flexible process that relies on sound nonclinical assessments and appropriate risk-based
rationales. A high degree of interaction between FDA and the sponsor and use of the Pre-Sub
process will be instrumental in the successful implementation of this guidance.

Appendix 1: Suggested topics for a Pre-Sub for an early feasibility
study IDE
Although use of the Pre-Sub process is not a requirement, interactions between the FDA and
sponsor are encouraged to enhance the predictability of the early feasibility study IDE review
process. Based on the recommendations outlined in the guidance, the following topics may be
useful to discuss during Pre-Sub interactions prior to the submission of the original IDE
application:
1. Design concept
2. Clinical context
a. Clinical condition the device is intended to treat or assess
b. The standard of care, including the types and severity of risks and the benefits associated with
current treatment options
c. The types and severity of potential risks and the anticipated benefits that may be associated
with the study device
d. The rationale for exposing the target population to the potential risks (i.e., whether the
anticipated benefits that may be associated with the use of the study device justify the potential
risks, recognizing the benefits and risks posed by current treatment or assessment options)
3. Rationale for early feasibility study, considering:
a. Novelty of the device or its intended clinical use
b. Stability of the device design
c. Whether additional nonclinical testing would likely provide the information needed to further
device development
4. Nonclinical testing plan
a. Draft device evaluation strategy for the early feasibility study
b. Draft device evaluation strategy for device development beyond the early feasibility phase, if
the sponsor wishes to obtain FDA feedback that may assist with future submissions
c. Summary justification regarding the amount and type of information/data needed to support
initiation of the early feasibility study in the specified patient population, with comment on, or
comparison to, what may be expected to support the initiation of a larger clinical study
d. Protocols for complex and novel nonclinical (e.g., bench, animal and computational modeling)
testing or analyses, when available
5. Investigational plan
a. Clinical study protocol summary
b. Summary of risk analysis and mitigation strategies
c. Informed consent language regarding the early feasibility nature of the study
6. Anticipated design iterations and clinical protocol changes and proposals for using the strategies
outlined in the guidance
7. Projected device development timeline (e.g., significant regulatory and testing milestones)

Appendix 2: Device evaluation strategy example
The following hypothetical example illustrates the concepts described in Section 6.3.
A sponsor approaches FDA with an early feasibility study proposal to evaluate an innovative,
covered, metallic implant to treat a disease common in the elderly. The device is unique in that
delivery of the treatment will be through a catheter, rather than by open surgery (the standard of
care). The expected benefits of this approach include less bleeding, fewer major adverse events,
less pain, shorter hospital stay, and faster recovery as compared to the open surgery. There are
aspects of the new device that are similar to a device approved for a different indication.
In a Pre-Sub, the sponsor describes the design concept and provides a draft device evaluation
strategy table as described in Tables 1 and 2 of Section 6.3. Portions of the table are presented in
Tables 3-5 for a procedure-related function, a performance-related function, and a basic safetyrelated feature.
The procedure-related functions for this device include the ability to:
 access the target site;
 deploy the implantable portion of the device; and
 withdraw the delivery system.
For the ‘the ability to access the target site’ attribute, the potential failure modes are:
 the inability to safely advance the system to the target site; and
 implant dislodgement from the delivery system.
Table 3 outlines the information for the attribute ‘the ability to access the target site’ and the
potential failure mode of ‘the inability to safely advance the system to the target site.’
Some of the performance-related functions and features include:
 implant integrity;
 fixation effectiveness; and
 patency.
For the ‘implant integrity’ attribute, the potential failure modes are:
 corrosion; and
 structural failure of the implant.
Table 4 outlines the information for the attribute ‘implant integrity’ and the potential failure
mode of ‘corrosion.’
The basic safety-related features include:
 biocompatibility;
 sterility; and
 MR compatibility.
For the ‘biocompatibility’ attribute, the potential failure mode is ‘non-biocompatibility.’ Table 5
outlines the information for the attribute ‘biocompatibility’ and the potential failure mode of
‘non-biocompatibility.’

To help support the device evaluation strategy, the sponsor identifies the novel and most
clinically relevant attributes (i.e., those that support an expectation of acceptable clinical use or
are associated with basic device safety) and those that could be affected by differences in their
study device as compared to existing devices. The sponsor explains why certain potential failure
modes would not likely be associated with catastrophic failures, discusses the likelihood and
severity of the potential clinical effects of failure, emphasizes the unique anticipated benefits of
their novel technology, and details how the mitigation strategies can be used to minimize harm to
study subjects. The sponsor also describes their rationale for deferring some nonclinical testing.
The FDA interacts with the sponsor to reach agreement on the comprehensive list of devicerelated attributes and the potential failure modes that could occur if the desired functions or
features are not achieved. They then discuss whether the proposed bench, laboratory, analytical,
and animal testing of the study device should be adequate to complete the evaluation of the
attributes and the potential failure modes, considering the information provided in Columns 5-7
of the device evaluation strategy table.
The sponsor plans to modify the device design based on the information obtained from the early
feasibility study. The sponsor elaborates on the planned testing to be completed for the modified
device, prior to progressing beyond the early feasibility study. For example, to justify the
initiation of the early feasibility study, an animal study is planned to evaluate the potential for
catastrophic failure of the device acutely and in the intermediate-term. To support initiation of a
pivotal trial, the sponsor proposes a long-term animal study, which will be carried out concurrently
with the traditional feasibility study, to demonstrate complete healing at the implant site. The
sponsor will update their overall device evaluation strategy table as information is obtained from
their nonclinical testing and early feasibility study.
The sponsor continues to interact with the FDA as they complete the nonclinical testing of their
device. The Pre-Sub interactions regarding the device evaluation strategy enhance the
predictability of the review process by increasing the likelihood that the Report of Prior
Investigations will be adequate to help support IDE approval.

Appendix 4: Device iteration example
The following is a hypothetical scenario that illustrates the concepts described in Section 8
regarding device iteration during an early feasibility study.
Using the Pre-Sub process, a sponsor approaches FDA with a proposal to evaluate an innovative
device in an early feasibility study to treat a disease common in the elderly. The device is unique
in that delivery of the treatment will be through a catheter, rather than through the standard
procedure which involves open surgery. The sponsor proposes to enroll up to 10 subjects at up
to 3 investigational sites. The sponsor will evaluate the device performance and clinical
outcomes after each subject is treated, and prior to enrolling the next subject.
In the Pre-Sub, the sponsor describes several potential device changes that may be implemented
during the early feasibility study. The sponsor proposes the following specific iterative changes
for which they will request contingent approval under the original early feasibility IDE, if the
information obtained during the clinical study suggests that these device modifications are
needed to optimize the device design:
 improvements in maneuverability, including:
o modifying the shape of the nose cone of the introducer (e.g., increase or reduce
tapering); and
o making the sheath stiffer or more flexible;
 changing the length of the catheter to allow for the use of alternative access sites;
 modifying the hemostatic valve by changing material properties or device dimensions to
improve hemostasis or reduce friction;
 implementing ergonomic changes in the handle that do not affect the overall function of
the device (e.g., changing texture of knobs or handle); and
 modifying the operator interface console.
During the Pre-Sub discussions, the sponsor and FDA reach agreement on the test plan to
evaluate the proposed changes, including the acceptance criteria to be included in the original
IDE application. Although some of these changes may be appropriate for 5-day notices,
obtaining prospective, contingent approval under the original IDE will provide the sponsor with
more predictability in the regulatory process for their device modification plans.
The sponsor, with help from the principal investigator, identifies other types of changes that may
be needed for their device and clinical protocol during the conduct of their early feasibility study.
In the original IDE application, the sponsor seeks FDA concurrence on their proposed
approaches for implementing these changes, as outlined in Table 6.

* These types of changes would not generally be appropriate for 5-day notification in a pivotal study
due to their possible effect on the scientific soundness of the investigational plan and/or data validity.

FDA considers the proposed approaches to be reasonable.
The developmental device changes proposed for the 5-day notification process are considered
appropriate in this case because they:
· are reasonably defined such that appropriate testing and expected outcomes are known;
· do not constitute significant changes in the basic principles of operation; and
· are not considered significant because they would not adversely affect the interpretability
of the results of an early feasibility study, and would not be expected to adversely affect
device performance or to be associated with additional risk to the study subjects.
Similarly, the clinical protocol changes would be appropriate for 5-day notification because the
changes do not affect:
· subject safety, rights, or welfare;

the validity of the data or information resulting from the completion of the approved
protocol, because the data or information will not be pooled; or
· the relationship of likely patient risk to benefit relied upon to approve the protocol.
The additional subject protection measures included in the early feasibility study protocol
augment patient safety.
·

FDA recognizes that more types of changes are appropriate for 5-day notification during this
early feasibility study than would normally be acceptable for a study enrolling a larger number of
subjects or requiring a stable device design and clinical protocol to allow for pooling of the data
from study subjects. For example, reducing the follow-up assessments would not likely be
appropriate under a 5-day notice for a pivotal study; prior clinical studies would have been used
to identify the appropriate follow-up assessments to ensure that consistent data are captured for
each study subject. For this early feasibility study illustration, since the optimal study subject
follow-up has not been defined, the sponsor plans to require laboratory testing on days 3, 7 and
14, but may find that, based on the results from the initial 5 subjects, the 7-day assessment is not
informative and can be safely omitted. As the safety of subsequent study subjects would not be
compromised with this change, FDA agrees that such a change during this study could be made
with a 5-day notification.
During the course of the early feasibility study, the sponsor makes some of the anticipated
changes, but also identifies an additional modification that had not been predicted in the original
IDE submission. The sponsor proposes contingent approval for a change in a material used in
the construction of their device based on obtaining acceptable results with the same types of
nonclinical testing used to evaluate the original device design. To formally request this change,
the sponsor submits an IDE supplement that describes the change and evaluation plan, including
the acceptance criteria for the testing. FDA and the sponsor reach a consensus regarding the
proposal during the 30-day review time for the supplement, and FDA grants approval of the
modification, contingent on the successful completion of the test plan and reporting of the
change and supporting information to FDA within 10 days of implementing the change. The
sponsor evaluates the modified device according to the test plan, obtains acceptable results,
implements the change and submits their test report to FDA 7 days after making the change.
