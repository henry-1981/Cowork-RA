This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative
approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and
regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate
FDA staff, call the telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.

I. Introduction:
This document is intended for FDA staff, regulated manufacturers, and the general
public. This document clarifies the legal status of an individual who manufactures an
electronic product solely for his own use in his own commercial activities.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current
thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background:
Section 538(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Subchapter CElectronic Product Radiation Control prohibits the introduction into commerce of any
electronic product which does not conform to an applicable standard.
Questions have been raised as to whether a person who manufactures an electronic
product, for which a standard has been prescribed, for use solely in his own
commercial activities or manufacturing process, has introduced the product into
commerce.

III Policy:
Such a person would not have introduced the product into commerce within the
meaning of Section 538(a)(1). However, Section 538(a)(5) of the Act makes it a
prohibited act for any person to fail to issue a certification as required by Section
534(h), regardless of whether the electronic product in question has itself been
physically introduced into commerce. The assembly and use of an electronic product
by a person engaged in the business of assembling that product (as defined in
Section 531(2) for commercial purposes in his own facility affects interstate
commerce; thus Section 534(h) would require that the manufacturer certify that the
product conforms to the relevant standard. However, if that person in no way
receives compensation for the assembly and use of the product, he would not be
engaged in the business and therefore would not be a manufacturer subject to
Section 534(h) and 538(a)(5).
