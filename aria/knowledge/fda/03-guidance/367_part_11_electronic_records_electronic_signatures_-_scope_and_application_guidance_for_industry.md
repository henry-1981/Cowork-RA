INTRODUCTION  
16 
 
17 
This guidance is intended to describe the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA’s) current 
18 
thinking regarding the scope and application of part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal 
19 
Regulations; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures (21 CFR Part 11).2 
20 
 
21 
This document provides guidance to persons who, in fulfillment of a requirement in a statute or 
22 
another part of FDA's regulations to maintain records or submit information to FDA, 3 have 
23 
chosen to maintain the records or submit designated information electronically and, as a result, 
24 
have become subject to part 11.  Part 11 applies to records in electronic form that are created, 
25 
modified, maintained, archived, retrieved, or transmitted under any records requirements set 
26 
forth in Agency regulations.  Part 11 also applies to electronic records submitted to the Agency 
27 
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and the Public Health Service Act (the 
28 
PHS Act), even if such records are not specifically identified in Agency regulations (§ 11.1).  
29 
The underlying requirements set forth in the Act, PHS Act, and FDA regulations (other than part 
30 
11) are referred to in this guidance document as predicate rules. 
31 
 
32 
                                                 
1 This guidance has been prepared by the Office of Compliance in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research 
(CDER) in consultation with the other Agency centers and the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
 
2 62 FR 13430 
 
3 These requirements include, for example, certain provisions of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice 
regulations (21 CFR Part 211), the Quality System regulation (21 CFR Part 820), and the Good Laboratory Practice 
for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies regulations (21 CFR Part 58).

As an outgrowth of its current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) initiative for human and 
33 
animal drugs and biologics,4 FDA is re-examining part 11 as it applies to all FDA regulated 
34 
products.  We anticipate initiating rulemaking to change part 11 as a result of that re-
35 
examination.  This guidance explains that we will narrowly interpret the scope of part 11.  While 
36 
the re-examination of part 11 is under way, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion with 
37 
respect to certain part 11 requirements.  That is, we do not intend to take enforcement action to 
38 
enforce compliance with the validation, audit trail, record retention, and record copying 
39 
requirements of part 11 as explained in this guidance.  However, records must still be maintained 
40 
or submitted in accordance with the underlying predicate rules, and the Agency can take 
41 
regulatory action for noncompliance with such predicate rules.     
42 
 
43 
In addition, we intend to exercise enforcement discretion and do not intend to take (or 
44 
recommend) action to enforce any part 11 requirements with regard to systems that were 
45 
operational before August 20, 1997, the effective date of part 11 (commonly known as legacy 
46 
systems) under the circumstances described in section III.C.3 of this guidance.  
47 
 
48 
Note that part 11 remains in effect and that this exercise of enforcement discretion applies only 
49 
as identified in this guidance.  
50 
 
51 
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
52 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should 
53 
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are 
54 
cited.  The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or 
55 
recommended, but not required.

II. 
BACKGROUND 
59 
 
60 
In March of 1997, FDA issued final part 11 regulations that provide criteria for acceptance by 
61 
FDA, under certain circumstances, of electronic records, electronic signatures, and handwritten 
62 
signatures executed to electronic records as equivalent to paper records and handwritten 
63 
signatures executed on paper.  These regulations, which apply to all FDA program areas, were 
64 
intended to permit the widest possible use of electronic technology, compatible with FDA's 
65 
responsibility to protect the public health.     
66 
 
67 
After part 11 became effective in August 1997, significant discussions ensued among industry, 
68 
contractors, and the Agency concerning the interpretation and implementation of the regulations.  
69 
FDA has (1) spoken about part 11 at many conferences and met numerous times with an industry 
70 
coalition and other interested parties in an effort to hear more about potential part 11 issues; (2) 
71 
published a compliance policy guide, CPG 7153.17: Enforcement Policy: 21 CFR Part 11; 
72 
Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures; and (3) published numerous draft guidance 
73 
documents including the following:

83 
Throughout all of these communications, concerns have been raised that some interpretations of 
84 
the part 11 requirements would (1) unnecessarily restrict the use of electronic technology in a 
85 
manner that is inconsistent with FDA's stated intent in issuing the rule, (2) significantly increase 
86 
the costs of compliance to an extent that was not contemplated at the time the rule was drafted, 
87 
and (3) discourage innovation and technological advances without providing a significant public 
88 
health benefit.  These concerns have been raised particularly in the areas of part 11 requirements 
89 
for validation, audit trails, record retention, record copying, and legacy systems. 
90 
 
91 
As a result of these concerns, we decided to review the part 11 documents and related issues, 
92 
particularly in light of the Agency's CGMP initiative.  In the Federal Register of February 4, 
93 
2003 (68 FR 5645), we announced the withdrawal of the draft guidance for industry, 21 CFR 
94 
Part 11; Electronic Records; Electronic Signatures, Electronic Copies of Electronic Records.  
95 
We had decided we wanted to minimize industry time spent reviewing and commenting on the 
96 
draft guidance when that draft guidance may no longer represent our approach under the CGMP 
97 
initiative.  Then, in the Federal Register of February 25, 2003 (68 FR 8775), we announced the 
98 
withdrawal of the part 11 draft guidance documents on validation, glossary of terms, time 
99 
stamps,5 maintenance of electronic records, and CPG 7153.17.  We received valuable public 
100 
comments on these draft guidances, and we plan to use that information to help with future 
101 
decision-making with respect to part 11.  We do not intend to re-issue these draft guidance 
102 
documents or the CPG. 
103 
 
104 
We are now re-examining part 11, and we anticipate initiating rulemaking to revise provisions of 
105 
that regulation.  To avoid unnecessary resource expenditures to comply with part 11 
106 
requirements, we are issuing this guidance to describe how we intend to exercise enforcement 
107 
discretion with regard to certain part 11 requirements during the re-examination of part 11.  As 
108 
mentioned previously, part 11 remains in effect during this re-examination period.

DISCUSSION

113 
A. 
Overall Approach to Part 11 Requirements 
114 
 
115 
                                                 
5 Although we withdrew the draft guidance on time stamps, our current thinking has not changed in that when using 
time stamps for systems that span different time zones, we do not expect you to record the signer’s local time. When 
using time stamps, they should be implemented with a clear understanding of the time zone reference used. In such 
instances, system documentation should explain time zone references as well as zone acronyms or other naming 
conventions. 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
 
 
 
4 
As described in more detail below, the approach outlined in this guidance is based on three main 
116 
elements: 
117 
 
118 
• 
Part 11 will be interpreted narrowly; we are now clarifying that fewer records will be 
119 
considered subject to part 11. 
120 
• 
For those records that remain subject to part 11, we intend to exercise enforcement 
121 
discretion with regard to part 11 requirements for validation, audit trails, record retention, 
122 
and record copying in the manner described in this guidance and with regard to all part 11 
123 
requirements for systems that were operational before the effective date of part 11 (also 
124 
known as legacy systems).  
125 
• 
We will enforce all predicate rule requirements, including predicate rule record and 
126 
recordkeeping requirements. 
127 
It is important to note that FDA's exercise of enforcement discretion as described in this 
128 
guidance is limited to specified part 11 requirements (setting aside legacy systems, as to which 
129 
the extent of enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, will be more broad).  We 
130 
intend to enforce all other provisions of part 11 including, but not limited to, certain controls for 
131 
closed systems in § 11.10.  For example, we intend to enforce provisions related to the following 
132 
controls and requirements: 
133 
 
134 
• 
limiting system access to authorized individuals 
135 
• 
use of operational system checks 
136 
• 
use of authority checks 
137 
• 
use of device checks 
138 
• 
determination that persons who develop, maintain, or use electronic systems have the 
139 
education, training, and experience to perform their assigned tasks 
140 
• 
establishment of and adherence to written policies that hold individuals accountable for 
141 
actions initiated under their electronic signatures 
142 
• 
appropriate controls over systems documentation 
143 
• 
controls for open systems corresponding to controls for closed systems bulleted above (§ 
144 
11.30) 
145 
• 
requirements related to electronic signatures (e.g., §§ 11.50, 11.70, 11.100, 11.200, and 
146 
11.300) 
147 
 
148 
We expect continued compliance with these provisions, and we will continue to enforce them.  
149 
Furthermore, persons must comply with applicable predicate rules, and records that are required 
150 
to be maintained or submitted must remain secure and reliable in accordance with the predicate 
151 
rules. 
152 
 
153 
B. 
Details of Approach – Scope of Part 11 
154 
 
155 
1.   Narrow Interpretation of Scope  
156 
 
157 
We understand that there is some confusion about the scope of part 11.  Some have understood 
158 
the scope of part 11 to be very broad.  We believe that some of those broad interpretations could 
159 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
 
 
 
5 
lead to unnecessary controls and costs and could discourage innovation and technological 
160 
advances without providing added benefit to the public health.  As a result, we want to clarify 
161 
that the Agency intends to interpret the scope of part 11 narrowly.   
162 
 
163 
Under the narrow interpretation of the scope of part 11, with respect to records required to be 
164 
maintained under predicate rules or submitted to FDA, when persons choose to use records in 
165 
electronic format in place of paper format, part 11 would apply.  On the other hand, when 
166 
persons use computers to generate paper printouts of electronic records, and those paper records 
167 
meet all the requirements of the applicable predicate rules and persons rely on the paper records 
168 
to perform their regulated activities, FDA would generally not consider persons to be "using 
169 
electronic records in lieu of paper records" under §§ 11.2(a) and 11.2(b).  In these instances, the 
170 
use of computer systems in the generation of paper records would not trigger part 11. 
171 
 
172 
2.   Definition of Part 11 Records 
173 
 
174 
Under this narrow interpretation, FDA considers part 11 to be applicable to the following records 
175 
or signatures in electronic format (part 11 records or signatures): 
176 
  
177 
• 
Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rule requirements and that are 
178 
maintained in electronic format in place of paper format.  On the other hand, records (and 
179 
any associated signatures) that are not required to be retained under predicate rules, but 
180 
that are nonetheless maintained in electronic format, are not part 11 records. 
181 
We recommend that you determine, based on the predicate rules, whether specific records 
182 
are part 11 records.  We recommend that you document such decisions. 
183 
 
184 
• 
Records that are required to be maintained under predicate rules, that are maintained in 
185 
electronic format in addition to paper format, and that are relied on to perform regulated 
186 
activities.  
187 
In some cases, actual business practices may dictate whether you are using electronic 
188 
records instead of paper records under § 11.2(a).  For example, if a record is required to 
189 
be maintained under a predicate rule and you use a computer to generate a paper printout 
190 
of the electronic records, but you nonetheless rely on the electronic record to perform 
191 
regulated activities, the Agency may consider you to be using the electronic record 
192 
instead of the paper record.  That is, the Agency may take your business practices into 
193 
account in determining whether part 11 applies.   
194 
Accordingly, we recommend that, for each record required to be maintained under 
195 
predicate rules, you determine in advance whether you plan to rely on the electronic 
196 
record or paper record to perform regulated activities.  We recommend that you 
197 
document this decision (e.g., in a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), or specification 
198 
document).  
199 
• 
Records submitted to FDA, under predicate rules (even if such records are not 
200 
specifically identified in Agency regulations) in electronic format (assuming the records 
201 
have been identified in docket number 92S-0251 as the types of submissions the Agency 
202 
accepts in electronic format).  However, a record that is not itself submitted, but is used 
203 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
 
 
 
6 
in generating a submission, is not a part 11 record unless it is otherwise required to be 
204 
maintained under a predicate rule and it is maintained in electronic format. 
205 
• 
Electronic signatures that are intended to be the equivalent of handwritten signatures, 
206 
initials, and other general signings required by predicate rules.  Part 11 signatures include 
207 
electronic signatures that are used, for example, to document the fact that certain events 
208 
or actions occurred in accordance with the predicate rule (e.g.  approved, reviewed, and 
209 
verified).  
210 
   
211 
C. 
Approach to Specific Part 11 Requirements 
212 
 
213 
1. 
Validation 
214 
 
215 
The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding specific part 11 requirements 
216 
for validation of computerized systems (§ 11.10(a) and corresponding requirements in § 11.30).  
217 
Although persons must still comply with all applicable predicate rule requirements for validation 
218 
(e.g., 21 CFR 820.70(i)), this guidance should not be read to impose any additional requirements 
219 
for validation.  
220 
 
221 
We suggest that your decision to validate computerized systems, and the extent of the validation, 
222 
take into account the impact the systems have on your ability to meet predicate rule 
223 
requirements. You should also consider the impact those systems might have on the accuracy, 
224 
reliability, integrity, availability, and authenticity of required records and signatures. Even if 
225 
there is no predicate rule requirement to validate a system, in some instances it may still be 
226 
important to validate the system.  
227 
 
228 
We recommend that you base your approach on a justified and documented risk assessment and 
229 
a determination of the potential of the system to affect product quality and safety, and record 
230 
integrity.  For instance, validation would not be important for a word processor used only to 
231 
generate SOPs.  
232 
 
233 
For further guidance on validation of computerized systems, see FDA’s guidance for industry 
234 
and FDA staff General Principles of Software Validation and also industry guidance such as the 
235 
GAMP 4 Guide (See References). 
236 
 
237 
2. 
Audit Trail 
238 
 
239 
The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding specific part 11 requirements 
240 
related to computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails (§ 11.10 (e), (k)(2) and any 
241 
corresponding requirement in §11.30).  Persons must still comply with all applicable predicate 
242 
rule requirements related to documentation of, for example, date (e.g., § 58.130(e)), time, or 
243 
sequencing of events, as well as any requirements for ensuring that changes to records do not 
244 
obscure previous entries. 
245 
 
246 
Even if there are no predicate rule requirements to document, for example, date, time, or 
247 
sequence of events in a particular instance, it may nonetheless be important to have audit trails or 
248 
other physical, logical, or procedural security measures in place to ensure the trustworthiness and 
249 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
 
 
 
7 
reliability of the records.6  We recommend that you base your decision on whether to apply audit 
250 
trails, or other appropriate measures, on the need to comply with predicate rule requirements, a 
251 
justified and documented risk assessment, and a determination of the potential effect on product 
252 
quality and safety and record integrity.  We suggest that you apply appropriate controls based on 
253 
such an assessment.  Audit trails can be particularly appropriate when users are expected to 
254 
create, modify, or delete regulated records during normal operation. 
255 
 
256 
3. 
Legacy Systems7 
257 
 
258 
The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to all part 11 requirements 
259 
for systems that otherwise were operational prior to August 20, 1997, the effective date of part 
260 
11, under the circumstances specified below.   
261 
 
262 
This means that the Agency does not intend to take enforcement action to enforce compliance 
263 
with any part 11 requirements if all the following criteria are met for a specific system: 
264 
 
265 
• 
The system was operational before the effective date.  
266 
• 
The system met all applicable predicate rule requirements before the effective date.  
267 
• 
The system currently meets all applicable predicate rule requirements.  
268 
• 
You have documented evidence and justification that the system is fit for its intended use 
269 
(including having an acceptable level of record security and integrity, if applicable). 
270 
 
271 
If a system has been changed since August 20, 1997, and if the changes would prevent the 
272 
system from meeting predicate rule requirements, Part 11 controls should be applied to Part 11 
273 
records and signatures pursuant to the enforcement policy expressed in this guidance.  
274 
 
275 
4. 
Copies of Records 
276 
 
277 
The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to specific part 11 
278 
requirements for generating copies of records (§ 11.10 (b) and any corresponding requirement in 
279 
§11.30).  You should provide an investigator with reasonable and useful access to records during 
280 
an inspection.  All records held by you are subject to inspection in accordance with predicate 
281 
rules (e.g., §§ 211.180(c), (d), and 108.35(c)(3)(ii)).

We recommend that you supply copies of electronic records by: 
284 
 
285 
• 
Producing copies of records held in common portable formats when records are 
286 
maintained in these formats 
287 
• 
Using established automated conversion or export methods, where available, to make 
288 
copies in a more common format (examples of such formats include, but are not limited 
289 
to, PDF, XML, or SGML) 
290 
                                                 
6 Various guidance documents on information security are available (see References). 
 
7 In this guidance document, we use the term legacy system to describe systems already in operation before the 
effective date of part 11.

In each case, we recommend that the copying process used produces copies that preserve the 
291 
content and meaning of the record.  If you have the ability to search, sort, or trend part 11 
292 
records, copies given to the Agency should provide the same capability if it is reasonable and 
293 
technically feasible.  You should allow inspection, review, and copying of records in a human 
294 
readable form at your site using your hardware and following your established procedures and 
295 
techniques for accessing records.   
296

Record Retention  
298 
 
299 
The Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion with regard to the part 11 requirements 
300 
for the protection of records to enable their accurate and ready retrieval throughout the records 
301 
retention period (§ 11.10 (c) and any corresponding requirement in §11.30).  Persons must still 
302 
comply with all applicable predicate rule requirements for record retention and availability (e.g., 
303 
§§ 211.180(c),(d), 108.25(g), and 108.35(h)).   
304 
 
305 
We suggest that your decision on how to maintain records be based on predicate rule 
306 
requirements and that you base your decision on a justified and documented risk assessment and 
307 
a determination of the value of the records over time.   
308 
 
309 
FDA does not intend to object if you decide to archive required records in electronic format to 
310 
nonelectronic media such as microfilm, microfiche, and paper, or to a standard electronic file 
311 
format (examples of such formats include, but are not limited to, PDF, XML, or SGML).  
312 
Persons must still comply with all predicate rule requirements, and the records themselves and 
313 
any copies of the required records should preserve their content and meaning.  As long as 
314 
predicate rule requirements are fully satisfied and the content and meaning of the records are 
315 
preserved and archived, you can delete the electronic version of the records.  In addition, paper 
316 
and electronic record and signature components can co-exist (i.e., a hybrid8 situation) as long as 
317 
predicate rule requirements are met and the content and meaning of those records are preserved. 
318 
319 
                                                 
8 Examples of hybrid situations include combinations of paper records (or other nonelectronic media) and electronic 
records, paper records and electronic signatures, or handwritten signatures executed to electronic records.
