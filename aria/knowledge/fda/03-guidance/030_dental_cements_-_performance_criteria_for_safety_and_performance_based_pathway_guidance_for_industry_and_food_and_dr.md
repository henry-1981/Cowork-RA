______________________________________________________________________________

Draft Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for dental cements in support of the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway. Under this framework, submitters planning to submit a 510(k)
using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for dental cements will have the option to use
the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence, rather than
a direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of

3

the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter could
demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the specific set of
performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an appropriate predicate
for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria represent performance
that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed devices of that device type.
Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature,
and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed surgical sutures to determine the
performance criteria and associated testing methods that could support a finding of substantial
equivalence for surgical sutures as described in this guidance. FDA recognizes that in some
cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing against an appropriate
predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of performance and
technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate performance
criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the optional device-specific Safety
and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance criteria identified in this guidance
provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public health.

This guidance applies to dental composite resins that are combination products; however it does
not address specific considerations unique to combination products.
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The prosthetic devices that fall within the scope of this guidance are dental cements intended to
serve as a temporary tooth filling or as a base cement to affix a temporary tooth filling, to affix
dental devices such as crowns, bridges, or orthodontic brackets, or to be applied to a tooth to
protect the tooth pulp and improve retention of a restoration. These devices are for prescription
use only.
Device Design Characteristics:
The performance criteria in this guidance are applicable to dental cements as defined in the
FDA-recognized consensus standards ISO 9917-1 Dentistry – Water-based cements – Part 1:
Powder/liquid acid-base cements and ISO 9917-2 Dentistry – Water-based cements Part 2:
Resin-modified cements.
ISO 9917-1 Dentistry – Water-based cements – Part 1: Powder/liquid acid-base cements is
applicable to both hand-mixed and capsulated cements for mechanical mixing, where dental
cements are categorized on the basis of their chemical composition as follows:
· Zinc phosphate cement
· Zinc polycarboxylate cement
· Glass polyalkenoate cement
ISO 9917-2 Dentistry – Water-based cements Part 2: Resin-modified cements classifies the
materials used on the basis of their setting characteristics as follows:
· Class 1 Material: materials in which the setting reaction of the polymerizable component
is activated chemically following mixing of components.
· Class 2 Material: materials in which the setting reaction of the polymerizable component
is light activated.
· Class 3 Material: materials in which the setting reaction of the polymerizable component
is activated chemically following mixing of components and may also be light-activated.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based

Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion with
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k) as described in FDA guidance Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g. Declaration of Conformity (DOC) 1) recommended for each test or evaluation
below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions under
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the sections below, test information
such as results summary, test protocols, and complete test reports should be submitted as part of
the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway. For
additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please
see FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance
Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.

Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,

management process, referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
External Communicating Devices in contact with tissue/bone/dentin with a prolonged or
permanent contact duration, and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the
FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Oral Mucosa Irritation
· Acute Systemic Toxicity – Oral Application
· Subacute/Subchronic Toxicity – Oral Application
· Genotoxicity
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. As described in the FDA guidance Safety
and Performance Based Pathway, if a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria
identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program; however, the previously established
510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are
conducted, including Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k), remain available.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus standards

testing within a risk management process
· ISO 7405 Dentistry – Evaluation of biocompatibility of medical devices used in
dentistry (this standard is an application of ISO 10993-1 to dental devices)
Performance Criteria: All direct tissue contacting components of the device and devicespecific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate

may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
