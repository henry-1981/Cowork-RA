Endosseous Dental Implants and
Endosseous Dental Implant Abutments
– Performance Criteria for Safety and
Performance Based Pathway

______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for endosseous dental implants and endosseous
dental implant abutments in support of the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. Under this
framework, submitters planning to submit a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway for endosseous dental implants and abutments will have the option to use the
performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence, rather than a
direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration of Conformity to a
recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting documentation. For
more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to
the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket
Submissions for Medical Devices.”
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter could
demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the specific set of
performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an appropriate predicate
for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria represent performance
that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed devices of that device type.
Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature,
and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed endosseous dental implants and
abutments to determine the performance criteria and associated testing methods that could
support a finding of substantial equivalence for endosseous dental implants and abutments as
described in this guidance. FDA recognizes that in some cases, it may be more burdensome for a
submitter to conduct testing against an appropriate predicate device to demonstrate equivalence
for the necessary set of performance and technological characteristics than to demonstrate their
device meets appropriate performance criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded
that the optional device-specific Safety and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the
performance criteria identified in this guidance provides a less burdensome policy consistent
with the public health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The scope of this guidance include root-form endosseous dental implants and endosseous dental
implant abutments. These devices are Class II devices and are regulated under 21 CFR 872.3640,
endosseous dental implant (product code DZE) and 21 CFR 872.3630, endosseous dental implant
abutment (product code NHA).
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The endosseous dental implant devices (‘implant bodies’) that fall within the scope of this
guidance are root-form and are intended to be surgically placed in the bone of the upper or lower
jaw arches to provide support for prosthetic devices, such as artificial teeth, in order to restore
the patient’s chewing function. The endosseous dental implant abutment device (‘abutment’) is
intended to be used with the root-form endosseous dental implant to aid in prosthetic
rehabilitation.

Device Design Characteristics:
The dental implant bodies and abutments that fall within the scope of this guidance document
should be manufactured solely from one of the following materials in conformance with the
associated FDA-recognized version of the following consensus standards:
• ASTM F67 Standard Specification for Unalloyed Titanium, for Surgical Implant
Applications (UNS R50250, UNS R50400, UNS R50550, UNS R50700)
• ASTM F136 Standard Specification for Wrought Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium ELI
(Extra Low Interstitial) Alloy for Surgical Implant Applications (UNS R56401)
• ASTM F1295 Standard Specification for Wrought Titanium-6Aluminum-7Niobium Alloy
for Surgical Implant Applications (UNS R56700)
The following characteristics should be described for each component included in the submission
and compared between the subject and predicate devices. We recommend the use of engineering
drawings to describe these features. If the devices include a range features such as lengths and
diameters, it is best to present summary engineering drawings with ranges.
•

Abutment characteristics:
o Diameter
o Wall thickness
o Transmucosal height
o Post height (portion above the transmucosal collar)
o Angle 1
o Retention type to implant body, including dimensions of screw if applicable
o Dental restoration retention type

•

Implant body characteristics:
o Connection platform type and dimensions, if applicable
o Bone diameter
o Placement type, i.e., bone level, tissue level, sub-crestal
o Transmucosal height, if applicable
o Threaded length
o Retention length
o Thread type

FDA considers the final finished device to include both the in-bone structure and the section that
mimics the prepared tooth or allows for the restoration of chewing function. For a device under
product code DZE that does not include an abutment post, you should include in your 510(k) a
compatible device that would fall under the NHA product code, or identify a legally marketed

FDA considers angulation to be the angle of the implant axis with the occlusal load. Discussion of “angulation”
includes both the nominal angulation of the abutment and any additional angulation based on the placement of the
final construct. For instance, certain overdenture type abutments often are able to correct angled placement of the
implant body by incorporating the angular correction into the overdenture retention features, even if the abutments
are not placed at an angle in reference to the implant axis. FDA considers this type of abutment to be an “angled”
abutment due to its non-parallel alignment with the occlusal load.

device under the NHA product code. Likewise, an NHA device should identify a legally
marketed compatible DZE device.
If you are not able to establish implant to abutment compatibility based solely on descriptive
information because, for example, you cannot obtain the manufacturing tolerances for the
platform size and shape of another manufacturer’s device, we recommend that you provide the
steps taken to establish implant to abutment compatibility, such as a reverse engineering analysis
report.
If needed to show compatibility, the reverse engineering analysis should be performed on the
original equipment manufacturer (OEM) implant body, OEM abutment(s), and OEM abutment
screw, if applicable. The devices used should not be analogs or replicas. The submission should
describe each device that is intended to be compatible, including the 510(k) clearance number(s),
manufacturer name, implant system name, and dimensions. The reverse engineering analysis
should include the following:
1. Description and tolerances of the measuring device(s) used, such as an optical measuring
machine, tomography, calipers, etc.
2. The sample size, including justification, for each OEM component used in the reverse
engineering analysis.
3. A chart for each component, including the following information:
a. Identification of the critical features analyzed for the OEM component and the
proposed device, including images as applicable.
b. Average measured value
c. Standard deviation of the measure value
d. Upper tolerance limit
e. Lower tolerance limit
4. A summary of the plan that is part of your quality system, which includes the method and
frequency to which the device’s compatibility with each OEM device will be tested and
confirmed, in the case of an OEM change in design.
5. Representative computer aided design (CAD) images for the subject implant system and
OEM implant system for each connection type per manufacturer. The CAD images
should include cross sections in both the coronal and transverse planes. The images
should be in contrasting colors to show gaps and/or tolerances between components of
the system.
Dental implant bodies and abutments with the following features are outside the scope of this
guidance:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Two-piece abutments that are composed of a base part combined with a computer aided
design and/or computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) top half
Abutments with a post height of less than 4 mm
Implants that have a diameter of less than 3.25 mm or a length less than 7.0 mm
Abutments that are retained to the implant body by methods other than screw retention
Dental implant bodies that are placed outside of the alveolar ridge, including zygomatic
implants and abutments intended for use with zygomatic implants

Some of the recommendations in this safety and performance guidance may assist in complying
with some of the special controls for endosseous dental implants and abutments. For information
regarding the special controls for endosseous dental implants and abutments, see Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document: Root-form Endosseous Dental Implants and Endosseous Dental
Implant Abutments. Additional information that is beyond the scope of this safety and
performance guidance document regarding submission of a 510(k) for endosseous dental
implants and abutments, such as device description and labeling, can be found in the above
guidance.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to make a determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance
Based Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion
with FDA prior to submission of the 510(k) as described in FDA guidance Requests for
Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC) 2) recommended for each test or evaluation
below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions under
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the performance criteria sections
below, test information such as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should
be submitted as part of the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance
Based Pathway. For additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench

testing information, please see FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of NonClinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.
Mechancical Bench Testing
1.

Test name: Dynamic Loading Test (as applicable for systems that include angled
abutments)
Methodology: FDA-recognized version of ISO 14801 Dentistry - Implants - Dynamic
loading test for endosseous dental implants and Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document: Root-form Endosseous Dental Implants and Endosseous Dental Implant
Abutments
Performance Criteria: The worst case construct should reach the maximum endured
load based on the major thread diameter of the implant body as follows:
Major Thread
Diameter (mm)
3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
3.4, 3.5
3.6
Greater than 3.6

Maximum
endured load (N)
150
170
180
200

For implant bodies with nominal diameters that do not match a value in the table above, a
comparison should be made to the next highest major diameter listed (e.g., a 3.35 mm
implant body should use the 3.4 mm acceptance criteria).
Performance Criteria Source: Criteria and associated warnings are derived from
aggregated mechanical testing data and labeling submitted to FDA in 510(k) submissions
for dental implant and abutment devices previously found to be substantially equivalent.
Additional Considerations: Representative devices that are intended and/or labeled to
be placed at an angle in excess of the nominal angulation of the abutment should be
tested at the largest intended angulation plus 10° of uncorrected angulation. You should
include relevant information outlined by ISO 14801, including the determination and
engineering drawing of the worst case, calculation or measurement of the moment arm,
the physical set up of the testing method, method for eliminating lateral constraints, and
mode of failure near the maximum endured load in your test report. We recommend that
you define the steps between loading values to be small enough so that the maximum
endured load is clearly defined.
In addition to reaching the maximum endured load as defined above we recommend
including warnings, such as those below, in your device labeling based on the maximum
endured load of the subject system (consistent with section 13 of Class II Special
Controls Guidance Document: Root-form Endosseous Dental Implants and Endosseous
Dental Implant Abutments).
• Maximum endured load is at 150 N: “Warning: (device name) are indicated for
maxillary lateral and mandibular central/lateral incisors only.”

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Maximum endured load is below 300 N but above 150 N: “Warning: Small
diameter implants and angled abutment are not recommended for the posterior
region.”
• Maximum endured load is below 400 N but above 300 N: “Warning: Small
diameter implants and angled abutment not recommended for the molar region.”
Submission Information: A full test report should be provided.
•

2.

Test name: Surface Cleanliness Analysis for Blasted or Roughened Implants
Methodology: You should provide analysis of the surface of the implant body, using
scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS),
or similar technology that allows for magnified images of the implant surface and
determination of the surface elemental composition. The magnified images should be of
sufficient magnification to show the entire representative surface of the implant. The
sample size should be adequately justified and the testing should include test articles
from multiple manufacturing lots. Test articles should undergo all manufacturing
processes before being tested, including packaging and sterilization. The spectroscopy
analysis should clearly define the locations being analyzed, especially in instances where
the magnified images suggest foreign bodies or particulate matter.
Performance Criteria: SEM and EDS analysis should demonstrate that there are no
particles on the surface and that all chemicals have been washed from the surface.
Performance Criteria Source: Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Rootform Endosseous Dental Implants and Endosseous Dental Implant Abutments
Submission Information: The submission should include the magnified images, the
spectroscopy analysis, and sample size justification. The sample justification should
clearly demonstrate how the locations analyzed on the implant bodies are representative
of the entire surface undergoing any treatment.

Sterilization (devices labeled as sterile) and Reprocessing (end-user sterilized) Validation
3.

Test name: Sterilization (devices labeled as sterile) and Reprocessing (end-user
sterilized)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized version of the following consensus standards
(as applicable):
• ISO 17665-1 Sterilization of health care products – Moist heat – Part 1:
Requirements for the development, validation, and routine control of a
sterilization process for medical devices
• ISO 11135 Sterilization of health care products – Ethylene oxide Requirements
for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for
medical devices
• ISO 11137-1 Sterilization of health care products—Radiation—Part 1:

AAMI/ANSI/ISO 11607-1 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices –
Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems
• AAMI/ANSI/ISO 11607-2 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices –
Part 2: Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes
• ASTM F88 Standard Test Method for Seal Strength of Flexible Barrier Materials
• ASTM F3039 Standard Test Method for Detecting Leaks in Nonporous
Packaging or Flexible Barrier Materials by Dye Penetration
• ASTM F2096 Standard Test Method for Detecting Gross Leaks in Packaging by
Internal Pressurization (Bubble Test)
Performance Criteria: Validation testing should demonstrate the cleanliness and
sterility of, or the ability to clean and sterilize to a sterility assurance level of 10-6, the
device and device-specific instruments. You should provide a description of the sterile
barrier system and how it will maintain the device’s sterility, and a description of the
package test methods, but not package test data. If the sterile barrier system is single
layered, you should include adequate instructions in your labeling related to the
unpackaging process, and a usability evaluation for aseptic presentation, as described in
section 7 of the FDA recognized standard, AAMI/ANSI/ISO 11607-1 Packaging for
terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier
systems and packaging systems, that demonstrates that the end user can unpackage the
device without contamination. For devices that are provided sterile, endotoxin-mediated
pyrogenicity information, as described in section V.A.4 of FDA guidance Submission
and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for
Devices Labeled as Sterile, should be provided. For any device that is provided nonsterile or is intended to be modified by the end user, you should provide instructions with
a validated sterilization cycle as described in Appendix C of FDA guidance Reprocessing
Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling.
Performance Criteria Source: FDA’s guidance:
• Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile
Submission Information: If using an Established Category A sterilization method, you
should provide the information in Section V.A. of the FDA guidance Submission and
Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for
Devices Labeled as Sterile; the validation data itself is not needed to demonstrate
substantial equivalence.
•

Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers endosseous dental implants and endosseous dental implant
abutments to be categorized as implanted devices in contact with tissue/bone with a prolonged or
permanent contact duration of > 30 days. Thus, you should assess the endpoints below, per
Attachment A of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
• Cytotoxicity

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Sensitization
Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity
Acute Systemic Toxicity
Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity
Sub-acute/Sub-chronic Toxicity
Genotoxicity
Implantation
Chronic Toxicity
Carcinogenicity

Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as your own predicate device with the same
type and duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the
biological response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent
biocompatibility, if documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA
Biocompatibility Guidance is also provided. Please be advised that this rationale is only
approriate if you have complete knowledge of the manufacturing process used to create the
predicate device.
In addition, if the subject device is manufactured from material that conforms to a standard for
implantable medical devices (ASTM F136, ASTM F67, or ASTM F1295), and has been shown
to have a clean surface via SEM/EDS or similar analysis, FDA recommends providing
biocompatibility testing to demonstrate that no materials that may cause a negative biological
reaction have been introduced via the proprietary manufacturing processes. Generally this
includes cytotoxicity, sensitization, and irritation testing. Based on historical data, FDA believes
this information is generally sufficient to demonstrate substantially equivalent biocompatibility
of these devices.
Testing: f you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. Please be advised that you should use a
surface area calculation for extraction volume, instead of weight, unless you demonstrate that
using weight results in a higher ratio of test article per volume. As described in the FDA
guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway, if a device cannot rely entirely on
performance criteria identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its
submission, it is not appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program;
however, the previously established 510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons
against appropriate predicates are conducted, including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated
510(k)s, remain available.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: Current FDA-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct tissue contacting components of the device and devicespecific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
