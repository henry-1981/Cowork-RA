On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Use of International Standard ISO
10993-1, "Biological evaluation of
medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation
and testing within a risk management
process"
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing Premarket
Applications (PMAs), Humanitarian Device Exceptions (HDEs), Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) Applications, Premarket Notifications (510(k)s), and De Novo requests for
medical devices that come into direct contact or indirect contact with the human body1 in order
to determine the potential for an unacceptable adverse biological response resulting from contact
of the component materials of the device with the body. The purpose of this guidance is to
provide further clarification and updated information on the use of International Standard ISO
10993-1, "Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process" to support applications to FDA. This guidance document also incorporates
several considerations, including the use of risk-based approaches to determine if
biocompatibility testing is needed, chemical assessment recommendations, and recommendations

1

For the purposes of this document, the term “human body” refers to either patient tissues or the clinical
practitioner. For example, masks or gloves intended for protective purposes by clinical practitioners should be
assessed for biocompatibility. Similarly, medical devices such as implants or skin electrodes also should be assessed
for biocompatibility.

for biocompatibility test article preparation for devices with submicron or nanotechnology
components and for devices made from in situ polymerizing and/or absorbable materials.
When assessing new devices, the sponsor should specifically state if the device does not have
any direct or indirect tissue contact,2 and no further biocompatibility information would be
needed.
When assessing device modifications, the sponsor should specifically state if the modification
does not result in a change to any direct or indirect tissue-contacting components, and no further
biocompatibility information would typically be needed. However, if the change could affect
other parts of the device with direct or indirect contact that were not changed, a biocompatibility
evaluation should be conducted to assess the potential impact of the change. For example, if a
new non-contact internal component is added, but it requires the application of heat in order to
join to another component that has patient contact, the patient-contacting component may be
impacted by the application of heat such that biocompatibility could be impacted, and should be
assessed.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.3
Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to FDA staff. “You”
and “your” refers to the sponsor.
In general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Scope
The scope of this document and accompanying attachments is limited to the biological
evaluation of sterile and non-sterile medical devices that come into direct or indirect contact
with the human body. This document specifically covers the use of ISO 10993-1 but also is

2

For non-contact devices, there is no direct or indirect contact with the body (e.g., stand alone software), so it would
be sufficient for the biocompatibility evaluation to confirm that there are no direct or indirect tissue contacting
components, and no further biocompatibility information is needed. However, for devices with transient contact,
assessment of biocompatibility risk should be conducted to determine if testing is needed.

If there are other FDA-recognized consensus standards11 that address biocompatibility issues for
particular types of devices (e.g., ISO 7405 Dentistry – Evaluation of biocompatibility of medical
devices used in dentistry), the recommendations in the more device-specific standard should be
followed. In some cases, such as for dental devices, the biocompatibility recommendations in the
device-specific standard should be used instead of the recommendations outlined in ISO 109931. In contrast, some device-specific guidances include recommendations regarding
biocompatibility evaluations, that should be considered in conjunction with ISO 10993-1. For
example, the FDA guidance “Content of Premarket Notifications for Conventional and High
Permeability Hemodialyzers”12 specifies that subcomponent testing is recommended due to the
high surface area of the membrane component of a hemodialyzer, and testing of the complete
device is only recommended if “the extraction conditions (i.e., volume of solvent used per
surface area of test article) are more rigorous than those recommended in ISO 10993.” In this
case, if biocompatibility testing of a hemodialyzer is conducted on the final device, FDA
recommends that the hemodialyzer be filled to capacity with the solvent, resulting in a much
higher surface area to extract volume ratio, as compared to recommendations from ISO 10993-12
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 12: Sample preparation and reference materials.
However, if non-membrane components are tested separately, then use of ISO 10993-12
recommendations for test article preparation would apply.
Note that if your product is a combination product with a device constituent part,13 the general
principles of this guidance would apply, although additional or modified testing may14 be
needed. For example, sample preparation of biologic-device combination products may be
dependent on the type of product and the endpoint being assessed, and such detailed guidance
specific to biocompatibility evaluation of combination products are not within the scope of this
document. As such, we encourage you to discuss combination products with the appropriate

Center and review division who will initiate proper consultation on combination product-specific
biocompatibility concerns as appropriate.15
We also recognize that an ISO standard is a document that undergoes periodic review and is
subject to revision. Through the FDA standards recognition process, we provide information
regarding the extent of recognition of the ISO 10993 series of standards and other
biocompatibility standards through Supplemental Information Sheets published on the FDA
website.16 Unless testing is conducted under the Accreditation Scheme for Conformity
Assessment (ASCA) program and it is determined that an ASCA Summary Test Report is
sufficient,17 FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed
because the ISO 10993 series of standards include general methods with multiple options, and in
some cases do not include acceptance criteria or address assessment of results.18 Therefore, when
a declaration of conformity is submitted for an FDA-recognized standard in the ISO 10993
series, a copy of the supplemental information used to support the declaration (e.g., a copy of the
study test report as described in Attachment E) should also be provided.19 FDA intends to make
updates to this guidance document as appropriate, should future revisions to ISO 10993-1 or
other FDA recognized biocompatibility standards result in significant changes to the
recommendations in this document.
Sponsors are advised to initiate discussions with the appropriate Center and review division prior
to the initiation of long-term testing of any new device to ensure that, if testing is needed, the
proper testing will be conducted.

III. Risk Management for Biocompatibility Evaluations
As stated in ISO 10993-1, the biological evaluation of a medical device (or a material component
of such) should be conducted within the framework of a risk management process. Such a
process should generally begin with assessment of the device, including the material
components, the manufacturing processes, the clinical use of the device including the intended
anatomical location, and the frequency and duration of exposure. Considering this information,
the potential risks from a biocompatibility perspective should be identified. Such risks might
include chemical toxicity, unacceptable biological response to physical characteristics of the
device, and aspects of manufacturing and processing that could alter the physicochemical
characteristics of the device, which could lead to changes in the biocompatibility response. Once
the risks have been identified, the sponsor should assess what information is already available
regarding those risks and identify the knowledge gaps that remain. Considering the potential
biological impact, a plan should be developed to address the knowledge gaps either by
biocompatibility testing or other evaluations that appropriately address the risks. The
interpretation of the overall biocompatibility evaluation should be considered in the appropriate
benefit-risk context.

A.

Risk Assessment of the Medical Device

The risk assessment should evaluate the final finished device. The Agency makes a
clearance or approval decision for a medical device as it is supplied in its final finished
form. The Agency does not clear or approve individual materials that are used in the
fabrication of medical devices. Therefore, the risk assessment should evaluate not only
the materials used in the device, but also the processing of the materials, the
manufacturing methods (including the sterilization process), and any residuals from
manufacturing aids used during the process.20
The risk assessment should also consider the proposed clinical use of the device,
including the anatomical location, duration of exposure, and intended use population. For
example, for pediatric patients with a limited life expectancy, the tolerance for risk
associated with a permanently implanted medical device may be higher than the tolerance
for risk from the same device in an otherwise healthy pediatric population. The potential
exposure duration should also consider which material components of the device have
direct or indirect contact with tissue, and whether exposure would be a one-time
exposure, a constant exposure over time, or an intermittent exposure over time that could
have a cumulative effect. For example, pacemaker pulse generators commonly contain
internal electronic components made from chemicals that could be toxic to the body, but
appropriate bench testing can demonstrate that the pulse generator is hermetically sealed
and will limit exposure of those chemicals to the surrounding tissues.

20

See Attachment G for special considerations for FDA’s recommended biocompatibility evaluation for certain
devices in contact with intact skin that are fabricated from common polymers and fabrics.

B.

Identification of Potential Risks

An assessment of potential biocompatibility risk should include not only chemical
toxicity, but also physical characteristics that might contribute to an unwanted tissue
response. These characteristics can include surface properties, forces on surrounding
tissue (e.g., mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic), geometry, and presence of
particulates, among others. In addition, changes in manufacturing and processing
parameters can also have an impact on biocompatibility. For example, the original
processing for an implanted device might include placing the device in an acid bath to
facilitate passivation of the implant surface. If this passivation process is changed to
eliminate the acid bath in favor of a different method of passivating the surface, removal
of the acid bath might unintentionally lead to a smaller reduction in pyrogenic material,
which could result in pyrogenic reactions (fever) following implantation of the device.
Another common change that might impact biocompatibility is a change in resin supplier.
For example, if the new resin supplier does not remove all processing solvents (some of
which may be known toxic compounds, such as formaldehyde), the final manufactured
device could cause unexpected toxicities (e.g., cytotoxicity, irritation, sensitization,
genotoxicity) that were not seen with devices manufactured from the original resin.
Sources of information on potential biocompatibility risks can include, but are not limited
to, a manufacturer’s previous experience with the same material(s), preferably in the
same or similar anatomical location; reported experience from other manufacturers using
the same material in the same or similar anatomical location; information provided by the
material supplier (e.g., in a master file,21 see Attachment B); chemical or surface analysis
of the device in its final finished form; and the published literature. In certain situations,
clinical experience, such as postmarket surveillance information, may be informative. For
example, for a limited duration, skin-contacting device, patient experience that includes
information on potential for irritation or sensitization can be useful to the risk assessment.
When leveraging data from experience with a particular device for a new device
submission to FDA, it is important to understand how the tested device compares to the
device under consideration. In general, the more similar the tested device and device
under consideration are, including their intended use, the more applicable the risk
information is likely to be. For example, for a vascular catheter comprised of a certain
polymer, citing experience with the same polymer in a blood-contacting device will be
more applicable than experience with a similar polymer in a device that only contacts
mucosal membranes. Similarly, experience with device components made using the same
formulation and processing (e.g., for devices within a product family) will be more
applicable than experience with device components made by a different manufacturer
where the formulation and processing are unknown.
A master file for a material, device component, and/or device may be useful if it includes
information on recommended processing of the material or component and any biological
21

Additional information regarding master files for devices is available online at: https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/premarket-approval-pma/master-files

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
testing already performed (see Attachment B). A master file should also contain a risk
assessment provided by the supplier that includes a discussion of the chemical
formulation and structure of the material or component and information on how to
evaluate a device made from that material.
In certain situations, a sponsor may propose to use a material that has known toxicities
but where the material could be acceptable for the end use. In this case, the risk
assessment should include consideration of the intended use population that will use (e.g.,
protective mask for clinician) or be treated with the device and a discussion of potential
benefits of using the chosen material as well as potential mitigations that have been
considered (e.g., hermetically sealing).
A chemical analysis of the materials used in a device in its final finished form can be
informative. Chemical analysis can be particularly helpful to demonstrate that chemical
toxicity testing from a previously cleared or approved medical device is relevant to a
device under review by the Agency. For example, in some circumstances, a chemical
analysis can demonstrate that the extractables and leachables in a biocompatibility extract
have not changed, supporting that additional biocompatibility testing using that type of
solvent is not needed. In addition, chemical analyses can be used to assess the
toxicological risk of the chemicals that elute from devices. For example, chemical
analysis using exhaustive extraction techniques (per ISO 10993-18) can also be helpful to
evaluate long-term toxicity endpoints such as potential carcinogens. Extraction
techniques could also be used to identify intermediate and final breakdown products in a
material that is either synthesized in vivo (e.g., in situ polymerizing materials) or intended
to be absorbable (e.g., degradable materials). However, chemical analysis is usually
insufficient to identify all of the risks of the device in its final finished form, because it
will not consider aspects of the finished device such as surface properties (e.g., rough
versus polished surface) or device geometry that could affect the biological response in
certain scenarios (e.g., thrombogenicity, implantation). In addition, the outcomes of
chemical analyses are often sensitive to the parameters of the test. Extraction solvents
should be selected to optimize compatibility with the device materials and provide
information on the types of chemicals that are likely to be extracted in clinical use.
Solvents that swell the polymer, cause the polymer to degrade or dissolve, or interfere
with detection of chemicals should be used with caution.
Finally, there may be potential hazards that are not addressed by available information. In
certain cases, such as the addition of a new chemical to a standard formulation, individual
toxicity information for the added chemical and starting material may be insufficient due
to the potential for chemical interactions between the material and added chemical. Thus,
the risk assessment should consider what is known about the additional material, the base
material, and potential chemical interactions between the two.

C.

Considering Available Information to Identify and
Mitigate Risks

In order to reduce unnecessary testing, including animal testing,22 FDA recommends that
sponsors consider all available relevant information when conducting their risk
assessment. FDA believes that the following information should be included in your risk
assessment, if applicable:
1. Literature and other publicly available information: Sponsors should review all
available toxicity literature and other publicly available information to determine
the toxicity risks for the materials used to manufacture their medical device. If
data are not available to evaluate the safety of a compound, then the concept of
Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC)23 can be used to assess some
biocompatibility endpoints.
Sponsors should also review available literature and other publicly available
information to identify specific risks associated with the use of their device and
possible mitigation measures. For example, literature could inform manufacturers
that nitinol passivation of a peripheral stent should be conducted appropriately to
ensure that nickel, a chemical with known toxicities, does not leach from the
device when implanted. Literature could also be useful in identifying the potential
breakdown products of an absorbable device, allowing the sponsor to conduct
more focused testing to characterize and analyze these chemicals as a device
degrades. Sponsors should be selective in how literature and other publicly
available information are used to inform their risk assessment; all available
information should be considered in the context of how relevant the information
might be to a specific medical device. For example, status of a device material or
component as “generally recognized as safe” (GRAS) by FDA as a food additive
may or may not be informative for a medical device risk assessment because it
may not be appropriate to extrapolate use in food to device-specific tissue contact,
such as muscle or circulating blood. In addition, when considering available
literature with respect to specific device materials, sponsors should also evaluate
whether such information is relevant in light of the manufacturing and processing
for the medical device. Similarly, literature or other publicly available information
such as clinical data may become less relevant when changes in materials or
suppliers occur. Such changes may affect the safety or effectiveness of a medical

22

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to replace, reduce, and/or refine animal use in testing when feasible.
We encourage sponsors to consult with us if it they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, qualified for use with medical devices, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could
be assessed for equivalency to an animal test method.

device and should be considered appropriately in any risk assessment provided to
FDA.
If literature is used in lieu of testing for certain biocompatibility endpoints, the
submission should include information on the applicability of the dose, route, and
frequency of exposure from the literature report(s) as compared to the proposed
device use. In addition, while literature may be appropriate to evaluate certain
biocompatibility endpoints, it may not be appropriate for all biocompatibility
endpoints. For example, No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) and
Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) data should be derived from
studies relevant to the endpoint under consideration. For example, NOAELs and
LOAELs from a systemic toxicity study can often be used to address acute,
subchronic, or chronic system toxicity endpoints, but might not be relevant for
genotoxicity, local and systemic carcinogenicity, sensitization, irritation or
reproductive toxicity assessments, if these endpoints are not assessed in the
studies selected to develop NOAELs or LOAELs. However, NOAEL/LOAEL
values developed to consider reproductive toxicity may be used to assess the
potential reproductive toxicity of compounds released from devices that are not in
direct contact with reproductive tissues.
2. Clinical experience: Clinical experience should be considered in the overall
benefit-risk profile for the device where the totality of the data available for the
device may inform whether more testing is needed, or if any testing is needed at
all. For example, clinical experience may be useful to mitigate problematic
findings in an in vitro biocompatibility or in vivo animal study. In other cases,
testing to address long-term biocompatibility endpoints (e.g., genotoxicity,
chronic toxicity, or carcinogenicity) may not be necessary if the patient’s life
expectancy in the intended use population is limited.
Generally, clinical studies are not sufficiently sensitive to identify
biocompatibility concerns. Clinical or sub-clinical symptoms that result from the
presence of a non-biocompatible material may not be identifiable, or may result in
symptoms that are indistinguishable from the disease state such that the clinical
data may not be informative to the biocompatibility evaluation. For example,
blood vessel occlusion at the site of an implanted stent could be indicative of a
toxic response to the stent materials or be related to damage to the stent during
implantation (e.g., due to operator error or a delivery device malfunction).
However, in limited circumstances, clinical experience may mitigate certain
identified risks. For example, if there is previous clinical experience with a
particular medical device (either from a clinical study or via marketing outside of
the US), and there have been no issues with anaphylaxis, then biocompatibility
testing for complement activation may not be necessary. Similarly, in an
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study, first in human study data may be
useful to initiate a study on a revised device design, while biocompatibility
evaluations are being completed in parallel, and it may be acceptable to provide

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
complete biocompatibility information once the device design is finalized for
commercialization, depending on the risks posed to patients. 24
Clinical experience may also inform biocompatibility evaluation of next
generation devices. For example, some clinical studies of specific absorbable
medical devices demonstrated that the absorption kinetics were not accurately
predicted by the nonclinical performance (bench or animal) studies. This
information has been helpful when evaluating a next generation device using an
improved bench model for the absorption of the device, and for assessing how the
type and amount of chemicals released with absorption over time might affect
biocompatibility.
However, there are also situations where FDA has not found clinical experience
to provide relevant biocompatibility information. For example, providing clinical
information that a particular implant material has a long history of use would not
typically be sufficient to support the biocompatibility of an implant made from the
same material because manufacturing and processing could affect the final
chemistry presented to the body. In addition, such information is often too broad
and general to be useful.
3. Animal study experience: Data from an in vivo animal study of the medical device
in its final finished form may be used in lieu of some biocompatibility tests.
Testing performed in a relevant animal model can be used if the study was
designed to include assessments for biocompatibility endpoints. These studies
should evaluate the biological response to the test article implanted in a clinically
relevant implantation site. For example, separate biocompatibility assessments for
implantation, in vivo thrombogenicity, and acute, subchronic, and chronic toxicity
may not be needed if these endpoints were included in the in vivo animal study
design with an appropriate study endpoint, and the scientific principles and
recommendations in the appropriate ISO 10993 test method were considered and
applied.
If animal study data (e.g., histology, necropsy) identifies adverse biological
responses, some additional biocompatibility testing may be warranted. For
example, glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue heart valves may show toxic effects in
animal studies as well as some standard biocompatibility assays, such as
24

FDA considers biocompatibility information, collectively with other nonclinical information, in the review of
Early Feasibility Study (EFS) IDE applications and through the review of devices granted Breakthrough designation
and determines, through our benefit-risk analysis, what biocompatibility endpoints should be evaluated prior to
initiation of clinical studies as well as what evaluations may be appropriately conducted in parallel with clinical data
collection. For more information, see “Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical
Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human (FIH) Studies: Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/investigational-device-exemptions-ides-early-feasibility-medical-device-clinical-studies-including and

cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. These findings would usually trigger the need for
additional studies, such as chemical characterization and dose ranging
cytotoxicity and genotoxicity studies of suspected chemical toxins released from
the device to confirm the cause of the adverse findings and to determine if
additional mitigations are needed.
Animal experience may also inform biocompatibility evaluation of next
generation devices. For example, animal study data from the literature regarding
absorbable adhesion barriers made of a certain material could provide information
related to the timeframe of absorption and potential adverse effects for a new or
modified device.
However, there are also situations where FDA has not found animal data to
provide relevant biocompatibility information. For example, data from the
literature indicating that a particular implant material is biocompatible may not be
sufficient to support the biocompatibility of a device made from the same material
because manufacturing and processing likely will affect the final device chemistry
presented to the body. Similarly, animal studies designed to assess human factors
and studies conducted in animal cadavers would not typically include assessment
of biological response, and therefore may not be useful to support a
biocompatibility evaluation.
4. Consensus standards: Consensus standards specific to a particular device type or
material may be helpful to inform a risk assessment; however, the extent to which
the standard could be utilized may be dependent on the specificity of the standard
and/or the specific material. Ideally, a standard would have sufficient specificity
to provide useful information regarding material risks. For example, standards
that outline both mechanical and chemical properties of a device type with
pass/fail criteria may be particularly informative to FDA’s review because of the
specificity of such a standard. Standards that address bulk material composition
can also be informative as a starting point for incorporating material
characterization into a risk assessment. For example, it may be appropriate to use
material standards to support the biocompatibility evaluation of 316L stainless
steel surgical vascular clamps, as long as any risks associated with manufacturing
are appropriately considered and mitigated (see Section IV.A). Given the effects
that manufacturing and processing may have on a polymer as incorporated into
the final finished medical device, use of material standards may not be sufficient
to identify biocompatibility risks for devices made from polymers.
5. Devices previously reviewed by FDA: Experience with medical device materials
previously reviewed by FDA (e.g., in previous generation devices, PMAapproved devices, predicate devices) are also relevant for consideration as part of
a risk assessment. Such information may be more informative when a sponsor is
able to leverage their own experience, rather than that from another manufacturer
or supplier as the manufacturing and processing of the device material may be
unknown. Sponsors should be specific in their risk assessment regarding how
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
devices previously reviewed by FDA are being utilized to identify potential risks
and/or mitigate identified risks. Sponsors should be as specific as possible when
referencing devices previously reviewed by FDA, including submission numbers
or master file numbers, and references to specific test reports or data in a
submission (if applicable). Sponsors should also provide a specific comparison of
the subject device materials to device materials previously reviewed by FDA. It
may be helpful to use the documentation examples provided in Attachment F to
provide such a comparison.

D.

Submission and Interpretation

FDA recommends that sponsors provide their risk assessment at the beginning of the
biocompatibility section in a submission to CDRH or CBER. Based on the considerations
outlined above, the sponsor should clearly summarize their conclusions regarding their
risk assessment and explain the relationship between the identified biocompatibility risks
and the information available to mitigate the identified risks, and identify any knowledge
gaps that remain. The sponsor should then identify any biocompatibility testing or other
evaluations that were conducted to mitigate any remaining risks.
The sponsor should also explain any toxicities and adverse effects identified in their
biocompatibility testing or other evaluations. As a part of the risk assessment, the sponsor
should discuss any other available information (such as the results of in vivo animal
studies) that might provide additional context for interpretation. For example, if a device
made from polypropylene shows a grade 2 cytotoxicity with L929 cells, which might be
acceptable per ISO 10993-5 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 5: Tests for
in vitro cytotoxicity, the sponsor should provide additional information regarding the
potential source of the toxicity, since polypropylene is generally not expected to elicit a
cytotoxicity response of this level. Conversely, skin-contacting electrodes with adhesives
containing detergents might be expected to have higher than grade 2 cytotoxicity with
L929 cells, which could be acceptable if the sponsor is able to confirm that there are no
other chemical constituents causing the adverse cytotoxic response. In general, potential
toxicities identified through biocompatibility testing should be evaluated considering the
intended use of the device and as part of the overall benefit-risk assessment.
During the biocompatibility evaluation, if chemical characterization testing is conducted
per ISO 10993-18 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 18: Chemical
characterization of medical device materials within a risk management process or
ISO/TS 10993-19 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 19: Physico-chemical,
morphological and topographical characterization of materials, it is important to
understand that these standards include only general information regarding multiple
analytical techniques and no acceptance criteria. Therefore, to support a declaration of
conformity, as a part of the supplemental information used to support the use of these
standards, we recommend that a rationale for the selected method(s) and protocols be
presented with your results so that FDA can assess whether the information obtained will
support the biocompatibility of your device.

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Attachment C provides an example biocompatibility risk assessment summary table,
which FDA has generally found useful from a review perspective. Sponsors may find that
utilizing this approach and format is helpful when developing their own biocompatibility
risk assessment. FDA reviews these risk assessments as part of the overall
biocompatibility evaluation to determine whether the risks, mitigations, and
biocompatibility testing or other information is appropriate to support the
biocompatibility of a medical device. Sponsors may wish to discuss their plan for
conducting an appropriate risk assessment with FDA early in their device development
process. FDA recommends that sponsors use the Q-Submission process to facilitate these
discussions.25 While FDA generally cannot review a detailed risk assessment under the
Q-Submission process, it is often helpful to discuss the planned approach for such a risk
assessment. Pre-Submissions may be particularly helpful to obtain feedback regarding a
risk assessment in the following and other instances:
·

When developing an in vitro test battery for hemocompatibility to determine
whether the validation information being developed might be appropriate for a
particular clinical indication;

·

When determining whether additional biocompatibility evaluations may be
needed if questionable or inconclusive findings have occurred in any previously
conducted biocompatibility evaluations, or in the event that novel materials are
used;26

·

When designing in vivo or ex vivo studies intended to address biocompatibility
endpoints;

·

When designing chemical analysis protocols that use accelerating factors (e.g.,
heat) to simulate patient exposure to medical device materials over time;

·

When determining how to prepare absorbable devices for biocompatibility testing
(e.g., unpolymerized, pre-polymerized, partially degraded, or fully degraded test
articles).

IV. ISO 10993 ­ Part 1 and the FDA­Modified Matrix
This guidance considers the assessment of biocompatibility to be an evaluation of the medical
device in its final finished form, including sterilization, if applicable. However, sponsors should
understand the biocompatibility of each device component and any interactions between
components that could occur. This is particularly important when the combination of device

Novel materials are not commonly used to manufacture medical devices. Novel materials are mentioned
throughout this document to provide transparency regarding FDA’s current thinking and recommendations
regarding biocompatibility evaluation of devices made from these materials. However, we recognize that these
recommendations will not apply to the majority of device submissions.

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
components could mask or complicate interpretation of a biocompatibility evaluation. For
example, if a metal stent has a polymer coating that may separate over time, then the results of a
final device biocompatibility assessment may not fully reflect the longer-term clinical
performance of the device, and biocompatibility evaluation of the stent with and without the
coating may be needed. Similarly, for an in situ polymerizing and absorbable sealant, where the
materials present will change over time, separate evaluations of the pre-polymerized,
polymerized, and degrading sealant may be needed.

A.

Evaluation of Local and Systemic Risks

Biological evaluation of medical devices is performed to determine the acceptability of
any potential adverse biological response resulting from contact of the component
materials of the device with the body. The device materials should not, either directly
(e.g., via surface-bound chemicals or physical properties) or through the release of their
material constituents: (i) produce adverse local or systemic effects; (ii) be carcinogenic;
or (iii) produce adverse reproductive and/or developmental effects, unless it can be
determined that the benefits of the use of that material outweigh the risks associated with
an adverse biological response. Therefore, evaluation of any new device intended for
human use warrants information from a systematic analysis to ensure that the benefits
provided by the device in its final finished form will outweigh any potential risks
produced by device materials over the intended duration and use of the device in or on
the exposed tissues.
When selecting the appropriate endpoints for biological evaluation of a medical device,
one should consider the chemical characteristics of the device materials and the nature,
degree, frequency, and duration of exposure to the body (i.e., intended use), as outlined in
Attachment A. In general, the biocompatibility endpoints to be considered include: in
vitro cytotoxicity; acute, subchronic and chronic toxicity; irritation; sensitization;
hemocompatibility; implantation; genotoxicity; carcinogenicity; and effects on
reproduction, including developmental effects. However, depending on device physical
properties (e.g., surface topography, device geometry),27 the intended use of the device,
target population, and/or the nature of contact with the body, not every biocompatibility
endpoint will warrant testing. In contrast, the biocompatibility endpoints identified in
Attachment A may not be sufficient to demonstrate the safety of certain devices (e.g.,
devices that include submicron or nanotechnology components, see Section V.D). In
addition, biocompatibility endpoints such as neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity should be
considered for devices where local or end organ toxicity assessments relevant to the
implant location or toxicity issues of concern would not be assessed in a traditional
biocompatibility study. For example, a neurological device having direct contact with
brain parenchyma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may necessitate an animal implant test
to evaluate its pathological and physiological effects (e.g., effects on the brain
parenchyma, neurobehavioral effects and/or neurological deficits, and effects on the
functional mechanisms of the choroid plexus and arachnoid villi to secrete and absorb
CSF). The specific clinical application and the materials used in the manufacture of the
27

For example, a material may be selected to provide a certain stiffness required for the device to perform
appropriately (i.e., device characteristic), but may also have other material characteristics that could impact the
biological response to the device (e.g., hydrophilic or hydrophobic surface).

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
new device will guide selection of the appropriate biocompatibility evaluations. Where
available, device-specific guidance documents may include additional safety assessments
to be considered within the context of a biocompatibility evaluation.
Some devices are made of materials that have been well characterized both chemically
and physically in the published literature and/or have a long history of safe use in legally
marketed medical devices. It may not be necessary to conduct testing for all or a portion
of the biocompatibility endpoints suggested in the FDA matrix of this guidance. For
example, if the sponsor is able to document the use of a particular material (e.g., 316L
stainless steel) in a legally-marketed predicate device or a legally-marketed device with
comparable tissue exposure, and is able to explain why manufacturing is not expected to
adversely impact biocompatibility, additional testing may not be necessary to address
some or all of the biocompatibility endpoints recommended for consideration in
Attachment A. Sponsors may also leverage information from existing marketing
applications to support a rationale that the biocompatibility of the device has been
established.28 Refer to Section III, Risk Management for Biocompatibility Evaluations,
for additional information on how to use prior information in lieu of new testing. Also,
refer to Attachment F, Component and Device Documentation Examples, for additional
information on comparisons to a legally-marketed device.

B.

FDA Use of ISO 10993-1

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in an effort to harmonize
biocompatibility testing, developed a standard for biological evaluation of medical
devices (ISO 10993). The scope of this multi-part standard is to evaluate the effects of
medical device materials on the body. The first part of this standard, "Biological
evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management
process," provides a framework in which to plan biological evaluation of medical
devices, and if needed, guidance for selecting tests to evaluate the biological response to
medical devices. Most of the other parts of the ISO 10993 standard series discuss
appropriate methods to conduct biological tests that may be identified when following
Part 1 of the standard.
With the 2009 and then the 2018 revisions to the ISO 10993-1 standard, the focus of the
document changed from how to determine which biocompatibility tests to conduct, to an
approach that considers existing information prior to determining if biocompatibility
testing is needed. With the advancement of scientific knowledge regarding the basic
mechanisms of tissue responses, FDA agrees with the ISO 10993-1:2018 revision focus
on minimizing the “number and exposure of test animals by giving preference to in vitro
models and to chemical, physical, morphological, and topographical characterization
testing, in situations where these methods yield equally relevant information to that
obtained from in vivo models.”29 For FDA submissions, biocompatibility information for
the device in its final finished form, either developed through the risk management

process or from biocompatibility testing (using both in vitro and in vivo models), and/or
adequate chemical, physical, morphological, and topographical characterization in
conjunction with supplementary biocompatibility information that adequately address the
biocompatibility risks of the device should be provided.
ISO 10993-1 uses an approach to biocompatibility evaluation that includes these seven
general principles.
1. The selection of material(s) to be used in device manufacture and its
biocompatibility evaluation should initially take into account the likelihood of
direct or indirect tissue contact and any available information for the materials of
manufacture, for example, chemical formulation for each component material,
including adhesives, known and suspected impurities, and constituents associated
with processing.
For the purposes of submission to the FDA, in situations where details pertaining
to the materials of manufacture may be proprietary information held by the
material supplier, a master file for the material component(s) may assist in
determining the formulation of some components of the final device (see
Attachment B). However, this information alone may not be sufficient to establish
the biocompatibility of the device. Currently there is no standard established for
the content or completeness of a device master file. Because the information in a
master file may be specific to the material and may not address device fabrication,
the information contained in master files may be insufficient to address all of the
characterization or biocompatibility questions that pertain to the medical device in
its final finished form.
2. The material(s) of manufacture, the device in its final finished form, and possible
leachable chemicals or degradation products should be considered for their
relevance to the overall biocompatibility evaluation of the device.
3. Endpoints relevant to the biocompatibility evaluation should take into account the
nature, degree, frequency, duration, and conditions of exposure of the device
materials to the body. This principle may lead to the categorization of devices that
would facilitate the selection of appropriate endpoints for inclusion in the overall
biocompatibility evaluation.
4. Any in vitro or in vivo biological safety experiments or tests should be conducted
in accordance with recognized Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations30
including, but not limited to, the assignment of competent trained staff in the
conduct of biocompatibility testing.

30

FDA does not recognize ISO/IEC 17025 General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration

17

For the purposes of submission to the FDA, if information on these types of
nonclinical laboratory studies31 is provided, a statement that all such studies have
been conducted in compliance with applicable requirements in the Good
Laboratory Practice regulation in 21 CFR 58 should also be provided. If any such
study was not conducted in compliance with such regulation (e.g., for supporting
historical data included with a regulatory submission), FDA recommends you
include a statement in your submission explaining the reasons why the study was
not in compliance with the GLP Regulations, as well as a detailed description of
all deviations from the regulation. FDA recommends the statement include
information that will help FDA reconstruct the study, explain any confounding
variables, and demonstrate that authentic and complete test data have been
collected and reported.
5. When test data are provided, complete experimental data, complete to the extent
that an independent conclusion could be made, should be submitted to the
reviewing authority.
For the purposes of submission to the FDA, if testing is conducted according to an
FDA-recognized consensus standard that does not include data reporting,
submission of the test data is optional.
6. Any change in chemical composition, manufacturing process, physical
configuration (e.g., size, geometry, surface properties) or intended use of the
device should be evaluated with respect to possible changes in biocompatibility
and the need for additional biocompatibility testing.
7. The biocompatibility evaluation performed in accordance with this guidance
should be considered in conjunction with information obtained from other
nonclinical tests, clinical studies, and postmarket experiences for a safety
assessment that incorporates all available relevant information.

C.

The FDA-Modified Matrix

Like ISO 10993-1:2018, this guidance also uses a tabular format (matrix) to outline the
recommendations for biological effects evaluation based on the various factors discussed
above for biocompatibility information to be submitted in support of an IDE or marketing
application.
Attachment A, Evaluation Endpoints for Consideration, includes biocompatibility
endpoints for consideration recommended by ISO 10993-1:2018, and additional
endpoints FDA recommends for consideration. Attachment D is a biocompatibility
evaluation flow chart explaining when additional biocompatibility evaluations beyond
those recommended in ISO 10993-1 may be requested to fully characterize the
biocompatibility profile, such as when novel materials or manufacturing processes are

used (i.e., materials or processes that have not previously been used in a legally marketed
medical device with the same type and duration of contact).
If the device has multiple types of exposure, you should include information to address
each exposure category identified for the device,32 even though testing may not be
necessary for every exposure category, in your overall biocompatibility assessment. For
example, a pacemaker may include both a pulse generator that is implanted
subcutaneously and leads that are implanted within the cardiovasculature. Therefore, we
have considered these devices to be classified as both tissue contact and blood contact
devices for the evaluation of biocompatibility.
In general, FDA agrees with the framework established in ISO 10993-1 for identification
of the nature and duration of contact (e.g., cumulative effects with repeat use).33
However, FDA has made several modifications to the evaluations identified in that
standard for the reasons outlined in Section IV.D and Attachment A.

D.

Endpoint Assessment

As described in Attachments A and C, sponsors should evaluate each biocompatibility
endpoint and whether there is a need for additional testing. All biological effects included
in the matrix may not be relevant for all devices. Thus, the modified matrix is only a
framework for the selection of endpoints for consideration and not a comprehensive
checklist of biocompatibility testing. A scientific rationale to support the use of
previously collected information in lieu of additional biocompatibility testing should be
included with the submission for each endpoint identified in Attachment A. Chemical
formulation and processing information may not always be needed for all medical device
submissions; however, this information may assist the sponsor to support justifications
for waiving testing for any recommended endpoints.
ISO 10993-1:2018, Clause 4.1 states that “Evaluation can include both a review of
relevant existing preclinical and clinical data and actual testing. Such an evaluation might
result in the conclusion that no testing is needed if the material has a demonstrable safe
history of use in a specified role and physical form that is equivalent to that of the
medical device under design.” To conclude that no additional biocompatibility testing is
needed, the sponsor should provide evidence that for each material, the type and duration
of tissue contact, physical form, formulation, processing, component interactions, and
storage conditions are the same as for the comparator device(s), or the comparator device
is demonstrated to be “worst case” compared to the proposed device. In cases where there
are differences, such differences should be explained and justified as to how prior data
are applicable to support a biocompatibility assessment of the medical device in its final
finished form. In vivo animal data and/or clinical data may be of limited utility (as
discussed previously in Section III) if specific biocompatibility endpoints are not
included as part of the data collected for these studies.
32

We encourage sponsors to contact the appropriate Center and review division if there is a question about the
appropriate evaluations for a particular device type.

V.

General Biocompatibility Testing Considerations

Test article preparation is a critical variable in the conduct of the biocompatibility tests.
Therefore, it is important to understand how the test articles compare to the medical device in its
final finished form (e.g., sterile, if applicable). The example test article documentation language
included in Attachment F can be used to detail how any differences may or may not affect
biocompatibility of the medical device in its final finished form.

A.

Use of Medical Device in Final Finished Form or
Representative Test Article

When biocompatibility testing is warranted, the Agency recommends testing medical
devices in the condition that they will be used, whenever possible. This could include
final packaged devices, or as sterilized by an end user, if appropriate. If the medical
device in its final finished form cannot be used for biocompatibility testing, a test article
(e.g., coupons or “representative components”) may be considered. The representative
test article should undergo the same manufacturing and sterilization processes, have the
same chemical, physical, and surface properties, and have the same ratio of component
materials as the medical device in its final finished form. In situations where differences
exist between the medical device in its final finished form and the test article, additional
information describing how these differences could impact study findings should be
provided. For example, when testing an individual device component, a low-level tissue
response could be observed, but when all of the components are tested within a medical
device in its final finished form, a more robust tissue response could occur. If there are
differences between the medical device in its final finished form and the representative
test article, additional information may aid in determining the appropriateness of the
selected test article. For example, extraction and surface characterization techniques may
be appropriate to demonstrate that the surfaces are equivalent in geometry and surface
properties, and that the chemicals leaching from the test article display the same kinetics,
chemical identity and relative quantity as those eluting from the medical device in its
final finished form. For example, for long term or absorbable implants, FDA may request
data from exhaustive extraction studies (per ISO 10993-18) and surface characterization
information to support use of the representative test articles. See also Attachment F.

B.

Testing of In Situ Polymerizing and/or Absorbable
Materials

For devices made from in situ polymerizing and/or absorbable materials, we recommend
that test article preparation be representative of the device in its final finished form. In
addition, we recommend that biocompatibility be evaluated for the medical device in its
final finished form as well as at various time points over the course of polymerization
and/or degradation to ensure that starting, intermediate, and final degradation products
are assessed. Should biocompatibility assessment of the materials during degradation be
needed, preparation of test articles using in vitro degradation methods may be considered
with appropriate technical justification. Test articles degraded in vitro may be used for
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
biological testing, and/or chemically analyzed to show that the material breaks down into
intermediate or final degradation products that are known to be non-toxic at the levels
present. However, depending on the materials of manufacture and the degradation testing
conditions, accelerated degradation testing may not result in the same intermediate or final
degradation products and therefore may not be acceptable.
For in vivo tests for devices made of in situ polymerizing or absorbable materials, the
assessment time points would depend on the polymerization and degradation kinetics. We
recommend that assessments be targeted to demonstrate how the device materials degrade
over time and continue until the absorbable material and/or its degradation products are no
longer present in the tissue (e.g., microscopically), if possible. Alternatively, it may be
acceptable to provide a rationale for ending the study earlier, if the rationale includes an
estimate of the percentage (%) of absorbable material remaining in the tissue, and
confirmation that a steady state biological tissue response is achieved.
For in vitro biocompatibility tests conducted with extracts of an in situ polymerizing or
absorbable device, chemical analytical testing of the extract may be useful to determine
whether the extract is representative of leachables during the polymerization or
degradation processes, and if multiple biocompatibility tests with different extracts are
needed to represent different stages of the polymerization or degradation processes. If test
articles are pre-polymerized prior to extraction, unreacted constituents that may be available
during physiologic polymerization may or may not be available for extraction from a prepolymerized test article. For systems that may not be polymerizable in traditional extraction
media, alternative approaches may be necessary.

C.

Biological Response Resulting from Device Mechanical
Failure

The scope of ISO 10993-1 includes biological hazards arising from mechanical failure,
and FDA agrees this potential risk is important to consider when conducting
biocompatibility evaluations. For some devices, it may be possible that mechanical
failure could alter the biological response to the device. For example, if coating particles
or wear debris are released from a device, those particles could lead to a biological
response because of their material properties, such as geometric and/or physicochemical
properties.34 In addition, coating delamination or component release or failure could
expose the biological system to leaching of different chemicals, or to an increased level
of chemicals from a substrate material. Another consideration is whether the surface
topography could change with mechanical loading in such a way that the biological
response changes. We recommend that your test article selection for any biocompatibility
testing incorporate these considerations. If your biocompatibility evaluation does not

to the wear debris.”

rationale for why such testing is not needed may include the results of other nonclinical
tests, such as bench testing or in vivo animal studies. For example, inadequate surface
treatment of nitinol devices might result in non-optimized passivation layers that can be
further compromised by mechanical loading, such as during device placement. This could
result in nickel, a known renal toxin, sensitizer, genotoxin and possible co-carcinogen,
being released at levels that could be toxic. If processing includes an adequate passivation
method, and corrosion testing confirms that an appropriate passivation layer exists, the
risk for nickel toxicity is minimized, and testing to assess biological endpoints and/or
nickel leaching may not be necessary. 35

Submicron or Nanotechnology Components

There can be unique properties associated with submicron (< 1 micron) or
nanotechnology components such as aggregation, agglomeration, immunogenicity, or
toxicity. 36,37 Medical devices with submicron components may warrant specialized
techniques if characterization and biocompatibility testing is needed.38 Limitations may
apply when using chemical leachates-based ISO 10993-12 test conditions for the analysis
of submicron component biocompatibility assessments. The sponsor should consult
relevant literature and standards during the development of test protocols for devicespecific submicron or nanotechnology component biocompatibility assessments, and
contact the respective Center and review division prior to initiation of any tests.
For biocompatibility assessment of devices with submicron components, you should
consider the following:
·

Careful characterization of the test article.

·

Selection of extract conditions (e.g., solvent type) that avoid testing artifacts.

·

Assurance that the test article used is representative of the device that is intended
to be used clinically.

For test selection, the following items are also important:
·

Consideration of standard biocompatibility tests in the context of contemporary
literature regarding the validity of individual tests for assessment of devices with
submicron components.

·

Assurance that the submicron components will not interfere with the conduct of a
chosen test.

·

Consideration of any additional toxicity issues that might be relevant to
submicron particles, such as absorption, distribution, and accumulation into
organs, potential metabolism, and elimination, since there are greater concerns
associated with submicron particles that cannot be readily detoxified and/or
eliminated from the body.

E.

Test Article Preparation for Extract Testing

For biocompatibility testing conducted using extracts of the test article,39 we recommend
that you:
·

Determine the appropriate amount of test article as outlined in ISO 10993-12 or
another FDA-recognized standard (e.g., ASTM F619 Standard Practice for
Extraction of Materials Used in Medical Devices), using surface area to extract
volume ratios. Mass to extract volume ratios should only be used if surface area
cannot be calculated, or if use of mass will result in a test article with a larger
surface area to extract volume ratio than recommended by ISO 10993-12. If there
is a need for an alternate extraction ratio, appropriate justification should be
provided. For example, for fluid path devices or components (where fluids contact
the channels in the device or component, and then the fluid enters the body), the
fluid path can be filled to capacity. If the ISO 10993-12 recommended surface
area to extract volume cannot be achieved, the fluid contacting surface area and
extraction volume should be noted in the test report. This approach can be used
for both static and dynamic extractions. For some test systems, there may be
standardized alternatives for test-specific extraction conditions that provide a
different level of extraction (e.g., guinea pig maximization testing per ISO 1099310 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 10: Tests for skin
sensitization).

·

Use both polar and nonpolar solvents, such as those described in ISO 10993-12.
In some cases, other solvents may be used, where appropriate. For example, a
mixed polarity solvent (e.g., cell culture medium with 5-10% serum for
cytotoxicity testing) is appropriate to extract both hydrophilic and lipophilic
chemicals. Also, where devices do not have direct contact with the body but only
have indirect contact via a polar solution (e.g., assessment of the inner channel
material of a cardiovascular catheter where the inner channel is only used for the
infusion of saline), a rationale for waiving testing with a non-polar solution
should be provided. For some tests such as material-mediated pyrogenicity, where
the extract is injected intravascularly, a polar extract is sufficient.

39

For biocompatibility testing, extracts could include leachable residuals at the surface of test articles or extractables
migrating from the bulk of test articles.

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

F.

·

Use extraction conditions that are adequate for testing of extractables and
leachables from the device given its intended use. Traditional biocompatibility
extraction methods, such as those in ISO 10993-12:2021 (e.g., 37 °C for 72 hours;
50 °C for 72 hours; 70 °C for 24 hours; or 121 °C for 1 hour) are acceptable for
many biocompatibility tests. For prolonged contact devices and those categorized
as long term devices, extraction at 37 °C may not be sufficient to obtain an extract
that represents the chemicals extracted over the duration of device use. However,
in some cases, temperatures above 37 °C result in chemicals that may not occur in
clinical use and may result in adverse biological responses not representative of
the medical device in its final finished form. For example, for devices that contain
heat labile or heat sensitive materials (e.g., drugs, biomolecules, tissue-derived
components), which may have the potential to undergo deformation or material
configuration/structural change at high temperature, extraction at 37 °C per ISO
10993-12 is recommended, but some additional information on how the chemistry
of the device will change over time may also be needed. In all cases, a
justification for the selected extraction conditions should be provided.

·

Describe the condition of the test extract (e.g., color, presence of any particles),
and describe any changes in the extraction solvent (pre- and post-extraction) and
explain the source of these changes (e.g., test article degradation).

·

Use the extracts without additional processing (e.g., no filtration, centrifugation,
or other methods to remove particulates; no pH adjustment), unless otherwise
justified.

·

If test article extracts are not used immediately, we recommend that you use them
within the time frame outlined in ISO 10993-12 or an equivalent method. We
recommend that you describe the details of storage conditions for the test extract,
and explain why storage will not affect your test results (i.e., as stated in ISO
10993-12:2021, “stability and homogeneity of the extract under the storage
conditions shall be verified”).

Inclusion of Multiple Components or Materials in a
Single Test Article

For devices that include components with different lengths of contact (e.g., categorized as
limited, prolonged, or long term), we recommend that any extract-based biocompatibility
testing be conducted separately.40 If the components are combined into a single test
article, this will dilute the amount of component materials being presented to the test
system and may not accurately identify potentially toxic agents that would have been
found if the components were tested separately. For example, we recommend testing
implants separately from delivery systems or other kit components.
40

In many cases, it is acceptable to combine components with limited (< 24 hour) use, with an appropriate
supporting rationale. However, separate assessments of devices with prolonged (24 hour to 30 day) or long term (>
30 day) duration of contact are recommended.

24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
For devices or device components that contain multiple materials with differing surface
areas or differing exposure to the body, if one or more materials is new (i.e., not used
before in devices with the same type and duration of contact), it may also be necessary to
test the new material component(s) separately as well, to further understand the potential
toxicity of this component. For example, for a catheter-based delivery system that contains
a new balloon material, tests of the delivery system separate from the balloon may be
necessary to ensure adequate assessment of each of the materials.

VI. Test­Specific Considerations
If your risk assessment indicates that testing is warranted, we recommend that you consider the
following issues when conducting any of the tests identified below. While there are other
biocompatibility endpoints identified in Attachment A, only certain tests are discussed below.
The test-specific issues discussed in this section have been included because they are often areas
where deficiencies are frequently identified in premarket submissions.

A.

Cytotoxicity

If not otherwise addressed during the risk assessment process, for tests where the test
article is extracted in growth media, we recommend that extractions be conducted at 37
°C for 24 to 72 hours using a vehicle that will allow for extraction of both polar and
nonpolar constituents from the test article, such as mammalian cell culture media (e.g.,
MEM) supplemented with 5-10% serum.
For novel materials (i.e., materials that have not previously been used in a legally
marketed medical device with the same type and duration of contact), we recommend that
both direct contact and elution methods be considered. For some devices, a direct contact
study per ISO 10993-5 may be needed to better reflect clinical use. Depending on the
nature and function of the material (e.g., coatings or surface topography modifications), a
non-standard direct contact study, where the cells are grown on a material surface, may
be needed if no implantation data are available.
For materials that are inherently cytotoxic, additional testing using various dilutions of
the test solution may be necessary to determine the level at which cytotoxicity no longer
occurs. This information can be evaluated with respect to the clinical dose as well as
other mitigating factors such as duration of contact and clinical need (e.g., clinical
benefits versus risks). For some devices, such as dental acid etchants, devices containing
a known cytostatic/cytotoxic agent, or uncured polymer resins, additional comparative
cytotoxicity testing using a legally marketed medical device may be necessary to
demonstrate that the new device is no more cytotoxic than the comparative device with
the same type and duration of contact.

B.

Sensitization

There are two types of sensitization tests that are generally submitted in support of IDE
and marketing applications: the Guinea Pig Maximization Test and the Local Lymph
25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Node Assay. In addition, the Buehler method can be used for topical devices only (i.e.,
those in contact with skin), per ISO 10993-10.
Guinea Pig Maximization Test (GPMT)
For this test, male and/or female healthy young adult animals should be used. If female
animals are used, we recommend that test reports confirm that the animals are nulliparous
and non-pregnant, as pregnancy can reduce the ability of a female animal to detect a
sensitization response.
Assays with positive controls using the same source and strain of animals should be
performed regularly (at least once every six months, or if longer, concurrent with the test
assays) to ensure the reproducibility and sensitivity of the test procedure. We recommend
that test reports include positive control data from concurrent testing or from positive
control testing within three months (before or after) of the device testing using the same
methods and source and strain of animal.41 We also recommend that your positive control
testing include a minimum of five animals to demonstrate a reproducible and
appropriately positive response in the test system. If a periodic positive control fails, all
GPMT data generated after the last valid positive GPMT response should be considered
invalid because there is no assurance that the test system is working appropriately.
Therefore, repeating positive control testing to justify a failed positive control test would
not be sufficient. If root cause analysis confirms the loss of sensitivity of the animal herd
to the positive control, repeating device testing using a new animal herd is recommended
for any GPMT data collected between the successful and failed periodic positive control
testing.
If a preliminary irritation study is not included in the sensitization protocol, adverse
findings at the end of the study may be due to irritation or sensitization, and additional
irritation studies to determine the causality may be needed.
Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA)
FDA intends to evaluate use of LLNA tests for medical devices on a case-by-case basis
for medical device extract/residuals that are composed of chemical mixtures. LLNA tests
may be appropriate in the following circumstances:
·

The LLNA can be used for testing metal compounds (with the exception of nickel
and nickel-containing metals) unless there are unique physicochemical properties
associated with these materials (e.g., nanomaterials) that may interfere with the
ability of the LLNA to detect sensitizing materials.

41

ISO 10993-10:2021 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 10: Tests for skin sensitization states that for
sensitization testing “a positive control does not need to be included in every assay, but may be run at regular
intervals which shall not exceed six months.” The standard further states that “Using a positive control only once
every six months can have consequences for the results obtained in the previous six months period when this
positive control shows a negative outcome.” FDA has not historically recommended that sponsors wait up to six
months for the subsequent positive control data to support submissions to the FDA. Instead, FDA has historically
accepted studies with positive control data conducted within three months of the device test.

26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

The LLNA can be used for testing device materials in aqueous solutions unless
there are unique physicochemical properties associated with these materials (e.g.,
nanomaterials) that may interfere with the ability of the LLNA to detect
sensitizing chemicals. When testing device materials in aqueous solutions, it is
essential to use an appropriate vehicle to maintain the test extract in contact with
the skin (e.g., 1% Pluronic L92)42 so that adequate exposure can be achieved, as
demonstrated by positive control results.

LLNA should not be used in the following circumstance:
·

For devices made from novel materials (i.e., that have not been previously used in
a legally marketed medical device), or “when testing substances that do not
penetrate the skin but are used in devices that contact deep tissues or breached
surfaces” [per ASTM F2148-18, Section 1.2], we recommend the use of the
GPMT test. For novel materials, it is unknown whether chemicals will be able to
penetrate the skin in an LLNA test, so GPMT (which includes intradermal
injection at induction) is recommended.

If LLNA testing is performed, FDA recommends that a fully validated standardized
method be used. Currently, the only FDA-recognized validated method is a radioactive
LLNA test performed in accordance with ASTM F2148 Standard Practice for Evaluation
of Delayed Contact Hypersensitivity Using the Murine Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA).
The following test methods may be used as alternatives. If a nonradioactive LLNA
method, such as the LLNA: 2-Bromodeoxyuridine-Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (BrdU-ELISA) test or the LLNA: Daicel Adenosine Triphosphate (DA) test, is
used, we recommend you also consider the following:
·

For the LLNA: BrdU-ELISA test, the accuracy and reliability supports the use of
the test method to identify device materials as potential skin sensitizers and nonsensitizers using a stimulation index (SI) ≥ 1.6 as the decision criterion to identify
substances as potential sensitizers. For borderline positive responses between an
SI of 1.6 and 1.9, there is a potential for false positive results that could limit the
usefulness of this type of LLNA test.

·

For the LLNA: DA test, the accuracy and reliability support use of the test
method to identify device materials as potential skin sensitizers and nonsensitizers using a stimulation index (SI) ≥ 1.8 as the decision criterion to identify
substances as potential sensitizers. For borderline positive responses between an
SI of 1.8 and 2.5 there is a potential for false positive results that could limit the
usefulness of this type of LLNA test. In addition, the LLNA: DA is not
appropriate for testing device materials that affect ATP levels (e.g., chemicals that
function as ATP inhibitors) or those that affect the accurate measurement of

intracellular ATP (e.g., presence of ATP degrading enzymes, presence of
extracellular ATP in the lymph node).

C.

Hemocompatibility

For devices having direct contact with circulating blood (regardless of contact duration),
we recommend that you consider hemolysis, complement activation, and
thrombogenicity testing, if not otherwise addressed during the risk assessment process.
For devices having indirect contact with circulating blood (regardless of contact
duration), we recommend that you consider only hemolysis testing, as complement
activation and in vivo thrombogenicity testing are generally not needed for indirect bloodcontacting devices. However, for novel materials not previously used in legally marketed
devices with cardiac or vascular applications, or for devices intended to release a
chemical into the circulating blood, some in vitro assessment of thrombogenicity (e.g.,
the effect of extractables and leachables on platelets and the coagulation system) may
also be needed for devices with indirect contact with blood.
Where a risk assessment has determined that hemocompatibility testing is not necessary,
we recommend that you provide a summary of the assessment that supports waiving
these specific tests. For example, to support waiving thrombogenicity testing, the
materials used in formulation and processing, as well as the geometry of the device (e.g.,
shape, dimensions, surface roughness, surface defects), should be compared to a legally
marketed device with similar blood contacting duration and an acceptable history of use
(see Attachment F).
Hemolysis
For hemolysis testing of devices having direct contact with circulating blood, we
recommend that both direct and indirect (extract) methods for material/surface-mediated
hemolysis be conducted per ASTM F756 Standard Practice for Assessment of Hemolytic
Properties of Materials or an equivalent method. For hemolysis testing of devices having
indirect contact with circulating blood, we recommend that only an indirect (extract)
method be conducted per ASTM F756, or an equivalent method. For devices or device
components that do not have direct or indirect contact with circulating blood, this testing
is generally not needed. For example, devices applied to the external surface of a blood
vessel may not need hemolysis testing, unless there is a risk for some components to
access the circulating blood (e.g., hemolysis testing should be performed on sealants
applied to vessel sutures).
For some devices where high shear stress due to blood flow may be an issue, dynamic
hemolysis assessment under clinical use conditions may also be important. See relevant
device-specific guidance documents.43

43

For example, FDA’s guidance document “Implanted Blood Access Devices for Hemodialysis – Guidance for
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/searchfda-guidance-documents/implanted-blood-access-devices-hemodialysis includes information on mechanical
hemolysis testing recommendations for these devices.

28

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Complement Activation
Medical device-mediated complement activation is a complex process and is a function
of physical and chemical properties of the device. Many factors such as device surface
area, surface architecture, and chemical composition (e.g., functional groups)44 may
affect complement activation. If complement activation testing is performed for devices
having direct contact with blood, we recommend that you perform this testing with the
device (i.e., a direct contact study) instead of with an extract of the device. For in vitro
complement activation testing, we recommend assessment of SC5b-9 fragment activation
using an established ELISA test method. Functionally intact serum is preferred for in
vitro “static” complement activation testing.45,46 If whole blood or plasma is used, the
type of anticoagulant should be carefully selected to ensure that it does not inhibit or
potentiate complement activation caused by the test device itself. If whole blood or
plasma is used, test validation information should be provided to confirm that the testing
is capable of detecting differences between negative and positive reference controls. For
data interpretation, the test results are deemed satisfactory if there is no statistically
significant difference between the test article and the negative control. However, if the
differences between the test article and the negative control are statistically significant,
performing complement activation testing using a legally marketed comparator device
may be helpful for data interpretation. This is because there are no established pass/fail
criteria for a clinically acceptable level of complement activation. This comparator data
can therefore be used to assess the biological relevance of the results obtained with the
test device in the in vitro model. Equivalent methods for testing complement activation
such as in vivo animal models, in vitro “static” methods such as ASTM F1984 Standard
Practice for Testing for Whole Complement Activation in Serum by Solid Materials, or in
vitro dynamic testing using simulated clinical flow conditions can be used if
accompanied by appropriate validation information as outlined above. Alternatively, you
can provide a rationale for waiving complement activation testing, if all the materials
used in the formulation and processing of the device have a history of previous use in
blood-contacting devices with comparable or larger surface area and equivalent contact
duration.
Thrombogenicity
In keeping with the Agency’s position on minimizing animal use for device testing, we
recommend that thrombogenicity be assessed as part of a safety or functional study
conducted in a relevant animal model, if such a study is generally conducted for a
particular device type. For example, the safety of cardiovascular stents is commonly
evaluated in an animal model and could include thrombogenicity assessments of the
delivery system and the implanted device. Protocols for studies with thrombogenicity
endpoints should include appropriate methods to assess device-associated thrombus
formation (e.g., photographic evidence) and thromboembolism in relevant downstream

organs. If device thrombus is evident at explantation, or the device is intended for use
upstream from a vital organ, additional histopathological analysis may be helpful to
assess local, upstream, and downstream tissue(s).
When performing in vivo tests, there are many parameters that could affect the results of
the test, including:
·

animal species;

·

positioning of the animal during the operation to simulate clinical positioning;

·

anticoagulation regimen, if applicable;

·

implantation technique to minimize vessel trauma at the implant site;

·

vessel to device diameter ratio, where larger vessels should be used for larger
diameter devices to maintain a diameter relationship similar to what will be seen
in patients, and to avoid artifactual disruption of blood flow and contact with the
vessel wall;

·

device positioning and securement to ensure blood flow around the device; and

·

explantation technique to ensure minimal disruption of adhered thrombus and to
minimize post-mortem clot formation.

When performing in vivo studies, fluoroscopy may be useful to ensure proper device
placement. If only a portion of the device is being utilized for thrombogenicity testing,
the sponsor should confirm that the test article is representative of all materials and
important geometrical/surface features that would have direct contact with the blood. In
addition, we recommend that for all in vivo thrombogenicity assessments, color
photographs of the device/vessel explants be provided.
For some devices such as oxygenators, for which in vivo animal studies are generally not
conducted, a series of in vitro or ex vivo blood damage assessments may be used to
support regulatory submissions. In particular, a battery of in vitro tests to include
assessment of platelets (e.g., adhesion, activation), and the coagulation system [e.g.,
Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex (TAT), Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT)47] may be
used as a substitute for in vivo thrombogenicity testing. For assessment of changes only
to the material, but not to the geometry or surface characteristics of the device, testing in
a “static” environment (e.g., with gentle agitation of the blood in the absence of simulated
clinical flow conditions) may be sufficient. However, for new devices, and/or for changes
to the geometry of an existing device, assessment of flow-mediated thrombosis under
47

This would not be the activated PTT (aPPT) test that is used clinically. As noted in ISO 10993-4:2017 Biological
evaluation of Medical Devices – Part 4: Selection of tests for interaction with blood, the activated PTT (aPTT) test
“is rarely useful in the in vitro evaluation of the thrombogenic properties of blood-contacting devices/materials
because the activating substances mask any activation caused by the device or its component materials.”

30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
simulated clinical flow conditions is recommended. This study design should include the
assessment of platelets, the coagulation system, and macroscopic thrombus formation.
For in vitro tests, the use of human blood is preferred. If blood from multiple donors
cannot be pooled together for use in a single test, we recommend that blood from a
different donor be used for each repeat test to demonstrate that results aren’t impacted by
donor variability. For tests that require large blood volumes, animal blood may be used
with justification. The flow conditions (e.g., gentle agitation versus clinically relevant
flow), and the type and concentration of anticoagulation used for in vitro testing, may
depend on the test system and the clinical indication of the device. We recommend
validation of the test conditions to confirm that the test can differentiate between positive
and negative responses.
In some cases additional thrombogenicity evaluation may be needed, for example, if:
·

your device includes novel materials that have not previously been used in legally
marketed devices with blood-contact, especially if the potential exists for use of
the device in non-anticoagulated patients, or

·

there are questionable or inconclusive hemocompatibility findings from an in vivo
safety study or previously conducted in vitro thrombogenicity studies.

This evaluation might include additional in vitro or in vivo testing, depending on the
specific device type, intended clinical use, and concerns (if any) from prior testing.
In certain instances, an acute (e.g., four to six hours) non-anticoagulated animal study
may be needed, for example:
·

for devices that are not always used with anticoagulation (e.g., diagnostic cardiac
catheters),

·

for patients where anticoagulants cannot be used for clinical reasons (e.g., for
devices intended to treat patients with hemophilia), or

·

when investigating design features intended to reduce the potential for
thrombogenicity (e.g., the effectiveness of a coating).

While non-anticoagulated in vivo studies have limitations, when performed correctly,
they can provide useful information on how synergistic mechanisms (e.g., material and
geometry of the device, arterial versus venous blood flow) influence thrombosis.
If a non-anticoagulated in vivo study results in elevated thrombus scores (i.e., the device
is not thromboresistant), it may be necessary to screen for device-related characteristics,
such as surface defects (e.g., microscopy with at least 40x magnification), that may
contribute to the thrombogenicity. In some cases, a detailed analysis of your device
geometry and surface as compared to a legally marketed device may also be beneficial.
Depending on the level of thrombus seen, the surface analysis results, and the potential
31

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
risk to the patient, we may recommend that you repeat the in vivo study with clinically
relevant levels of anticoagulant to confirm that the anticoagulant will counter the
thrombogenic response seen in the non-anticoagulated model.48 In this case, labeling may
also be needed to contraindicate the use of the device in non-anticoagulated patients.

D.

Pyrogenicity

Implants (due to their contact with the lymphatic system), as well as sterile devices
having direct or indirect contact with the cardiovascular system, the lymphatic system, or
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (regardless of duration of contact) and devices labeled as “nonpyrogenic,” should meet pyrogen limit specifications.49 Pyrogenicity information is used
to help protect patients from the risk of febrile reaction. There are two sources of
pyrogens that should be considered when addressing pyrogenicity. The first, materialmediated pyrogens, are chemicals that can leach from a medical device during device
use.50 Pyrogens from bacterial endotoxins can also produce a febrile reaction similar to
that mediated by some materials.
If recommended for consideration per Attachment A, material-mediated pyrogenicity
testing is not needed if chemical characterization of the device extract and previous
information indicate that all patient-contacting components have been adequately
assessed for pyrogenicity. Otherwise, we recommend that you assess material-mediated
pyrogenicity using traditional biocompatibility extraction methods (e.g., 50 °C for 72
hours; 70 °C for 24 hours; or 121 °C for 1 hour per ISO 10993-12:2021), using a
pyrogenicity test such as the one outlined in USP <151> Pyrogen Test (USP Rabbit Test)
or an equivalent validated method. For devices that contain heat labile or heat sensitive
materials (e.g., drugs, biomolecules, tissue-derived components), which may have the
potential to undergo deformation or material configuration/structural change at high
temperature, extraction at 37 °C per ISO 10993-12:2021 is recommended.

48

Historically, some have proposed the use of anticoagulant in a four hour canine in vivo thrombogenicity study to
support regulatory submissions. Anticoagulant use in this type of study may significantly affect the ability of the
study to provide informative data regarding the thrombogenic potential of a device. Therefore, data from this type of
study is generally only useful for comparative purposes (i.e., to determine if clinically relevant anticoagulation will
counter any thrombogenic effects seen in non-anticoagulated studies).
49
Refer to FDA’s “Guidance for Industry – Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers” (June 2012)
for information on pyrogen limit specifications.
50
Even over a relatively short duration of use, chemical pyrogens can be released within the body and initiate a
febrile reaction.

32

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Bacterial pyrogens51 are traditionally addressed as part of the sterility assessment. We
recommend that you refer to the most recent sterility guidance document52 for
recommendations related to testing to determine endotoxin levels for sterile devices.53
If a sponsor would like to label their device “non-pyrogenic” even if there are no
endotoxin limit specifications based on the nature of body contact, we recommend that
both the bacterial endotoxin and rabbit material-mediated pyrogen testing be conducted.

E.

Implantation

For implantation testing, if there are characteristics of the device geometry that may
confound interpretation of this test, it may be acceptable to use device sub-components or
coupons instead of the device in its final finished form, with appropriate justification. For
example, it may be acceptable to use a coupon instead of a stent, if information is provided
to demonstrate that the manufacturing and resulting surface properties are comparable.
Instead of a traditional toxicology implantation study in subcutaneous, muscle, or bone
tissues, a clinically relevant (e.g., brain, vascular) implantation assessment may be more
appropriate for certain implant devices with relatively high safety risks, as described in
ISO 10993-6 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 6: Tests for local effects
after implantation. Clinically relevant implantation54 studies are critical to determine the
systemic and local tissue responses to the implant in a relevant anatomical environment
under simulated clinical conditions.55 In some cases, the toxicity outcomes that would be
obtained from a clinically relevant implantation study can be assessed as part of in vivo
animal studies that are performed to assess overall device safety (e.g., the protocol for an
animal study to evaluate delivery and deployment of a device may also include
assessment of relevant toxicity endpoints).
51

This section of the guidance is addressing only the potential issues with febrile reactions, but bacterial endotoxins
can also lead to inflammation (e.g., swelling, pain).

Clinically relevant implantation and muscle or subcutaneous implantation tests may be
informative to the overall biocompatibility assessment of both the material components
of the device and the device in its final finished form when used in its intended
anatomical location. Muscle or subcutaneous implantation tests often are not needed
when clinically relevant implantation studies are conducted. However, the muscle or
subcutaneous implantation study may be helpful as a screening test to assess local
toxicities. For example, because the muscle implants tend to form a fibrous capsule
around the implant, any materials eluted over time from the test article may be contained
within the capsule, and therefore may result in an exaggerated response not observed in
the site-specific implantation study. In addition, a well-defined muscle implantation study
is often helpful to interpret the data from clinically relevant implantation studies that may
include other confounding factors (e.g., concomitant treatments may interfere with tissue
response). Therefore, muscle implantation studies should be considered as a supplemental
test even when clinically relevant implantation studies are performed, especially when
new materials/chemicals are used in a medical device or the results of a clinically
relevant implantation study raise toxicity concerns.
For implantation testing of devices with materials that are intended to degrade, we
recommend that tests include interim assessments to determine the tissue response during
degradation (i.e., when there is minimal or no degradation, if applicable; during
degradation to demonstrate a pattern of progressive degradation; and once a steady state
has been reached with respect to material degradation and tissue response). Selection of
interim assessment time points may be based on in vitro degradation testing.

F.

Genotoxicity

Genotoxicity testing may not be needed if chemical characterization of device extracts
and literature references indicate that all components have been adequately tested for
genotoxicity.
Genotoxicity testing may not be informative for devices containing materials already
known to be genotoxic, because a positive result will be assumed to be due to the known
genotoxin. Thus, a second genotoxin from another source may be overlooked. If
genotoxicity testing is performed, a negative result should be interpreted as a negative for
the other device components or interaction products, but does not necessarily negate the
risk of the known genotoxin. Chemical characterization may be needed to demonstrate to
what extent the genotoxin is released from the device. For known genotoxins, the overall
benefit-risk determination will depend on the device indication and human exposure.
Genotoxicity testing is requested when the genotoxicity profile has not been adequately
established. As described in Attachment A, CDRH and CBER traditionally requests
genotoxicity information for some devices with prolonged contact (> 24 hours to 30
days) or long term contact (> 30 days) with blood, bone, mucosa or other tissue, or any
materials that have not previously been used in legally marketed medical device
applications regardless of the duration of use.
34

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Genotoxicity evaluations are also requested for all devices used in extracorporeal bloodcontacting circuits, even if the contact is less than 24 hours, genotoxicity evaluations are
recommended because of the high surface area, the associated increased potential for
chemical leaching, and introduction of any leachables into the systemic circulation. If
these devices include leachables with an unknown genotoxicity profile (i.e., no
toxicology information in the literature), some additional genotoxicity information may
be necessary.
Because no single test can detect all genotoxins, we recommend the following two in
vitro tests be conducted, as well as an optional third in vivo test:56
·

Bacterial gene mutation assay. This test is conducted with engineered strains of
Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli designed to detect all possible
single base pair changes as well as frameshift mutations (OECD 471 Guidelines
for Testing of Chemicals – Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test).

·

An in vitro mammalian genotoxicity assay. A choice of one of the following is
recommended:
a) the mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay (OECD 490 Guidelines for the
Testing of Chemicals – In Vitro Mammalian Cell Gene Mutation Tests using
the Thymidine Kinase Gene), which is preferred since it detects the broadest
set of genotoxic mechanisms associated with carcinogenic activity;57
b) an in vitro chromosomal aberration (CA) assay (OECD 473 Guidelines for the
Testing of Chemicals – In Vitro Mammalian Chromosome Aberration Test); or
c) an in vitro micronucleus assay (OECD 487 Guidelines for the Testing of
Chemicals – In Vitro Mammalian Cell Micronucleus Test).

·

An in vivo cytogenetics assay should be considered, for example, for devices
containing novel materials. However, if the quantities of materials in the test
extract following exhaustive extraction of the devices are below the threshold of
detection of the in vivo assay, the test does not need to be performed.
When an in vivo assay is needed, a choice of one of the following is
recommended:
a) a bone marrow micronucleus (MN) Assay (OECD 474 Guidelines for the
Testing of Chemicals – Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Test); or

56

All of the OECD guidelines referenced in this section are incorporated by reference in ISO 10993-3 Biological
evaluation of medical devices – Part 3: Tests for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity, which is
FDA-recognized.

b) a bone marrow chromosomal aberration (CA) assay (OECD 475 Guidelines
for the Testing of Chemicals – Mammalian Bone Marrow Chromosome
Aberration Test); or
c) a peripheral blood MN assay (OECD 474 Guidelines for the Testing of
Chemicals – Mammalian Erythrocyte Micronucleus Test).
Since the different genotoxicity assays detect different types of genotoxicity, a positive in
any assay is considered a positive result. In the event of an equivocal result in any of the
in vitro assays, the same assay should be repeated. In the event of a positive result, we
recommend further investigation to identify the source of the genotoxin. We recommend
this information be used to help evaluate the overall benefit-risk of the device using a
toxicological risk assessment with respect to carcinogenicity, as described in Section
VI.G, below. An in vivo genotoxicity assay is not recommended as a follow-up to rule out
a positive in an in vitro assay because the amount of the chemicals in a device extract
may be below the limit of detection of the in vivo assay.
All assays should be performed on undiluted extracts only, unless cytotoxicity is shown
to interfere with the performance of the test. For the in vitro mammalian cell-based
assays, we recommend that cytotoxicity be evaluated using a quantitative method (i.e.,
not confluence estimations).
For combination products that include a drug, if genotoxicity data are not available from
the literature, the drug should be tested separately in a dose-response study (not as an
extract). In addition, the final combination product should be evaluated by standard
extraction methods. If the device is tested without the drug, additional chemical
characterization information should be provided to confirm that final manufacturing of
the device with the drug does not introduce any new chemical moieties that could be
potential genotoxins. For combination products that include a biologic, the need for
genotoxicity evaluation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

G.

Carcinogenicity

As described in Attachment A, FDA recommends that carcinogenicity potential be
evaluated (usually via a risk assessment) for devices with long term contact (i.e., greater
than 30 day exposure). This includes devices in contact with breached or compromised
surfaces (i.e., wound healing), as well as externally communicating and implanted
devices. If novel materials (i.e., not previously used in a legally marketed device) are
used to manufacture devices in contact with breached or compromised surfaces,
externally communicating devices, or implant devices, we also recommend a review of
the carcinogenicity literature. In the absence of experimentally derived carcinogenicity
information, structure activity relationship (SAR) modeling for these materials may be
needed regardless of the duration of contact, to better understand the carcinogenicity

36

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
potential for these materials.58 Because there are carcinogens that are not genotoxins59
and carcinogenesis is multifactorial, the assessment of carcinogenicity should not rely
solely on genotoxicity information. Therefore, the following elements should be
considered in conjunction with genotoxicity information to evaluate carcinogenic risk of
the medical device in its final finished form:
·

Include the complete chemical formulations and manufacturing residuals for all
components of the device with the potential for tissue contact. For device
materials or components that are provided by third-party suppliers where the
chemical formula is proprietary, sponsors should request that suppliers use master
files to provide chemical formulation information to the FDA. Refer to
Attachment B for details regarding the chemical formulation information that
would be helpful to a carcinogenicity evaluation.

·

Quantify the total amount of extractables and leachables using analytical
chemistry methods with an appropriate sensitivity (i.e., ppm or ppb). The elution
methods and analytical techniques should be designed to evaluate the presence of
device materials, any breakdown products, chemical interaction products, or
processing agents (e.g., adhesives, mold cleaning agents, mold releasing agents,
sterilization chemicals, etc.). The TTC approach can be used to determine if
quantification without chemical identification is sufficient to assess the toxicity
risk of the device.60 Otherwise, chemical identification is needed.

·

Evaluate how much of each chemical would be present in an individual worstcase patient exposure situation. For this assessment, one would assume the patient
is exposed to 100% of the chemical in the device or 100% of the byproduct that
could be generated from the device. Alternatively, a worst-case scenario could be
justified based on exhaustive extraction data from chemical characterization. As a
part of this assessment, consider the situation where a patient might receive
multiple devices of the largest device size to calculate the estimated worst-case
patient exposure. An exposure assessment should also address the following: any
intermediate degradation chemicals, route-to-route extrapolation of dose, and
local versus systemic exposure potential.

·

Evaluate the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity potential of the chemicals,
including:

findings in animal studies),
o the relevance of animal data to assess risks in humans, and
o assessment of human data from epidemiological studies if available or any
other relevant long-term clinical study findings, including susceptible
population and life stages, and device implant site and propensity of the
site to develop local tumors.61,62
·

If potential carcinogens [e.g., International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) monograph chemicals]63 are identified in the device, a cancer risk
assessment should also be provided with literature evidence to demonstrate that
the amount of the potential carcinogen(s) available in a device does not pose an
unacceptable carcinogenic risk.64

If carcinogenicity testing is warranted (e.g., when data are not available to provide an
adequate assessment or when an assessment indicates that there is a probable risk),
consider use of transgenic animal models (e.g., RasH2), with confirmation of stability of
transgene status, or other validated models.
Prior to conducting carcinogenicity testing, the sponsor is advised to discuss proposed
testing with FDA to ensure that the study design is appropriate to assess the probable
carcinogenic risks using a statistically-based sample size, with documentation of the
statistical power.

H.

Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity

FDA recommends that reproductive and developmental toxicity be assessed to evaluate
the potential effects of medical devices, materials and/or their extracts on reproductive
function, embryonic development (teratogenicity), and prenatal and early postnatal
development as described in ISO 10993-1. If the biocompatibility evaluation identifies a
known or a potential reproductive or developmental toxicity risk, and/or there is
inadequate reproductive and developmental toxicity information in the literature to
address the risk, testing and/or labeling mitigations will most likely be necessary. Some
examples include:

·

novel implant materials if there is a potential for chemical leachables to contact
reproductive organs, regardless of the type or duration of contact, and

·

device materials or components in contact with reproductive organs.

Testing in animals of reproductive age should also be considered, if device materials may
be systemically distributed (e.g., absorbable devices), and reproductive and
developmental toxicity literature is not available.

I.

Degradation Assessments

FDA recommends that in vivo degradation assessments be conducted in an appropriate
animal model if the device is designed to be absorbable. As described in ISO 10993-1,
parameters that affect the rate and extent of degradation should be described and
documented. Sponsors should report the rate of degradation based upon physiologicallyrelevant data and the biological response to the degrading device. If an adverse biological
response is observed, additional in vitro assessments are recommended to identify the
source of the toxicity, such as potential chemicals of concern. Some additional testing
(e.g., degradation testing and/or chemical characterization testing) on the medical device
in its final finished form may be necessary. FDA recommends that prior to conducting in
vivo degradation or chemical characterization testing, the sponsor discuss proposed
testing with FDA to ensure that the design of the proposed testing is appropriate to assess
the potential risks to the patient, such as toxicological risks and loss of mechanical
properties. Protocols and test reports (see Attachment E for recommended elements to
include in a test report) from characterization of degradation products should be provided
in the submission.

VII. Chemical Assessment
FDA evaluates the safety of medical devices based on duration of exposure and nature of
contact. Inherent in the review of medical devices is an understanding of the body’s entire
exposure to the medical device, including all chemical entities contained within the device. For
devices where the patient-contacting portions may contain potentially toxic chemicals, the
evaluation of safety should include both chemical risk (i.e., the level of toxicological concern)
and the type and duration of exposure.
FDA may request that additional chemistry information be provided in the following situations:
·

For devices made from novel materials never before used in a legally marketed medical
device, toxicology information (i.e., data from the literature, additional biocompatibility
testing of the final device, or toxicity testing of the chemicals of concern) may be
necessary so a complete toxicity assessment of the new materials can be conducted. This
toxicity assessment may not necessarily be limited to those endpoints identified by ISO
10993-1 for a specific type and duration of contact. To more fully evaluate novel
materials, which may raise unique toxicological concerns, FDA will typically request
additional toxicology information as described in ISO 10993-1, to more fully understand
39

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the toxicological risks of materials that are novel and to ensure the safety of such
materials when used in medical devices.
·

For submissions proposing the use of new chemicals to modify the material formulation
or device manufacturing (e.g., surfactants, antioxidants, plasticizers),65 toxicology
information (i.e., purity and impurity information, data from the literature, or additional
toxicity testing on the chemical(s) of concern) may be necessary to address the endpoints
identified by ISO 10993-1 for the relevant type and duration of contact.

·

For some devices including chemicals with known toxicities (e.g., drugs or biologics
used in combination products),66 it may not be possible to mitigate the toxicological risks
with traditional biocompatibility testing conducted on the medical device in its final
finished form. For example, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and developmental toxicity
endpoints may be better assessed through chemical characterization and a review of the
literature. Therefore, in these particular situations, data from chemical characterization
and toxicology information from the literature may be necessary to support the risk
assessment.

·

For some devices manufactured from materials that change over time (e.g., combination
products, or in situ absorbable or degradable materials), it may not be appropriate to only
use the biocompatibility information from the as-manufactured device to predict the
toxicity of the device over its implant life. Therefore, data from chemical characterization
and toxicology information from the literature may be necessary to support the risk
assessment.

·

For some devices where an unexpected finding is observed in a biocompatibility study,
additional chemical characterization and toxicology information from the literature may
be necessary to determine the cause of the toxicity, and whether additional mitigations
are needed to reduce the risk.

·

For devices using materials where a “long history of safe use” rationale would not be
sufficient to understand the effect of formulation additives and manufacturing methods
and conditions on the biocompatibility of the medical device in its final finished form,
additional chemical characterization and toxicology information from the literature may
be necessary to support the risk assessment.

When additional device or device component chemical information is needed, the following
descriptive information should be provided:

65

Per requirements under purchasing controls (21 CFR 820.50), if a new material supplier is being considered,
comparative chemical characterization can be used with incoming material or component specifications to confirm
whether there are additional types or quantities of impurities in the new material or component that could impact
biocompatibility such that additional testing may be needed, or if it is sufficient to document the change in the
Device Master Record because testing was determined to be unnecessary.
66
The amount of information available, within the submission or by reference to a device or drug master file, new
drug application (NDA), or biologic licensing agreement (BLA), may impact how much additional information on
the chemical constituents is needed to fully assess the level of toxicological concern.

40

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
1. The identity of the chemical by common name, chemical name, Chemical Abstract
Services (CAS) number, and trade name.
2. If known,67 the composition, formula and formula weight, structural information, and
manufacturing and purity information for the chemical, such as a detailed description of
the manufacturing process (including the substances used, the amounts used in the
synthesis, and reaction conditions), specifications for the chemical, analysis of multiple
batches of the chemical, and identification of major impurities.
3. The specific amount of each chemical in the formulation by weight percent of the
applicable device component and total amount (e.g., µg) in the device. If this information
is not available (e.g., from a material supplier), it would be acceptable to use a worst-case
estimation approach for the risk assessment. For example, one might assume 100% of the
material (e.g., resin pellet) used in the final device formulation is the chemical of concern
(i.e., any chemical components of the supplied material).
4. The identity of any other devices marketed in the US (by device name, manufacturer, and
submission number) where the chemical entity with direct or indirect tissue contact has
been previously used, if known, and comparative information on the composition and
amount(s) used. This information is generally available only for components made by the
same manufacturer.
If information on identity and quantity of component chemicals cannot be obtained (e.g., from a
material supplier), chemical characterization of device extracts generated using polar (e.g., water,
physiological 0.9% saline), semi-polar (e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, alcohol/water) and
non-polar (e.g., hexane) solvents may be sufficient to support the biocompatibility evaluation of
the device. Choice of solvents will depend on device materials and should be justified. For
example, physiological 0.9% saline should be used for the polar extraction of devices with metal
components to optimize ion release. In addition, extraction conditions (i.e., solvent, temperature,
and duration) should not compromise device integrity.
In addition, to evaluate the patient exposure to the device or device component chemical(s), the
following exposure information should be provided:
5. An exposure assessment for each chemical (including any related impurities) to which the
patient has direct or indirect contact. If repeat dosing is possible or probable, this should
be considered in the patient exposure calculation. This includes chemicals that can
migrate from the surface or bulk of the device. If testing is needed to assess if chemicals
migrate from the device, this testing can be conducted using the chemical
characterization testing methods described above for elution. For this testing, provide the
test report, including details of the test conditions, to confirm that the chemical is stable
under the intended conditions of use. As discussed in the risk assessment section,
descriptive information may also be sufficient in lieu of any new testing.
67

The amount of information available, within the submission or by reference to a device or drug master file, may
impact how much additional information on the chemical constituents is needed to fully assess the level of
toxicological concern.

41

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

If the information above confirms that there are no toxicity concerns for the device or device
component chemical(s), either because the chemical is physically sequestered in a device
component with no direct or indirect tissue contact, or based on the results of testing conducted
as described in #5 above, no further information is necessary.
If the information above suggests that there is patient exposure to the device or device
component chemical, the following toxicological information should be provided:
6. A safety assessment for each chemical entity using toxicity information from the
literature and any available, unpublished data that the sponsor may have generated for all
known toxic effects. Where the full toxicology profile for the chemical entity is not
available, either in the literature, from the supplier, and/or from a previous medical
device submission, a complete battery of toxicity tests on the chemical entity (i.e., tests in
addition to those outlined in Attachment A, including but not limited to genotoxicity,
reproductive and developmental toxicity, and carcinogenicity) may also be needed unless
a scientific rationale is provided to explain why these additional tests are not needed. For
example, if extractables and/or leachables data demonstrates exposure will be below the
derived tolerable intake (TI) for a particular chemical, or the TTC (if a TI cannot be
derived), then further toxicological assessment is unnecessary for the evaluation of some
biological endpoints (e.g., systemic toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity).
The level of toxicological concern should be based on patient exposure to the chemical entity
and the available toxicological data. One approach to this assessment is to consider the total
patient exposure of the device or device component chemical in relation to the amount at which
toxicities are known or probably exist.
If available toxicity information suggests that even if all of the chemical(s) were released, no
toxicity concern would exist with this level of exposure (i.e., the amount is well below the
amount at which toxicity concerns are present), no further information is necessary.
However, if potential toxicity concerns exist if all of the chemical(s) are released, further
information will generally be needed to determine how much of the chemical(s) are released, as
well as the fate of the chemical(s) within the body. Specifically, the following information
should be provided:
7. Data to demonstrate the amount of chemical(s) to which the patient may be exposed (e.g.,
amount released) through 30 days (or worst-case exposure that might be reasonably
encountered in clinical use plus a safety margin).
8. If data indicate that the patient will be exposed to the chemical(s) (e.g., through elution),
assessment(s) of the fate of the chemical(s) from the device in a clinically relevant animal
model may be necessary to assess the timing of elimination and to perform
pharmacokinetic analyses (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
(ADME)). We recommend that a sponsor consider relevant device-specific guidance
documents, if available, or contact the review division to discuss the appropriate animal
model in these circumstances.

VIII.

Labeling68 Devices as “­Free”

FDA notes that to communicate with users regarding potential allergenic or toxic compounds,
some sponsors have requested to include statements in the device labeling such as “latex-free,”
“DEHP-free,” “BPA-free,” or “pyrogen-free.” It may not be possible with current test methods to
reliably assure that there is an absence of the allergen or toxic compound in the medical device at
levels that could produce an adverse event in highly sensitive individuals. Use of such terms may
give users a false sense of security when using a medical device. If a sponsor elects to include a
statement in medical device labeling indicating that a specific material was not used in the
manufacture of their medical device or medical device container, FDA recommends the use of a
statement such as “Not made with natural rubber latex” or “Not made with BPA” based on a
material certification to indicate that natural rubber latex or BPA is not used in the device or
device component. If this statement is made without any qualification, it should apply to the
entire device and all of its packaging. A sponsor can also elect to make a statement that certain
components of the medical device or device container are not made with the material of concern.
For example, “The <vial stopper> is not made with natural rubber latex.”69
If a sponsor elects to include a “-free” statement, in their labeling, at the time of submission,
FDA recommends that the sponsor provide data to support that the device does not include the
material at a level that could result in an adverse event (e.g., allergic reaction or toxicity).

68

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with the requirements of
21 CFR Parts 801, and if applicable, 809 before a medical device is introduced into interstate commerce. In addition,
please be aware of the implications of 21 CFR 801.109 for final labeling for prescription devices.

Attachment A: Evaluation Endpoints for Consideration
The following is a framework for the development of a biocompatibility evaluation and is not a
checklist for testing. For particular medical devices, different biological endpoints may warrant
evaluation, including either additional or fewer endpoints than indicated. If it is unclear in which
category a device falls, we recommend consulting device-specific guidances or contacting the
appropriate Center and review division for more information.70 For example, FDA has
historically considered devices used to drain fluids (such as Foley catheters) as externally
communicating devices rather than as surface devices contacting mucosal membranes.

Note * All X’s and O’s should be addressed in the biological safety evaluation, either through the use of existing
data, additional endpoint-specific testing, or a rationale for why the endpoint does not warrant additional assessment.
Note + Tissue includes tissue fluids and subcutaneous spaces
Note ^ For all devices used in extracorporeal blood-contacting circuits
Note # Reproductive and developmental toxicity should be addressed for novel materials, materials with a known
reproductive or developmental toxicity, devices with relevant target populations (e.g., pregnant women), and/or
devices where there is the probability for local presence of device materials in the reproductive organs.
Note @ Degradation information should be provided for any devices, device components, or materials remaining in
contact with tissue that are intended to degrade.

ISO 10993-1:2018, Table A.1 includes separate columns for subacute and subchronic toxicity
endpoints. FDA recommends that if a subacute or subchronic test is conducted to evaluate these
endpoints, the choice of test be based on the duration of the test as it compares to the duration of
device use. For example, devices used for greater than 14 days should not be assessed using a 14
day test.
Sponsors are advised to consider conducting a separate evaluation to assess chemical
components of device materials that may be pyrogenic. This type of material-mediated
pyrogenicity is identified as a subset of acute systemic toxicity in ISO 10993-1:2018. However,
it may not be appropriate to use data from an acute systemic toxicity or implantation study in
place of a separate pyrogenicity evaluation if the study did not include periodic temperature
measurements (e.g., every 30 minutes for the first three hours) or was not conducted in an
appropriate animal model (i.e., rabbit). See also Section VI.D for more information about
assessment of pyrogenicity.

Attachment E: Contents of a Test Report
Whenever biocompatibility or chemical characterization testing information is included in a
submission, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed
unless testing is conducted under the ASCA program and it is determined that an ASCA
Summary Test Report is sufficient or a declaration of conformity without supplemental
information can be appropriately provided. 72,73 Test reports for GLP studies must address the
reporting requirements of 21 CFR 58 and all test reports (for both GLP and non-GLP studies)
should also include the sections described below. Test reports should address the reporting
provisions of any referenced standards, as well as the information outlined below.
Test Article Preparation
As described in Section V.A above, the test report should identify the test specimen; if the test
article is not the medical device in its final finished form, a justification for the test article used
should be provided either in the test report or in the submission to FDA. If the test uses extracts,
the report should explain how those extracts were prepared, and indicate the appearance of the
extract (color, cloudy versus clear, and presence of particulates).
Test Method
The test report should provide a summary of the method used. If the method used is not in a
published guidance document or FDA-recognized standard, a complete description of the method
should be provided. If the test method is a modified version of a method in a published guidance
document or FDA-recognized standard, the test report should include an explanation of the
differences and their potential impact on the interpretation of the results.
The test report should identify any protocol deviations and their impact on the conclusions drawn
from the test.
Test Parameters and Acceptance Criteria
The test report should identify the test parameters and acceptance criteria applied. If the test
method is not in accordance with a published guidance document or FDA-recognized standard
72

Refer to FDA’s “Biocompatibility Testing of Medical Devices – Standards Specific Information for the
Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot Program” available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/biocompatibility-testing-medicaldevices-standards-specific-information-accreditation-scheme for information regarding ASCA biocompatibility
summary test reports.
73
The ISO 10993 series of standards do not specify either a method or test outcome, because these standards are
both compendia and guidance. As such, these standards allow one to select different tests and methods, and do not
necessarily include acceptance criteria. Therefore, to support a declaration of conformity and for FDA to assess
conformance, for any tests selected under the ISO 10993 paradigm, the rationale for the test battery selected and the
criteria used to determine acceptance should be provided. It has been FDA’s experience that test reports often
address this, and raw data is usually not necessary. There may be other testing for which a declaration of conformity
can be submitted to FDA without supplemental information. Refer to FDA’s “Appropriate Use of Voluntary
Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/appropriate-use-voluntary-consensus-standards-premarketsubmissions-medical-devices for more information on when to provide supplemental documentation.

that includes defined acceptance criteria, a rationale for the acceptance criteria should be
provided.
Analysis of Results
The test report should provide a summary of the test results and include tables with each data
point and statistical analyses, where appropriate. For example, the test report for hemolysis
testing per ASTM F756 should include a description of the test, blank, positive, and negative
supernatant conditions, in addition to the absorbance and percent hemolysis data.
For any test in which the results indicate a potential toxicity, the report should include a
discussion of any test-specific issues that might have affected results.
Conclusions
The test report should describe the conclusions drawn from the test results. The clinical
relevance of the study conclusions should be described in the test report or in the submission to
FDA.

Attachment F: Component and Device Documentation
Examples
The examples below are provided to illustrate one possible approach to documentation of how a
test article compares to the proposed medical device in its final finished form; other approaches
may also be acceptable. Manufacturers are encouraged to use an approach that works for their
specific purposes, taking into account how any changes might impact the biocompatibility of the
device. Note that these are generalized examples to demonstrate documentation and do not
necessarily account for every possible consideration.

A. Component Documentation
For each component and any joining processes/materials (e.g., adhesives, sintering processes),
either of the following statements can be provided:
Comparison to test article: "The [polymer/metal/ceramic/composite name] [component
name] of the test article is identical to the [component name] of the medical device in its
final finished form in formulation, processing, sterilization, and geometry, and no other
chemicals have been added (e.g., plasticizers, fillers, additives, cleaning agents, mold release
agents)."
Comparison to previously marketed device: "The [polymer/metal/ceramic/composite
name] [component name] of the medical device in its final finished form is identical to the
[component name] of the [name] (legally marketed device)74 in formulation, processing,
sterilization, and geometry, and no other chemicals have been added (e.g., plasticizers, fillers,
additives, cleaning agents, mold release agents)."

B. Device Documentation
If the above statement is true for all of the device component material formulations, processes,
and sterilization methods (if applicable) in the device, either of the following general statements
can be provided:
Comparison to test article: "The test article is identical to the medical device in its final
finished form in formulation, processing, sterilization, and geometry and no other chemicals
have been added (e.g., plasticizers, fillers, additives, cleaning agents, mold release agents)."
Comparison to previously marketed device: "The medical device in its final finished form
is identical to [name] (previously marketed device) in formulation, processing, sterilization,
and geometry and no other chemicals have been added (e.g., plasticizers, fillers, additives,
cleaning agents, mold release agents)."

74

We recommend that you include the submission number and date where the legally marketed device was given
marketing authorization.

C. New Processing/Sterilization Changes
If there are any processing or sterilization changes that the sponsor believes will not alter the
biocompatibility of the medical device in its final finished form, the sponsor should use the
component documentation language and include either of the following qualifiers:
Comparison to test article: "…with the exception of [identify change]. FDA submission
exhibit [#], page [#], submitted on [date], provides scientific information to demonstrate that
the [processing/sterilization] change does not alter the chemical or physical properties of the
medical device in its final finished form, and therefore, results from the test article can be
applied to the medical device in its final finished form.”
Comparison to previously marketed device: "…with the exception of [identify change].
FDA submission exhibit [#], page [#], submitted on [date], provides scientific information to
demonstrate that the [processing/sterilization] change does not alter the chemical or
physical properties of the medical device in its final finished form, and therefore, results from
the [name] (legally marketed device) can be applied to the medical device in its final
finished form.”
NOTE: The information provided to support a claim that processing and sterilization changes
will not affect chemical or physical properties of the medical device in its final finished form
should be provided in sufficient detail for FDA to make an independent assessment during
our review and arrive at the same conclusion.
NOTE: Changes in raw material suppliers or raw material specifications could introduce
different types or quantities of residual chemicals and could result in a toxic response (even if
the base material has a long history of safe use in similar applications).75
NOTE: The impact of surface alterations due to processing, even at the micron or submicron
level, should be evaluated when there is a reasonable possibility that they could result in
geometrical or chemical changes at the surface which, in turn, could result in an adverse
biological response (even if the base material has a long history of safe use in similar
applications).

D. Formulation Changes
If there are any formulation changes the sponsor believes will not alter the biocompatibility of
the medical device in its final finished form, the sponsor should use the component
documentation language and include the following qualifier:
Comparison to test article: "…with the exception of [identify change]. FDA submission
exhibit [#], page [#], submitted on [date], provides scientific information to demonstrate that
75

In some cases, chemical characterization at the raw material level may be sufficient to show comparability and to
justify not conducting device level testing. However, some resin changes may result in changes to physical
properties and/or surface characteristics of the medical device in its final finished form that could affect the
biological response.

55

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the formulation change does not alter the chemical or physical properties of the medical
device in its final finished form, and therefore, results from the test article can be applied to
the proposed medical device in its final finished form.”
Comparison to previously marketed device: "…with the exception of [identify change].
FDA submission exhibit [#], page [#], submitted on [date], provides scientific information to
demonstrate that the formulation change does not alter the chemical or physical properties of
the medical device in its final finished form, and therefore, results from the [name] (legally
marketed device) can be applied to the medical device in its final finished form.”
For example, if your legally marketed comparator device contains a PEBAX® resin, and your
subject device contains a different grade of PEBAX®, your documentation should include a
qualifier that states that the untested PEBAX® grade varies only in the concentration of
specific formulation components. Formulation changes that introduce novel components, or a
higher concentration of an existing component, may warrant a new risk assessment or new
testing if the upper and lower bounds of each component have not been previously evaluated.
NOTE: The information provided to support a claim that formulation changes will not affect
chemical or physical properties of the medical device in its final finished form should be
provided in sufficient detail for FDA to make an independent assessment during our review
and arrive at the same conclusion. To support this assessment, FDA requests that the
following be discussed:
a. formulation of the test article and possible impurities or leachable chemicals;
b. formulation of the medical device in its final finished form and possible impurities or
leachable chemicals; and
c. a discussion of why the differences would not necessitate additional testing.

Attachment G: Biocompatibility of Certain Devices in
Contact with Intact Skin
Many devices have intact skin contacting materials that are made from synthetic polymers and
natural fabrics. FDA believes that these materials pose a very low biocompatibility risk because
they have a long history of safe use in legally marketed medical devices that contact intact skin.
The policy outlined in this Attachment describes a least burdensome76 approach for these devices
that recommends specific material information to be included in a premarket submission in lieu
of biocompatibility testing. This approach also supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to replace,
reduce, and/or refine animal use in testing when feasible.77 This approach is partially based on
FDA’s review experience in premarket submissions with these common synthetic polymers and
natural fabrics. This approach also relies on certain parts of the Quality System Regulation (QS
Regulation, 21 CFR 820) and other postmarket controls78 to identify potential biocompatibilityrelated issues.
For example, quality system and other postmarket controls have requirements that should
identify biocompatibility issues for devices in contact with intact skin if procedures established
and maintained, and records maintained in the Device Master Record79, by the manufacturer
include sufficient:
·

Purchasing controls (21 CFR 820.50) over material suppliers,

·

Production and process controls for manufacturing (21 CFR 820.70). Manufacturing
materials that could adversely affect device biocompatibility should be removed or
limited to an amount that does not pose toxicity concerns,

·

Receiving, in-process, and finished device acceptance (21 CFR 820.80) for component
and manufacturing materials,

·

Analysis of quality data (21 CFR 820.100(a)(1)), including complaints, to detect quality
problems, such as those that may reveal issues of cytotoxicity, irritation, or sensitization.
FDA recommends that such an analysis occurs routinely (at least annually), and

·

Complaints (21 CFR 820.198) should be received, reviewed, evaluated, and, when
necessary, investigated.80 We recommend that manufacturers process complaints in a
uniform and timely manner to look for issues related to cytotoxicity, irritation, or
sensitization. Indications of these issues may include:

FDA intends to periodically reassess the list of device materials and exclusion characteristics
identified in Section B and Section C of this Attachment. FDA recommends that external
stakeholders submit comments to the docket to suggest the addition or removal of device
materials or exclusion characteristics from the policy outlined in this Attachment, including a
rationale. We also recommend the following information be included when suggesting the
addition of a material: (1) the generic chemical name, (2) identification of the FDA medical
device product code(s) where the material is commonly used with intact skin, and (3) a specific
rationale for why the proposed material(s) pose a low biocompatibility risk for intact skin. FDA
intends to review comments received in the docket and periodically assess whether any changes
to this policy are warranted. When FDA believes changes are warranted, FDA will issue updated
guidance in accordance with the procedures in the Good Guidance Practices Regulation (21 CFR
10.115).

A. Which Types of Devices are Included?
Devices included in the policy outlined in this Attachment should meet all of the following
characteristics:
·

Medical devices or components that contact intact skin surfaces only, as described in
section 5.2.2 (a) of ISO 10993-1:2018: Biological evaluation of medical devices –
Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process,

·

Limited (≤24 hour), prolonged (>24 hours to 30 days), and long term (>30 days)
durations of contact, including repeat use devices, and

·

Composed of materials outlined in Section B below.

FDA recommends additional discussion through the Q-Submission process81 to determine if the
policy outlined in this Attachment could be applicable to specific products in the following
situations:
·

If a legally marketed device made from the same material was found to be toxic in
previous testing. For example, if a rationale was used to support a previous premarket
submission where the material was found to be toxic in a biocompatibility test, additional
information (e.g., data or rationale) may be needed for the subject device;

81

Submissions: The Q-Submission Program” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fdaguidance-documents/requests-feedback-and-meetings-medical-device-submissions-q-submission-program

58

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

If a legally marketed device made from the same material resulted in adverse clinical
findings (e.g., redness (erythema), swelling (edema), allergy, and immune response or
other reactions on the skin where the device has contact) after marketing that may be
related to cytotoxicity, irritation, or sensitization;

·

If the proposed device is indicated for use with neonates. Neonatal skin and the skin of
infants with low birthweight is more permeable, and therefore the risk that leachables
may permeate the skin is higher;82,83

·

If the proposed device is indicated for use in pregnant women. Physiological alterations
during pregnancy may lead to higher “unsafe” levels of toxicants that would otherwise be
deemed “safe” in a non-pregnant woman. In addition, if chemicals absorb through the
skin, they may be transferred from a pregnant woman to her fetus; or

·

If it is a device-led combination product,84 or a device comprised of biologically-derived
material (e.g., tissues derived from animal or plant material).85 Such products can cause
adverse biological responses (e.g., cytotoxicity, irritation, or sensitization).

B. What Materials Are Included?
FDA has identified specific materials in the final finished devices that are included in the policy
outlined in this Attachment when they are in contact with only intact skin surfaces. The materials
can include other processing chemicals and additives (e.g., plasticizers, fillers, color additives,
cleaning agents, mold release agents). With the exception of color additives, these chemicals
would not need to be disclosed in a marketing submission for devices with this type of tissue
contact.
Devices made from the following materials are included and can be made from a single material
or multiple materials, such as polymer blends:
Synthetic polymers:
·
·
·
·

·

Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plastic (ABS);
Cellulose Acetate
Cured epoxy adhesives (used to attach medical device components to each other);
Fluoropolymers including polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), expanded

C. What Devices or Materials are Excluded?
Medical devices, components, or materials excluded from the policy outlined in this Attachment
are described in Table G.1 below.

60

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Table G.1: Exclusion Characteristics
Medical Device Characteristic
Intact skin contacting components
fabricated from materials that are not
explicitly included in the above list,
including novel materials and bulk
metals (e.g., titanium, stainless steel,
nickel, nitinol, gold, cobalt, chrome)

Reason for exclusion
There are known risks or we do not have adequate
experience with these materials that may introduce
toxicity risks. Biocompatibility testing or detailed
rationales for omission of this testing could address
these concerns.

Stored in or containing fluids or
creams

There is an increased risk that leachables can be
transferred into the fluid or cream and then absorbed
through the skin.

Fabricated from in-situ polymerizing
materials, absorbable materials, or
hydrogels

There is an increased risk that polymerization or
degradation products can change over time. The
manufacturing process can impact the type and quantity
of intermediate and final chemicals present in the
device, which could introduce a toxicity risk.

Contacts breached or compromised
surfaces, such as open or healing
wounds

There is an increased risk that leachables can be
transferred through breached or compromised skin.

Reprocessed single-use devices

FDA is unaware of a history of safe use of single-use
devices that are reused after reprocessing. Reprocessing
of such devices can cause adverse biological responses
(e.g., irritation)

Adhesives used to attach a device
directly to the skin (e.g., electrode
pads, on-body pump attachment
systems)

Adhesives can cause adverse biological responses (e.g.,
irritation)

D. What Biocompatibility Information Should be Included in a Premarket
Submission?
(1) All premarket submissions (PMAs, HDE applications, IDE
applications, 510(k)s, and De Novo requests)
We recommend the following information be included in the premarket submission for device
types within the scope of the policy outlined in this Attachment:
·

A list of all materials (including color additives)86 used to fabricate the device or
component with only direct or indirect skin contact;

A statement confirming that none of the exclusions listed in Section C apply.

(2) Additional recommendation for IDE applications
In addition to the content recommended in Section D(1) above, FDA recommends that study
sponsors discuss any adverse biological responses from devices within this intact skin policy in
IDE progress reports87 submitted pursuant to 21 CFR 812.150(b)(5). Specifically, FDA
recommends that study sponsors describe any redness (erythema), swelling (edema), irritation,
sensitization (delayed Type IV hypersensitivity), allergy, immune response, or other reactions
observed by investigators during the course of a clinical study with observations attributed to a
specific device, if relevant.

(3) Additional recommendations for marketing submissions (510(k)s,
PMAs, HDE applications, and De Novo requests)
In addition to the content recommended in Section D(1) above, FDA recommends manufacturers
include a statement that the manufacturer has documented in their Device Master Record (DMR)
how they have determined that biocompatibility risks for their device are addressed such that
biocompatibility testing, and a detailed rationale regarding manufacturing is not necessary to
include in a premarket submission. The following statement is an example of the format and
content to support such an approach:
“We have documented in the Device Master Record (DMR) that we have addressed any
concerns that have been identified through biocompatibility testing (i.e., cytotoxicity,
irritation, and sensitization), manufacturing information (based on the type of materials,
formulation (if available) and nature of contact), and/or relevant quality system
requirements and postmarket controls related to:
· Purchasing controls (21 CFR 820.50) of device materials,
· Production and process controls (21 CFR 820.70) for manufacturing materials ,
· Acceptance activities (21 CFR 820.80) for component and manufacturing
materials,
· Corrective and preventative action (21 CFR 820.100),
· Complaint files (21 CFR 820.198), and
· Medical device reporting (MDR) (21 CFR 803).”

E. What is FDA’s Recommended Content and Format for Certain Labeling
Information Related to This Policy?
This section contains FDA’s format and content recommendations for certain labeling
information, and to help illustrate, FDA has provided an example. When the device is intended
for use in a patient population that may not have the ability to identify adverse biological
reactions related to cytotoxicity, irritation, or sensitization (e.g., patients with epilepsy or
dementia, or the vision impaired), FDA recommends that manufacturers using the policy
outlined in this Attachment, in lieu of conducting biocompatibility testing, inform caretakers in
the labeling by including a precaution discussing common adverse skin reactions. This applies to
medical devices used in health care settings by health care personnel as well as medical devices
used by patients and/or their caretakers.
An example of a precautionary statement that follows FDA’s recommendations is below:
“Caretakers should assess patients for adverse reactions on the skin where the device has
contact, such as redness (erythema), swelling (edema), irritation, sensitization (delayed
Type IV hypersensitivity), allergy, immune response, or other reactions.”

Attachment H: Glossary
For the purposes of this guidance, the following definitions apply:
Agglomerate/agglomeration – collection of weakly or medium strongly bound particles
where the resulting external surface area is similar to the sum of the surface areas of the
individual components88
Aggregate/aggregation – particle comprising strongly bonded or fused particles where the
resulting external surface area is significantly smaller than the sum of surface areas of the
individual components89
Biocompatibility – the ability of a device material to perform with an appropriate host
response in a specific situation90
Contact:
·

Direct contact – term used for a device or device component that comes into
physical contact with body tissue

·

Indirect contact – term used for a device or device component through which a fluid
or gas passes, prior to the fluid or gas coming into physical contact with body tissue
(in this case the device or device component itself does not physically contact body
tissue)

·

Non-contact – term used for a device or device component that has no direct or
indirect contact with the body (e.g., stand-alone software or database), and for which
no biocompatibility information would be needed other than confirmation that there
is no contact with the human body

·

Transient contact – term used for a device or device component that comes into
very brief/transient contact with body tissue (e.g., hypodermic needles that are used
for less than one minute)

Degradation – decomposition of the device, possibly through the generation of new
chemicals or absorption of the material, leading to loss of mechanical and/or physical
properties of the device (device function) over time

Extraction, exhaustive – extraction conducted until the amount of extractable material in a
subsequent extraction is less than 10% by gravimetric analysis (or that achieved by other
means) of that detected in the initial extraction91
Extractable – substance that can be released from a medical device or material using either
extraction solvents or extraction conditions, or both, that are expected to be at least as
aggressive as the conditions of clinical use92
Final finished form - term used for a device or device component that includes all
manufacturing processes for the “to be marketed” device including packaging and
sterilization, if applicable
In vivo animal study – a nonclinical animal study designed to provide initial evidence of
device safety, potential performance when used in a living system, and/or the biologic
response to the device
Leachable – substance that can be released from a medical device or material during clinical
use93
Material – the substance or substances of which a thing is made or composed94
Novel material – material that has not previously been used in any legally marketed medical
device
Risk assessment – overall process comprising a risk analysis (systematic use of available
information to identify hazards and to estimate the risk) and a risk evaluation (process of
comparing the estimated risk against given risk criteria to determine the acceptability of the
risk)95
Sponsor – manufacturer, submitter or applicant
Toxic – capable of causing injury or death, especially by chemical means96
Toxicological hazard – potential for a chemical substance or material to cause an adverse
biological reaction, taking into account the nature of the reaction and the dose required to
elicit it97
