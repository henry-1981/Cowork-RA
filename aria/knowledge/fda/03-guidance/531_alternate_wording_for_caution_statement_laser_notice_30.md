TO: MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Alternate Wording of Caution Statement in User
Information (21 CFR 1040.10(h) (1) (iv))

The warning statement, "Caution - use of controls or adjustments or
performance of procedures other than those specified herein may result
in hazardous radiation exposure" required by 21 CFR 1040.10(h) (1) (iv) to
be provided in the user information with laser products has been found
to be inappropriate or misleading for certain products. Such instances
occur when there are no controls available to the user or there are no
adjustments or procedures which the user could reasonably perform during
conditions of operation or maintenance which could result in hazardous
radiation exposure. Some Class I laser products that have evidenced
this condition are business machines, and sealed consumer products.

The Bureau of Tadiological Health will not object to the use of alter-
native wornince to the statement required by 21 CFR 1040.10(h) (1) (iv)

under the following conditions:

1. The required warning statement must be inappropriate in the
context of the design or use the product.

2. The alternative warning statement(s) must be more appropriate
than the required statement.

3. The alternative warning statement(s) must be related to the

laser hazard possible as a result of procedures other than

those given in the user instructions, e.g. removal of protective

housing, attempting to defeat nondefeatable interlocks, etc.
Under 21 CFR 1040.10(g)}(10} as amended the Director, Bureau of Radiological
Health may approve on the Director's own initiative or upon written
application by the manufacturer alternate means or wording. Manufacturers
are requested to apply for approval of alternate labeling in advance of
use of alternate labeling. In cases where a manufacturer substitutes
approved alternative warnings, it is also requested that the alternative
warnings be specifically identified in the initial or model change

report on the product.
