Medical Device User Fee Small
Business Qualification and
Determination
Guidance for Industry,
Food and Drug Administration Staff
and Foreign Governments
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
The Medical Device User Fee Amendments (MDUFA) require the payment of a user fee for
most types of medical device applications and reports, as well as for establishment registration.
Small businesses, however, may be eligible for application fee reductions or waivers, and for an
establishment registration fee waiver, depending on whether they fall below the applicable gross
receipts or sales maximums specified in statute, and meet other requirements. A business that is
qualified and determined by FDA to be a MDUFA “small business” is eligible for a substantial
reduction in these application user fees. Application types eligible for reduced small business
fees are: Premarket Notifications (510(k)), De Novo requests, Premarket Applications
(Premarket Approval Applications [PMA], Biologics License Applications [BLA], Product
Development Protocols [PDP]), Premarket Reports (PMR), PMA/PDP/BLA Supplements and
PMA Annual Reports, and 513(g) requests for classification information. See the full list of
eligible application types at the MDUFA User Fees website. In addition, a business that is
qualified and determined to be a “small business” under a different provision may be eligible for
a waiver of the fee for its first premarket application or report, and a business that is qualified
and determined to be a “small business” and meets additional requirements under yet another
provision may receive a waiver of an establishment registration fee. This guidance describes the
process for how a business may request a determination that it qualifies as a small business for
the purposes of each of these three provisions, which define “small business” with reference to
different gross receipts or sales maximums – $100 million for reduced fees; $30 million for the
first premarket application/report fee waiver; $1 million for the registration fee waiver.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic, and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended but not required.

II. Overview
Information about the process to demonstrate qualification and obtain a determination that your
business is a small business is described in the following sections of this guidance:
■
for a U.S. Business:
• see Section II(B) and Section IV
• use the MDUFA Small Business Request (“MDUFA SBR”) in the Customer
Collaboration Portal (“CDRH Portal”), for a business headquartered in the
United States
• if you have foreign affiliates, complete a MDUFA Foreign Small Business
Request for a business headquartered outside the United States (“MDUFA
Foreign SBR”) for each foreign affiliate.
■
for a Foreign Business:
• see Section II.C and Section V
• a MDUFA Foreign SBR includes the same information as a MDUFA SBR, with the
addition of a completed National Taxing Authority Certification.
• use the MDUFA SBR in the CDRH Portal.
■
for a National Taxing Authority:
• see Section II.D and Section VI
• work with your Foreign Business/Affiliate to complete a MDUFA Foreign SBR.
The instructions in this guidance are intended to help in understanding and providing the
information that is required or recommended for your business.
For additional information about medical device user fees, see FDA’s Medical Device User Fees
website. This site provides an overview of the laws establishing medical device user fees,
links to additional guidance documents, answers to frequently asked questions, and more.

A.

Eligibilities

To be eligible for a:
• Reduced application or report fee, FDA must determine that you qualify as a “small
business.” For the purposes of the reduced small business fee, a small business is one
that has gross receipts or sales of no more than $100 million for the most recent tax year,
inclusive of its affiliates. If you have any affiliates, you must add their gross receipts or
sales to yours, and the total must be no more than $100 million to be able to qualify as a
small business. 1 More information about the general applicability of the reduced fee
provisions may be found in Section III (Small Business Fees and Waivers) and Section
1

See Sections 738(d)(2)(A) and 738(e)(2)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).

VII (Frequently Asked Questions) of this guidance.
•

“First Premarket Application/Report Fee Waiver,” you must qualify as a small business
and neither you nor your affiliates have previously received a “First Premarket
Application/Report Fee Waiver.” For the purposes of the first premarket
application/report fee waiver, a small business is defined as having gross receipts or
sales of no more than $30 million for the most recent tax year, inclusive of gross receipts
or sales of its affiliates. 2

•

Registration Fee Waiver, a business (owner or operator) must qualify as a small
business, have registered and paid the fee in a prior year, and establish to FDA’s
satisfaction that paying the fee for the year at issue represents a financial hardship. For
the purposes of the registration fee waiver, a small business is defined as having gross
receipts or sales of no more than $1 million for the most recent tax year, inclusive of
gross receipts or sales of its affiliates. 3 More information about these conditions may be
found in Sections IV (for domestic businesses) and V (for foreign businesses). There are
no reduced fees for registration.

A Small Business Determination is granted for a single fiscal year (FY) and expires at the end of
that FY. A FY runs from October 1 through September 30, inclusive of the following calendar
year. A sponsor who wishes to apply any applicable reduction in user fee for a submission must
apply and be granted the Small Business Determination for each FY in which they plan to submit
a medical device application that requires a user fee. 4 The first premarket application/report fee
waiver, per MDUFA, is a one-time benefit. FDA intends to grant the registration fee waiver to an
entity once in relation to the circumstances that gave rise to the waiver.
Applicants seeking any of the three types of small business determinations must submit evidence
of qualification at least 60 days before the fee at issue is due. 5 The periods for submitting
evidence are described in the following paragraph.
For the purposes of the reduced small business fee and the first premarket application/report fee
waiver, FDA accepts Small Business Requests (“SBR”) beginning August 1, prior to next FY
starting on October 1. For example, requests for FY 2026 status (which runs from October 1,
2025, through September 30, 2026) will be accepted from August 1, 2025, through July 31,
2026. SBRs for the next FY received before August 1 will not be accepted. Please plan your
request strategy accordingly.
For purposes of the registration fee waiver, for actively registered firms, the FDA accepts SBRs
through October 31. For example, requests for FY 2026 status (which runs from October 1,
2025, through September 30, 2026) will be accepted from August 1, 2025, through October 31,
2025.

B.

U.S. Businesses

If your business is headquartered in the United States, you should follow the guidance in Section
IV (Guidance for U.S. Businesses). To qualify as a small business, please complete a MDUFA
SBR, and submit to FDA in the CDRH Portal. Detailed instructions on this process can be found
at the website titled “Reduced Medical Device User Fees: Small Business Determination (SBD)
Program.”
If you have any foreign affiliates, please complete a MDUFA Foreign SBR for each foreign
affiliate and review the SBD Program website for necessary information to complete a MDUFA
Foreign SBR.

C.

Foreign Businesses

If your business is a foreign business headquartered outside the United States and your business
does not file a Federal (U.S.) income tax return, you should follow the guidance in Section V
(Guidance for Foreign Businesses). To qualify as a small business, please follow these sequential
steps:
1. Visit the website “Reduced Medical Device User Fees: Small Business Determination
(SBD) Program” for detailed instructions on accessing and completing a MDUFA
Foreign SBR.
2. Complete the sections entitled “Information about the Business Requesting Small Business
Status” and “Information about You and Your Affiliates” on the MDUFA Foreign SBR.
3. Submit the MDUFA Foreign SBR to your National Taxing Authority (the
equivalent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service), to complete Section III of that
form (National Taxing Authority Certification).
4. Request that the National Taxing Authority return the completed MDUFA Foreign SBR
to you.
5. Submit the fully completed MDUFA Foreign SBR to FDA in the CDRH Portal for
review. In addition, if your business has any foreign affiliates, you must send a separate,
certified National Taxing Authority Certification for each foreign affiliate. If your
business has any U.S. affiliates, you must send a Federal U.S. income tax return for each
U.S. affiliate. 6
We recommend that you review Section VI (Guidance for Foreign Governments – How to
Prepare a National Taxing Authority Certification) to understand the responsibility of your
National Taxing Authority and, specifically, the National Taxing Authority Certification of the
MDUFA Foreign SBR.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If you are a National Taxing Authority, you should review Section VI (Guidance for Foreign
Governments – How to Prepare a National Taxing Authority Certification) for instructions on
your responsibilities. Complete the National Taxing Authority Certification of the MDUFA
Foreign SBR submitted to you by a business headquartered in your nation and return the
completed form back to the business that sent you the form.

E. Important Note for Submitters of Pre-FY2026 Small
Business Requests
The process and principles described in this guidance are substantially similar to the previous
version of this guidance. Please be advised that FDA continues to make quality improvements in
the program, in areas such as administrative completeness and consistency of documentation.
These updates assist the applicant in developing and submitting the SBR and FDA in reviewing
the request in a consistent, timely manner.

III. Small Business Fees and Waivers
This section identifies the MDUFA User Fee schedule and explains the benefits of qualifying as
a small business, including reduced application fees, the “first premarket application/report fee
waiver” and the “registration fee waiver.”

A.

MDUFA User Fee Schedule

The standard MDUFA User Fee must be paid for the identified applications in order for FDA to
begin its review, unless the applicant is eligible for a reduction, waiver or exemption. 7 A fee
must also be paid for establishment registration, unless an establishment is eligible for a waiver
and FDA grants the waiver. 8 The current user fees are shown at the FDA MDUFA User Fees
website and are set by law. 9

B.

Benefits of Qualifying as a Small Business
(1)

Reduced Application Fees

If the FDA determines that you qualify as a small business, you will pay a lower user fee than the
standard fee for applicable submissions from the date of FDA’s determination of your small
business status through the end of that FY (i.e., September 30). Applicable submissions are:
PMA, PDP, PMA and PDP Supplements (Panel-Track, 180-day, Real-Time and 30-day Notice),
Modular PMA, BLA, BLA Efficacy Supplement, 510(k) (Traditional, Abbreviated, and Special),
PMR, PMA Annual Reports, 513(g) and De Novo request. 10 Under Sections 738(d)(2)(D) and
738(e)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act, applicants seeking this fee reduction must submit supporting
information at least 60 days before the fee is due. Sections 738(d)(2)(D) and 738(e)(2)(D)
additionally state that FDA’s decision regarding whether an applicant qualifies for a small
business reduced application fee is not reviewable.
Section 738(a)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act.
Section 738(a)(3)(C) of the FD&C Act.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

To qualify for the reduced application fees, FDA must determine that you qualify as a small
business with gross receipts or sales of no more than $100 million, including the gross receipts or
sales of all of your affiliates. 11

(2)

First Premarket Application/Report Fee Waiver

If the FDA determines that you are eligible for a “first premarket application/report fee waiver”,
this means that you will not have to pay the fee for your first premarket application/report (i.e.,
PMA, including Modular PMA, BLA, PDP, or PMR). 12 This fee waiver may only be applied
once. The first premarket application/report is defined as the first PMA (including Modular
PMA), BLA, PDP, or PMR received by FDA from a business entity or any of its affiliates. If a
second business entity (or any of its affiliates) acquires another business entity that has
previously submitted a premarket application/report, then the second business entity is not
eligible for a “first premarket application/report waiver.” Under Section 738(d)(2)(D) of the
FD&C Act, applicants seeking this waiver must submit supporting information at least 60 days
before the fee is due. Section 738(d)(2)(D) additionally states that FDA’s decision regarding
whether an applicant qualifies for a small business premarket application/report fee waiver or
reduction is not reviewable.
To qualify for the “first premarket application/report fee waiver”, you must meet both criteria:
1. FDA must determine that you qualify as a small business with gross receipts or sales of
no more than $30 million, including the gross receipts or sales of all of your affiliates. 13
Note: This means that some businesses may qualify as a small business for the purpose
of reduced application fees because their gross receipts or sales are less than $100 million
but would not qualify for the “first premarket application/report fee waiver” if their
gross receipts or sales are more than $30 million.
2. FDA must determine that this is your first premarket application/report (i.e., PMA,
including Modular PMA, BLA, PDP, or PMR). Specifically, if you or any affiliate
previously submitted a premarket application/report, then your next application does not
qualify for the “first premarket application/report fee waiver”, and you must pay the fee
that would otherwise apply. 14
Examples of situations that do not qualify for the “first premarket application/report
fee waiver”:
a. Business A has an approved PMA and is acquired by Business B. Business B has
not submitted a PMA, BLA, PDP or a Modular PMA to FDA. Because Business
A has submitted a PMA, Business B is not eligible for the first premarket

application/report fee waiver.
b. A business with Name A has submitted a BLA and then changes its name to
Name B. Under Name B, the business submits a Modular PMA. This is
considered the same business. The business is not eligible for the first premarket
application/report fee waiver.
c. A business submits a PMA that is not approved and then submits a Modular PMA
for a different product. The business is not eligible for the first premarket
application/report fee waiver because it has already submitted a premarket
application regardless of whether it was approved.

(3)

Registration Fee Waiver

If you:
•
•
•

reported $1,000,000 or less in gross receipts or sales in your most recent Federal (U.S.)
income tax return (including the returns of your affiliates 15), and
provided evidence that paying the annual registration fee represents a financial
hardship 16, as described below and FDA determines this to be the case, and
provided proof of prior paid registration,

then you may be eligible to receive a waiver of the establishment registration fee for the fiscal
year identified in the approval letter. If you are granted this registration fee waiver, you are still
obligated to comply with the applicable registration and listing requirements found in 21 CFR
Part 807.
FDA intends to combine and update the forms FDA-3602 and FDA-3602A to request both
minimal information needed to evaluate an SBD hardship determination and evidence of prior
paid registration fees. Under section 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(V) of the FD&C Act, applicants seeking a
small business registration fee waiver must submit supporting information at least 60 days before
the fee is due, which, for actively registered firms, is December 31. Accordingly, applicants
must submit supporting information for this waiver between August 1 and October 31. Section
738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(V) additionally states that FDA’s decision regarding whether an applicant may
receive a small business registration fee waiver is not reviewable.

IV. Guidance for U.S. Businesses
A U.S. business is a business headquartered in the United States. If you are a U.S. business, you
should follow the guidance provided in this section. If your business is headquartered in a
foreign country, you should follow the guidance in Section V (Guidance for Foreign
Businesses).

See Section 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(I).
See Section 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(II).

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If you believe you qualify as a small business and want to pay reduced fees or have certain fees
waived, you should submit the following documents to FDA:
• a completed MDUFA SBR
o include your Organization ID Number (Org ID). Org ID is a system-generated
number assigned to a new organization during the User Fee account creation
process that uniquely identifies your business in the FDA User Fee System.
Your Org ID is separate and distinct from any other number that may be
associated with your company. See Section VII (Frequently Asked Questions)
of this guidance for instructions on obtaining your Org ID.
• Documentation demonstrating that the total gross sales and receipts for you and your
affiliates are under the relevant amount for each benefit, which are $100 million for
reduced application fees, $30 million for a first premarket application/report fee
waiver, and $1 million for the registration fee waiver (hereinafter “Applicable
Thresholds”). This documentation must include:
o a complete, signed copy of your original Federal (U.S.) income tax return for the
most recent tax year;
o a separate Federal (U.S.) income tax return for each U.S. affiliate; and
o a certified National Taxing Authority Certification on the MDUFA Foreign SBR
for each foreign affiliate.
• This can be completed by submitting the National Taxing Authority
Certification to your National Taxing Authority (the equivalent of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Service), who then completes the Certification
and returns the updated form to you.
FDA will review your submission and supporting materials within 60 calendar days of receipt.
Upon completion of our review, we will send you a letter that indicates whether or not your
business has been determined to be a small business under MDUFA and for what purposes. A
small business is then eligible for a reduced or waived fee for submissions made during the FY
and may be eligible for a registration fee waiver. If your business qualifies as a small business,
FDA’s decision letter will assign you a Small Business Decision number and specify which fee
reduction or waiver(s) FDA has determined you are eligible for. You should provide this number
to FDA each time you want to receive a small business fee discount for any of your eligible
applications or, if you qualify, when you want to obtain a fee waiver for your first premarket
application/report or a registration fee waiver.
What is an affiliate?
The term “affiliate” is defined in Section 737(13) of the FD&C Act. An affiliate means a
business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity (whether domestic or
international) if, directly or indirectly:
(a) one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity;
or
(b) a third party controls, or has power to control, both of the business entities.
You must include the gross receipts or sales of all your affiliates with your own gross receipts or

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
sales when you prepare your MDUFA SBR. 17
Why does FDA require me to submit a Federal (U.S.) income tax return?
Regarding the reduced application fee and the first premarket application/report fee waiver,
Sections 738(d)(2)(B)(i) and 738(e)(2)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act require an applicant to pay the
standard fees for its submissions unless it demonstrates it is a small business by submitting a
copy of its most recent Federal (U.S.) income tax return (and returns of all affiliates). Regarding
the registration fee waiver, Section 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(III) requires a small business to submit its
most recent Federal income tax return to support its eligibility for the registration fee waiver. A
consequence of this requirement is that you cannot qualify as a small business under MDUFA if
you have not submitted a Federal (U.S.) income tax return. FDA cannot accept a foreign tax
return or state tax return in place of a Federal (U.S.) income tax return.
What is an acceptable copy of a Federal (U.S.) income tax return?
An acceptable copy of a Federal (U.S.) income tax return is an identical signed copy of the entire
original Federal (U.S.) income tax return submitted to the United States Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). Please do not include your state tax return. Only the Federal (U.S) income tax
return is needed.
The copy of the Federal (U.S.) income tax return must include the signature and the date of the
signature of an officer, partner, or member of the company. Alternatively, you may submit a
copy of the e-file form submitted to the IRS, if your documentation includes a dated signature of
an officer, partner or member.
What is the most recent tax year?
You should submit your most recent tax return. If you submit your SBR prior to the current
year’s due date for your taxes, you may submit your previous year’s tax return.
If you obtained an extension to file your taxes, then you may use your most recent return filed
prior to the extension. In this scenario, you should also include your IRS Form 7004: Application
for Automatic Extension of Time to File Certain Business Income Tax, Information, and Other
Returns in your SBR.
My organization filed a Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax. Do I
still need to qualify as a Small Business?
Yes. The FD&C Act does not exempt you from medical device user fees or grant you automatic
small business status simply because you are exempt from Federal (U.S.) income tax. You are
subject to the same “gross receipts or sales” thresholds as other applicants. You should report
your Total Revenue (line 12 of Form 990) as your “gross receipts or sales.” In addition, include a
signed copy of your Form 990.
How do I access and complete a MDUFA SBR?
You may access and complete a MDUFA SBR in the CDRH Portal. Detailed instructions on this
process can be found at the website titled “Reduced Medical Device User Fees: Small Business
Determination (SBD) Program.”

See Sections 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(III), 738(d)(2)(A), and 738(e)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
What do I provide if I have a foreign affiliate?
If you have a foreign affiliate, you should submit a MDUFA Foreign SBR (which includes a
National Taxing Authority Certification) for that affiliate. A National Taxing Authority is the
government agency that collects the national income tax in the country where your affiliate is
located. Please contact that national government to identify the appropriate point of contact for
the National Taxing Authority where your affiliate is located.
What if the National Taxing Authority does not provide the certification for my foreign
affiliate?
A certification from a National Taxing Authority, if extant, is required to authenticate the gross
sales and receipts for a foreign business or affiliate. 18
How can I demonstrate “financial hardship” and receive a registration fee waiver?
FDA may, but is not required to, grant a waiver of the fee for annual registration to applicants
that qualify as a small business if FDA finds that the establishment is a small business and
paying the fee for such year represents a financial hardship to the establishment as determined by
FDA. 19 FDA intends to grant waivers only where financial hardship is shown by a clear and
objective standard, the meeting of which is publicly transparent. The only situation we are
currently aware of that meets this is where the small business is in active bankruptcy. FDA
believes that active bankruptcy represents financial hardship that is shown by a clear, objective
standard, the meeting of which is a matter of public record. Thus, if you are seeking the
registration fee waiver, we recommend you provide all of the following:
•
•
•

your most recent Federal (U.S.) income tax return(s) showing $1,000,000 or less
in gross receipts or sales (including affiliates),
evidence that you have filed a petition for bankruptcy in United States Bankruptcy
Court and that the bankruptcy is currently active (debts have yet to be discharged
or a reorganization plan has not been confirmed), and
evidence that the establishments for which you are seeking a waiver have, under
your owner/operator ID with FDA, previously registered and paid the associated
registration fees.

V. Guidance for Foreign Businesses
A foreign business is a business headquartered outside the United States. If you are a foreign
business, you should follow the guidance provided in this section. If your business is
headquartered in the United States, you should follow the guidance in Section IV (Guidance for
U.S. Businesses).
If you are a foreign business and wish to qualify as a small business, please follow these
sequential steps:

1. Detailed instructions on this process can be found at the website titled “Reduced
Medical Device User Fees: Small Business Determination (SBD) Program” describing
how to access the form.
2. Complete the “Information about the Business Requesting Small Business Status”
and “Information about you and your Affiliates” sections of the MDUFA Foreign
SBR. Note you need to generate your Organization ID Number (Org ID) and include
this in the MDUFA Foreign SBR. Your Org ID is separate and distinct from any
other number that may be associated with your company. See Section VII
(Frequently Asked Questions) of this guidance for instructions on generating the Org
ID.
3. Submit the MDUFA Foreign SBR to your National Taxing Authority (the
equivalent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service), who then completes the National
Taxing Authority Certification. Please ensure all appropriate boxes and lines are
filled in.
4. The National Taxing Authority returns the updated form to you.
5. Submit a fully completed MDUFA Foreign SBR to FDA for review, including a
completed National Taxing Authority Certification. In addition, if your business
has any foreign affiliates, you must send a separate certified National Taxing
Authority Certification for each foreign affiliate. If your business has any U.S.
affiliates, you must send a Federal (U.S.) income tax return for each U.S. affiliate.
Note that the website titled “Reduced Medical Device User Fees: Small Business
Determination (SBD) Program” provides detailed information on accessing and
completing a MDUFA Foreign SBR.
We recommend that you review Section VI (Guidance for Foreign Governments – How to
Prepare a National Taxing Authority Certification) to understand the responsibility of your
National Taxing Authority.
FDA will complete its review of your SBR, which includes your completed MDUFA Foreign
SBR and supporting evidence, within 60 calendar days of receipt. Upon completion of our
review, we will send you a letter that indicates whether your business has been determined to be a
small business under MDUFA and for what purposes. A small business meeting the Applicable
Threshold(s) is then eligible for a reduced or waived fee for submissions made during that FY,
and may be eligible for a registration fee waiver. If your business is qualified as a small
business, FDA’s decision letter will assign you a Small Business Decision number. You should
provide this number to FDA each time during the applicable FY that you want to receive a small
business fee discount for any of your eligible applications or, if you qualify, when you want to
obtain a fee waiver for your first premarket application/report or a registration fee waiver.
What is an affiliate?
The term “affiliate” is defined by Section 737(13) of the FD&C Act. An affiliate means a
business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity (whether domestic or
international) if, directly or indirectly:
(a) one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity; or
11

(b) a third-party controls, or has power to control, both of the business entities.
You must include the gross receipts or sales of all of your affiliates with your own gross receipts
or sales when you prepare your MDUFA Foreign SBR.20
Who is my National Taxing Authority?
Your National Taxing Authority is the government agency that collects your national income tax.
Please contact your national government to identify the appropriate point of contact for your
National Taxing Authority.
What if I live in a jurisdiction without a National Taxing Authority?
You may submit evidence of your gross sales and receipts (e.g., end of fiscal year financial
statements or shareholder reports) to show that you fall below the Applicable Threshold to
qualify for a small business fee waiver or reduction. FDA plans to review evidence on a case-bycase basis to determine whether you qualify for a small business fee waiver or reduction.
What if the National Taxing Authority does not provide the required certification for my
business or my foreign affiliate?
A certification from a National Taxing Authority, if extant, is required to authenticate the gross
sales and receipts for a foreign business or affiliate. 21
May a foreign applicant file a Federal (U.S.) income tax return in order to qualify as a
small business under MDUFA?
Although the law does not prohibit a foreign business from submitting a Federal (U.S.) income
tax return, filing a Federal (U.S.) income tax return may have significant tax and other legal
consequences beyond simply making you eligible as a small business under MDUFA. FDA
cannot provide advice regarding whether you should or should not file a Federal (U.S.) income
tax return. If you are in doubt as to whether it is advisable for you to file a Federal (U.S.) income
tax return, you should consider consulting with qualified legal and tax professionals. Additional
information on Federal (U.S.) income taxation is available from the United States Internal
Revenue Service (https://www.irs.gov).
How do I access and complete a MDUFA Foreign SBR?
You may access and complete a MDUFA Foreign SBR in the CDRH Portal. Detailed
instructions on this process can be found at the website titled “Reduced Medical Device User
Fees: Small Business Determination (SBD) Program.”
How can I demonstrate “financial hardship” and receive a waiver of the registration fee if I
am located outside of the United States?
FDA may, but is not required to, grant a waiver of the fee for annual registration to applicants
that qualify as a small business if FDA finds that the establishment is a small business and
paying the fee for such year represents a financial hardship to the establishment as determined by
FDA. 22 FDA intends to grant waivers only where financial hardship is shown by a clear and

objective standard that is publicly transparent. The only situation we are currently aware of that
meets this is where the small business is in active bankruptcy. FDA believes that active
bankruptcy represents financial hardship that is shown by a clear, objective standard, the meeting
of which is a matter of public record. Thus, if you are applying for the registration fee waiver, we
recommend you provide the following:
•
•

•

The most recent income tax return(s) submitted to your National Taxing
Authority showing $1,000,000 or less in gross receipts or sales (including
affiliates),
evidence that you have filed your jurisdiction’s equivalent of a United
States bankruptcy action, including evidence that the applicant has
initiated the action (i.e., a document analogous to a United States
bankruptcy petition) and evidence that the bankruptcy action is active,
and
evidence that each establishment for which you are seeking a waiver has
previously registered and paid the registration fee, under your
owner/operator ID with FDA.

VI. Guidance for Foreign Governments – How to Prepare a
National Taxing Authority Certification
Qualification as a MDUFA small business may allow the business to pay reduced medical device
user fees and/or be eligible for certain fee waivers. If a foreign business has not previously
submitted a Federal (U.S.) income tax return, it may obtain a certification from its National
Taxing Authority” showing that its gross receipts or sales do not exceed the Applicable
Thresholds. The law 23 requires that this certification, referred to as the “National Taxing
Authority Certification”:
•
•
•
•
•

be in English;
be from the National Taxing Authority of the country in which the
business (or affiliate) is headquartered;
provide the business’s gross receipts or sales for the most recent year, in both
the local currency and in United States dollars, and the exchange rate used in
converting local currency to U.S. dollars;
provide the dates during which the reported receipts or sales were collected; and
bear the official seal of the National Taxing Authority.

In addition, the applicant must submit a statement signed by its head or CFO that it has submitted
certifications for all of its affiliates, or that it has no affiliates.
What are “gross receipts or sales”?
If you are unsure how “gross receipts or sales” relate to your national income taxation system,
please contact the United States Internal Revenue Service through the United States Embassy.
23

See Sections 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(IV), 738(d)(2)(B)(iii), and 738(e)(2)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act.

What information should the business submit to the National Taxing Authority?
The business should send the National Taxing Authority a MDUFA Foreign SBR, with the
information other than the National Taxing Authority Certification fully completed.
Each National Taxing Authority may require the business to provide additional information and
evidence needed by the National Taxing Authority to determine the gross receipts or sales it will
report in the National Taxing Authority Certification for the business.
What exchange rate should be used to convert local currency to U.S. dollars?
You should use the exchange rate in effect as of the ending date of the period during which the
reported receipts or sales were collected; this is the date provided as the ending date in which
reported receipts or sales were collected in the National Taxing Authority Certification. FDA
cannot provide this information to you; each National Taxing Authority is responsible for
determining the appropriate exchange rate to use.
Why does FDA require the National Taxing Authority Certification to bear the official seal
of the National Taxing Authority?
This is a statutory requirement. Sections 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(IV), 738(d)(2)(B)(iii) and
738(e)(2)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act require the National Taxing Authority Certification to bear the
official seal of the National Taxing Authority.

VII. Frequently Asked Questions
What is the purpose of a Small Business Decision number?
The Small Business Decision number is used by FDA to confirm that you have qualified as a
small business and may receive the appropriate user fee reduction or waiver when you make a
submission that requires a user fee (as described at the FDA MDUFA User Fees website). You
should use your Small Business Decision number to document that you have qualified as a small
business. You should include your Small Business Decision number when you submit a Medical
Device User Fee Cover Sheet, which is available from the FDA User Fee System.
When will my status as a small business begin?
Your status as a small business will begin on the date of FDA’s decision letter, which determined
that you qualified as a small business.
When will my status as a small business expire?
Your status as a small business will expire at the end of the FY for which the small business
status was granted (September 30). You should submit a new MDUFA SBR each year to qualify
as a small business for the purpose of reduced fees. This is because:
•
•

Your gross sales and receipts will vary from one year to another.
We will always need a copy of your most recent Federal (U.S.) income tax
return (if you are a U.S. business) or your most recent certification of income
from your National Taxing Authority (if you are a foreign business).

What is an Organization ID Number (Org ID)?
Org ID is a system-generated number assigned to a new organization during the User Fee
account creation process that uniquely identifies your business in the FDA User Fee System. It is
not the same as the Federal Employer Identification Number, Registration Number, or Taxpayer
Identification Number. It is important that this number is correct, because FDA uses the Org ID
to interact with an organization to ensure proper payment of its medical device applications that
require the payment of a user fee. If this number is incorrect there could be a delay in processing
your Small Business Determination reduced user fee or waiver.
If you are a registered company, you should already have an organization ID number. You should
use this one – do not create a new one.
Your Org ID may be found in the Profile section, under Business Information on the User Fee
System MDUFA screen. Follow these instructions to obtain your organization number:
1. Login to the User Fee System MDUFA screen and enter a valid user name and password
to sign into the Medical Device User Fee Website.
2. Click the “Go” button for the Medical Device User Fee (MDUFA Cover Sheets (e.g.,
PMA, De Novo, 510(k), etc.)) option, under the Cover Sheets section.
3. Click the Profile icon located on the top of the page.
4. You will see Business Information under the Details tab. The organization ID number is
listed below the organization name.
If your company has never paid a user fee, you should create a new User Fee System account.
See the FDA User Fee System (UFS) Account Creation Desk Guide for detailed instructions.
If you forgot your user name and/or password or a message displays “Invalid username and/or
password” while attempting to login, you may retrieve your user name and/or password online
by returning to the User Fee System website and clicking on the “Forgot User Name/Password?”
link. You will need to enter your username and/or email address and then click on the “email
My Password” button. If the email address or username is valid, a temporary password will be
sent to the user with the requested information. If the message “We’re sorry, but we haven’t
been able to locate your account information” is displayed, you should create a new User Fee
account.
Please contact the User Fee Helpdesk at userfees@fda.gov or (301) 796-7200 if you need
assistance obtaining your Organization ID Number (Org ID) or there are any issues with your
account. Be prepared to provide your organization name and address.
What fee should I pay if I submit an application before FDA determines that I qualify as a
small business?
If you submit an application before FDA has qualified you as a small business, you must pay the
standard (full) amount of any fee that applies. FDA will not refund the difference between the
standard (full) fee and the small business fee if you later qualify as a small business. If you want
to pay the small business fee for an application, you should not submit your application until you
obtain your Small Business Decision number from FDA.

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
May a company request a small business determination for a prior FY?
No. All of the fee reduction and waiver provisions require an applicant seeking a fee reduction or
waiver to submit supporting information to FDA at least 60 days before payment of the fee is
required. See Section 738(a)(3)(B)(ii)(V), Section 738(d)(2)(D), and Section 738(e)(2)(D). We
have no provision for an applicant to retroactively request a small business status for a prior FY.
What may happen if I submit a false SBR concerning my business?
When you make your SBR you are explicitly certifying:
“. . . to the best of my knowledge, the information I have provided in
this Request is complete and accurate. I understand that submission of
a false request may subject me to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. §
1001 and other applicable federal statutes.”
This statement appears immediately above your signature.
A false certification is one where you report information that is not true (for example, your gross
receipts or sales are actually higher than you state) or if you fail to disclose required information
(for example, you fail to disclose the existence of a parent, partner, or affiliate).
If FDA determines that you submitted a false certification, we may suspend your status as a small
business, we may suspend the review of any application you submitted until you pay the full fee
that applies to that type of application, we may seek payment of the unpaid portion of fees that
should have been paid, we may take other legal actions that are appropriate under the
circumstances, and you may be subject to criminal penalties under 18 U.S.C. § 1001 and other
applicable federal statutes.
Who is the contact for the SBR?
The primary contact for the SBR is the person making the certification that the information
provided in the SBR is complete and accurate. If you would like to identify additional contacts,
please identify any additional contacts on the cover letter of your SBR. To protect your
confidential information, we will only communicate with individuals you have identified as
contacts.
If my firm qualifies as a small business, may I take advantage of the reduced fees or fee
waivers on behalf of another entity?
No. For purposes of application fee waivers or reductions, the law provides that an applicant
shall pay the higher fees established by the Secretary each year unless the applicant submits
evidence that it qualifies for a waiver of the fee or the lower fee rate. 24 Similarly, for purposes of
the registration fee waiver, FDA may grant a waiver of the registration fee for an establishment
for a year if FDA “finds that the establishment is a small business and paying the fee for such
year represents a financial hardship to the establishment.” 25
The statute does not contain a transferability provision pursuant to which a small business

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
determination and qualification for the fee waiver or reduction could be transferred to another
entity. For example, if the owner/operator of a device establishment, determined to be a small
business, is acquired by another entity, and that acquiring entity submits an application, the
applicant must pay the full fee, unless it obtains its own small business determination. 26
Additionally, a third-party consultant who submits an application on behalf of its client is not the
applicant and may not qualify for a reduction or waiver.
As a small business that can show financial hardship, will I be liable for the annual
registration fee?
Under 21 CFR Part 807, establishments must register annually with FDA. 27 If you have
previously registered with FDA a facility under your owner/operator ID, and the gross receipts or
sales for you and all of your affiliates combined are $1 million or less, and you can show that
paying the fee would be a financial hardship, FDA may grant the waiver. If you have been
granted a registration fee waiver, you will not be required to pay the annual registration fee for
that year.
How often will FDA grant the small business registration fee waiver?
If FDA grants the registration fee waiver, it does not intend to grant this waiver more than once
to the same entity in relation to the circumstances that gave rise to the waiver. This means FDA
intends to grant a small business registration fee waiver for an active bankruptcy for one year
only, even if the bankruptcy lasts for several years.
Am I eligible for a refund for previous years where I paid the full fee, if I currently qualify
for a fee waiver or reduction or would have qualified for a fee waiver or reduction in that
previous year where I paid the full fee?
No, the statute requires any establishment seeking a fee waiver or reduction to submit their
supporting information at least 60 days before the fee is due for that year. The statute does not
provide a mechanism to retroactively apply the waiver or reduction to previous years.
If I have a question, whom may I ask?
If you need additional information about becoming a MDUFA small business, contact FDA’s
Division of Industry and Consumer Education by email at DICE@fda.hhs.gov or by phone at
800-638-2041 or 301-796-7100.
