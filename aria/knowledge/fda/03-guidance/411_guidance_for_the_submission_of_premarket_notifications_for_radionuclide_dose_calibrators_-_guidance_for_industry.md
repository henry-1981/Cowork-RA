I. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the information which should
be included in a premarket (510(k)) notification for a radionuclide dose calibrator (RDC)
submitted to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). This information is an
elaboration of the general requirements contained in 21 CFR 807.87.

II. Scope
This document is applicable to Radionuclide Dose Calibrators as defined in 21 CFR 892.1360:
“A radionuclide dose calibrator is a radiation detection device intended to assay radionuclides
before their administration to patients.”
RDCs are currently in Class II and require premarket notification and an agency determination of
substantial equivalence prior to marketing. The product code currently used to identify this
device is KPT. This guidance covers calibrators used to calibrate doses of radionuclides used in
nuclear medicine and radionuclide sources used in brachytherapy.
The principal components of current RDCs are a measurement chamber (such as a vented or
sealed gas ionization chamber or scintillation detector) and readout (such as an electrometer).
This guidance is applicable to premarket notifications for new RDCs, new components, and
modifications to RDCs and components that have a significant influence on safety or
effectiveness.
III. Background
In the last few years, a number of legislative changes relating to the authority of the agency have
occurred. These changes have resulted in the adoption of new regulations and administrative
procedures by CDRH, which affect the 510(k) process. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990
(SMDA) has resulted in new Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations requiring preproduction design controls, and several administrative requirements (Truthful and Accurate
statements, Summaries of Safety and Effectiveness, and Statements of Indications for Use) have
been added. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) of 1997 and a reengineering effort have resulted in the development of a new 510(k) paradigm that incorporates
alternative approaches to demonstrating substantial equivalence in premarket notifications. These
approaches are intended to facilitate the marketing clearance of devices for which recognized
standards exist, and for cases in which the new device is a modification of a previously cleared
product.

A. The New 510(k) Paradigm
On March 20, 1998 CDRH issued a document entitled “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternative
Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications”. This
document is available on the CDRH web site (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html). In
addition to the traditional 510(k), this document describes two alternatives, the “Special 510(k):
Device Modification” and the “Abbreviated 510(k)”.
1. Special 510(k)
The Special 510(k) is based on the requirement that manufacturers establish design controls in
accordance with the SMDA and 21 CFR 820.30. A manufacturer uses the FDA guidance
document entitled “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device” to
decide if a device modification could be implemented without submission of a new 510(k). If a
new 510(k) is needed, and if the modification does not affect the intended use of the device or the
basic fundamental scientific technology, conformance with design controls may form the basis for
clearing the application. Under this option, a manufacturer who is intending to modify a legally
marketed Class II device would conduct the necessary verification and validation activities to
demonstrate that the design output of the modified device meets the design requirements. Once
the company has ensured the satisfactory completion of this process through a design review, a
Special 510(k) may be submitted. While the basic content requirements for the submission are the
same, this type of submission should also reference the cleared 510(k) and contain a “Declaration
of Conformity” with design control requirements. In the Special 510(k) the manufacturer has the
option of using a third party to assess conformance with design controls (refer to the paradigm
document for details). Special 510(k)s are to be processed by the Office of Device Evaluation
within 30 days of receipt by the Document Mail Center.
2. Abbreviated 510(k)s
The Abbreviated 510(k) is based on the use of conformance to voluntary standards in place of
data review as the means by which the safety and effectiveness of Class II devices can be assured.
Manufacturers may submit an Abbreviated 510(k) when FDA has recognized an individual or
several voluntary standards that cover aspects of the new device. In addition to the required
elements of a 510(k) as described in 21 CFR 808.87, Abbreviated 510(k) submissions should
include information that describes how conformance to one or several voluntary standards,
recognized by CDRH, have been used to address risks associated with the device, and a
“Declaration of Conformity” to those standards. The “Declaration of Conformity” should provide
the information listed in the paradigm. A third party may be used to assess conformance with
these standards (refer to the paradigm document for details). The review of abbreviated 510(k)s is
intended to be more efficient since they are not required to contain the experimental data from
which conformance is determined.

B. Standards for Radionuclide Dose Calibrators
The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 authorizes CDRH to recognize
consensus standards established by national and international standards development
organizations that may be used to satisfy identified portions of device review requirements. On
February 19, 1998 CDRH issued a “Guidance on the Recognition and Use of Consensus
Standards” which is intended to provide information relating to the recognition and use of
national and international consensus standards. It is available on the CDRH web site
(hhtp://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/k982.html), and describes how the agency will use information
on conformance with recognized standards to satisfy premarket review requirements. It also
describes the content of a declaration of conformity. In the case of 510(k)s, information on
conformance with recognized standards might help establish the substantial equivalence of a new
device to a legally marketed predicate in the areas covered by the standards. If a premarket
notification contains declarations of conformity, this will in most cases eliminate the need to
review the actual test data for those aspects of the device addressed by the standards. However,
the results of testing are expected when the standard specifies a test method without the
associated performance limits. There are currently no consensus standards related to RDCs that
are recognized by CDRH, however, several bodies have published standards and requirements.
Several of these are listed for convenience.
1. 10 CFR 35.50 Possession, use, calibration and check of dose calibrators
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires a licensee to possess and use a dose
calibrator to measure the activity of dosages of photon-emitting radionuclides prior to
administration to each patient or human research subject. This requirement specifies when a RDC
will be used and the timing of required quality control checks (constancy, accuracy, linearity, and
geometrical dependence.
2. IEC 61303(1994-10) Medical Electrical Equipment: Radionuclide calibrators –Particular
methods for describing performance.
This standard covers radionuclide calibrators of the well type, with a gas-filled ionization chamber
as used in the practice of nuclear medicine. The object of this standard is to identify the most
important characteristics of radionuclide calibrators and lay down associated test methods to
enable manufacturers to declare the characteristics of their devices in a standardized way and
facilitate comparisons between devices.
3. IEC 61145(1992-05) Calibration and usage of ionization chamber systems for assay of
radionuclides.
This standard covers the techniques for the quantification of the activity of identified radionuclides
using any of a variety of ionization chambers currently available for this purpose.

6

4. ANSI N42.13-1986 Calibration and usage of “dose Calibrator” ionization chambers for the
assay of radionuclides
This standard covers the techniques for the quantification of the activity of identified radionuclides
using any of a variety of ionization chambers currently available for this purpose. Application of
the standard is limited to instruments that incorporate well-type ionization chambers as detectors.
