Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data
in Clinical Trials
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff1
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or
the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, please contact the relevant FDA review
division for your medical product.

I.

INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this guidance is to provide FDA expectations for and recommendations on
use of a standardized approach for collecting and reporting race and ethnicity data in
submissions for clinical trials for FDA regulated medical products conducted in the United
States and abroad. Using standard terminology for age, sex, race, and ethnicity helps ensure
that subpopulation data is collected consistently. The recommended standardized approach
is based on the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Directive 152 and developed in
accordance with section 4302 of the Affordable Care Act3, the HHS Implementation
Guidance on Data Collection Standards for Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language, and
Disability Status4, and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act5
(FDASIA) Section 907 Action Plan6. This guidance lists the OMB

This guidance has been developed by the Agency-wide Race and Ethnicity Working Group from the Office of the
Commissioner (OC), the Office of Minority Heath (OMH), the Office of Women’s Health (OWH), the Office of
Public Health Strategy and Analysis (OPHSA), the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), the Center
for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA).

categories for race and ethnicity and describes FDA's reasons for recommending the use of
these categories in medical product (drugs, biologics, and devices) applications. In addition,
this guidance recommends a format for collection of race and ethnicity clinical trial data that
are submitted in standardized data sets per the Study Data Tabulation Model7, in the
electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)8, and as specified in FDA’s Guidance on
providing regulatory submissions in electronic format9.
This document is intended to provide guidance on:
• Meeting the requirements set forth in the 1998 final rule10 regarding presentation of
demographic data on investigational new drug (IND) applications and new drug
applications (NDAs) (known as the “Demographic Rule”) and collection of race and
ethnicity data in biologics license applications (BLAs) and medical device applications
• Addressing the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, Section 907 Action Plan6 to improve
demographic subgroup gaps in data quality
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something
is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. SCOPE
This document is intended to provide guidance on the collection of race and ethnicity in
clinical trials. This guidance provides clarifying recommendations on the two step collection
process of race and ethnicity data and has been developed in support of the FDASIA 907
Action Plan to improve the completeness and quality of demographic subgroup data. This
guidance replaces the 2005 FDA guidance on Collection of Race and Ethnicity in Clinical
Trials11.

For drugs, the Demographic Rule requires IND holders to tabulate in their annual report the
number of participants enrolled in clinical trials by age, race, and sex and requires sponsors
of NDAs to include summaries of effectiveness and safety data for important demographic
subgroups, including racial subgroups13. FDA also strongly recommends the collection and
reporting of ethnicity data (Hispanic-Latino/not Hispanic-Latino) consistent with OMB
standards and guidelines2.
This guidance is also intended to help applicants in preparing BLAs.
For medical devices, FDA also recommends application sponsors collect ethnicity and race data
in accordance with the OMB recommendations2, the information collection standards discussed
in this guidance document and, when finalized, the Center for Devices and Radiologic Health
(CDRH) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Age/Race/Ethnicity draft
guidance document14.
FDA expectations are that sponsors enroll participants who reflect the demographics for
clinically relevant populations with regard to age, sex, race, and ethnicity13. A plan to address
inclusion of clinically relevant subpopulations should be submitted for discussion to the
Agency at the earliest phase of development and, for drugs and biologics, no later than the end
of the phase 2 meeting. Inadequate participation and/or data analyses from clinically relevant
subpopulations can lead to insufficient information pertaining to medical product safety and
effectiveness for product labeling. Patient characteristics such as age, sex, geographic location
(e.g. rural), emotional, physical, sensory, and cognitive capabilities can often be important
variables when evaluating medical product safety and efficacy. However, these will not be
addressed within this guidance.
This guidance does not address the level of participation of racial and ethnic groups in clinical
trials. For questions related to the level of participation or the size of a trial, sponsors should

clinical trial design and demographic sub-groups prior to the start of a trial.

III. BACKGROUND
Over recent decades the Agency’s views, as well as those of the medical community, have evolved
regarding the collection of race and ethnicity information in clinical studies.
Prior to developing the recommendations set forth in this guidance, FDA publicly sought input
from a variety of experts and stakeholders regarding the study and evaluation of age, race, and
ethnicity in clinical studies for medical products. On April 1, 2014, FDA convened a public
hearing18 for feedback19 on the findings of the FDASIA 907 Report, to obtain input on the issues
and challenges associated with the collection, analysis, and availability of demographic subgroup
data (i.e., age, sex, race, and ethnicity) in applications for approval of FDA‐regulated medical
products. FDA also opened a public docket for further input18. On April 9, 201520 and December 2,
201521, various government agencies, physician professional societies, and patient advocacy groups
participated in public workshops to discuss strategies for ensuring diversity, inclusion, and
meaningful participation in clinical trials. This guidance reflects the concerns and
recommendations generated in these and other public fora. The following is a brief history of the
adoption of the OMB categories for reporting of race and ethnicity data by the Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA.

ethnicity for HHS programs. The report asks for the inclusion of race and ethnicity
categories in HHS funded and sponsored data collection and reporting systems in all HHS
programs, including in both health and human services. The policy was developed to (1)
help monitor HHS programs, (2) determine whether Federal funds are being used in a
nondiscriminatory manner, and (3) promote the availability of standard race and ethnicity
data across various agencies to facilitate HHS responses to major health and human
services issues. This policy, updated in 20114, clearly states that the minimum standard
categories in OMB Policy Directive 152 should be used when collecting and reporting data
in HHS data systems or reporting HHS funded statistics23.

B. ICH E5 - Guidance on Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of
Foreign Clinical Data
In 1999, as part of an international effort by the United States and others to harmonize
technical requirements for pharmaceutical drug development and regulation (the
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)), the FDA published a guidance entitled
E5 Guidance on Ethnic Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data24 (63 FR
31790, June 10, 1998), that described how clinical data collected in one region could be
used in the registration or approval of a drug or biological product in another region, taking
into account the influence of ethnic factors. The E5 guidance defines ethnic factors that
affect response in terms of both intrinsic and extrinsic issues. Because differences in ethnic
factors have the potential to affect responses in some subpopulations, the E5 guidance
provides a general framework for evaluating medicines with regard to their sensitivity to
ethnic factors. In particular, the Question and Answer Addendum to E5 introduces the
multi-regional clinical trial study design as one means to evaluate treatment response
heterogeneity and extrapolation. Multi-regional clinical trials may present special situations
for the collection and self-reporting of race and ethnicity.

C. National Institutes of Health Initiatives, Revitalization Act
In 1993, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act25 directed NIH to
establish guidelines for including women and minorities in NIH-sponsored clinical
research26. In 2001, NIH was directed27 to ensure that women and minorities were
included as participants, unless their exclusion was justified due to circumstances specified
by NIH guidelines. Furthermore, clinical trials were to be designed and carried out in a
On September 21, 2016, HHS issued the final rule on Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information
Submission (42 CFR Part 11). When fully implemented, the final rule will require the submission of race and
ethnicity information with summary results information, if it is collected during the trial. Available at

manner that would elicit information across either sex and diverse racial and ethnic
subgroups to examine differential effects on such groups.
NIH guidelines stipulate that when proposing a phase 3 clinical trial, evidence must be
reviewed to establish whether or not there are potentially clinically important sex- and
racial/ethnic-based differences in the anticipated effects of the intervention. If previous
studies support the existence of significant differences, the primary questions and design of
the trial must specifically accommodate this. For example, if men and women are thought
to respond differently to an intervention, then the phase 3 clinical trial must be designed to
answer two separate primary questions, one for men, and the other for women. When prior
studies support no significant differences for either sex or racial/ethnic subgroups with a
given intervention, then sex and racial/ethnic status will not be required as subject selection
criteria, although the inclusion and analysis by sex and racial/ethnic groups is strongly
encouraged. When prior studies neither support nor negate significant differences, then the
design of the phase 3 clinical trial will be required to include sufficient and appropriate
entry of sex and racial/ethnic participants so that valid analysis of the intervention effects
can be performed. However, the trial will not be required to provide high statistical power
for these comparisons.

D. FDA Regulations, Guidances, and Section 907 of the Food and
Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012
(FDASIA)
In 1997, OMB issued its revised recommendations for the collection and use of race and
ethnicity data by Federal agencies (Policy Directive 15)2. OMB stated that its race and
ethnicity categories were not anthropologically or scientifically-based designations, but
instead were categories that described the sociocultural construct of our society.
As outlined in FDA’s 2005 Guidance on Collection of Race and Ethnicity in Clinical
Trials11, FDA recommended the use of the standardized OMB race and ethnicity categories
for data collection in clinical trials for two reasons. First, the use of the recommended OMB
categories will help ensure consistency in demographic subset analyses in applications
submitted to FDA13 and in data collected by other government agencies. Second,
consistency in these categories may make the demographic subset analysis more useful in
evaluating potential differences in the safety and effectiveness of medical products among
population subgroups. To assess potential subgroup differences in a meaningful way, it is
important to use uniform, standard methods of defining racial and ethnic subgroups.
FDA regulations require sponsors of Investigational New Drugs (INDs)28 to report the total
number of subjects initially planned for inclusion in the study; the number entered into the
study to date, tabulated by age group, sex, and race; the number whose participation in the
study was completed as planned; and the number who dropped out of the study for any

reason. FDA regulations for NDAs require sponsors to present a summary of safety and
effectiveness data by demographic subgroups (age, sex, race, and other subgroups as
appropriate)29, as well as an analysis of whether modifications of dose or dosage intervals
are needed for specific subgroups30. FDA recommends the identification of a subject’s race
and/or ethnicity in such summaries.
Section 907 of FDASIA directed the Agency to develop a report31 “addressing the extent to
which clinical trial participation and the inclusion of safety and effectiveness data by
demographic subgroups, including sex, age, race, and ethnicity, is included in applications
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration.” Section 907 also directed FDA to develop
an action plan outlining “recommendations for improving the completeness and quality of
analyses of data on demographic subgroups in summaries of product safety and
effectiveness data and in labeling; on the inclusion of such data, or the lack of availability of
such data, in labeling; and on improving the public availability of such data to patients,
health care providers, and researchers.” In support of that Action Plan, FDA has developed
this guidance as one of the actions to improve the completeness and quality of demographic
subgroup data

Relevance of Population Subgroup Studies
Differences in response to medical products have already been observed in racially
and ethnically distinct subgroups of the U.S. population32. These differences may be
attributable to intrinsic factors (e.g., genetics, metabolism, elimination), extrinsic
factors (e.g., diet, environmental exposure, sociocultural issues), or interactions
between these factors (Huang 2008)33.
An FDA review of drug approvals between 2008 and 2013 found that approximately
one-fifth of new drugs demonstrated some differences in exposure and/or response
across racial/ethnic groups (Ramamoorthy 2015)34. For example, racial differences
21 CFR § 314.50(d)(5)(v) and (vi)(a) (October 2015). See also Integrated Summary of Effectiveness Guidance for
Industry, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/
guidances/ucm079803.pdf
30
Under 21 CFR 314.101(d)(3), the Agency may refuse to file an NDA if it is incomplete because it does not contain
information required by 21 CFR 314.50. Thus, if there is an inadequate evaluation for safety and/or effectiveness of
the population intended to use the drug, including pertinent subsets, such as sex, age, and racial subsets the Agency
may refuse to file the application. See FDA's Manual of Policies and Procedures, Office of New Drugs, Good Review
Practice: Refuse to File (October 10, 2013), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/

In fact, in June of 2005, FDA approved BiDil, the first drug approved by the Agency to treat a disease in patients
identified by race. The drug was approved for the treatment of heart failure in Black patients. The sponsor
conducted two trials in the general population that failed to show a benefit, but suggested a benefit of BiDil in Black
patients. The company then studied the drug in 1,050 self-identified Black patients and it was shown to be safe and
effective.

in skin structure and physiology can affect response to dermatologic and topically
applied products (Taylor 2002)35. Mortality rates of patients on dialysis have been
shown to differ across race and ethnicity groups36. Several studies have also shown
that Blacks respond less well to several classes of antihypertensive agents (beta
blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors) (Exner 200137 and
Yancy 200138). For cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), an important enzyme that
metabolizes drugs belonging to a variety of therapeutic areas such as antidepressants,
antipsychotics, and beta blockers, the frequency of poor metabolizers is higher in
Whites39 (7-10%) and Blacks or African Americans (3-8%) than in persons of Asian
heritage (Xie 2001)40. The incidence of anticonvulsant carbamazepine41-induced
Stevens-Johnson syndrome-toxic epidermal necrolysis has shown a strong
association with HLA-B*1502 (Chung 200442), an allele that is highly prevalent in
Asian populations (particularly Chinese) when compared to non-Asian populations
(Hung 200643and Alfirevic 200644).
Collecting data on race and/or ethnicity is critical to identifying population-specific
signals. As illustrated above, genetic studies may explain the basis for observed
differences in pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety across racial or ethnic subgroups,
and FDA has recommended collection of DNA samples in clinical trials for such
purposes45. FDA has also published guidance on enrichment strategies for selecting
participants for clinical trials based on prognostic or predicative biomarkers (such as
genotype)46.

IV. COLLECTING RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA IN
CLINICAL TRIALS
The classifications discussed below provide a minimum standard for maintaining, collecting, and
presenting data on race and ethnicity for Federal reporting purposes. Consistent with OMB
Policy Directive 15, the categories in this classification are social-political constructs and should
not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They are not to be used as
determinants of eligibility for participation in any Federal program. The standards have been
developed to provide a common framework for uniformity and consistency in the collection and
use of data on race and ethnicity by Federal agencies.
The recommendations in this section reflect the Agency's commitment to and expectations
for more consistent demographic subgroup data collection. For studies conducted both
inside and outside the United States, the Agency recommends the following process, which
is based on the current OMB Directive for collecting racial and ethnic data. These
recommendations are also consistent with the format for collecting race and ethnicity data
set forth in NIH guidance47.

A. Two-Question Format
In order to be consistent with OMB and other recommended best practices, FDA
recommends using the two-question format for requesting race and ethnicity information,
with the ethnicity question preceding the question about race. Example:
Question 1 (answer first): Do you consider yourself Hispanic/Latino or not
Hispanic/Latino?
Question 2 (answer second): Which of the following five racial designations best
describes you? More than one choice is acceptable.

B. Self-Reporting
FDA recommends that trial participants self-report race and ethnicity information and
those individuals be permitted to designate a multiracial identity. When the collection of
self-reported designations is not feasible (e.g., because of the subject’s inability to
respond), we recommend that the information be requested from a first-degree relative or
other knowledgeable source. Race and ethnicity should not be assigned by the study team
conducting the trial.

C. Ethnicity
For ethnicity, we recommend the following minimum choices be offered:

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Hispanic or Latino: A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central
American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race. The term, “Spanish origin,”
can be used in addition to “Hispanic or Latino.”
Not Hispanic or Latino

D. Race
For race, we recommend the following minimum choices be offered:
American Indian or Alaska Native: A person having origins in any of the original
peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains
tribal affiliation or community attachment.
Asian: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast
Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan,
Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Black or African American: A person having origins in any of the black racial
groups of Africa. Terms such as “Haitian” or “Negro” can be used in addition to
“Black or African American.”
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: A person having origins in any of the
original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
White: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East,
or North Africa.
We recommend offering an option of selecting one or more racial designations or
additional subgroup designations. Recommended forms for the instruction accompanying
the multiple response questions are “Mark one or more” and “Select one or more.”
Sponsors should report the number of respondents in each racial category who selfreported as Hispanic or Latino. When aggregate data are presented, data producers should
provide the number of respondents who marked (or selected) only one category, separately
for each of the five racial categories. In addition to these numbers, data producers are
encouraged to provide the detailed distributions, including all possible combinations of
multiple responses to the race question. If data on multiple responses are collapsed, at a
minimum the total number of respondents reporting “more than one race” shall be made
available (see attached NIH PHS Inclusion Enrollment Report form48)

E. Use of More Detailed Racial and Ethnic Categories
In certain situations, as recommended in OMB Policy Directive 15, more detailed race and
ethnicity information may be desired. For example, for clinical trials conducted outside
the United States, FDA recognizes that the recommended categories for race and ethnicity
were developed in the United States and that these categories may not adequately describe
racial and ethnic groups in foreign countries. Furthermore, White can reflect origins in
Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa; Asian can reflect origins from areas ranging
from India to Japan.
In situations where appropriate, FDA recommends using more detailed categories by
geographic region to provide sponsors the flexibility to adequately characterize race and
ethnicity. As outlined in the 2011 HHS Implementation Guidance on Data Collection
Standards for Race, Ethnicity, Sex, Primary Language, and Disability Status4, if additional
granularity or more detailed characterizations of race or ethnicity are collected to enhance
understanding of the trial participants, FDA recommends these characterizations be
traceable to the five minimum designations for race and two designations for ethnicity
listed in sections D and C above. Example (from the above referenced 2011 HHS
Guidance4):
Ethnicity Data Standard
Are you Hispanic, Latino/a, or of Spanish origin? (One or more categories may be selected)
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.

No, not of Hispanic, Latino/a, or Spanish origin
Yes, Mexican, Mexican American, Chicano/a
Yes, Puerto Rican
Yes, Cuban
Yes, Another Hispanic, Latino/a or Spanish origin

These categories roll up to the
Hispanic or Latino category of
the OMB standard

Race Data Standard
What is your race? (One or more categories may be selected)
a.
b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.
h.
i.
j.
k.
l.
m.
n.

White
These categories are part of the
Black or African American
current OMB standard
American Indian or Alaska Native
Asian Indian
Chinese
Filipino
These categories roll up to the Asian
Japanese
category of the OMB standard
Korean
Vietnamese
Other Asian
Native Hawaiian
These categories roll-up to the Native Hawaiian or
Guamanian or Chamorro
Other Pacific Islander category of the OMB standard
Samoan
Other Pacific Islander

Where concerns exist in the representation of race or ethnicity categories, sponsors
are encouraged to discuss the race or ethnicity issues with the appropriate review
division.

F. Use of the term “nonwhite”
The term “nonwhite” is not acceptable for use in the presentation of Federal Government
data. It should not be used in publication or text of any report.

V. PRESENTATION OF CLINICAL TRIAL RACE AND
ETHNICITY DATA
For INDs, NDAs, and BLAs, we recommend the submission of tabulated demographic data
based on the Demographic Rule10 13 for all clinical trials using the characterizations of race
and ethnicity described in this guidance. Beginning in May 2017, CDER and CBER will
require marketing applications to be submitted electronically49. CDER and CBER use the
eCTD as the standard for their electronic applications. When submitting an electronic
application, presentation of demographic data is described in ICH M4E eCTD Guidance
(section 2.7.4.1.3 and table 2.7.4.2)50, which suggests a tabular display of demographic
characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race) by treatment group (e.g., active drug, placebo)51. With
regard to the description of race and ethnicity, the categories that are suggested previously in
this document (Section IV) provide more detail than those suggested in the ICH M4E eCTD
guidance. FDA recommends that sponsors provide the level of detail described in Section IV
of this guidance. For relevant device submissions, we recommend following the guidance
presented here and, when finalized, the recommendations in the draft guidance documents
Evaluation and Reporting of Age, Race, and Ethnicity Data in Medical Device Clinical
Studies14.

Step_4.pdf

The ICH M4 eCTD document suggests specific kinds of demographic information to be collected as a part of a
clinical trial, but does not provide rigid specifications on how the data should be presented, noting, for example, that
“if relative exposure of demographic groups in the controlled trials differ from the overall exposure, it may be useful
to provide separate tables.” Choices of how best to summarize demographic data depend on the nature of the data to
be conveyed. For some trials, it may be useful to show the distribution of one demographic characteristic within a
second demographic (e.g., the age distribution of men and women enrolled in a set of controlled trials).
