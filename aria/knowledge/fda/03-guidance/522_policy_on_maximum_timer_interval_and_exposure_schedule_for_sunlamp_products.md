TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS, 
IMPORTERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS O F  
SUNLAMP PRODUCTS. 
SUBJECT: POLICY ON MAXIMUM TIMER INTERVAL AND EXPOSURE SCHEDULE FOR 
SUNLAMP PRODUCTS. 
BACKGROUND: 
The amended performance standard for sunlamp products (21 CFR 1040.29) was 
published i n  the September 6, 1985 issue of the Federal Register and w i l l  
become effective September 8, 1986. 
Any sunlamp product manufactured on o r  
a f t e r  t h a t  date must comply with the amended standard. 
The ten (10) minute maximum timer interval requirement was removed 
from the o r i g i n a l  performance standard since there are newer sunlamp 
products on the market f o r  which ten (10) minutes is not appropriate. 
The maximum timer i n t e r v a l  now depends on the i n t e n s i t y  and s p e c t r a l  
d i s t r i b u t i o n  of u l t r a v i o l e t  (W) 
radiation emission of each individual 
model of sunlamp product and must not exceed the maximum recommended 
exposure time provided on the required product warning label. Therefore, 
sunlamp product manufacturers must develop an exposure schedule and 
e s t a b l i s h  the maximum recommended exposure tlme (and therefore the 
maximum timer i n t e r v a l )  based on the characteristics of t h e i r  particular 
products. 
The intended purposes of a sunlamp product timer are t o  provide 
f o r  r e l i a b l e  control of exposures and t o  l i m i t  acute (and delayed) damage 
from unintentionally long exposures. 
However, the maximum timer setting; 
should a l s o  allow f o r  s e l e c t i o n  of exposure times needed t o  build up and 
maintain a tan. 
The maxlmurn timer i n t e r v a l  is i n  no way t o  be considered 
a s  a s a f e  l i m i t ;  a l l  u l t r a v i o l e t  radiation is potentially hazardous. 
The standard requires the manufacturer t o  provide an exposure schedule 
i n  t h e  product warning label. 
The purpose of the exposure schedule 
is t o  allow a person t o  gradually build-up skin pigmentation and t o  
maintain a tan while controlling the r i s k  of acute injury and delayed 
adverse effects. 
Since the W radiation dose that causes a barely 
discernible pink coloration (minimal erythema1 dose o r  MED) is not the same 
f o r  d i f f e r e n t  skin types, t h e  exposure schedule f o r  f i r s t  time users w i l l  
depend on t h e  s k i n  type of t h e  user. 
Furthermore, suberythemogenic doses 
of W radiation received at 24 hours i n t e r v a l s  i n i t i a l l y  lead t o  lowering; 
of t h e  erythema and tanning thresholds. Therefore, the exposure schedule 
and maximum recommended exposure t i m e  should be constrained by the 
p o t e n t i a l  f o r  erythema a s  w e l l  as the quantity of radiation necessary t o  
achieve and maintain a tan. 
POLICY : 
The Center f o r  Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) w i l l  use the 
following c r i t e r i a  t o  evaluate the adequacy of the exposure schedule and 
t h e  recommended maximum exposure t i m e  (and therefore the maximum timer 
i n t e r v a l ) :

1) The maximum recommended exposure time (and maximum timer 
interval) must not exceed a value which will result in an exposure 
of four (4) times the minimal erythema dose (MED) for untanned 
Type I1 skin (always burns, then tans slightly). 
This is based on 
the CDRH Erythema Action Spectrum [proposed action spectrum of 
Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) modified by CDRHI. 
See Appendix A for the action spectrum and weighting factors and 
equations needed to derive it. 
The formula for determining the recommended maximum exposure . 
time,"T " in seconds is : 
e 
2 
Te = 6 2 4 5 1 ~ ~  where Standard MED = 1565lM at 296nm 
CViRi 
vi = weighting factor 
Ri = irradiance in W/M 2 
2) The recommended maximum exposure time must not exceed a value 
which will result in an exposure of four (4) times the minimal 
melanogenic dose (MMD) for untanned Type I1 skin. This is 
based on the melanogenic action spectrum developed by Parrish 
et a1 (1982). See Appendix B for this action spectrum. 
The formula for 
" T ~ "  
in seconds 
determining the recommended maximum exposure time, 
is : 
2 
where standard MMD = 459J/M at 296nm 
J~ = weighting factor 
tRi = irradiance in W/M 2 
3) The recommended exposure schedule should provide for exposures 
of no more than 0.75 MED three times the first week, gradually 
increasing the exposure the following weeks until maximum tanning 
has occurred (approximate,ly four weeks total) and then provide for 
maintenance of a tan by biweekly or weekly exposures of up to 
four(4) MEDs or four(4) MMDs, whichever is less. 
CDRB believes that the above criteria balances the need to limit acute (and 
delayed) damages from unintentionally long exposure and the need to provide 
for single exposure durations adequate to achieve and maintain a tan.
