  Clinical Development Programs for 
Drugs, Devices, and Biological Products Intended for the 
Treatment of  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)  
 
 
 
I. 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This guidance is intended to assist developers of drugs, biological products, and medical devices 
intended for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The document discusses the types of 
label claims that can be considered for such products and provides guidance on the clinical 
development programs to support those claims. 
 
The central purpose of label claims is to inform prescribers and patients about the documented 
benefits of a product.  Because RA is a chronic, symptomatic disease that can result in a variety 
of outcomes with different chronologies, severities, and overall patient effects, any number of 
different clinical outcomes could provide the basis for a label claim. 
 
Relief of symptoms — the signs and symptoms claim —  is a central therapeutic effect of most 
RA therapeutics marketed circa 1997.  The claim structure proposed in this document, however, 
incorporates a wider range of patient outcomes than previously allowable RA claims.  As a 
result, guidance is provided for demonstrating patient benefit of greater magnitude than is needed 
for a claim of symptomatic relief.  For example, the claims major clinical response, complete 
clinical response, and remission (the same criteria as complete clinical response while off all 
antirheumatic drugs) reflect enhanced effects on the signs and symptoms of disease.  The claim 
prevention of structural damage is documented by various radiographic techniques.  The claim 
prevention of disability is intended to reflect longer term benefits on disease course.  The claims 
and clinical development programs discussed in this draft  guidance for industry represent the 
current views of Agency rheumatologists about achievable and clinically relevant overall 
outcomes that can be evaluated in clinical trials. 
 
Traditionally, RA therapeutics have been categorized as disease modifying antirheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) or as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  As a result of the ongoing 
search for more effective therapeutics that have a positive impact on the natural history of the 
 
1 This guidance has been prepared by the Rheumatology Working Group of the Medical Policy 
Coordinating Committee (MPCC) of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research (CBER), and the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). This guidance 
document represents the Agency’s current thinking on Clinical Development Programs for Drugs, Devices, and 
Biological Products Intended for the Treatment of  Rheumatoid Arthritis.  It does not create or confer any rights for 
or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  An alternative approach may be used if such 
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.

disease, promising new therapies are currently being tested in the clinic.  Many of the novel 
agents under study for the treatment of RA defy categorization by putative mechanism of action.  
As a result, the usefulness of classifying them in the traditional manner may be limited.  For this 
reason, information being provided in labeling about the onset and duration of action and the 
durability of response of therapeutic interventions is intended to reflect the data that were 
gathered in clinical trials.  Because of this, some of the claims described in this document 
incorporate response duration times within their structure. 
 
Over the past decade, there has been a search for better measures to describe patient outcomes in 
RA clinical trials.  A number of organizations, including the European League Against 
Rheumatism,  the International League Against Rheumatism, the American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR), and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials 
(OMERACT) group, have attempted to define core groups of measures, as well as composite 
indices, that describe patient outcomes.  As a result of these efforts, several new measures have 
been described and validated with clinical data.  With the hope that these measures will provide 
more useful information about patient outcomes, this document provides guidance about the use 
of these new measures in clinical trials to support label claims.   
 
One outcome measure that is not fully relied upon as a stand-alone claim is general health-
related quality of life (HR-QOL).  Since RA affects so many domains of a patient’s life, it is 
hoped that such HR-QOL measures may provide an integrated assessment of the long-term 
impact of intervention.  However, not enough information is available on the performance of 
general HR-QOL measures in longer term arthritis trials.  The incorporation of such measures in 
planned trials is encouraged. 
 
 
II. 
NEW CLAIMS FOR THE TREATMENT OF RA 
 
A number of new claims are now being evaluated in clinical trials during drug development.  
Descriptions of the claims and acceptable outcome measures to support each claim are discussed 
in the following sections. 
 
A. 
Reduction in the Signs and Symptoms of RA 
 
This claim is intended to reflect the demonstration of symptomatic benefit or benefits that 
includes improvement in signs of disease activity as well as symptoms.  Reduction in 
signs and symptoms may ordinarily be the initial claim granted for marketing approval. 
Ordinarily, this claim is established by trials of at least six months' duration, unless the 
product belongs to an already well-characterized pharmacologic class (e.g., NSAIDs) for 
which trials of three months' duration are sufficient to establish efficacy for signs and 
symptoms.  Six-month trials are desirable for several reasons.  First, RA is a disease of 
long duration.  Interventions that provide only short-term, time-limited benefit are 
unlikely to have overall value to patients.  In addition, products with the potential to 
elicit antibody formation should be assessed for durability, since antibodies may block 


 
 
 
 
3 
effectiveness.  In evaluating signs and symptoms, methods that evaluate response over 
time are preferable to methods that incorporate only the baseline value and the final 
observation, unless there is a reason to weight symptoms at the last visit more than 
intermediary symptoms.  Acceptable outcome measures that would support claim A 
include: 
 
l. 
Validated composite endpoints or indices of signs and symptoms 
 
These composites may be used to construct categorical endpoints for patient 
success or failure.  For example, the Paulus criteria (1990) or the ACR definition 
of improvement (ACR 20)2 could be used to assess a patient's response. 
 
Illustration:  Success for each patient in a six-month trial could be defined as 
meeting the criteria for improvement over baseline in at least four of six monthly 
observations and not dropping out because of toxicity. 
 
2. 
Well-accepted sets of signs/symptoms measures 
 
The four measures previously recommended in the 1988 CDER Guideline for the 
Clinical Evaluation of Anti-Inflammatory and Antirheumatic Drugs (FDA 1988) 
—  joint counts:  pain, tenderness, and swelling and global assessments:  
physician and patient — or the ACR core set are examples of well-accepted sets 
of signs and symptoms measures.  The criteria for success and the methods for 
statistical analysis should be prospectively defined and agreed upon.  For 
example, historically, in using joint counts and global assessments, a statistically 
significant difference between the control and the treatment group in change from 
baseline in at least three of the four measures has been used as the criterion for a 
successful trial.  However, as stated above, comparison of only the baseline and 
last observation may not be the best way to construct the analysis since this 
method leaves out all intervening efficacy observations. 
 
For both the above measures, using 66- or 28-joint count is appropriate (Smolen 
1995). 
 
B. 
Major Clinical Response 
 
This claim is intended to reflect the demonstration of a continuous six-month period of 
success by the “ACR 70," which is defined entirely parallel to the ACR 20, except 70 
 
2 The ACR definition of improvement (ACR 20) is 20 percent improvement in tender and swollen joint 
counts and 20 percent improvement in three of the five remaining core set measures:  patient and physician globals, 
pain, disability, and an acute phase reactant (Felson 1993, 1995). For specific details on individual measures, e.g., 
disability, acute phase reactant, refer to Felson 1995.  


 
 
 
 
4 
percent improvement, rather than 20 percent, is needed for the component assessed.  
This claim is based on statistically significant improvement in response rates by the 
continuous six-month ACR 70 definition compared to background therapy in a 
randomized control group.  For reference, the number of patients satisfying various 
definitions of ACR responses from ACR 20 to ACR 70 in two historic databases are 
given in Appendix A of this document.  Trial duration should be a minimum of seven 
months for an agent expected to have a rapid onset of action and longer for agents with 
less prompt effects.   
 
C. 
Complete Clinical Response 
 
This claim is intended to describe a therapeutic benefit of greater magnitude than the 
major clinical response claim.  Complete clinical response and remission (see below) 
are identically defined as a continuous six-month period of both remission by ACR 
criteria and radiographic arrest (no radiographic progression [Larsen 1977] or modified 
Sharp methods [1985]).  Complete clinical response connotes a benefit requiring 
ongoing drug therapy; remission is defined by the same result while off all antirheumatic 
drugs.  The 1981 ACR remission criteria (Pinals 1981) require at least five of the 
following:  morning stiffness less than 15 minutes, no fatigue, no joint pain by history, 
no joint tenderness or pain on motion, no swelling of joints or tendon sheaths, and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) less than 20 for males or less than 30 for females. 
The duration of trials designed to support this claim will vary depending upon the rate of 
onset of effect of the test product.  For all but the most rapid-onset agents, trials of one 
year’s duration should be planned.  Longer trials may be needed for very slow-acting 
agents.   Trials evaluating complete clinical response would use a categorical endpoint 
(patient complete response or treatment failure) as the primary outcome measure.  
 
D.  
Remission 
 
This claim is defined as both remission by ACR criteria and radiographic arrest (no 
radiographic progression by Larsen or modified Sharp method) over a continuous 
six-month period while off all antirheumatic therapy.  Remission is not intended to 
imply cure, and a remission claim could be granted even if patients relapse after six 
months or more of remission.  The duration of trials designed to support a remission 
claim will vary, depending upon the rate of onset of effect of the test product.  Ordinarily 
such trials should be at least one year in duration, and longer trials may be needed for 
slow-acting agents. 
 
E. 
Prevention of Disability 
 
This claim is intended to encourage long-term trials in RA.  Currently, the Health 
Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (Fries 1982) and the Arthritis Impact Measure Scales 
(AIMS) (Meenan 1982) are adequately validated measures for use as the primary 
outcome measure in these trials.  Studies should be two to five years in duration.  


 
 
 
 
5 
Sponsors seeking this claim should plan to have demonstrated previously, or to 
demonstrate concomitantly, improvement in signs and symptoms.  Since the full effect 
of RA on a patient is not captured without the use of more general HR-QOL measures, a 
validated measure such as the SF-36 should also be collected and patients should not 
worsen on these measures over the duration of the trial.  
 
F.  
Prevention of Structural Damage 
 
Prevention of structural damage is an important goal of RA therapy.  Trials evaluating 
this outcome should be at least one year in duration. 
 
The following are examples of outcome measures that could be used to support 
prevention of structural damage claims. 
 
1. 
Slowing X-ray progression, using either the Larsen, the modified Sharp, or 
another validated radiographic index 
 
Radiographic claims should be based on comparisons of films taken at one year 
(and subsequent yearly points) with those taken at baseline.  All randomized 
patients should have films at both time points, regardless of whether they are 
continuing treatment.  Patients dropping out of the trial should have films taken 
at that time.  Prespecification of the handling of dropouts is especially important 
in these trials. 
 
2. 
Prevention of new X-ray erosions — maintaining an erosion-free state or 
preventing new erosions 
 
Trials evaluating this claim would ordinarily use a categorical endpoint to assign a 
status of progression or nonprogression to each patient, comparing the final state 
to the baseline state. 
 
3. 
Other measurement tools (e.g., MRI) 
 
Other measures, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or ultrasonography, 
could be employed.  However, because of the technique's potential for 
identifying small, albeit statistically significant changes, the magnitude of the 
difference that would reflect actual patient benefit is unclear and needs to be 
established. 
 
Because slowing of radiographic progression does not in itself define a patient benefit, it 
is expected that the claim of prevention of structural damage would be submitted for an 
agent that has been shown (previously or concomitantly) to be effective for one of the 
other claims (e.g., prevention of disability).  However, some agents are not intended to 
affect acute inflammation, but are designed to prevent or slow joint destruction by other 


 
 
 
 
6 
means.  The first indication that such an agent is clinically useful might be slowing of 
radiographic progression.  Nevertheless, the ultimate goals of slowing joint destruction 
are to improve symptoms and to preserve functional ability.  Therefore, slowing 
radiographic progression of disease is considered a surrogate marker for overall patient 
benefit in RA. 
 
Under 21 CFR 314, subpart H and 21 CFR 601 subpart E, FDA can approve drugs 
intended to treat serious and life-threatening diseases based on an effect on a surrogate 
marker, provided that certain criteria are met and that there is a commitment to define the 
actual clinical benefit of the agent in studies completed after marketing.  A 
demonstration of significant slowing of radiographic progression in a seriously affected 
population of RA patients would qualify for consideration under these regulations.  
Sponsors are urged to consult with the relevant FDA staff before embarking on a clinical 
program based on these regulations.   
     
One example of a significant effect on radiographic progression might be the 
demonstration, in a randomized controlled trial, of maintenance of an erosion-free state in 
a large majority of treated patients when control patients develop multiple erosions. The 
methods of measurement of the radiographic finding, the magnitude of change considered 
to be clinically significant (whether a by-patient measure or treatment group means), and 
the methods of statistical analysis should be prospectively defined in the clinical protocol, 
and the sponsor should seek Agency concurrence with the plan for evaluating efficacy.  
The use of the accelerated approval pathway would necessitate timely completion of 
phase 4 studies using acceptable clinical endpoints evaluating signs and symptoms or 
prevention of disability.  It is anticipated that these investigations would be extensions of 
the one-year studies used for the  accelerated approval.   
 
 
III. 
CONSIDERATIONS IN RA PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
 
The following information on preclinical and early clinical product development pertains 
primarily to pharmaceuticals (drugs and biologics).  Except in the first two sections, the general 
principles outlined below also apply to devices.  For information specific to the development of 
devices, refer to the section in this document entitled "Special Considerations for Medical 
Devices."  Developers of products that combine therapeutic modalities (e.g., biologics and 
devices) may request assistance from FDA in designating a lead center for review of the product.  
Such requests should be submitted to:  Office of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman (HF-7), 
Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. 
 
Frequently encountered issues in RA product development include: 
 
1. 
Selecting appropriate in vitro (animal or human systems) and in vivo animal models for 
screening potentially active agents. 


 
 
 
 
7 
2. 
Designing and performing appropriate preclinical safety studies to support the use of a 
new molecular entity in human volunteers or patients. 
 
3. 
Balancing the potential need for therapeutic intervention early in the disease course with 
the need to avoid exposing patients with mild disease to agents that have toxicities or 
little record of safety. 
 
4. 
Identifying the potential risks associated with combination therapies, particularly those 
with shared target organ toxicity or potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. 
 
5. 
Designing adequate and practical long-term safety monitoring. 
 
6. 
Designing trials that definitively show clinical efficacy. 
 
The following sections discuss approaches to the above issues.   
 
A. 
Preclinical Considerations 
 
This section focuses on preclinical issues that are specific to the clinical development of 
antirheumatic therapies.  In designing toxicity studies and the timing of such studies, 
consultation with the Agency is recommended concerning the current recommendations 
and guidances that address drugs, devices, and biological products.  Guidance on 
preclinical safety testing, addressing the need for and design of toxicokinetic, 
reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity studies has been developed by 
the International Conference on the Harmonization (ICH) of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals.  Because biologics can pose unique challenges in animal study design 
(for example, species-specific binding or immunogenicity of human proteins in animals), 
a specific ICH document is available that addresses the safety evaluation of 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6 1997).3   
 
1. 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
Animal studies of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion are 
important during the early investigational new drug (IND) phase to aid in toxicity 
study interpretation, but need not all be completed prior to phase 1.  Generally, 
for initial studies in humans, determining pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, such 
as area under the curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax ), and half-life (t1/2 ) 
in animals, is sufficient to provide a basis for predicting safe clinical exposure.   
   
 
 
 
In the past, preclinical testing of combinations of drugs (or biologics) to be used 
in patients with RA has not often been done prior to the initial clinical trials.  
 
3 ICH documents are available via the FDA Internet home page at http://www.fda.gov/cder or cber. 


 
 
 
 
8 
However, given the variety of drugs, including NSAIDs, analgesics, 
corticosteroids, and DMARDs currently used to treat RA patients, it would be 
useful to consider this testing of common combinations both preclinically and 
clinically.  In addition, to evaluate potential interactions, information on the 
impact of concomitant therapies on pharmacokinetics may be needed to optimize 
dosing regimens and to identify potential safety concerns.  Metabolic interactions 
often may be assessed in an in vitro system using animal or human liver slices, 
microsomal preparations, or purified P450 enzymes (FDA 1997). 
 
Interactions may also result from the presence of individual- or  
 
disease-specific factors, such as rheumatoid factor, which may bind to 
various monoclonal antibody therapeutics; in such cases in vitro binding studies 
that identify patients with high titers may be useful in identifying patients who 
may exhibit unique pharmacokinetics or patterns of clinical response. 
 
2. 
Biological activity  
 
The biological activity of a potential antirheumatic therapy should be established 
using multiple preclinical model systems (i.e., in vitro, in vivo, ex vivo).  In vitro 
screens can use cells or tissues derived from animal or human sources and are 
generally used to select candidate drugs that have a desired effect on a molecular 
target.  Such assays can also be used to devise appropriate bioassays for the 
selected agent.  Animals, either healthy, with rheumatic disease (spontaneous or 
induced), or genetically modified, are subsequently used to determine whether the 
biological effect can be demonstrated in vivo.  While the in vivo system used 
should mimic one or more aspects of rheumatoid arthritis or its etiology, it is 
expected that each animal model will have limitations.   
 
a. 
In vitro 
 
Data from in vitro studies can be useful in defining the potential 
mechanism of action of a drug or biologic and for determining relevance 
of a particular animal species for in vivo assessment of activity or safety.  
These data are especially useful if a potential surrogate marker can be 
identified in preclinical studies.  For example, if the product is intended to 
affect the CD4 receptor on lymphocytes, this receptor can be used as a 
surrogate marker for both activity and certain toxicities. 
 
Several in vitro tests could be used, depending on the mechanism of action 
of the drug or biologic.  For example, binding assays may be useful for 
developing receptor antagonists or monoclonal antibodies.  In vitro 
functional assays (e.g., platelet and neutrophil aggregation) may be useful 
tests for identifying inhibitors of inflammatory mediators.   Enzymatic 
assays (e.g., in vitro or ex vivo inhibition of cyclooxygenase, 


 
 
 
 
9 
lipoxygenase, and phospholipase) may also be useful for determining 
selectivity for the inhibition of isozymes.  
 
b. 
In vivo 
 
Selection of animal models should be made on the basis of  
pharmacodynamic (PD) responses, similarity of animal disease etiology to 
clinical disease, and/or to define mechanism-based toxicity.  Ideally, 
products that are targeted for a subset of arthritic patients should be 
developed in an experimental model(s) that is most relevant to that subset.  
For example, rats are not sensitive to drugs that inhibit 5-lipoxygenase.  
Therefore, mouse or rabbit models are more relevant  to evaluate the anti-
inflammatory activity of leukotriene inhibitors. 
 
The development of rheumatic disease models to allow screening for potential RA 
candidate drugs is encouraged.  The following examples are meant only to 
illustrate some models in current use and are not intended to suggest excluding 
the use of others. 
 
Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA): 
 
Collagen-inducted arthritis is often considered to be a suitable model for studying 
potential drugs or biologics active in human rheumatoid arthritis because of the 
involvement of localized major histocompatibility, complete class II-restricted T 
helper cell activation, and the similarity of histopathological lesions.  
Radiographs of joints affected by CIA often show erosive changes similar to those 
seen in human rheumatoid arthritis.  The progressive arthritis often results in RA-
like joint deformity and dysfunction.  Anticollagen antibodies, which occur in 
some patients with RA, develop in the CIA model. 
 
The CIA model has been useful for assessing immunosuppressants and steroid 
hormones as well as inhibitors of inflammatory mediators.  Since this model can 
be induced in several animal species, it may be especially useful for evaluating 
drugs that are species-specific (e.g., leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase 
inhibitors).  In addition, although functional tests are not routinely used in this 
model, incorporation of measures of mobility and joint function may enhance the 
predictive value of the model. 
 
Naturally occurring arthritis or autoimmune response: 
 
MRL/lpr mice, Biozzi H mice and DBA/1 mice have been used to examine the 
onset of drug-induced tolerance and immunosuppressant drug effects on 
autoimmunity.  The MRL/lpr mouse model has been useful for evaluating 
immunosuppressants and hormones. 


 
 
 
 
10 
Rat carrageenin-induced acute model of inflammation: 
 
This model has been useful in assessing anti-inflammatory activity of 
cyclooxygenase inhibitors.  Most of the animal models that involve inflammation 
in the paw may be used for measuring antiphlogistic action of a drug. 
 
Adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats (AA): 
 
 
AA in rats has been frequently used for screening nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs and inhibitors of inflammatory cytokines as well as antimetabolite-like 
immunosuppressants. 
 
Streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis: 
 
This model has been used for developing cytokine inhibitors. 
 
Experimental organ transplant in animals: 
 
This model has been used to identify the activity of immunosuppressants and 
antimetabolites, particularly those directed at cytolytic cellular immune processes. 
 
Transgenic animal models: 
 
A number of transgenic animal models are being developed for the study of 
rheumatoid arthritis and may prove useful over the next decade.  Some examples 
include transgenic mice that carry genes for the env-Px region of the human T cell 
leukemia virus type I genome, human TNF, CD4, and HLA B-27. 
 
3. 
Toxicology 
 
Preclinical toxicology studies of a drug or biological product are designed to 
characterize general and specific toxicity using dosing routes and regimens as 
similar as possible to the proposed clinical trials with consideration of the 
demographics and disease status of the intended patient population.  For instance, 
the prevalence of RA is high in females.  Therefore, reproductive toxicity studies 
should be completed early in clinical development to support the inclusion of 
women of childbearing age in early phases of clinical trials.  The need for 
reproductive studies for biological products is likely to be case-specific due to 
complications arising from immunogenicity and species selectivity.  Therefore, 
standardized study designs, such as those recommended in the ICH reproductive 
toxicology guidance, may not be feasible or clinically relevant for biologics (ICH 
S5 1994).  The need, and specific designs, for these studies may be discussed 
with Agency review staff. 
 


 
 
 
 
11 
Immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents administered to RA patients as 
monotherapy or in combination raise concerns about the adverse effects of 
prolonged immunosuppression.  For example, malignancies (i.e., lymphomas) are 
a known risk of long-term, nonselective immunosuppression used for treatment of 
graft recipients.  Investigational drug-related opportunistic infections and 
mortality related to immunosuppression have occurred in RA patients.  Sponsors 
are encouraged to identify and use animal models that assist in selecting drug 
candidates that selectively inhibit cells and processes responsible for RA.  
 
  
Antirheumatic drugs are often used in combination in an attempt to improve 
outcomes and minimize toxicities.  However, drug interactions may result in 
increased toxicity, even at lower than previously evaluated doses of either agent.  
This concern is especially evident for agents that have long half-lives or 
nonselective activity, or for drugs that share common target organ toxicity.  
Preclinical toxicity studies that evaluate the use of combined agents may be 
helpful in predicting clinical safety hazards.  The duration of toxicity dosing of 
animals is usually linked to patient dosing regimens.  Development and 
validation of in vitro or whole animal models is encouraged to address concerns 
regarding short- or long-term toxicity and to identify surrogate markers for patient 
immunocompetence.   
 
B.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Strategies 
 
In vivo pharmacokinetic studies should be used to evaluate drug disposition and 
metabolism, degree of linearity and accumulation, dose proportionality, and, for oral 
dosage forms, food interactions (Peck 1992).  Some of these data can be gathered in a 
single study designed to evaluate a number of parameters.  During formulation 
development, bioequivalence studies linking formulations may be recommended.   
 
A particular concern with biological agents is the development of antibodies that may 
accelerate drug clearance or alter its distribution, resulting in changes in therapeutic 
benefit over time, or following repeated courses of treatment.  To address this 
consideration, it is desirable for sponsors to build into their repeat-dose clinical protocols 
a coordinated evaluation of drug levels, receptor saturation, antidrug antibodies, and 
clinical responses.  Optimally, these assessments would be conducted at the initiation of 
therapy and at several time points over the course of therapy.  The presence of antidrug 
antibodies and their role in altering drug exposure, clinical activity endpoints, or adverse 
events would be evaluated.  The goal of an integrated analysis of these parameters is to 
provide data to guide drug dosage or schedule changes to optimize therapeutic benefit.  
The best time for conducting these pharmacokinetic studies is prior to phase 3, before 
commitments have been made regarding dose and schedule. 
 


 
 
 
 
12 
  
Because polypharmacy is common during the treatment of rheumatic disorders, in vitro 
binding studies with blood from patients with active disease should be used as a 
preliminary screening tool for potential displacement reactions. 
 
For products that may interact with rheumatoid factors (e.g., monoclonal antibodies), the 
frequency of patients with rheumatoid factor reactive to the antibody, as well as the effect 
of interactions on the pharmacokinetics of the product, should be evaluated. 
 
  
C.   
Considerations in Phase 1 Trials 
 
For general information on clinical development pertaining to most drugs and biological 
products, see the CDER guidance General Considerations for the Clinical Evaluation of 
Drugs (FDA 1978).  
 
The term phase 1 has two connotations:  one refers to the earliest, first-time-into-humans 
trials, while the other encompasses studies of pharmacokinetics, metabolism, drug 
interactions, special populations, and the other clinical pharmacology trials as described 
above.  It is expected that both kinds of phase 1 trials ordinarily will be conducted during 
the clinical evaluation of therapies for RA.  This section is primarily intended to discuss 
issues related to the first time people are exposed to the drug (including to a particular 
dose level, combination, or duration of therapy). 
 
1.   
Settings and investigators 
 
First-time-into-humans phase 1 studies should be carried out in institutions with a 
full range of clinical and laboratory facilities, and the patients should be kept 
under close observation.  It is desirable that the trials be under the direction of 
physicians with experience in early drug development and rheumatology, or that a 
team of investigators combining experience in rheumatology and clinical 
pharmacology be employed. 
 
2.   
Subjects 
 
First-time-into-humans drug trials are frequently conducted in healthy volunteers.  
Such studies are predicated upon the ability to perform and to interpret the results 
of preclinical animal tests.  If the preclinical testing does not reveal potential 
mutagenic or immune system effects, or potentially serious effects at or near the 
expected therapeutic range, testing in volunteers may be initiated.  However, for 
products that have potentially serious toxicities, it may be appropriate for initial 
testing to be performed in patients with some potential to benefit.  This has 
created challenges in selecting an appropriate initial patient population. 
 
For products that have been tested in relevant preclinical toxicity evaluations and 
have been found relatively safe (without the potential for mutagenic, immune 


 
 
 
 
13 
system or other serious effects at the proposed doses), trials may be initiated in 
healthy volunteers.  However, if significant effects have been demonstrated or 
might be possible, selection of an appropriate patient population is necessary.  It 
is recommended that patients meet the ACR criteria for both diagnosis and 
activity of RA and be without other serious medical conditions.   Patients with 
minimal disease are sometimes not appropriate for the same reasons that the 
testing is not initiated in healthy volunteers.  Patients with devastating RA may 
also not be the best starting population because of the medical complications of 
their disease.  In addition, they may be less likely to respond to therapy.  
 
There is ongoing epidemiologic work on identifying markers of increased risk in 
RA.  These could be useful for identifying patients with poor prognoses, who 
might be considered for very aggressive treatments of potential high toxicity (e.g., 
immunoablative therapies followed by stem cell transplants).  Application of 
epidemiologic studies may allow a very aggressive treatment to be restricted to a 
subset of RA patients who have a demonstrated shortened life span due to their 
disease (e.g., subjects with greater than 30 affected joints or a HAQ score with 
fewer than 75 percent of questions answered “without difficulty”). 
 
When the characteristics of the agent suggest that it may potentially have long-
term gonadal effects, it is desirable that men and women not wishing to parent 
children be chosen for phase 1 studies.  
 
3.  
Trial design 
 
Ordinarily, initial phase 1 studies are sequential dose escalation trials, in which 
safety and tolerance at a specific dose is established before exposing additional 
subjects to a higher dose.  A single dose is almost always tested first, followed by 
repeated dose studies; however, this design is influenced by the type of agent 
used.  Although escalating the dosage to a clearly determined maximum-
tolerated-dose (MTD) will aid future trial design, in some instances it is not 
medically prudent to try to fully characterize the MTD.  Additionally, for some 
products, an MTD may be undefinable. 
 
The starting dose chosen is often a no-adverse-effect dose (determined by 
interspecies milligrams (mg)/meter square/day dose conversion from animal to 
human).  For biologics, the initial dose chosen is often one thought to have no 
adverse biological effect, with caution regarding the possibility of relative species 
specificity and comparing receptor avidity between test species and humans.  
Conservative dose escalations (e.g., half log or less) are usually recommended.   
 
4.  
Concomitant therapy 
 


 
 
 
 
14 
Use of low-dose corticosteroids (up to 10 mg prednisone equivalent daily) and 
NSAIDS may ordinarily be continued in phase 1 trials.  Concomitant therapy 
with methotrexate and similar agents should be avoided in initial phase 1 trials of 
all novel antirheumatic drugs, biologics, and devices because of the difficulty of 
differentiating the toxicity of the novel agent from that of the co-administered 
product.  
 
Physicians now prescribe methotrexate and similar agents earlier in the course of 
rheumatoid arthritis.  Recruiting adequate numbers of patients not taking these 
agents may be difficult.  Approaches that may allow the use of methotrexate and 
similar agents in later phase 1 trials include (a) obtaining reassuring evidence of 
lack of toxicity from relevant animal models in which co-administration occurred 
and (b) starting at doses significantly lower than the no-adverse-effect level of the 
single agent as determined by earlier phase 1 studies or preclinical studies, or 
both.  Such proposals should be discussed in the planning stages with Agency 
staff.  
 
5. 
Observations 
 
a.   
Safety 
 
The standard batteries of safety observations have been described 
elsewhere (ICH S5A 1994).  However, additional types of safety 
observations may be necessary (e.g., tests of effects on cellular and 
humoral immune function or host defenses).  For products with the 
potential for effects lasting long after administration, or for delayed 
toxicity, appropriate follow-up should be designed.  For example, phase 1 
studies of agents used to deplete or modify the function of T-cell subsets 
should be designed to carefully assess both the short- and long-term 
effects on number and functional status (e.g., delayed type hypersensitivity 
responses) of cell populations and other pertinent pharmacodynamic 
assays during therapy and during follow-up. 
 
It is also desirable to incorporate individual patient adverse event 
stopping/withdrawal rules into protocol designs.  In addition, it is often 
advisable to incorporate into trial designs rules for trial stopping or trial 
modification in case adverse events are observed.  For example, dose 
escalation rules should be clearly defined in dose-finding studies, with 
provisions for enrollment of additional patients at or below the dose-
causing toxicity if possible significant adverse events are observed.  
 
It is desirable to develop a standardized toxicity grading scale for use in all 
trials of a product based on the known and suspected toxicities of the 


 
 
 
 
15 
product or of the drug class.  This may improve consistency of adverse 
event reporting and allow more accurate comparisons among trials. 
 
b.  
Efficacy    
 
Developing an understanding of the agent's therapeutic potential in early 
trials is highly desirable for efficient product development.  This may be 
attempted in phase 1, but can ordinarily be achieved only by performing 
controlled trials.  RA responses in open trials are of little value in 
indicating efficacy.  Consideration should be given to the more modest 
goal of determining whether the pharmacological effect predicted from the 
preclinical development is present (proof of concept).  
 
D. 
Considerations in Phase 2 Trials 
 
During phase 2, larger, often longer, term trials are employed to better define the dose- 
and exposure-related activity and toxicity of the agent.  Enough information should be 
generated to ensure that the phase 3 trials can be conducted safely and with a probability 
of success.  In addition, phase 2 trials should solidify a total drug development strategy 
to ensure that, after the phase 3 safety/efficacy trials are done, all of the information 
needed for registration will have been gathered, including an appropriate safety database, 
clinical pharmacology, dose-response data, the exploration in special populations (e.g., 
renal failure, hepatic failure, pediatric patients), and information on drug interaction with 
agents expected to be co-administered.   
 
There is nothing to preclude conducting additional phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies 
and phase 2 trials while the phase 3 development is ongoing.   
 
The following issues are important for phase 2 trials in RA: 
 
1.   
Trial design   
 
Dose finding is a central challenge of phase 2 development.  Once a reasonably 
safe range of doses has been established, randomized, parallel-arm dose-
comparison trials are ordinarily recommended.  The use of a placebo arm is 
desirable for several reasons.  First, if no difference is found among doses, there 
is usually no other way to determine whether all doses were equally effective or 
equally ineffective.  Second, if a dose-response trend is found, the placebo arm 
may indicate the possible magnitude of the observed effect.  If use of a placebo is 
impossible, designs should include wide dose ranges or durations, or repetitions.  
Active controlled designs that specify an arm with a well-characterized, known 
therapy can also be very useful. 
 


 
 
 
 
16 
Signs and symptoms measures may be used for dose-finding studies, but it is 
possible that separate dose-finding studies may be needed for longer term 
endpoints. 
 
For agents that are thought to have prompt onset and rapid offset of effect, 
alternative designs, including crossover and titration designs, may be useful, 
although historically this has not been the case.  Trials of two or more doses that 
permit liberal titrating per the patients' responses are unlikely to clearly 
demonstrate a dose response because these titration designs result in a blurring of 
any existing dose distinction.  
 
The desirability of identifying a range of doses with acceptable toxicity and 
reasonable activity for study in phase 3 cannot be stressed enough. 
 
2.   
Safety   
 
Every RA investigational therapy raises safety concerns.  Whenever there is a 
potential for significant toxicities, long-lasting or delayed-onset, it is desirable to 
design the phase 2 studies to provide a group of patients with longer term follow-
up preceding the larger phase 3 studies.  Provisions for long-term follow-up can 
be helpful in addressing issues raised during premarket review (e.g., potential for 
immunosuppression, opportunistic infections, neoplasia, and induction of 
autoimmune disease).  Standard toxicity grading scales and stopping rules are 
also desirable in phase 2. 
 
3.   
Additional development aspects 
 
a.   
Concomitant therapy 
 
Before starting phase 3 trials, an evaluation of the test product's interaction 
with other agents likely to be used by the target population should be 
performed.  Initial information can be established based on metabolic 
pathways, studies of in vitro systems, animal or human pharmacology 
studies, or drug interaction studies.  This type of information helps in 
directing areas in need of clinical evaluation.  When products are 
intended to be tested as combination therapy with the investigational 
agent, substantial information on interactions and safety of 
co-administration should be developed in phase 2. 
 
b.   
Sex effects 
 
Most RA trials have predominantly female enrollment.  Sponsors should 
evaluate whether the observed safety and efficacy findings are restricted to 
women or can be also extrapolated to male subjects.  This may be 


 
 
 
 
17 
accomplished by subset analyses from trials, PK data, or other information 
(FDA 1993).   
 
E.   
Efficacy Trial Considerations 
 
The overall goal of phase 3 work is to demonstrate the efficacy of the product in 
convincing controlled trials and to accrue a sufficient safety database.  Efficacy trial 
protocols should contain an analytical plan that precisely identifies the primary 
comparison(s) to be made, the criteria for success of the trial, and the statistical tests that 
will be used. Protocols should be designed to generate data that support desired labeling 
claims.  Any additional planned, ongoing, or completed trials that are also intended to 
generate data supporting the claim should be identified.  
 
1.   
Global considerations  
 
 
    
 
      a. 
Patient selection  
 
Activity of disease:  Unless some other specific subgroup is targeted, 
patients enrolled in efficacy trials should at a minimum meet the disease 
definition and disease activity as defined by ACR criteria.  Consultation 
with the Agency on the generalizability of claims derived from trials with 
significant limitations on entry criteria is recommended.  
 
To enhance the power of the trial, strategies to improve the chances of a 
response to therapy are often employed.  Some designs incorporate an 
attempt to select active patients by withdrawing background treatment and 
allowing patients to flare.  Only individuals with sufficiently high scores 
are enrolled.  The relevance of this type of observed flare is questionable, 
and its ability to predict the normal course of active disease has not been 
established.  Many patients randomized to placebo in such studies exhibit 
the characteristic response of rapidly returning almost to baseline without 
further treatment.  In addition, when patients undergo blinded withdrawal 
from therapy within these trials, similar dramatic flares are not observed.  
This raises the question of whether there is an expectation bias on the part 
of patients, who have been told about the flare procedure, and 
ascertainment bias on the part of investigators, who wish to have patients 
meet the entry criteria and enroll in the study.  These uncertainties and 
instabilities around the outcome measures used in such trials should be 
kept in mind when employing these designs. 
 
A proportionately smaller, but nevertheless noticeable and prompt, 
regression to the mean is noted in the joint scores of patients required to 
have a certain minimum value for trial entry in trials not employing a flare 


 
 
 
 
18 
strategy.  This means that patients, on the whole, will not actually have 
disease as active as anticipated when the entry criteria are set.  
 
Subgrouping patients by disease markers:  RA is likely composed of a 
number of more or less distinct diseases delineated by a common genetic 
background, corresponding clinical manifestations, similar serologies, and 
responses to therapy and prognoses.  The study of RA possibly may be 
made more efficient with the use of markers with clear prognostic 
significance as entry criteria to increase patient homogeneity.  Novel 
epidemiologic and molecular genetic approaches may lead to 
identification of even more subgroups.  However, prospective studies are 
first needed to confirm the clinical usefulness of new purported prognostic 
factors.  Where existing data do support markers as prognostic indicators 
(risk factors), such as the presence of rheumatoid factor, erosive or 
vasculitic disease, and DR4 homozygosity, they can be taken into 
consideration in the design of trials, as can factors known to affect 
treatment responses.  Although in some cases such studies could limit 
generalizability and impact labeling of the final product, it is also possible 
that such targeting could improve the risk/benefit profile.  
 
     
b. 
Concomitant antirheumatic therapy 
  
 
 
 
Studies in RA patients, except in those with very mild disease, are carried 
out in the presence of concurrent active therapies, including steroids, 
NSAIDS, hydroxychloroquine, etc.  This concurrent therapy creates 
numerous challenges in patient selection, toxicity monitoring, and clinical 
trial design.  For example, since methotrexate therapy is used to treat 
many RA patients, it is inevitable that new agents will be used in 
combination with methotrexate in clinical practice unless a 
contraindication exists.  Therefore, unless a prohibition on concurrent 
methotrexate is supportable, data regarding use of the investigational agent 
in combination with methotrexate are needed to evaluate the potential for 
immunosuppression from combination therapy.  Other agents should be 
similarly evaluated.   
 
In addition, patients can be categorized according to their prior responses 
to standard therapy.  Varying trial designs may help assess the response 
of different response categories to an investigational therapy.  For 
example, with respect to methotrexate use, the RA population can be 
divided into five groups:  (1) methotrexate noncandidates — disease too 
mild or too early for methotrexate; (2) methotrexate candidates — disease 
sufficiently (or will become sufficiently) active to justify methotrexate; (3) 
methotrexate successes — disease reduced to negligible amounts; (4) 
methotrexate failures — clear drug failures, for inefficacy or tolerability, 


 
 
 
 
19 
and (5) methotrexate partial responders — with considerable residual 
disease despite methotrexate.  Each of these groups might be considered 
separately for candidacy for an investigational agent and with respect to an 
appropriate trial design.  If only a subpopulation of RA patients (e.g. 
methotrexate nonresponders) is studied in a particular trial, the results 
strictly reflect efficacy in that group only, but they may, of course, imply 
something about efficacy in other groups.  Single trials in various 
responder subpopulations could be supported by positive results in other 
subpopulations.  Any planned subpopulations should be clinically 
distinguishable.  Sponsors should consult Agency personnel when 
planning a clinical development program contemplating an RA claim that 
is limited to a subpopulation with the disease. 
    
c.   
Other concomitant therapies 
 
Most patients with RA are taking concomitant medications.  Use of 
medicines unlikely to influence treatment outcomes (e.g., 
antihypertensives) should simply be recorded, although investigators 
should be alert for possible drug interactions.  Obtaining information 
during clinical development on co-administration of the test medication 
and expected concomitant medications is desirable.  The following 
approaches may be considered in dealing with arthritis medications or 
analgesics.    
 
Prohibit use:  This strategy may result in noncompliance or an increased 
number of dropouts. 
 
Incorporate protocol-specified use, with monitoring:  With this strategy, 
additional analgesic use (and possibly other arthritis medications) may be 
used according to protocol-specified criteria.  In addition, for long 
duration studies, protocols should address (1) whether intra-articular 
steroids are permitted and, if so, for how long assessments of the involved 
joint are excluded from analysis; (2) the manner in which stress doses of 
corticosteroids for surgery, etc., are to be handled; and (3) how soon after 
such doses protocol assessments would be allowed. 
 
Design analgesic use, or its quantitative consumption, as (part of) an 
efficacy endpoint. 
 
Define use of more arthritis treatments as (part of) an efficacy endpoint. 
 
     
d.   
Stratification 
 


 
 
 
 
20 
Randomization is intended to balance populations for confounding 
variables; however, there is always a chance that randomization may fail 
to achieve balance, particularly in smaller trials.  It may be advisable to 
stratify known (or highly suspected) major risk factors to ensure their 
balance across arms.  Any factor whose influence on the outcome is 
suspected to be as strong as the treatment’s influence should be considered 
for stratification (e.g., erosive disease, presence of rheumatoid factor).  
An often overlooked risk factor is the patient's past therapeutic history.  
(See statistical section for further discussion.) 
 
e. 
Blinding 
 
Because most RA outcome measures have a high degree of subjectivity, 
the highest confidentiality in patient and assessor blinding should be 
sought to achieve a credible inference.  Blinding may be compromised if 
there is not an approximate parallelism in time to onset, nature of 
response, and toxicity profile between active and controlled interactions.  
Trials should have parallel (e.g., “double dummy”) dosing in all arms 
when possible so that a drug requiring frequent dose manipulations does 
not threaten the blind.  If arm specific treatment adjustments are 
necessary (e.g., per monitored drug levels), these can be done by an 
unblinded (and sequestered) third party to maintain patient and assessor 
blinding.  In this case, parallel changes should be made as dummy 
adjustments in the control arm to preserve blinding.  Similarly, if the 
blind is likely to be compromised by infusion-related events or other 
features of the treatment protocol, critical treatment endpoints, such as 
joint counts, should be assessed by an independent party with no 
knowledge of the subject’s history. 
 
f. 
Effects of dropouts and noncompliance.   
 
It is important that trials be designed to minimize dropouts and the 
attendant information loss.  Traditionally, recommended RA trial designs 
have focused on eliminating sources of variability, for example, extra pain 
medications, and intra-articular injections.  Often, these interventions 
were defined as major protocol violations, requiring that the patient be 
dropped from the study.  There is a trade-off between patient retention 
and tolerance of variability in RA trial design.  Protocols demanding rigid 
adherence may yield uninterpretable results because of dropouts and 
noncompliance emanating from patient and investigator intolerance of the 
requirements.  On the other hand, protocols permitting any kind of 
additional intervention may likewise be so confounded as to defy 
interpretation.   
 


 
 
 
 
21 
The following strategies may help minimize loss of information: 
 
i. 
Use screening or run-in periods so that patients are randomized to 
treatment groups only after their eligibility and commitment are 
confirmed. 
 
ii. 
Thoroughly train investigators and study personnel to minimize 
inappropriate enrollments, protocol violations, and other deviations 
that would decrease the ability to assess trial outcomes.  
 
iii. 
Include dropouts in the definition of the endpoint, as in a time to 
defined treatment failure, or a defined by-patient success or failure.  
A sufficiently late time point should be chosen as the endpoint to 
avoid the situation where the time course for response differs 
between two active therapies in a trial, which can introduce bias. 
 
One example of this approach would be to use a protocol-defined 
response rate as the primary endpoint, wherein dropouts due to 
lack of efficacy are classified as nonresponders.  With this type of 
endpoint, the criteria for classification as a nonresponder should  
be clearly and prospectively defined.  The use of this type of 
endpoint could be justified in situations where there are robust 
phase 2 data suggesting drug responsiveness at a defined point 
after initiation of therapy and durability of that response.  In this 
case, one could define the primary analysis as a comparison of the 
proportion of patients with an ACR 20 response at six months.  
The protocol could specify that if no improvement compared to 
baseline were seen on two consecutive study visits after two 
months on protocol, the subject would be declared a nonresponder.  
Experience will determine whether this approach effectively limits 
information loss due to dropouts. 
  
iv. 
Make provisions for following patients who have stopped 
experimental treatment.  Options include allowing a 
protocol-specified crossover to a standard therapy for patients 
meeting predefined criteria for treatment failure. 
 
v. 
Allow more flexibility in treatment options during the study.  
Some designs that have been used include allowing dose 
adjustment of the comparator arm (assessor and patient blinded), 
allowing add-on therapy for patients meeting predefined criteria 
for inadequate response, and allowing a limited number of joint 
injections, with elimination of that joint from assessment. 
 


 
 
 
 
22 
2. 
Trial designs in RA 
 
Clinical trials in RA can be designed in a variety of ways.  More than one claim 
can be pursued in the same trial, and claims can be submitted singly or together.  
Trials can be designed to test a difference — demonstrating that the 
investigational product is superior to control (placebo, lower test dose, another 
active agent), or they can be designed to test no difference — demonstrating that 
the product is adequately similar in efficacy to active control.  Placebo-, dose-, 
concentration- or active-controlled designs can be used. 
 
Because the persuasiveness of trials showing a difference is, in general, much 
greater than that of equivalence trials, it is highly desirable for a claim to be 
convincingly demonstrated in at least one trial showing superiority of the test 
agent over placebo or active control.  If a claim of superiority over a specific 
comparator is sought,  rather than just straightforward efficacy, the claim should 
be substantiated by two adequate and well-controlled trials showing superiority.  
Such trials can also be the basis for demonstrating the product's efficacy. 
 
a.    
Superiority trials   
 
The standard two-arm, investigational agent versus placebo design has 
been the most common RA design and is the most straightforward.  The 
details of trial design will depend on the population tested.  Patients with 
mildly active RA taking only NSAIDS, who have never been treated with 
an additional class of therapy, may be enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial 
with continuation of NSAID background therapy; however, patients doing 
poorly on NSAIDs alone are usually not appropriate candidates for 
placebo-controlled trials.  The same considerations apply to patients who 
are partial responders to, or who have failed, various other treatments.   
 
Alternatives to the two-arm difference design are a standard dose-response 
study and a superior-to-active-control hypothesis.  These designs may 
accommodate the need to provide active treatment to patient groups where 
randomization to placebo is infeasible. 
 
b.   
Equivalence trials 
 
Equivalence trials are designed to demonstrate that the test drug is 
adequately similar to an active control.  This is done using a 
prospectively defined equivalence test, specifying to a 95 percent 
confidence level that the real difference between test and control is smaller 
than some predetermined amount.  Achieving similar point estimates of 
efficacy of two agents is not a demonstration of equivalence.  
 


 
 
 
 
23 
Equivalence trials can serve two purposes.  First, they can be used to 
supply evidence for a simple efficacy claim.  Second, they can be used to 
pursue a specific equivalence to drug X claim.  Both purposes could also 
be pursued in the same trial.  The important point to note is that the 
strength of the evidence may need to be stronger for a claim of 
equivalence to drug X than for a simple efficacy claim.  Thus, the 
equivalence test may differ, depending on which claim is intended.  
Currently, the equivalence standard that is appropriate for a given trial in 
RA will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  As noted above, this test 
may be more stringent if a claim of equivalence to drug X is being 
pursued.  Additionally, the test of equivalence may be constructed 
differently if a placebo arm is present, since the presence of the placebo 
allows estimates of absolute and relative drug effect size. 
 
In either case, the statistical test for equivalency needs to be quantitatively 
described in the protocol.  Under either the pursuit of a simple efficacy 
claim or the pursuit of a specific equivalence to drug X claim, the basis of 
the decision on an appropriate test remains, fundamentally, a clinical one.  
It represents a consensus, in that particular circumstance and for that 
particular claim, on what small potential difference can be considered 
clinically insignificant, to allow the treatments to be considered clinically 
equivalent. 
  
There is considerable experience in the interpretation of active-controlled 
trials in clinical situations where the response to the intervention is high.  
As an example, antibiotics are evaluated by the Division of Anti-Infective 
Drug Products (CDER, FDA).  For these products, the magnitude of the 
potential difference permitted in an equivalence determination depends on 
the response rate of the standard treatment.  For example, a new agent 
being compared to standards with response rates of 90 percent or more 
will be allowed a 10 percent window to provide confidence that the 
difference between the standard response rate and the test response rate is 
no more than 10 percent.  Technically, this means the 95 percent 
confidence interval of the difference must lie fully to the right of 10 
percent.  If the standard treatment is known to have an 80 to 90 percent 
response rate, a 15 percent window is used.  These equivalence tests were 
designed for trials without a placebo arm and for clinical situations where 
the placebo response is known to be very low. 
  
Treatment response rates in RA are often in the vicinity of only 50 percent 
(depending, of course, on the endpoint used) with placebo rates of about 
20 percent, so the clinical decision for an allowable small difference may 
differ from that with antibiotic therapy.  At this time, the decision will 
have to be individualized for each trial.   


 
 
 
 
24 
A major problem in equivalency trials lacking a placebo arm is ensuring 
that both treatments are equally effective, rather than equally ineffective.  
A number of the agents that are approved for RA have fairly small effects 
and may fail to show efficacy when tested against a placebo.  
Comparative trials intended to show equivalence to such treatments, when 
not anchored by a placebo control group, may lack credibility.  Thus, it is 
desirable in equivalence designs to select highly effective comparative 
agents.  If possible, use of a third (placebo or lower dose) arm, so that a 
treatment difference can be shown, is a desirable strategy in equivalence 
trials.  This arm would not necessarily have as many patients or as long a 
duration as the active comparators.  If a placebo arm is present, both the 
test and active arms need to statistically exceed placebo for a finding of 
equivalence to have meaning. 
 
Strict attention to numerous aspects of trial design and conduct are 
important to ensure accurate inferences from equivalency trials.  Design 
decisions regarding patient population, dosing, and efficacy and safety 
assessments should be done in a manner that is unbiased against the 
control to ensure a fair comparison.  Furthermore, attention to certain 
problems in trial conduct, such as minimizing dropouts, noncompliance, 
and missing data is essential to the reliability of the inference.  These 
aspects of trial conduct may obscure differences and lead to a false 
conclusion of equivalence.  This is the opposite of their effect in a 
difference design to show superiority, where they work against trial 
success.  
 
In any particular development, the choice of trial design depends on many 
factors.  Since controlled evidence showing a difference is more 
persuasive than that showing equivalence, greater efficiency (fewer 
patients or shorter exposures) is available with development strategies 
using trials employing maximal differences between trial arms.  
Optimally, this means placebo controls, with the requisite background 
therapy, given to all patients.  
 
c.    
Trial designs novel to the study of RA 
 
Although not used traditionally in the study of new RA treatments, the 
withdrawal design can be considered in certain circumstances.  The 
withdrawal design is sometimes used to assess efficacy.  In this design, 
patients in both arms of a study are treated with the investigational agent, 
which is then blindly withdrawn from one arm, after which patient 
outcomes are compared.  Showing that patients taken off the 
investigational drug get worse demonstrates effectiveness.  Natural 
endpoints for withdrawal designs are time to (predefined) worsening using 


 
 
 
 
25 
standard time-to-occurrence statistical tests or a simple comparison of 
proportion of outcomes in the two arms.  Withdrawal studies may be 
performed with both arms on background therapy. 
 
There are a number of caveats about withdrawal designs.  If the product is 
very toxic, so that only a small (tolerant) subset of the original population 
remains at the end of the trial and is available for the double-blind 
withdrawal phase, the generalization of any inference from the withdrawal 
design is limited to that tolerant subset.  Additionally, it should be noted 
that, if a drug induces habituation or tolerance, withdrawal or rebound 
phenomena may make withdrawn patients worse even though drug 
therapy did not have a beneficial effect.  
   
3. 
Analytical Issues 
 
a.   
Handling dropouts   
 
Historically, RA trials have suffered from information loss due to 
dropouts.  Dropouts probably never occur randomly, and rarely occur 
fully independent of the treatment being tested, so there is always the 
possibility that dropouts introduce a bias.  This problem is common in 
many randomized trials.  Methods for analyzing the effects of dropouts 
have been proposed, but none is fully adequate.  
 
The problem of dropouts is not resolved by using an intent-to-treat (i.e., all 
randomized patients included) analysis with an imputation by last-
observation-carried-forward (ITT/LOCF) or by showing that both the 
ITT/LOCF and PP/OC (per protocol completers/observed cases only) 
analyses concur, although these approaches may increase confidence in 
the results.  It should also be noted that there are other methods of 
modeling missing data, for example, see Little and Rubin (1987).   Such 
modeling methods require assumptions that are nonverifiable by existing 
data. 
 
The effects of dropouts should be addressed in all trial analyses to 
demonstrate that the conclusion is robust. One trial design approach is 
following all patients, including dropouts, to the planned trial endpoint, 
even if postdropout information is confounded by new therapy, and 
performing an analysis including these patients.  Another approach 
involves the worst case rule:  assigning the best possible score to all 
postdropout placebo patients and the worst score to all postdropout 
treatment patients, then performing an analysis including these scores.  
 
b.   
Comparison to baseline outcome measures 


 
 
 
 
26 
 
A phenomenon frequently observed in RA, as well as in other conditions, 
is that patients who stay in trials do better than those who drop out:  
responders do better than nonresponders.  This is true both for placebo 
groups and active treatment groups.  If observations of the disease were 
made exclusively from clinical trials, one might conclude that the natural 
history of the disease is inexorable improvement.  This phenomenon is 
attributable to preferential dropout of worsening patients (a phenomenon 
not adequately compensated for in LOCF analysis) as well as regression 
to the mean.  The problem is exacerbated in flare designs, where all 
patients have major improvement regardless of treatment status.  This fact 
makes comparison-to-baseline outcome measures difficult to assess, since, 
very often, much of the improvement noted has no relationship to a 
treatment effect.  For these reasons, active-controlled trials not 
incorporating a placebo arm and using comparisons to baseline may be 
extremely difficult to interpret, especially if a flare design is employed.  
In any case, success in any trial implies improvement over control. 
 
4. 
Statistical Considerations in Efficacy Trial Design 
 
It is advisable to discuss the design and analysis with the FDA review team prior 
to embarking on a study.  In addition, FDA’s Guideline for Format and Content 
of the Clinical and Statistical Sections of New Drug Applications (1988) contains 
useful information. 
 
a. 
Randomization/stratification 
 
Randomization is intended to allocate patients to treatment groups to avoid 
bias and to ensure that statistical procedures can be appropriately applied. 
 
In some clinical trials, there are known factors that are at least as 
influential in controlling the observed severity of disease as the drugs 
being studied.  Stratification may be  used to avoid relying on 
randomization properties to balance patient assignment for these factors.  
Stratification is implemented by constraining simple randomization to 
balance the assignment of patients to treatment groups for the chosen 
stratification factors.   
 
Every phase 2 and phase 3 study protocol should contain a randomization 
section.  All constraints imposed on the randomization should be 
explicitly identified.  It can then be inferred, when a stratification factor 
or sample size allocation constraint is not mentioned in a protocol, that 
there exists no corresponding randomization constraint.  This applies to 
whether patients are blocked to balance treatment assignment for time of 


 
 
 
 
27 
patient entry into study and to the more obvious stratifications on center 
and baseline.   
 
Because stratification implies constraints on randomization, studies that 
have been stratified for certain factor(s) should account for these factors in 
the statistical analysis section.  The protocol-defined analysis should be 
implemented for each study. 
 
There are also statistical procedures to address bias in treatment group 
comparisons by adjusting for factors (covariates) that, like the 
stratification factors, are to be prespecified in the protocol or by using a 
mechanism to determine a fixed number of covariates prespecified.  It is 
important to prospectively identify covariates (or criteria for choosing 
covariates) in the protocol.  In addition, statistical adjustment procedures 
should be used with care and include appropriate verifications of 
assumptions. 
 
In deciding whether to stratify randomization in all clinical trials, practical 
judgment is required.  There are reasons to choose stratification and 
reasons to choose statistical adjustments.   
 
The first advantage of stratification is that it avoids possibly major 
statistical adjustments of differential treatment effects.  Stratification 
would essentially eliminate the effect of such adjustments before analysis 
began.  Second, although stratification and statistical adjustment 
procedures are both designed to remove bias in estimated treatment 
effects, stratification is usually more powerful.  This is because 
stratification leads to smaller variances of estimated treatment effects than 
does statistical adjustment without stratification.  Finally, the inclusion of 
stratification factors into a statistical analysis model should result in 
increased power to detect effectiveness. 
 
Stratification becomes increasingly clumsy as the number of strata 
increases and, consequently, the available number of randomizable 
patients per cell decreases.  In this case, it is logistically simpler to not 
stratify, but to rely on statistical methods to adjust for these factors.   
 
The best approach may be to combine stratification, applied to a limited 
number of the most influential prognostic factors, with statistical 
modeling.  This protocol-defined statistical modeling would both account 
for stratification and be used to adjust for the effects of a parsimonious 
number of the most important remaining factors. 
 
b. 
Identification of primary efficacy variables   


 
 
 
 
28 
Each phase 2 or phase 3 study protocol should identify the primary and 
secondary efficacy variables.  Primary efficacy variables are critical to the 
identification of the effectiveness of the product.  Secondary efficacy 
variables are those that support the validity of the primary variables but 
are less critical in deciding if this product is effective.  It is helpful, but 
not necessary, that statistical evidence of efficacy be shown for secondary 
efficacy variables.   
 
c. 
Prespecification of statistical analysis 
 
Statistical analysis of clinical endpoints is part of the process for obtaining 
consistent and convincing evidence of product efficacy.  These statistical 
analyses should not be data driven.  This is implemented by identifying, 
in each study protocol, before data are available for analysis, a sufficient 
description of the statistical analyses of primary efficacy variables so that 
an independent statistician could perform the protocol analyses.  A brief 
description of the statistical analyses should include but not necessarily be 
limited to specifying:  (1) the level of significance to be used; (2) whether 
statistical tests of hypothesis or confidence intervals will be 1- or 2-sided; 
(3) whether interim analyses are planned and, if so, how the tests of 
hypotheses and confidence intervals will be adjusted to account for interim 
looks at the data; (4) the mathematical expression of the statistical 
model(s) used; (5) the minimal statistical results needed to demonstrate a 
successful outcome; (6) the treatment of missing values and dropouts; (7) 
the method used for controlling type I error rates for multiple primary 
efficacy variables; and (8) the method used for making multiple treatment 
comparisons. 
 
d. 
Multiple endpoints 
 
There has often been a clinical argument for using multiple endpoints to 
assess primary evidence of effectiveness in RA.  The theoretical bases for 
such combination endpoints are the focus of an area of ongoing statistical 
research.  For example, for the four measures recommended in FDA’s 
previous guidance (FDA 1988), trial results were considered to support a 
conclusion of effectiveness when statistical evidence of efficacy was 
shown for at least three of the four measures:  physician global 
assessment, patient global assessment, swollen joint count, and painful 
joint count. 
 
Multivariate statistical methods are also available for analyzing the set of 
primary efficacy variables.  Procedures are being developed for 
inferences derived from multiple endpoint results. 
 


 
 
 
 
29 
Efficacy variables can be combined within patients (composite endpoint).  
Such a fixed combination of efficacy measures should be well defined in 
the study protocol.  Composite efficacy variables have the advantage of 
avoiding several statistical and inferential difficulties associated with 
multiple endpoints. 
 
e. 
Dropouts 
 
Dropouts are patients who, after a certain period of time in a trial, fail to 
provide clinical efficacy data scheduled to be collected by the protocol.  
Frequently, dropouts occur for reasons related to taking the assigned test 
drug (adverse effects or lack of efficacy).  Since dropouts do not usually 
occur randomly, the remaining patients constitute a biased subsample of 
the patients originally randomized.  Unless trial dropouts can be assumed 
to be random (which is rare), no model used to impute their effects can be 
verified. 
 
Methods used to handle dropouts, such as LOCF and completers analyses, 
are not fully satisfactory even though they have often served as the basis 
for determining that adequate statistical evidence of efficacy has been 
provided.  The LOCF method usually does not preserve the size of the 
test, either for the comparison of final observations or for the comparison 
of rates of change.  Alternative methods include growth curve analysis 
and random effects regression.  These are also susceptible to informative 
censoring — that is, dropping out depends on the value of the response.  
It is often useful to show that the results hold for a variety of analyses (i.e., 
they are robust). 
 
f. 
Trials with several treatment groups/multiple comparisons 
 
In clinical trials involving more than two treatment groups, a statistical 
multiple comparison procedure controlling the experiment-wise error rate 
to 5 percent or less should be applied.  In essence, there should be overall 
statistical evidence of a treatment main effect before attempting to make 
specific drug comparisons relevant to proposed drug labeling.   
 
g.  
Trials simultaneously used to pursue more than one claim 
 
A single trial can be used to pursue simultaneously more than one claim; 
an adjustment of significance level for multiple analyses is not always 
necessary.  If the order of testing the hypotheses is prespecified, then no 
penalty need be taken.  For example, when a trial is simultaneously 
pursuing a six-month signs and symptoms claim and a twelve-month x-ray 
claim, if the trial wins by the first hypothesis tested — signs and 


 
 
 
 
30 
symptoms — then the x-ray hypothesis can be calculated without an  
adjustment penalty.   
 
h. 
Interim analyses 
 
Interim analyses are those that, for any purpose, are repeatedly performed 
on accumulating clinical trial efficacy data.  Methods have been 
developed to compensate for the fact that multiple tests (including interim 
analyses) alter the true significance level.  The study protocol should state 
whether such interim analyses are planned or not.  Should interim 
analyses be planned, the plan and its implementation should be described 
in the protocol. The description should include who will have access to the 
interim data, the scheduling of these interim analyses, the method to be 
applied for adjusting significance levels, and the corresponding time 
sequence of significance levels at which statistically significant results 
will be claimed.   
 
Although an interim analysis may not be thought to affect the subsequent 
collection of efficacy data, interim analyses carry the additional risk that 
the blinding or conduct of a study may have been compromised. Statistical 
methods cannot compensate for any unblinding and bias that may result 
from gathering the information needed to perform an interim analysis.  
Finally, if any major protocol change becomes necessary (e.g., a new 
therapy becomes available), it is important that such a change not be 
influenced by those unblinded to data. 
 
i. 
Sample size 
 
Failure to recruit an adequate number of patients is a major reason why an 
effective product may fail to meet established statistical criteria for 
efficacy, independent of whether the purpose was to show superiority or 
comparability of treatment effect.  The method for determining the 
sample size should be stipulated in sufficient detail to permit independent 
verification of the computation.  This should include identifying the 
efficacy variable that the sample size determination is based on, the 
magnitude of the hypothesized clinical difference, the standard deviation, 
the power, the significance level, and the sidedness of the statistical 
procedure(s) described in the analysis plan.  Furthermore, the size of the 
clinical difference chosen should be justified, and the rationale for the 
choice of the efficacy variable used to determine sample size should be 
discussed.  For comparability from one trial to the next, it is optimal to 
use the same efficacy variables as were used to power earlier studies.  
 
j. 
Trials to show clinical equivalence 


 
 
 
 
31 
The words clinical equivalence are used in a much narrower sense than 
these words might imply to the casual reader.  First, there is often no 
intent to show equivalence of two or more drugs across the broad 
spectrum of pharmacologic effect.  Rather, focus is on showing no 
clinically relevant differences for one or possibly more variables that are 
to be clearly identified in advance.  The concept of equivalence is two-
sided in that if, for any outcome measure, one drug is sufficiently different 
from another drug, then these drugs are no longer deemed equivalent in 
that variable. 
   
To show equivalence, the variables serving to measure these effects of 
interest should be defined in the protocol.  For each efficacy variable for 
which clinical equivalence of effect is sought, the magnitude of a 
difference deemed to be inconsequential should be identified.  The 
clinical data should then show, with 95 percent confidence, that this 
predefined difference is not exceeded.   
 
Inference based on trials to show equivalence is inherently less convincing 
than inference based on trials to show the existence of a difference.  
Often, clinical trials do not detect treatment differences that are known to 
exist.  In such cases, statistical methods may then seemingly provide 
evidence of equivalent effect (e.g., to placebo).   
         
 
 
 
 
 
 
k.  
Appropriateness of the statistical methodology 
 
The appropriateness of the statistical model should be assessed, including 
checking for outliers and determining if distributional assumptions 
(usually normality) are met and if common variance assumptions hold.   
 
l.  
Site effects 
 
If the patients have been stratified and randomized by site, the analysis 
should include a site effect.  There may be a site-by-treatment interaction 
reflecting the degree to which the treatment varies across sites.  This is 
often notable when there is a great variation in enrolled patients across 
sites.  Site-by-treatment interaction should be explored.  
 
F.   
Safety Analysis 
 
The approach to evaluating adverse event data and laboratory values has traditionally 
differed from that used to evaluate efficacy.  The purpose of safety evaluations is usually 
not to test a specific hypothesis, but to examine the pattern of effects and to detect 
unusual or delayed events.  Analyses using cumulative occurrences, scatter-plots of 
laboratory values (baseline versus on-therapy), or other techniques may be helpful.  The 


 
 
 
 
32 
safety profile should address to what extent adverse events (drug reactions or lab values) 
depend on duration of drug exposure, dose level, coexisting medical conditions, or 
possible drug interactions.  Incidence rates should be calculated using denominators that 
reflect the period of drug exposure for the population at risk.  Cumulative incidences 
(hazard rates, instant probabilities) do a better job representing the temporal pattern of 
drug effects than do prevalence rates; comparative cumulative incidence tables — drug 
versus active control(s), versus placebo — also are very helpful to practitioners.  Critical 
incidence rates should be described with 95 percent confidence intervals. 
 
Ensuring safety during the development of a drug, biologic, or device can be optimized 
by adequate preclinical evaluations and the development of a standardized clinical safety 
assessment system.  Elements of a successful safety assessment system include the use 
of predefined standard terminology (such as the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities Terminology) and criteria to define and assess adverse events (AEs), 
approaches to optimize AE detection, and appropriate safety stopping rules in trials.  It is 
also useful to capture AE severity (grades 1 [mild], 2 [moderate], 3 [severe], or 4 [life-
threatening]), outcomes (such as the need for therapy and whether resolution or death 
occurred), treating physician assessment of association with study agent (remotely, 
possibly, or probably related), and impact on the trial (none, dose of agent delayed or 
changed, or patient withdrawn from further therapy).  Stopping rules, determined by the 
risk/benefit ratio for the agent in the study population, are desirable both for individual 
patients (a single grade 3-4 AE is often used) as well as for the clinical trial, especially in 
dose-escalation studies. 
  
1. 
Intrinsic trial design considerations 
 
An attempt should be made to characterize the patient population susceptible to 
adverse drug effects.  Some extraneous factors, such as variations in soliciting 
and reporting adverse events among the investigators and differences in the 
definition of normal ranges for lab values among different laboratories can 
complicate the safety data.  Since adjustment for their effects may be difficult, 
precautions should be taken in the design stage of the trial to minimize the 
influence of these factors by preparing clear and specific instructions for data 
collection and monitoring adherence of the investigators and the laboratories to 
the protocol.  Procedures for normalizing laboratory data, for example, may be 
employed.  As previously mentioned, developing standardized toxicity grading 
scales that can be employed in all studies may also be useful. 
 
2. 
Adequate numbers 
 
The ability to detect adverse experiences is dependent on the number of patients 
evaluated in the clinical trials and in clinical usage.  In studies of 300 or more 
patients having adequate exposure to the investigational drug, it is expected (with 
95 percent confidence) that at least one patient will manifest an adverse event 


 
 
 
 
33 
having an incidence rate of 1 percent or greater.  Smaller studies fail to meet 
even this minimal incidence detection standard.  In most cases, however, it is 
possible to combine studies of equal duration to establish adverse experience 
rates. 
 
For any chronically administered product, the safety database should include at 
least 300 patients treated with the maximally recommended dose for at least six 
months and at least 100 patients treated for at least twelve months (ICH E1A 
1995).  Larger and/or longer safety databases may be advisable for agents with 
known or potential safety problems. 
 
 
IV.  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS  
 
Although there are similarities between RA trial designs for drugs and biologics, biologics have 
special characteristics and problems that should be considered in their development.   
 
A.  
Species Specificity  
 
The schemes used traditionally in determining the initial human dose may not pertain to 
biologics.  Biological agents may behave differently in animal models than in humans, 
depending on the physiologic relevance and avidity for the receptor of the ligand in the 
animal compared to the human.  Immunogenicity may also be species specific.   
 
B.  
Dose Responses 
 
The dose-response curve may be steep and/or even hyperbolic, and an agent can be quite 
toxic at levels just above those thought to show efficacy. 
 
C.  
Toxicity Response 
 
The toxicity response may be highly unpredictable and potentially very dangerous and 
may include the risk of disease worsening.  Agents may have narrow therapeutic 
windows.  Biologics have the potential for disruption of immunologic and physiologic 
processes.  Monoclonal antibodies to cellular epitopes of the immune system, for 
example, or to TNF receptors may cause serious morbidity at doses only slightly higher 
than those that are efficacious with markedly less toxicity. 
 
D.  
Product Homogeneity  
 
This often plays a critical role in activity and toxicity of a compound.  Product 
alterations can greatly affect physiologic activity.  Thus, biologics should demonstrate 
lot-to-lot consistency to the extent possible while under development and be reasonably 
well characterized to be properly evaluated.  


 
 
 
 
34 
 
 
E. 
The Role of Antibodies  
 
If phase 2 data suggest that agent-induced neutralizing antibodies could interfere with the 
efficacy of a biological agent over time, it may become necessary to formally investigate 
the possibility in a randomized-controlled setting.  The occurrence of neutralizing 
antibodies may call for the reconsideration of doses and dose regimens.  Non-
neutralizing antibodies may have a profound effect on PK and may therefore be just as 
important as neutralizing antibodies. 
   
 
V.  
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MEDICAL DEVICES 
 
A. 
Background 
 
Medical devices used in the treatment of RA vary considerably in their therapeutic 
impact, ranging from primary therapy for a specific affected joint to products used as 
adjuncts to primary therapies such as the use of ultrasound or heat for symptomatic relief 
in conjunction with pharmaceutical therapy.  Variability in therapeutic effects due to 
disease and response heterogeneity may be exaggerated with some devices because 
treatments are often targeted to a single or a few joints per patient.   
 
Preclinical requirements for devices include assessment of data from a diverse range of 
tests, including, for example, tests that evaluate chemical composition, mechanical 
reliability or the electrical properties of a given device.    Each product type has an 
identified battery of tests that are evaluated to ensure that the design of the specific 
product is well understood and can be expected to have the intended effect on patients as 
described in its labeling. 
 
The design of clinical trials in RA for a device may raise some unique issues uncommon 
in pharmaceutical trials.  The interaction between treated and untreated joints as it 
affects functional and quality of life assessments is just one example of these issues.  
Selection of an appropriate control often poses difficult questions when the active therapy 
under study is an implant and the available controls are more systemic in activity.  
Understanding how to design these trials, analyze the data, and assess the contribution 
from each therapy can be challenging.   
 
B. 
Efficacy Considerations 
 
1. 
The selection of a control group may be quite challenging with devices because 
masking for the patient and investigator is frequently impossible and a placebo 
may be infeasible.  Because historical controls are often unsatisfactory and 
evaluating the equivalence of local therapy to a systemic active control poses 


 
 
 
 
35 
problems, innovative trial designs are often needed.  Some innovative options 
include randomization to early versus late device interventions, or rescue 
interventions following failure of pharmaceutical interventions.  Although the 
use of a sham (placebo) device is the most desirable control for many products 
evaluated for RA, it may be inappropriate if the subject device is implanted.  
Additionally, the success of patient and/or physician masking with such shams 
may not always be complete.  Patient masking is infeasible if the product 
requires a surgical or other invasive procedure.  However, in some cases it is 
possible to achieve evaluator masking for the effectiveness evaluation.   
 
2. 
For devices intended for use as adjunctive therapy, approaches and analysis 
methods should be designed to account for differences in disease status and 
severity to minimize potential biases in outcome measures.  One approach is to 
have a consistent primary therapy with a named pharmaceutical to avoid 
confounding the analyses.  The use of additional, potentially confounding co-
therapies (hot/cold treatments, splinting, physical therapy, and orthotics) also 
needs to be appropriately addressed during the study design phase. 
 
3. 
The use of quality of life (QOL) assessments is very important where devices are 
intended for rehabilitative purposes.  QOL benefits for the intervention should be 
judged with tools chosen for their validity, ease, and convenience of 
administration and the ability to address both improvement in QOL and product 
satisfaction.  These assessments should be kept masked from the independent 
effectiveness evaluator to avoid assessment bias. 
 
4. 
In the case of invasive devices necessitating in-hospital or in-office use, it is 
recommended that clinical assessments include convenience in use and pain or 
discomfort in administration.   Early assessment of this aspect of therapy can 
provide critical information on the ultimate acceptability of the treatment and 
affect decisions as to whether to pursue a treatment modality. 
 
C. 
Safety Considerations 
 
1. 
Obtaining well-characterized, short-term adverse events rates, as an early 
assessment of safety as is common for large pharmaceutical trials is not always 
meaningful in medical device trials.   Device trials are frequently much smaller 
in size and the reliability of early data may not be sufficient to establish a 
prospective pattern.  When the device in question is an implant, the evaluation 
period must be fairly long to assesses the potential for late occurring adverse 
events including device failure and adverse reactions to device materials.  In 
some cases, the full assessment of safety cannot be completed in the premarket 
phase and extends into mandatory postmarket surveillance. 
 


 
 
 
 
36 
2. 
When devices are used in conjunction with another medical or surgical procedure, 
the distinction between an adverse event that is clearly device related and one that 
is common to the procedure may be difficult to assess.  The nature, timing, and 
degree of severity are some of the factors that may be useful in reaching a 
determination of cause.  Since these determinations are based on clinical 
judgment, a real potential for bias exists in reaching conclusions about the 
treatment.  Care must be exercised in designing the protocol to provide adequate 
detail in instruction to investigators to allow for consistent and unbiased decision 
making on their part.  
 
3. 
Devices (e.g., those emitting radiation) that have the potential for intermittent or 
chronic use require assessment as to whether there is a lifetime exposure limit or a 
maximum frequency of exposure.    Such issues are frequently addressed with 
animal data as well as with long-term clinical evaluations. 
 
 
VI. 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR JUVENILE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS 
 
A. 
Background 
 
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that share the 
common feature of chronic, idiopathic synovitis, with onset prior to 16 years of age. 
These disorders have been divided into clinically distinct subsets based on the extent of 
joint involvement and extra-articular manifestations: pauci-articular, poly-articular, and 
systemic-onset JRA, as well as oligoarthritis associated with HLA-B27,4 and they have 
been further subdivided based on clinical courses (Cassidy 1986).  Immunogenetic 
subsets appear to correlate with these clinical course subsets and are also distinct from 
adult RA (Nepom 1991).  Of these various entities, polyarticular JRA is similar in many 
aspects to adult RA, particularly in clinical signs and symptoms, synovitis, and similar 
efficacy responses to some existing pharmacotherapy (NSAIDs, methotrexate, and 
prednisone).  As only 3 to 5 percent of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis develop 
illness onset during childhood, many investigational therapeutic agents in this small 
population will receive orphan drug status, according to 21 CFR part 316 — Orphan 
Drugs.  The application of principles in the conduct of clinical trials for adult RA largely 
applies as well to JRA, and this section outlines only those areas of difference from adult 
RA.  Sponsors are generally encouraged to develop as much information as possible on 
JRA patients for agents that will be approved for adult RA.  As a minimum, dosing and 
safety data are strongly encouraged. 
 
Conducting drug studies in children is generally necessary and consistent with the 
expectations of treatment regimens for this disease.  Because pediatric subjects

37 
constitute a vulnerable population, conducting research involving minimal risk is 
important.  The Committee on Drugs of the American Academy of Pediatrics has 
published guidelines for the ethical conduct of studies to evaluate drugs in pediatric 
populations (AAP 1995a), and general considerations for the clinical evaluation of drugs 
in infants and children (AAP 1982), both of which should be consulted.  Guidelines 
regarding informed consent and assent of pediatric patients from the Committee on 
Bioethics of the American Academy of Pediatrics should also be followed (AAP 1995b).  
Conducting clinical trials for patients with JRA and, particularly, assessing global disease 
activity and response to therapy should involve pediatric rheumatologists or adult 
rheumatologists who have extensive training in pediatric rheumatology and have 
demonstrated competence in caring for children with rheumatic diseases.  
 
As a general principle, children should not be subjected to an agent that has not been first 
tested for safety in adults.  Testing may begin in children, however, when the anticipated 
benefits based on existing knowledge justify the anticipated risks.  An agent developed 
specifically for use in JRA (e.g., a biological agent targeted against a specific pathogenic 
process that is unique to JRA and not present in adult RA) may need to be tested first in 
children, as exposure in adult RA patients or even normal adult volunteers may be 
unrevealing.  If, however, the agent has potential for use in both adult RA and JRA, then, 
at minimum, PK-PD and initial phase 1 data (including MTD) for adults should be 
available prior to the start of testing in children.  JRA trials of drugs that are expected to 
be similar in efficacy to existing drugs and that do not represent major therapeutic 
advances or alternative approaches to the basic mechanism of intervention can be delayed 
until there is extensive efficacy and safety data either from adults or in other pediatric 
populations.   
 
The need for reliable inferences does not necessitate a placebo control, but randomization 
and controls should be employed.  The choice of control is a function of what is known 
about the agent at the time and what other treatments are available to potential trial 
enrollees.  If only an active control is used for an equivalence trial, convincing evidence 
of the efficacy of the active control should be provided, and the test proposed to establish 
equivalence should be specified.  If there have been no prior adult studies, or if the agent 
under development has a novel mechanism of action or represents an entirely new class 
of drug, a randomized, double-blinded trial, using either a placebo or an active control 
group of (anticipated) similar efficacy is indicated.  Open label extensions to obtain 
additional data about risk and persistence of benefit are very valuable.  The use of active 
control (standard-of-care therapy) in the control arm, dose-response design (where 
control receives a lower dose(s) of the test agent), crossover, randomized withdrawal 
(enrichment design) or, if the agent has a short onset of effect, randomized placebo-phase 
trial designs are encouraged as possible alternatives to inactive placebo control in JRA 
studies (Temple 1994, Feldman 1995).  As a general principle, protocol escape clauses 
are encouraged to permit children who are not responding well to experimental therapy to 
receive early conventional or alternative treatment.  The sponsor should indicate how 
dropouts will be handled in the analysis, whether from the escape clause, or otherwise.

B. 
Applicability of Pediatric Regulation and Impact on Trial Design for JRA 
Studies 
 
The pediatric use section in the labeling regulations (21 CFR 201.57(f)(9)) permits drug 
and biological products to be labeled for pediatric use if they have been demonstrated to 
be safe and effective for adult populations and the mechanism of action of the drug is 
sufficiently similar in children.  The pediatric rule may be applied only to obtain labeling 
for the signs and symptoms of JRA;  other claims, including prevention of structural 
damage, remission, and prevention of disability, should be evaluated in separate JRA 
efficacy studies.  Although the regulation allows extrapolation of adult efficacy data, 
additional pediatric dosing and safety evaluations are usually needed.   
 
In general, sponsors seeking approval for adult RA products appropriate for use in 
patients with JRA are strongly encouraged to obtain dosing and safety data in 
polyarticular course JRA for inclusion in the dosing and pediatric use sections of the 
label.  Specimen collection for PK studies can be reduced significantly if available data 
indicate that the coefficients are similar in adults and children.  Microsampling 
techniques should be employed for such studies (Hashimoto 1991).  The extent of safety 
testing needed depends on the agent, its prior use, and any established safety in other 
pediatric populations.  Toxicity grading scales should be adjusted for pediatric 
populations.  Phase 4 studies for safety evaluation will be strongly encouraged when 
limited preapproval data are obtained.  It is desirable that as much efficacy evidence as 
possible be gathered during the evaluation of pediatric dosing and safety.    
 
For currently approved traditional (cyclooxygenase inhibitor) NSAIDs and 
corticosteroids, adequate efficacy information exists to support a labeled indication for all 
JRA and all JRA subsets.  For methotrexate and sulfasalazine, adequate efficacy 
information exists for a labeled indication for JRA patients with a polyarticular course. 
For such agents, a labeling claim could be supported using only PK, PD, and safety data 
in JRA patients, although submission of additional JRA efficacy data is encouraged. 
 
For new agents (not yet approved for adult RA) that are not from a new pharmacologic 
class, adult efficacy data can be used to support a signs and symptoms claim for 
polyarticular JRA if there is biological plausibility that the agent would have a similar 
effect in JRA.  The applicability of the pediatric rule to support a labeled indication for 
polyarticular course JRA will be based on adult RA efficacy data considered on an 
individual basis for each agent.  When evidence for biological plausibility does not exist, 
evidence should be submitted to support the application of the pediatric rule.  (The 
Agency should be consulted in determining whether adequate biological plausibility 
exists to apply the pediatric rule.)  Pediatric safety and dosing studies should be 
submitted.   
 


 
 
 
 
39 
For agents in a new class, efficacy studies should be performed in JRA to obtain an 
indication for use in JRA.  The indication will reflect the JRA subsets included in the 
efficacy study. Sponsors who seek approval for all JRA should include all JRA subsets in 
an efficacy study.  The data could support a claim for JRA (subsets not specified) 
provided that the data do not suggest that the agent is ineffective in any one subset.  The 
label should reflect that efficacy was demonstrated and that the agent is approved for JRA 
(subsets specified depending on which were included in the efficacy study).  
 
C. 
Outcome Variables and Claims 
 
It is possible for sponsors to seek approval for all JRA subsets or to seek approval for 
individual subsets.  In the former case, the label should note the number of patients from 
each subset enrolled in trials and the character of each subset response.  Except as noted 
above in the application of the pediatric rule, all claims should be supported by an 
efficacy demonstration in the intended subset(s). 
 
1. 
Reduction in the Signs and Symptoms of JRA 
 
All JRA trials should evaluate improvement based on a validated endpoint for 
improvement.  Currently, the one validated approach is the definition of 
improvement established by the JRA core set:  three of six (MD global, 
parent/patient global, number of active joints, number of joints with limited range 
of motion, functional ability, and ESR) improved by at least 30 percent and no 
more than one of six worsening by more than 30 percent (Giannini 1997).  
Because the JRA definition of improvement was validated using a trial of 
methotrexate, which primarily included polyarticular JRA patients, protocol 
individualization may necessitate a refinement in the responder test for other 
patient subsets.  For example, for pauci-articular JRA, with one knee involved 
and a normal ESR, use of joint and functional assessments specific to the involved 
joints and evaluation of uveitis as coprimary endpoints may also be valuable 
(Lindsley 1996).  For patients with systemic onset JRA, additional assessment of 
fever, extra-articular manifestations, and thrombocytosis/leucocytosis may be 
useful coprimary endpoints (Silverman 1994).  Outcome variables need to be 
appropriate and consistent with the type of agent under investigation.  
Investigators should specify, before the trial is initiated, how much change is 
considered clinically important for each outcome variable. 
 
Trials should generally last at least six months, except when six-month efficacy 
data exist in adult RA and there are no reasons to expect loss of efficacy over 
time. Under these circumstances, trial durations may be three months' 
blinded/randomized, but six-months' open safety data should be obtained.  As 
with adult RA, a three-month trial duration is suggested for NSAIDs. 
 
2. 
Major Clinical Response 


 
 
 
 
40 
 
Similar to adult RA, major clinical response is a claim intended to connote that 
the agent provides substantial clinical benefit, including in patients who are 
unable to completely respond to the treatment or remit from the disease.  At 
present, this claim is only theoretical, as clinical JRA trial databases adequate for 
defining major clinical response do not exist. 
 
3.  
Complete Clinical Response 
 
The claim of complete clinical response reflects achievement on drug of six 
consecutive months of morning stiffness of less than 15 minutes duration, no 
active synovitis (pain, redness, tenderness to palpation, swelling, stable or 
decreasing limitation of motion), no extra articular features (including fever, 
serositis, adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, uveitis), and normal laboratory 
parameters (including ESR, platelets, WBC) and, where applicable, no ongoing 
structural damage while continuing on therapy.  Trials should be at least one year 
in duration.  Residual damage from prior disease, including extra articular 
manifestations, is acceptable in meeting criteria for complete clinical response.  
Because spontaneous complete clinical response rates may be relatively high in 
JRA, these studies should be controlled.  
 
4. 
Remission 
 
Remission is characterized exactly as above, but while off all antirheumatic drugs.  
Remission is not intended to imply cure. 
 
5.  
Prevention of  Disability 
 
This claim is proposed to reflect durable improvement in physical function and 
disability in studies of one to two years' duration with demonstrated improvement 
in signs and symptoms over the same period.  Instruments currently validated for 
use in JRA include the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ), the 
Juvenile Arthritis Self-Report Index (JASI), and the Juvenile Arthritis Functional 
Assessment Report (JAFAR).  HR-QOL should also be measured and 
demonstrated not to worsen over the trial duration.  Endpoints should be tailored 
to subtypes enrolled in trials (e.g., to assess knee function in pauci-articular JRA 
patients in whom knee arthritis may be the primary arthritic manifestation).  
Instruments should be developmentally validated for the age ranges studied in a 
trial (Murray 1995). 
 
6.  
Prevention of Structural Damage 
 
Similar to adult RA, this claim would reflect trials of one year or more with 
concomitant success in signs and symptoms.  Currently, only sparse data exist 


 
 
 
 
41 
regarding the usefulness of only one radiographic measure in JRA:  the 
carpal-metacarpal distance in those patients with wrist arthritis.  Other clinically 
promising settings include the evaluation of erosive disease in systemics with 
polyarthritis, hip assessment in systemics, and knee assessments in pauci-articular 
JRA. 
 
D. 
Trial Design Issues 
 
Recommendations for efficacy studies are based on the nature of the agent under 
development.  The principles outlined for adult RA are generally applicable.  Patients 
enrolled in these trials may be of any onset or disease course subset.  Separate trials for 
each JRA subset are recommended if the agent is predicted to have a target mechanism of 
action that will not be applicable and equally efficacious in all JRA subsets.  
Alternatively, a single, sufficiently large trial with enrollment appropriately stratified 
provides for useful conclusions to be reached about efficacy and safety for each subset.  
Relevant covariates include disease course type, disease duration, and nonresponse to 
prior methotrexate treatment.  Given that JRA is an orphan disease, there is often some 
flexibility in trial design, but this should be discussed on a case-by-case basis. 
 
At this time, JRA patients are usually ineligible for entry into efficacy trials unless they 
have failed to respond adequately to at least one standard second line agent (such as 
methotrexate at a dose of at least 10 mg/m2 body surface area per week).  There may be 
exceptions to this if, for example, there is evidence that greater efficacy could be obtained 
by using the agent very early in the disease course, evidence that delayed use in sicker 
patients potentially carries greater risk of toxicity, or evidence that the agent has a 
favorable safety and efficacy profile in a comparable population studied to date and that 
the agent's actions are potentially readily reversible.  Pauci-articular JRA patients are 
particularly encouraged for inclusion in trials with agents targeting the treatment of 
uveitis or agents that will replace existing therapy with an improved safety profile, less 
frequent blood monitoring, and/or superior efficacy. 
 
Some JRA patients exposed to new agents should be evaluated periodically for an 
extended period.  Effects on skeletal growth, development, behavior, sexual maturation, 
reproductive capacity, and secondary malignancy should be included in such monitoring.  
Registries or cohort follow-up studies may be useful in providing long-term safety 
information. 
 
E. 
Concurrent Antirheumatic Agent Administration 
 
The principles of  use of concurrent antirheumatic therapy in JRA trials are similar to 
those outlined for adult RA:  limiting their discretionary use as much as reasonably 
possible so that interpretation of efficacy and safety data is not compromised.  However, 
limitations on concurrent medication cannot prohibit ethically justified treatments, nor 
should the protocol be made so unattractive to parents, physicians, and patients that 


 
 
 
 
42 
enrollment is threatened.  If background treatment is necessary, early tolerance studies, 
to ensure safety of co-administration, should precede any large trials. 
 
If patients receive concurrent slow-acting or prednisone therapy, the dose should be 
stable prior to study entry and should preferably remain so throughout the trial.  
Concurrent medications are usually important prognostically and so may need 
stratification.  If possible, intra-articular steroid injections should be disallowed for a 
minimum of one month prior to beginning experimental therapy; otherwise, that joint 
should be discounted in assessing therapeutic effects.  
 
F. 
Multicenter Trials and Center Effects 
 
Although JRA is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood, its prevalence is low 
compared to adult RA.  Thus, trials of JRA that require large numbers of patients will 
likely be multicenter trials.  Multicenter trials should employ a standardized protocol and 
data collection forms among all centers.  Pretrial meetings of all investigators and other 
involved personnel are strongly encouraged to ensure uniformity in protocol 
interpretation, patient evaluation, and data recording.  Studies have shown that, within a 
cooperative group, a center's performance is a function of the number of patients enrolled 
at the center (Sylvester 1981).  Thus, studies that use fewer centers with greater numbers 
of patients at each center are preferable to those that use large numbers of centers with 
fewer patients.  Effort should be made to enroll at least 10 to 12 patients at each center to 
provide for greater quality assurance.  In all multicenter trials, center effects should be 
examined.  A therapy should show effect in more than one center.  When stringent 
entrance criteria restrict the number of patients eligible for study, many centers may be 
unable to enroll even 10 patients.  In such situations, randomization blocked within 
individual centers, rather than across all centers, may help to reduce the potential impact 
of center effects.
