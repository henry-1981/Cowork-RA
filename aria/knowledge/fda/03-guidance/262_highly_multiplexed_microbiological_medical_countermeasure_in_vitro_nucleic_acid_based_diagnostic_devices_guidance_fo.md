Food and Drug Administration 
Staff  
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on 
this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate 
to bind FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies 
the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you want to discuss an 
alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance.  If 
you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the 
title page of this guidance.  
1. Introduction 
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations 
for studies to establish the analytical and clinical performance of highly multiplexed 
microbiological/medical countermeasure in vitro nucleic acid based diagnostic devices 
(hereafter referred to as HMMDs) intended to simultaneously detect and identify multiple 
pathogen nucleic acids extracted from a single appropriate human specimen or culture.  
For the purposes of this guidance document, the multiplex level that is used to define 
HMMDs is the capability to detect ≥20 different organisms/targets, in a single reaction, 
using a nucleic acid-based technology and involves testing multiple targets through a 
common process of specimen preparation, amplification and/or detection, and result 
interpretation.  HMMDs are used to aid in the diagnosis of infection or screening for 
colonization.  This guidance is not intended to replace or supersede other assay specific 
guidance documents. 
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and 
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory 
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something 
is suggested or recommended, but not required.   


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
2. Background 
This document recommends studies for establishing the performance characteristics of 
HMMDs.  FDA considers these recommended studies to be relevant for premarket 
notifications (e.g., 510(k) or de novo) that may be required for a particular device. 
A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type must, in addition to any 
other applicable requirements,  
· conform to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the 
FD&C Act), including the premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 
807 Subpart E, and 
· obtain premarket clearance or de novo classification prior to marketing the device 
(sections 510(k), 513, 515 of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. 360(k), 360c, 360e.   
This document is intended to supplement 21 CFR 807.87 (information required in a premarket 
notification) and other FDA resources such as “Premarket Notification 510(k)” found at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDevic
e/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/default.htm.   
Guidance on the content and format for abbreviated and traditional 510(k)s can be found in 
the guidance entitled “Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s found at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDoc
uments/ucm084396.pdf.” 
Information regarding the use of standards can be found in section 514(c) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. 360d(c), and in the FDA guidance entitled “Use of Standards in Substantial 
Equivalence Determinations” found at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDoc
uments/ucm073756.pdf.  FDA recommends that developers of HMMDs use this guidance for 
information on FDA’s current thoughts regarding the regulation of these devices.    
3. Scope 
The scope of this guidance includes nucleic acid based devices that employ technologies 
such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR), bead-based liquid arrays, microarrays, re-sequencing approaches as well as the 
measurement of individual targets via a common process of sample preparation, target or 
signal amplification, allele discrimination, and collective interpretation and are reported 
out simultaneously.  This guidance is not intended to address devices that utilize detection 
mechanisms other than nucleic acid based approaches.  The document does not apply to 
devices that are intended to screen donors of blood and blood components, and donors of 
human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) for communicable 
diseases.   
This guidance document addresses HMMDs used in conjunction with the patient’s clinical 
presentation and other laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of infections from viruses, 
2 
 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
bacteria, parasites, or fungi and determine the presence of genetic markers for drug resistance.  
For the assays addressed by this guidance, positive results do not rule out potential co-
infection with other pathogens, and negative results should not be used as the sole basis for 
diagnosis, treatment, or patient management decisions.  
This guidance provides detailed information on the types of data FDA recommends 
submitting in support of Class II premarket devices.  The inclusion of certain analytes 
could elevate the classification of the device to Class III, and we encourage sponsors to 
contact the FDA for additional guidance.
3 
 
1  In addition, if you plan to seek clearance or 
approval for a microbiology multiplexed device that detects less than 20 
organisms/targets, please contact the Agency prior to undertaking any clinical or 
analytical validation studies to discuss whether the recommendations found within this 
guidance may be applicable.   
4. Risks to Health 
The potential risks to health associated with HMMDs that are used in conjunction with the 
patient’s clinical presentation and other laboratory tests to aid in the diagnosis of infection 
include: failure of the device to perform as indicated, leading to inaccurate results or lack of 
results, and incorrect interpretation of results.  These potential risks may lead to incorrect 
patient management decisions. 
A false positive result could lead to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment for the 
misidentified illness, as well as delayed treatment of the actual infection, which may 
potentially lead to a more serious infection.  Additionally, a false positive result in the context 
of a public health emergency could lead to misallocation of resources used for surveillance 
and prevention.  A false negative result, or lack of result, could lead to failure to provide a 
diagnosis and the correct treatment, may contribute to unnecessary treatment, or incorrect 
patient management to prevent transmission of infection.  
5. Device Description   
In your 510(k) submission, you should identify the regulation, the product code(s), and a 
legally marketed predicate device(s).  We recommend you include a table that outlines the 
similarities and differences between the predicate or multiple predicates and your device.  
You should include the following descriptive information to adequately characterize your 
highly multiplexed microbiological/medical countermeasure device. 
A.  Intended Use 
The intended use should specify the pathogens and, if applicable, drug resistance markers that 
the test detects and identifies, the nature of the analyte (e.g., RNA, DNA, or both RNA and 
DNA), specimen types for which testing will be indicated, the clinical indications for which 
                                                 
1 Certain analytes are inherently high risk, including some that are insufficiently understood to authoritatively 
identify the  risks, and therefore belong in class III.  A device that tests multiple analytes takes on the 
classification of the highest class analyte. 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
the test is to be used, and the specific population(s) for which the test is intended.  The 
intended use should state that the test is qualitative or quantitative, whether detection of an 
analyte is presumptive, and any specific conditions of use. 
In your 510(k), you should clearly include the following information related to the intended 
use of your product: 
· The identity, phylogenetic relationship, or other recognized characterization of the 
pathogens that your device is designed to detect. 
· How the device results might be used in a diagnostic algorithm if applicable. 
Additional measures that might be needed for a laboratory identification and diagnosis 
of the infection.  
· Additional measures that should be instituted if infection with a novel or emerging 
pathogen is suspected based on current clinical and epidemiological screening criteria. 
B.  Test Methodology 
You should describe, in detail, the methodology used by your device.  You should describe 
the following elements, at a minimum, as applicable to your device: 
· Test platform (e.g., multiplexed RT-PCR, bead arrays, re-sequencing array, mass 
spectrometry used in conjunction with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)). 
· Information and rationale for selection of specific target sequences and the methods 
used to design detection elements.  
· Specimen collection (e.g., swabs, viral culture media, positive blood culture, etc.) and 
handling methods. 
· Specimen matrix (e.g., blood, sputum, stool, etc.). 
· All pre-analytical methods and instrumentation for collection, stabilization, and 
concentration of specimens. 
· Specificity of the pathogen sequences being detected (i.e., methodologies used in 
addition to the evaluation of clinical specificity to demonstrate the target sequence is 
found only in the pathogen of interest). 
· Limiting factors of the assay (e.g., saturation level, maximum cycle number, etc.). 
· Reagent components provided or recommended for use, and their function within the 
system (e.g., buffers, enzymes, fluorescent dyes, chemiluminescent reagents, 
oligonucleotides, other signaling/amplification reagents, etc). 
· The potential for specific and non-specific interference effects from reagents or device 
material. 
· Internal controls and a description of their specific function in the system. 
· External controls that you recommend or provide to users.  
· Instrumentation inherent to using your device, including the components and their 
function within the system. 
4 
 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
· The  signal analysis and interpretation from raw data to the reported result (e.g., how 
raw signals are processed and converted into a useable result).  This would include 
sufficient software controls for identifying and dealing with obvious problems in the 
dataset.  It would also include adjustment for background and normalization, if 
applicable.  
· Illustrations, photographs, and a detailed description of non-standard equipment or 
methods, if available.  
· Design inputs and outputs with a risk analysis and traceability matrix. 
When applicable, you should include descriptions of how your device’s features address or 
mitigates risks associated with highly multiplexed devices such as the following examples:  
· Prevention of cross-contamination for multiplexed tests in which many probes are 
included in the device.  
· Correct placement and identity of assay features (e.g., probes, arrayed capture oligos). 
· Minimization of false positive results due to contamination or carryover of specimen. 
· How to enable detection of emerging variants due to mutations within the target 
organism.  
· Process controls used to detect and/or correct long term drift in device performance 
due to antigenic drift. 
C.  Ancillary Reagents 
Ancillary reagents are those reagents that a manufacturer of HMMDs specifies in device 
labeling as “required but not provided” in order to carry out the assay as indicated in its 
instructions for use and to achieve the test performance claimed in labeling for the assay.  For 
the purposes of this document, specific ancillary reagents are those that you specify with a 
catalog or product number, or other specific designation as necessary for your device to 
achieve its labeled performance characteristics.  For example, if your device labeling specifies 
the use of a specific brand of reagent (e.g., ‘Brand X or other amplification enzyme that has 
been shown to be equivalent’) and the use of any other DNA amplification enzyme may alter 
the performance characteristics of your device from that reported in your labeling, then Brand 
X DNA amplification enzyme or other amplification enzymes shown to be equivalent to 
Brand X DNA amplification enzyme are ancillary reagents of concern for the purposes of this 
document.
5 
 
2  
By contrast, if your device requires the use of 95% ethanol, and any type of 95% ethanol will 
allow your device to achieve the performance characteristics provided in your labeling, then 
95% ethanol is not an ancillary reagent for the purposes of this document. 
                                                 
2 Even if you establish that one or more alternative ancillary reagents may be used in your assay, each of those 
named alternatives may still be an ancillary reagent.  If you are unsure whether this aspect of the guidance 
applies to your device, we recommend you consult with the Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In 
Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
If the instructions for use of your device specify one or more specific ancillary reagents, 
include information on how you will ensure that the results of testing with your device and 
these specific ancillary reagents, in accordance with your instructions, will be consistent with 
the performance established in your premarket submission.  Your plan may include 
application of quality systems approaches, product labeling, and other measures. 
Manufacturers should address the elements described in detail below.  FDA will evaluate 
whether your plan will help to mitigate the risks presented by the device to offer reasonable 
assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device and establish its substantial 
equivalence.   
1. You should include in your 510(k) a risk assessment addressing the use of specific 
ancillary reagents, including risks associated with management of reagent quality and 
variability, risks associated with inconsistency between instructions for use provided 
directly with the specific ancillary reagent and those supplied by you with your device, 
and any other issues that could present a risk of obtaining incorrect results with your 
device. 
2. Using your risk assessment as a basis for applicability, you should describe in your 
510(k) how you intend to mitigate risks through implementation of any necessary 
controls over ancillary reagents.  These may include, where applicable: 
· User labeling to assure appropriate use of ancillary reagents. 
· Plans for assessing user compliance with labeling instructions regarding 
specific ancillary reagents.  
· Plans for alerting users in the event of an issue involving specific ancillary 
reagents that would impact the performance of the HMMD. 
· Material specifications for specific ancillary reagents.  
· Identification of reagent lots that will allow appropriate performance of your 
device. 
· Stability testing. 
· Complaint handling. 
· Corrective and preventive actions. 
· Any other issues that must be addressed in order to assure safe and effective 
use of your test in combination with named ancillary reagents, in accordance 
with your device’s instructions for use. 
In addition, you should provide testing data to establish that the quality controls you supply or 
recommend are adequate to detect performance or stability problems with the specific 
ancillary reagents. 
If you have questions regarding identification, use, or control of specific ancillary reagents, 
you should contact Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics 
and Radiological Health for advice.

D.  Controls 
The performance of controls should adequately monitor when issues occur at critical steps 
within the system workflow in order to minimize risk of false results due to system 
variances/failures. 
.  
You should describe the following concerning quality control and calibration: 
· The nature and function of the various controls that you include with, or recommend 
for, your system.  These controls should enable the user to determine if all steps and 
critical reactions have proceeded properly without contamination or non-specific 
interference. 
· Your methods for value assignment (relative or absolute) and validation of control and 
calibrator material, if applicable. 
· The control parameters that could be used to detect failure of the instrumentation to 
meet required specifications. 
In general, external positive and negative controls should be run during the analytical and 
clinical studies as they are necessary to monitor the ongoing performance of the entire testing 
process.  Ideally, you should include external controls for each analyte covered with your 
device.  However, due to the high number of analytes detected by these devices, a rotating 
control scheme may be considered appropriate whereby a panel of representative control 
organisms (reflective of the organisms in the assay menu) is designed and used throughout the 
evaluation process. 
We recommend that you consult with FDA when designing specific controls for your device, 
including the selection/design of control panel constituents.  Controls should provide 
information about (1) specimen quality, (2) reagent quality, and (3) process quality.  We 
generally recommend that you include the following types of controls: 
i. Negative Controls 
7 
 
Blank or no template control  
The blank, or no-template control, contains buffer or specimen transport media and all 
of the assay components except nucleic acid.  This control is used to rule out 
contamination with target nucleic acid or increased background in the amplification 
reaction.  Negative controls should be run at a justifiable frequency (# per shift, day, 
week) as determined by the laboratory in keeping with state and local 
recommendations to control for contamination. 
Negative specimen control 
The negative specimen control contains non-target nucleic acid.  It reveals non-
specific detection and indicates that signals are not obtained in the absence of target 
sequences.  Examples of acceptable negative specimen control materials could 
include: 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
· Patient specimen from a non-infected individual that has been tested to exclude   
any of the pathogens detected by the HMMD 
· Specimens containing a non-target organism  
· Surrogate negative control (e.g., packaged RNA)  
ii.  Positive Controls 
8 
 
Positive control for complete assay  
The positive control is designed to mimic a patient specimen, contains target nucleic 
acids, and is used to control the entire assay process, including nucleic acid extraction, 
amplification, and detection.  Positive controls are run as a separate assay, 
concurrently with patient specimens.  For the clinical and analytical studies, a 
minimum of one positive and one negative external control should be run daily or per 
batch during the evaluation.  Positive controls can be a subset of the larger assay menu 
and can be rotated through a pre-defined schedule.  In the case of a single use/test 
consumable with an internal control, periodic external control testing may need to be 
performed with every new lot taking into consideration state and local 
recommendations. 
Some examples of acceptable external positive assay controls include: 
· Vaccine or prototypic vaccine strains of appropriate virus or bacteria 
· Low pathogenic virus or bacteria  
· Inactivated virus or bacteria  
· Packaged RNA/DNA containing target sequences 
Positive control for amplification/detection 
The positive control for amplification/detection can contain purified target nucleic 
acid near the limit of detection for a qualitative assay.  It controls for the integrity of 
the device and the reaction components when negative results are obtained.  
iii. Internal Control 
The internal control is a non-target nucleic acid sequence that is co-extracted and co-
amplified with the target nucleic acid.  It controls for integrity of the reagents, 
equipment functionality, and the presence of inhibitors in the specimen.  Examples of 
acceptable internal control materials include human nucleic acid co-extracted with the 
specimen and primers amplifying human housekeeping genes (e.g., RNaseP, B-actin).  
Alternatively, the internal control can be a packaged non-target sequence that is added 
to each clinical specimen before any pre-analytical steps and is analyzed 
simultaneously with the clinical targets.  The appropriateness of this control is 
dependent on the design of the assay and should be determined with input from the 
FDA.  


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
E.  Interpreting Test Results/Reporting  
In your 510(k), you should describe how positive, negative, or invalid results are determined 
and how they should be interpreted.  Developers should indicate the cut-off values for all 
outputs of the assay. 
· In particular, you should provide the cut-off value for defining a negative result of the 
assay.  If the assay has only two output results (negative/positive), this cut-off also 
defines a positive result of the assay. 
· If your interpretation results involve re-testing, you should provide (1) a 
recommendation whether re-testing should be repeated from the same nucleic acid 
preparation, a new extraction, or whether a new patient specimen should be obtained 
and tested, and (2) an algorithm for defining a final result by combining the initial 
result and the results after re-testing (note that this algorithm should be developed 
before the pivotal clinical study that evaluates the clinical performance of the assay).   
· If the assay has an invalid result, you should describe how an invalid result is defined.  
If internal controls are part of the determination of invalid results, you should provide 
the interpretation of each possible combination of control results for defining the 
invalid result.  You should provide recommendations for how to follow up any invalid 
result (i.e., whether the result should be reported as invalid or whether re-testing is 
recommended).  If re-testing is recommended, you should provide information similar 
to that for the re-testing of indeterminate results (i.e., whether re-testing should be 
repeated from the same nucleic acid preparation, a new extraction, or a new patient 
specimen). 
6. Performance Characteristics  
In your 510(k), you should detail the study design you used to evaluate each of the 
performance characteristics outlined below. 
If your product labeling calls for the use of specific ancillary reagents, the premarket 
performance testing submitted to support your 510(k) should use the specific ancillary 
reagents that your instructions for use reference.  The performance claims you establish 
through premarket testing, which should be reflected in your labeling under 21 CFR 
809.10(b), should be based on the particular test configuration you describe in your labeling, 
including all pre-analytical steps.   
In addition, if your product labeling indicates the use of multiple devices (i.e., PCR machines) 
and/or extraction methods, the premarket performance testing submitted to support your 
510(k) should use all devices or extraction methodologies specified in your instructions.  
Your performance claims in your labeling, which you established through premarket testing, 
should be based on the particular test configuration you describe in your labeling, including 
all pre-analytical steps.    
Evaluation of assay performance should include appropriate controls for the duration of the 
analytical and clinical studies.  This includes any internal assay controls as well as the 
9 
 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
appropriate external controls recommended by the manufacturer, but not necessarily provided 
with the assay, and how they were tested during the analytical and clinical studies.   
A.  Pre-analytical Factors 
Consideration of pre-analytical factors is critical for HMMDs.  In your 510(k), you should 
clearly address the following issues regarding pre-analytical factors. 
i. Specimen Collection and Handling 
10 
 
You should specify the specimen type(s) for which your assay is intended to be used.  
Appropriate specimen types depend on a variety of factors, including the site of 
infection and the pathogen nucleic acid to be detected.  Specifically, a clinical 
specimen should be collected from the appropriate anatomical site or source at the 
appropriate time in the clinical progression of disease.  Appropriate specimen types 
will vary according to the test panel.  We recommend that sponsors consult the FDA 
to determine which specimens are considered appropriate for the intended test panel 
and if certain specimen types can be considered equivalent and thus can be combined. 
The quality and quantity of extracted target can be affected by multiple factors such as 
specimen source, collection method, handling (e.g., transport, storage time, 
temperature).  Testing results you provide in your 510(k) should validate the 
following: 
1. The system provides adequate and appropriate nucleic acid for all 
analytes detected by your assay (i.e., DNA/RNA from bacteria, virus, 
fungi, parasites, or any combination thereof included in the test).  
2. The device maintains acceptable performance under all the various 
specimen handling conditions claimed in the product labeling. 
The acceptance criteria for all specimen stability parameters should be clearly 
indicated and justified. 
Specimens for pathogen identification should be collected and handled using all 
applicable state and federal biosafety guidelines.  For standard precautions for handling 
of specimens, refer to the most current editions of the related Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI) documents.3     
ii. Fresh vs. Frozen Specimens  
Detection sensitivity can change for frozen specimens as compared to fresh.  In 
developing your test, we recommend you consider and evaluate whether this is a 
concern for any of the pathogens detected by the particular multiplex panel (i.e., they 
should not be frozen and thawed).  You should assess the effect of storage temperature 
and repeated freeze/thaw cycles on the yield of the nucleic acid and its influence on the 
assay performance.  The evaluation of fresh versus frozen specimens can be considered 
during the determination of the limit of detection (LoD) providing an early indication of

assay performance with specimens that have been frozen as compared to fresh 
specimens.  The freeze-thaw conditions tested should capture the actual conditions 
encountered in a clinical setting and those used to establish the enrollment criteria for 
frozen archived specimens that could be used in the prospective analysis.   
If significant differences are observed with the LoD, then additional studies will be 
necessary and product labeling will indicate the use of fresh, unfrozen specimens only.  
If developers still wish to pursue the use of frozen specimens, then performance should 
also be established for frozen specimens by conducting a study consisting of a total of 
60 positive clinical specimens tested fresh and frozen.  In certain circumstances, well-
designed mock specimens, made by spiking cultured organism into individual negative 
specimens could also be considered.  However, FDA feedback for this approach is 
recommended prior to undertaking the study.  The positive specimens should be 
representative of the test panel composition.  If it is the case that fresh and frozen 
specimens are not equivalent, then developers should ensure that all studies are 
conducted with specimens that have been handled properly.    
iii. Nucleic Acid Extraction 
11 
 
Different extraction methods may yield nucleic acids of varying quantity and quality, 
and thus the extraction method can be crucial to a successful result.  Purification can be 
challenging because biological specimens may contain low pathogen signature 
sequences in a background of human genomic DNA, normal flora, as well as high levels 
of proteins and other contaminants.  Additionally, the lysis conditions may differ 
depending on physiochemical nature of the organisms detected by the device.   
For these reasons, you should evaluate the effect of your chosen extraction method on 
the performance of the assay with respect to satisfactory nucleic acid quantity and 
quality for the intended use of the assay.  In addition, you should evaluate your assay’s 
clinical performance characteristics using the entire pre-analytical process (including 
extraction procedures) that you recommend for use with your assay.  If multiple 
extraction methods are recommended for use with your assay, you should demonstrate 
extraction quality and efficiency, as well as analytical and clinical performance of 
your assay with each extraction method.  Specifically, you should demonstrate LoD 
and reproducibility for each pre-analytical method indicated for use by your device.  
You may be able to combine the extraction method variable with each site 
performance variable.  For example, if you recommend three different extraction 
methods, you can design a reproducibility study by evaluating one of the three 
extraction methods at each of three testing sites: test extraction method A at site 1, test 
extraction method B at site 2, and test extraction method C at site 3.   
However, if the studies from the three sites indicate statistically or clinically 
significant differences in assay performance, the reproducibility study should be 
expanded to include testing each extraction method at three study sites (e.g., site 1 
extraction methods A, B and C, site 2 extraction methods A, B and C, and site 3 
extraction methods A, B and C). 
In addition to the analytical limit of detection and reproducibility, each extraction 
method should be utilized in at least one clinical site during the clinical studies to 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
generate clinical performance data.  If results from the expanded reproducibility 
testing indicate a significant difference in efficiency among the extraction methods, 
the data from each clinical testing site (using a different nucleic acid extraction 
method) are not considered equivalent and should not be combined, but rather should 
be analyzed separately.  As a consequence, additional prospective clinical specimens 
may be called for in order to support the claimed extraction method. 
You should provide your recommendations for assuring specimen adequacy for the 
different specimen types for which your assay is indicated.  For example, the quality 
of the nucleic acid can be assessed using internal controls that determine presence, 
quality, or both presence and quality of the nucleic acid.  For additional information, 
consult with the Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In Vitro 
Diagnostics and Radiological Health. 
iv. Specimen-to-Specimen Cross-Contamination with Automated Extraction 
12 
 
Systems 
If automated systems are used or recommended for nucleic acid extraction that takes 
place prior to use of your device, you should include a check of potential well-to-well 
cross-contamination as part of the performance qualification of the extraction 
instrument.  You should provide a software hazard analysis for automated extraction 
systems as part of your 510(k).  A validation study of the extraction process can be 
designed in a pattern such that a nucleic acid-containing specimen with a 
concentration at the highest anticipated clinical level is surrounded on all sides by 
negatives.  The results should demonstrate that well-to-well cross-contamination does 
not occur. 
v. Performance Study Quality Controls  
Evaluation of assay performance should include appropriate controls for the duration 
of the analytical and clinical studies.  The results should also include any positive and 
negative controls provided with your assay as well as appropriate external controls 
recommended but not necessarily provided with the assay.  If a rotating control 
scheme is used throughout the evaluation process, the results should be presented for 
each control panel member.   
B.  Analytical Performance 
           The following are analytical performance characteristics you should demonstrate for   
your assay in your 510(k). 
i. Limit of Detection  
The LoD provides a measure of the analytical sensitivity of an assay for a particular 
target and is defined as the lowest concentration of target distinguishable from 
negative specimens that is consistently detected in 95% of the specimen replicates.  
Proper determination of the LoD is critical since many of the analytical validation 
studies, as well as the levels included in the reproducibility analysis, are based on this 
target concentration.   


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
Determination of the LoD for each target included in the assay menu and each 
specimen type is necessary.  This can be accomplished by limiting dilutions of 
calibrated target material into a negative (non-infected) clinical matrix. The target 
material should be made from isolated culture material and can be calibrated using 
either acceptable molecular approaches or non-molecular methods of target 
quantification and expressed as colony forming unit/plaque forming unit (CFU/PFU) 
and genome equivalents/mL.   In certain circumstances with Agency review and 
agreement, it may be appropriate to use, clone, or chemically synthesize genomic 
DNA and/or RNA transcripts if the target cannot be cultured.  A preliminary 
evaluation of LoD can be done individually then substantiated with multiple replicates 
using pools of multiple targets.  One approach would be to prepare serial dilutions 
using appropriate pooled negative specimen matrix as diluent that include three to five 
replicates for each dilution to establish the preliminary range.   
After the preliminary LoD range is established, the preliminary LoD is confirmed by 
demonstrating a detection rate of 95% using a minimum of 20 independent specimens.   
Alternatively, sponsors may desire to pool targets for the preliminary estimation and 
final confirmation of LoD.  This approach can be taken with the understanding that 
developers provide justification for the number of targets included in the evaluation 
pool.  It is important to note that pooling of multiple targets may negatively affect the 
LoD; thus, the justification provided by developers should indicate what steps were 
taken to ensure the LoD obtained in the study is accurate.  The use of Probit analysis 
may also be used to establish LoD provided the study is appropriately designed.  
Additionally, an analysis to confirm the Limit of Blank (LoB) of zero using a 
minimum of 50 negative individual clinical specimens should also be provided.   
ii. Analytical Reactivity (Inclusivity) 
13 
 
You should demonstrate analytical reactivity to account for potential genetic variation 
among the pathogens included in the multiplex assay panel.  You should collect data 
to evaluate clinically relevant microorganisms that represent temporal, geographical, 
and phylogenic diversity for each claimed target at or near the specific LoD or cut-off 
value.  The approach to establish inclusivity should use both intact cultured organisms 
that undergo all pre-analytical steps, as well as pre-extracted and defined nucleic acids 
to significantly augment traditional laboratory testing.  The pre-extracted nucleic acid 
target material should be made from isolated culture material and calibrated using 
acceptable molecular approaches and expressed as CFU/PFU and genome 
equivalents/mL.   
The evaluation should use panels designed to include different strains, laboratory 
isolates, serotypes, and other closely related subspecies relevant to the specimen type.  
It is important to note that the panel design for inclusivity should incorporate a diverse 
and clinically relevant specimen set.  To ensure the highest quality materials are used 
in this analysis, the identity and titer of the original stock should be confirmed.  For 
example, if your assay detects and identifies Salmonella enterica, we recommend that 
you demonstrate that the assay can detect all frequently reported serotypes by testing 
at or near the specific LoD or cut-off value.  


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
When it is difficult to represent adequate diversity and demonstrate detection due to 
difficulty obtaining sufficient specimens of pathogens, we recommend that you 
contact FDA to discuss your study.  When strain availability is limited, laboratory 
testing can be augmented through in silico analysis of target sequences.  In silico 
analyses should include clinically relevant organisms and represent temporal, 
geographical, and phylogenetic diversity for each claimed target.  In these cases, the in 
silico approach will be used to guide the inclusion of pathogens for traditional and in 
silico analyses.  For example, an approach whereby an in silico analysis is used to 
guide laboratory testing could be based on alignment identity.  With this approach, 
representative organisms selected from groups with decreasing levels of identity to the 
target region will be selected for further laboratory testing.  We recommend that 
sponsors provide a clear rationale for the inclusion of the selected strains, the metrics 
used to assess inclusivity, and a clear presentation of the alignment in the specific 
regions of interest for each pathogen evaluated. 
iii. Analytical Specificity 
14 
 
You should determine analytical specificity for your HMMD for all pathogens 
detected.  The evaluation should be  done using a combined approach with a pre-
extracted nucleic acid panel as well as an analysis of the complete system, from 
nucleic acid extraction through amplification and detection.  In general, you should 
evaluate interference from substances found in the specimen and the potential for 
interference from other microorganism present in the specimen.  However, under 
certain circumstances (i.e., inability to obtain rare organisms in sufficient quantity), a 
combined approach using pre-extracted nucleic acid for specific target(s) may be 
appropriate after consultation with the FDA.  In general, you should evaluate 
interference from substances found in the specimen and the potential for interference 
from other microorganisms present in the specimen.   
Interference 
You should demonstrate that your assay can specifically detect the target organism in 
the presence of relevant interferents.  These studies should include other organisms, 
homologous sequences, and contrived specimens with high background levels of 
human DNA.  The following sections describe specific types of interference studies 
you should perform in order to assess potential interference for your highly 
multiplexed device.  The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) document 
EP7-A2, Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry; Approved Guideline; 2005, 
provides additional information about how to design interference studies.   
a) 
Interfering substances 
We recommend that you conduct a comprehensive interference study using 
medically relevant concentrations of interfering substances to assess the potentially 
inhibitory effects that would affect a test result.  Potentially interfering substances 
to test include those that may pre-exist in the specimen as well as those that may be 
introduced during specimen collection and specimen preparation.  The types of 
interfering substances will be specimen specific.  We recommend that you test the 
effect of each interferent on a small representative panel of organisms at the LoD or 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
cut-off as well as the effect on negative specimens.  For example, the representative 
panel could be composed of a predetermined number of each organism type (Gram 
(+), Gram (-), fungi, yeast, parasites, RNA and DNA viruses, etc.).  In addition to 
the analysis of spiked specimens with endogenous levels of potential interfering 
substances, purified interferents will also be spiked into individual negative 
specimens to evaluate the effect on the device when elevated levels of potential 
interfering substances are present.  The final concentration should approach the 
worst-case levels and should be justified either through literature analysis or FDA 
feedback.   
The representative organisms should be spiked into negative clinical specimens, 
which are individual or pooled, or simulated negative clinical specimens (using an 
appropriate specimen background) at 2-3 times the LoD along with the potentially 
interfering substance being tested.   This analysis should employ all pre-analytical 
steps to evaluate the affects of matrix variation and inhibitory substances on 
performance.  Devices that have unique pre-analytical processing steps, either as 
stand alone or incorporated into a unitized consumable may involve more in depth 
analysis and could include additional studies to ensure the removal of potential 
interferents.  Sponsors are encouraged to obtain FDA’s feedback in these cases.    
Potential interferents that should be assessed are endogenous substances that can be 
encountered at elevated levels in clinical specimens, as well as commonly 
prescribed or over-the-counter clinically relevant medications and their metabolites, 
as appropriate in the indicated specimen type.  Exogenous substances that may be 
introduced into specimens before or during specimen collection, including 
medication, treatments, or topical applications for treating symptoms associated 
with specific infections, should also be included in this study.  Since spiking 
experiments may not necessarily be an accurate model of the in vivo scenario, 
alternative experimental designs, such as assessing the effect of medications 
received by patients included in the clinical studies may need to be considered, as 
appropriate.    
b) Interference by other microorganisms  
15 
 
You should evaluate your assay for interference by microorganisms that are 
expected to be encountered in the indicated specimen type designed to be used by 
your device.  We recommend that you evaluate a representative test panel of intact 
organisms 2-3 times the LoD with the interfering microorganisms expected to be 
present in the anatomical site(s) to be sampled for testing, or those known to 
commonly cause similar symptoms as the assay panel on the test device. The 
potentially interfering microorganism should be spiked at the high end of the 
clinically relevant range to allow for the determination of the maximum amount of 
a non-target microorganism the assay can tolerate without causing interference or 
adversely affecting the test results when target organisms are 2-3 times the LoD.    
c) 
Competitive Interference by analytes 
You should assess the effects of all known clinically relevant co-infections.  The 
selection that you consider for these studies should be based on combinations of co-


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
infections that are known to occur or are widespread.  The selection of targets to be 
included in this study should be justified through literature surveillance, 
combinations of pathogens that are known to occur, or from FDA feedback. 
If a target/analyte is expected to be present at a high level, the detection of another 
target present at low levels could potentially be impaired.  To assess whether this 
would be the case, we recommend you evaluate competitive interference with one 
target at the LoD or cut-off concentration and another target at a very high 
concentration, as well as both targets at the LoD or cut-off values.  This can be 
done either during the LoD or cut-off evaluation or, alternatively, as a part of 
reproducibility or interference studies.  
d) In Silico analysis of physical interactions 
16 
 
You should provide an in silico evaluation to demonstrate a lack of internal 
competition due to secondary structure/binding between various oligonucleotides 
(including all primers, probes, linkers, and amplified targets) included in the 
multiplexed assay.  You should provide data demonstrating that no adverse binding 
interactions are having a negative impact on performance as well as all evaluation 
parameters used for the analysis.  Any potentially negative interaction should have 
a justification for inclusion on the assay menu as well as any relevant follow-up 
validation data. 
e) 
Cross-reactivity 
The following sections describe specific types of cross-reactivity studies in order to 
assess potential cross-reactivity in the absence of the target organisms.  
Comprehensive panels of microorganisms should be designed and include the 
following information:   
· Strain characterization (pedigree information) 
· Titer information prior to nucleic acid extraction 
· Quality assessment parameters of the extracted nucleic acid (i.e., quantity of 
nucleic acid (NA) recovered, optical density (OD) 260/280 ratio, etc.) 
· Determination of the conversion from titer to genomic equivalents or copy 
number for the extracted nucleic acids.      
1) Cross-reactivity with other organisms in the panel   
Section 6B.ii above discussed testing characterized specimens for each target 
probed by the multiplex panel to establish reactivity (inclusivity) of the assay for 
that particular pathogen.  You should also utilize similar types of specimens to 
evaluate (and rule out) cross-reactivity between analytes represented within the 
highly multiplexed assay.  "The cross-reactant level used in this analysis should be 
at the highest anticipated clinical level and can be done using cultured stocks of 
bacteria and viruses (106 CFU/ml or higher for bacteria and 105 pfu/ml or higher). 
In certain circumstances with Agency review and agreement, it may be appropriate 
to use, clone, or chemically synthesize genomic DNA and/or RNA transcripts if 
the target cannot be cultured.  


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
2) Cross-reactivity with pathogens or targets that are not part of the assay 
17 
 
To determine whether the HMMD cross-reacts with analytes other than the 
pathogens it is designed to measure, we recommend assessing a comprehensive 
panel of microorganisms designed to include all closely related organisms as well 
as other pathogens and microorganisms that are likely found in similar specimens 
or known to commonly cause similar symptoms as those included in the assay 
menu.  It is important to consider analytes that have a reasonable likelihood of 
being present at the specimen collection site for each specimen type.     
For this analysis we recommend that you test the highest clinically encountered 
level of viruses and bacteria (106 cfu/ml or higher for bacteria and 105 pfu/ml or 
higher for viruses).  Generally, the bacterial and viral stocks are cultured and titered 
using traditional methods; however, for the purposes of highly multiplexed devices 
and the expanded size of the panels to be used, the use of cultured stocks that have 
been calibrated using molecular approaches is appropriate.  From these calibrated 
stocks, preparations of highly purified and qualified nucleic acids can be made and 
used to evaluate cross-reactivity at the aforementioned test levels.  We understand 
that with certain microorganisms you may not be able to achieve this titer.  If so, we 
recommend consulting with the FDA. 
A pooled target approach for the evaluation of cross-reactivity can be taken with 
the understanding that developers provide justification for the number of targets 
included in the evaluation pool.  It is important to note that pooling of multiple 
targets could mask cross-reactive events due to overloading nucleic acid; thus, the 
justification provided by developers should indicate what steps were taken to 
obviate this potential issue.  If a justifiable pooling approach is employed, all cross- 
reactive pools should be further analyzed as individual reactions to determine the 
cross-reactive microorganism(s).  
iv. Cut-off 
You should clearly define how the cut-off for each target/analyte was initially 
determined as well as how it was validated.  The cut-off should be determined using 
appropriate statistical methods.  For example, to support the determined cut- off, the 
sponsor could provide distribution of results, 95th and 99th percentiles, percents of the 
positive results, etc. for the clinical specimens.  Selection of the appropriate cut-off 
can be justified by the relevant levels of sensitivity and specificity based on Receiver 
Operating Curve (ROC) analysis of the pilot studies with clinical specimens (for 
details about ROC analysis, see CLSI document EP24-A2 Assessment of the 
Diagnostic Accuracy of Laboratory Tests Using Receiver Operating Characteristics 
(ROC) Plots; Second Edition; 2012).  The performance of the candidate multiplexed 
device using the pre-determined cut-off should be validated in an independent study 
consistent with the defined intended use of your device.  
v. Precision (Repeatability/Reproducibility) 
You should provide data demonstrating the precision (i.e., repeatability and 
reproducibility) of your system.  The CLSI documents, EP05-A2, Evaluation of 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods; Approved Guideline- 
Second Edition; 2004, and EP12-A2, User Protocol for Evaluation of Qualitative Test 
Performance; Approved Guideline-Second Edition: 2008, include guidelines that may 
be helpful for developing experimental design, computations, and a format for 
establishing performance claims.  
We recommend you establish the precision of your device using a representative panel 
composed of a predetermined number of each organism type (Gram (+), Gram (-), 
fungi, RNA and DNA viruses, etc.) that has a range of analyte concentrations 
spanning the detection range of your assay.  All sources of variability in the precision 
study should be identified.  While some sources of variability can be evaluated in an 
in-house precision study, the site-to-site reproducibility study should include an 
evaluation of the major sources of variability described below, for each pathogen. 
In the study design description in your 510(k), you should identify which factors (e.g., 
instrument calibration, reagent lots, and operators) were held constant and which were 
varied during the evaluation, and describe the computations and statistical analyses 
used to evaluate the data.   
For qualitative tests, you should estimate the overall variance as well as the variance 
for all the factors considered in the precision study using an appropriate statistical 
method.  For qualitative tests that have an underlying numerical output, the component 
of precision is often measured for each source of variation using the analysis of 
variance.  For each specimen in the precision study, you should provide the mean 
value with variance components (standard deviation and percent coefficient of 
variation (CV) for each site separately and for all sites combined. 
For non-biothreat pathogens, reproducibility will be evaluated using a multi-site 
approach.  The intended user will perform all pre-analytical steps in the analysis in the 
intended use environment.  Not all pathogens will be included in the reproducibility 
study due to the increase in the number of targets of these types of devices.  
Representative panels of pathogens may be used to reduce the overall size of the study 
while still collecting sufficient information to determine the reproducibility of the 
device.  Panels should be composed of representative organisms selected from the 
multiplex menu and should be agreed upon through FDA feedback prior to initiating 
the evaluation. 
The representative panel should be tested at the concentrations defined below and can 
be pooled.  Intact cultured organisms should be spiked into the negative clinical 
specimen matrix and include all pre-analytical steps to evaluate the reproducibility of 
the device.  
· Negative clinical matrix - If negative matrix is not available, the sponsor 
should consult with FDA regarding the use of an artificial matrix.  Note:  a 
matrix equivalency study is involved to support the use of an artificial matrix 
and may not be appropriate in all cases. 
· LoD (or C95, positive (above the cut-off) approximately 95% of the time) - 
Cultured organisms should be spiked into negative matrix at a determined LoD 
level. 
18 
 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
· Two to three times the LoD (C100, positive 100% of the time) - Cultured 
organisms should be spiked into negative matrix at two to three times the LoD 
level.  It is important to clarify that test levels in excess of two to three times 
the LoD are not appropriate for this part of the evaluation of reproducibility. 
Factors that are held constant should be clearly identified and all computation and 
statistical analysis should be indicated.  The following variables should be assessed 
and included in the study design:  
· Extraction-to-extraction precision: specimens used in precision testing are 
processed from clinical specimens (e.g., nasopharyngeal swabs) at the test site, 
using the procedure you plan to recommend in the test labeling.   
· Between-instrument precision. 
· Site-to-site and operator-to-operator precisions: include three or more sites (at 
least two external sites and one in-house site) with multiple operators at each 
site.  Operators should reflect potential users of the assay in terms of education 
and experience.  You should provide training only to the same extent that you 
intend to train users after marketing the test. 
· A minimum five non-consecutive days to cover day-to-day variability of the 
precision test panel on the device. 
· A minimum of two runs per day (unless the assay design precludes multiple 
runs per day) and two replicates of each panel member per run is 
recommended to assess the between-run component as well as within-run and 
within-day imprecision in your reproducibility study. 
· Lot-to-lot precision:  including evaluation of multiple product lots (e.g., 
multiple lots of assay reagents and ancillary reagents, multiple lots of primers 
and probes for RT-PCR, multiple lots of beads or arrays), and multiple 
instruments. 
· For each analyte level (regardless of pooling), a total of 90 data points should 
be collected. (i.e., one analyte test level x two operators times three 
replicates/operator times five days of testing times three testing sites = 90 data 
points/analyte test level) 
For biothreat pathogens, within-laboratory precision should be evaluated using a 
single site due to handling restrictions.  Arrangements to validate reproducibility at 
qualified institutions with the capability to conduct the proper studies should be made.  
This evaluation should be done for all biothreat targets using the same test levels 
outlined above.  Testing should be done at a single site with multiple operators and 
instruments to assess reproducibility between operators, runs, and days.   
vi. Carry-over Studies and Cross-contamination Studies (for multi-specimen 
19 
 
assays and devices that require instrumentation)  
For assays and devices that require instrumentation, you should demonstrate that 
carry-over and cross-contamination do not occur with your device.  For multiplexed 
assays, use of one or more representative analytes to evaluate the risk of 
contamination is appropriate.   A risk-based approach should be employed to justify 
the choice of analyte(s) and experimental design based on a combination of all aspects 
of the workflow, including pre- processing and run set up. Multiple instruments should 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
be used in studies to demonstrate the robustness of the system design.  Multiple 
operators should be included in studies if there is significant manual manipulation of 
specimens and/or reagents. Rationale should be provided for the sample size tested 
based on the power involved in detecting a specified defect rate.  Target levels tested 
should reflect the upper end of the spectrum of anticipated clinical loads associated 
with the analyte(s) in question and should include a testing pattern that included 
negative specimens to evaluate potential carry over.  
vii. Stability Studies 
20 
 
You should describe your study design for determining the real-time stability of the 
reagents and instruments, and if applicable, a description of stress test conditions and 
results.  For each study, you should describe your acceptance criteria values and how 
you selected them. 
C.  Instrumentation and Software 
Instrumentation for clinical multiplex test systems is regulated under 21 CFR 862.2570.  
Guidance for such instrumentation is available in the guidance entitled “Class II Special 
Controls Guidance Document: Instrumentation for Clinical Multiplex Test Systems” found at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDoc
uments/UCM071061.pdf.  If the multiplexed assay uses instrumentation for clinical multiplex 
test systems and obtains FDA clearance, the instrumentation for clinical multiplex systems 
will be cleared for use with the assays included in the device.  Simultaneous clearance of the 
assay and the instrumentation can be accomplished by either (1) the sponsor of the assay 
submitting the information for both the assay and the instrumentation for clinical multiplex 
systems within one 510(k) or (2) the instrument manufacturer simultaneously submitting a 
separate 510(k) for the instrumentation for clinical multiplex systems by itself.  The amount 
of information required for clearance of the instrument depends on whether the instrument has 
been previously cleared for a similar intended use, and whether there are software 
modifications to accommodate the new assay(s). 
 
If your system includes software, you should submit software information detailed in 
accordance with the level of concern.  More information can be found in the document 
entitled “Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in 
Medical Devices” found at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/uc
m089543.htm.  You should determine the level of concern prior to the mitigation of hazards.  
In vitro diagnostic devices of this type are typically considered a moderate level of concern 
because software flaws could indirectly affect the patient and potentially result in injury due 
to inaccurate information. 
For any device that uses a proprietary database to define the outcome of a signal generated by 
their device we recommend that the quality criteria for establishing the accuracy of reference 
databases as well as the methods for curating, maintaining, and updating the databases be 
included in your submission.

i.  Clinical Study Design 
21 
 
Clinical validation of highly multiplexed devices should be performed using a study 
that is separated into two parts.  The clinical evaluation will determine the specificity 
(or negative percent agreement) through a prospective study of a minimum of 1500 
patients enrolled with the signs and symptoms of infection for which the device is 
indicated, using a randomized evaluation with a specific number of comparator 
method (CM) measurements for each analyte, see 6.D.iii for study size.  Sensitivity (or 
positive percent agreement) for each analyte can be evaluated using well defined 
retrospective archived specimens.  Developers should include a detailed description of 
how the retrospective specimens were collected and curated.  This information should 
include how specimens are identified, specimen characterization (including methods 
used to determine positivity), and storage conditions of the specimens while archived.  
All possible biases in retrospective specimens should be discussed.  It is critical that 
the highest quality archived specimens are selected for use in this part of the study.  
Section 6.D.iii discusses the number of specimens for each part of the study. 
Clinical evaluation of your device should be conducted using specimens from the 
intended use patient populations.  Specifically, specimens from patients with the signs 
and symptoms of infection for which the device is indicated should be used to evaluate 
the performance for the claimed specimen type and organisms included on the 
multiplex assay menu.  The clinical specimens, either prospective or archived, should 
be collected from clinical sites in different geographical locations representative of 
United States (U.S.) demographics. If positive clinical specimens are not available in 
the U.S., then the use of specimens from outside of the U.S. is warranted.  However, 
discussion with the FDA before pursuing the inclusion of these specimens in 


Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
recommended.  In specialized cases of localized outbreaks, FDA might also consider a 
single geographic collection site.   
Evaluation of the clinical specimens with the subject device, both prospectively 
collected as well as archived specimens, should be carried out using a minimum of 
three testing sites (one site can be internal), with at least two sites located in the U.S.  
The testing sites can be independent from the collection sites.  
Prospective specimens as well as archived positive specimens should be randomly 
distributed to the testing sites.  The application of CM testing can be done at a single 
reference site.  Comparator methods should be FDA cleared or approved devices, if 
available, and the use of appropriate cleared or approved multiplexed devices is 
recommended.  When FDA cleared or approved devices are not available, a composite 
reference method (e.g., two well-validated amplification based assays followed by bi-
directional sequencing) could be used.  Information regarding the minimal validation 
steps for PCR based assays and sequencing criteria is found in Section 6.D.ii and can 
also be obtained by contacting FDA. 
For all specimens (prospective and retrospective) used in the clinical evaluation, all 
relevant clinical and laboratory information available should be collected, including 
collection and testing date and time, if available.  For prospective specimens, the 
minimum clinical information collected should be patient age (To show the degree to 
which the data is representative of the children, adults, and the geriatric user 
population).  Additional relevant clinical information (e.g., days since onset of 
symptoms, sex, patient population (i.e., outpatient, ER, hospitalized, immuno-
compromised), collection and testing date/time, signs and symptoms and indications 
for testing, and any medications taken or administered) may be needed to further 
define the study population.    The need for additional relevant clinical information is 
dependent primarily upon the proposed indications for use of the test device.  The 
clinical information appropriate for consideration may vary with the study group of 
interest. 
In your pre-market submission, the developer should submit a copy of the protocol of 
each clinical study (including the inclusion and exclusion criteria, anticipated levels of 
sensitivities (positive percent agreements) and specificities (negative percent 
agreements, acceptance criteria), and a description of how the studies support the 
proposed intended use.  We recommend that you include specimens from each age 
group in your clinical studies and present the data demonstrating the performance of 
your test stratified by age (e.g., ≤5, 6-21, 22-59, 60 years old and above) in addition to 
the overall data summary table.  Furthermore, information regarding the archived 
specimens should be provided including methods used for the selection of appropriate 
archived specimens and information regarding measures taken to identify and mitigate 
any selection biases in the study set, etc.  We encourage you to contact FDA to request 
a review of your proposed studies. 
The device sponsor should assure that a high quality clinical study is performed 
through site/clinical monitoring of the study.  This should include performance of "on 
site" monitoring of individual case histories, to assess adherence to the protocol,

ensure the ongoing implementation of appropriate data entry and quality control 
procedures, and in general assess adherence to good clinical practices.

ii.  Comparator Methods 
23 
 
You should compare your assay’s performance to FDA cleared or approved devices.  
For pathogens that do not have an FDA cleared/approved device for comparison, a 
composite (multi-test) reference method (using a predetermined algorithm that 
combines results of multiple tests) can be used as a CM.  This method should include a 
separate well-characterized nucleic acid amplification method (e.g., PCR) followed by 
bidirectional sequencing.  The nucleic acid amplification method used in the 
composite reference method should be targeted to different genomic regions (i.e., 
incorporate different targets) from the specific regions probed by the subject device.  
You should provide published literature or laboratory data in your submission in 
support of the method used for amplification.  We recommend that you perform the 
sequencing reaction on both strands of the amplicon (bidirectional sequencing) and 
demonstrate that the generated sequence is at least 200 base pairs of an acceptable 
quality (e.g., a quality score of 20 or higher as measured by PHRED or similar 
software packages) and that it matches the reference or consensus sequence.  
Information regarding the validation steps for PCR based assays and sequencing 
criteria could be obtained by contacting FDA.  Briefly, the analytical performances of 
the well validated PCR-based assays for comparison followed by sequencing analysis 
reference assays should be established by performing analytical sensitivity (LoD) and 
reactivity studies as described previously in the guidance.  Literature and/or other 
validation data for establishing and describing the performances of the nucleic acid 
amplification test (NAAT) followed by sequencing analysis comparator method 
should be evaluated prior to clinical testing. You should submit to the FDA validation 
data from literature to justify your selection of primers for the NAAT followed by 
sequencing analysis reference assays. This information is important to demonstrate 
that the reference assays target conserved regions of pathogen(s) of interest genome 
and react broadly to capture strain diversity.  As a part of the pre-market application, 
primer sequences, target region of the genome, BLAST results, and sequence 
alignments, should also be submitted to the FDA for review. Appropriate controls,

including a positive control that has a low genomic copy number of the pathogen, a 
negative control, and an independent inhibition control measure, should be 
incorporated into each NAAT followed by sequencing analysis reference assays. 
iii. Clinical Evaluation - Study Size and Data Analysis 
24 
 
Evaluation of Negative Percent Agreement 
Evaluation of negative percent agreement should take place using prospectively 
collected specimens and analysis at a minimum of three clinical testing sites, two of 
which should be in the U.S.  Patient enrollment in the study should be based on signs 
and symptoms and meet any additional inclusion criteria for the study.  In general, the 
use of healthy donors is not acceptable; however, in some circumstances they may be 
appropriate and we encourage developers to contact the FDA to discuss when these 
types of specimens are appropriate.  For this study, 1500 prospective samples, from 
the intended use population, should be collected and analyzed by the subject device in 
order to obtain sufficient statistical power for FDA to make a substantial equivalence 
determination.  Depending on the number of organisms and specimen types to be used 
with multiplexed devices, the following approach should be considered for evaluation 
with the CM’s.  
If specimen volume becomes prohibitive to run all comparator tests, then a clearly 
defined randomized approach should be taken such that a minimum of 100 of each 
CM for each analyte would be analyzed.  In addition, provisions should be made so 
that an adequate number of specimens can be analyzed for Select Agents in order to 
meet the specificity performance criteria.  Using the example of a 20-plex device 
where each CM needs equal test volumes and allows five CM tests, the first specimen 
could be tested with comparative methods (CM1, CM2, CM3, CM4, CM5), the 
second specimen tested with CMs as (CM6, CM7, CM8, CM9, CM10) and so on. 
After testing four specimens, each CM would have been applied one time.  After 
testing the first four specimens, a new array of integer numbers from 1 to 20 in a 
random order could be generated and the next four specimens could be tested with 
comparative methods according to this new array.  Developers should power the study 
to establish clinical specificity with a point estimate and lower bound of the 95% CI to 
exceed a level that has been agreed upon through FDA feedback.  For Select Agents4, 
clinical specificity would be demonstrated to achieve a point estimate 99.9% with a 
lower bound of the 95% CI greater than 99%.   
Also note, for each specimen from the prospective study that has positive results by 
the subject multiplexed device for a pathogen, this specimen will also require testing 
by the corresponding CM.  Information about CM results that were driven by a 
positive result from the HMMD would not be used directly in calculation of sensitivity 
and specificity as it introduces bias into estimation of the multiplexed device 
performance.  However, this information is useful to understand the overall 
performance of the HMMD, especially in terms of co-detections, and should be 
presented in a separate table.  Comparative performance of the specificity of the

http://www.selectagents.gov/select%20agents%20and%20Toxins%20list.html

HMMD should be established using FDA cleared or approved devices, if available.  
Use of cleared multiplexed devices, when appropriate, is recommended.  
When FDA cleared or approved devices are not available or appropriate, a composite 
reference method could be used.  See section 6.D.ii for further clarification.  
Evaluation of Positive Percent Agreement 
The analysis will include a minimum of 50 positive specimens (as determined by the 
CM) per claimed organism.  The number of positive specimens for each pathogen to 
include will be driven by the point estimate of positive percent agreement and the 
lower bound of the 95% two-sided confidence interval.  These values can vary, 
depending on the intended use of the device, and would require discussions with the 
FDA to determine the appropriate clinical sensitivity levels for each pathogen of the 
multiplexed device.   
For example, a multiplexed device with an assay menu composed of upper respiratory 
organisms would include a sufficient number of archived/retrospective specimens for 
each claimed analyte to generate a result with at least 90% positive percent agreement 
with a lower bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) greater than 80%.  
Assuming a point estimate of 90.2% is achieved; a minimum of 61 positive specimens 
(55/61) will need to be included to surpass the indicated lower bound of the 95% CI of 
greater than 80%.  Indeed, for 61 specimens, 55 out of 61 yields a point estimate of 
90.2% with 95% CI: 80.2% to 95.4%.  However, using the example of 60 specimens, 
with a performance of 54 out of 60 yielding a point estimate of 90.0%, the CI does not 
meet the minimum performance bar with 95% CI being 79.9% to 95.3%.   
All positive archived/retrospective specimens (as determined by the method prior to 
banking the specimens) will be analyzed with the corresponding CM and the subject 
device.  Verification by the CM is imperative to ensure that specimens were properly 
archived, no specimen degradation occurred during storage, and that the specimens are 
properly identified; thus, any specimens that are not confirmed as positive by the CM 
should not be included in the performance determination.  However, results from the 
subject device testing the unconfirmed specimens should be included in a separate 
table.  Additionally, any positive determination for any other pathogen by the HMMD 
should also be verified by the CM as this provides additional information about 
multiplexed device performance, especially in cases of potential co-infection. 
Alternative approaches to confirming the positivity of specimens can be considered; 
however, we would encourage discussion with the FDA before executing the study.  
Retrospective positive specimens should be the same specimen type as listed in the 
intended use of the device, and have been collected from the appropriate intended use 
population.  The specimens selected for inclusion in this study should represent the 
clinically relevant range of concentrations for the particular pathogen.  In cases where 
extracted nucleic acids from positive clinical specimens have been archived, they can 
be considered for inclusion in the analysis provided that the appropriate intended use 
population was used, the indicated specimen type was collected and processed using 
the indicated pre-analytical steps, and confirmation by the corresponding CM was 
done.

We recognize that actual clinical human specimens, archived or otherwise, may not be 
readily available for biothreat pathogens.  The use of mock clinical specimens, 
prepared by spiking cultured pathogen into individual negative clinical specimens may 
be used.  For this analysis, 50% of the spiked specimens would be made at the LoD 
concentration, while the remaining 50% would span the expected clinical range of 
pathogen concentrations.  For non-biothreat pathogens with extremely low prevalence, 
mock specimens should reflect the relevant clinical range.  Justification of the 
expected clinical range through peer-reviewed literature references or feedback from 
subject matter experts should be provided by the developers for each specimen type 
indicated.  Given the restrictions associated with the handling of many of the biothreat 
pathogens, arrangements to validate the clinical performance at qualified institutions 
with the capability to conduct the proper studies should be made.  For biothreat 
pathogens, due to the logistical issues with this facet of the positive percent agreement 
validation, analysis can be conducted at a single site.  Alternatively, if the biothreat 
pathogen does not involve a special facility, a multiple testing site approach can be 
used to evaluate positive percent agreement, and the archived specimens (positive and 
negative) should be randomly distributed evenly among three testing sites for analysis.   
Prior to conducting any studies using mock specimens, you should consult the FDA 
for feedback.  Your protocols should include a detailed test plan and justification.  
26 
 
  
iv. Data Presentation  
You should present positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement 
(NPA) (with 95% CI) separately for each pathogen identified by the HMMD.  Also, 
you should present: 
· The results of your test for the specimens that have co-infections as obtained 
by the reference method.  Note:  This information may not be available for 
some of the prospective specimens due to prohibitive specimen volume. 
· The results of the CM for the specimens that have co-infections as obtained by 
the HMMD. 
· The results for CM measurements that were driven by a positive result from 
the subject multiplex device.  
All specimens in the clinical study should be tested with the HMMD as described in 
the instructions for use of your device.  For example, if specimens with initial 
indeterminate or invalid results are re-tested according to the instruction for use for the 
HMMD then the final result obtained from the indicated testing procedure for these 
specimens should be used in your statistical analysis.  For the specimens in your 
clinical study, you should provide the percent of re-tested specimens because of initial 
indeterminate results (if applicable) and the percent of re-tested specimens because of 
initial invalid results (if applicable).  In addition, you should present the percent of 
final invalid and final indeterminate results (if applicable) for each.  
You should provide numerical result distributions of the HMMD for all prospectively 
collected fresh, prospectively collected archived, and banked pre-selected specimens 
shown separately, for each pathogen and for all pathogens combined.

v. Study Specimens/ Specimen Types 
27 
 
You should use clinical specimens from all specimen types and matrices you claim in 
your intended use to demonstrate that correct results can be obtained from clinical 
material.  For specimens you use in your clinical studies, you should provide data 
demonstrating that storage and transport of any banked specimens have not affected 
assay results as well as the methods used to bank the specimen as positive for a 
specific analyte.  If you have questions regarding the choice of appropriate specimen 
type(s) as well as specimen types that can be pooled, please contact the FDA. 
7. Post Market Analysis 
The potential for performance erosion over time for certain pathogens, especially those that 
are known to have a relatively high rate of mutation, is a significant concern for HMMDs.  
HMMDs are subject to the quality system regulation described in 21 CFR Part 820.  As 
part of the quality system a developer should monitor the performance of their devices in 
the intended use environment and through their Corrective and Preventive Actions 
program.   If a mutation occurs that compromises device performance characteristics that 
were used in the premarket evaluation for clearance of the HMMD, we strongly 
recommend that the developer contact the FDA for further guidance to modify the existing 
device.  The validations studies for the modified device and the performance of the 
modified device will vary depending on the type of change.    
8. Device Modification 
The following information provided is meant to clearly define a pathway to incorporate 
new targets on an existing device in response to public health needs or an emergency 
situation and to ensure that performance characteristics of a cleared device are consistent 
over time.  Addition of a new analyte to a multiplex panel will result in a new intended use, 
and thus will require the submission of a traditional 510(k) in accordance with 21 CFR 
Subpart E.  Since many studies have been conducted to establish the performance of the 
previously cleared device and we presume that the assay’s performance has not changed, 
only a subset of the evaluations would need to be repeated. 
In cases where the inclusion of additional targets to address a public health need or 
emergency is necessary, the studies to substantiate performance will focus primarily on the 
additional analyte.  It is important to highlight that certain types of evaluations may not 
need to be considered when adding a new analyte or modifying a device, including stability 
studies and the evaluation of carry-over and cross-contamination.  Additionally, the scope 
of the reproducibility study and clinical evaluation would be focused on the new/modified 
analyte and a representative panel for performance confirmation.   For any device 
modification we recommend obtaining FDA feedback regarding the necessary studies to 
validate the modification.

A.  Limit of Detection 
A LoD study using the recommendations found in section 6.B.i of this guidance should 
be followed for the new analyte.  Briefly, confirmation of 95% positivity using a 
minimum of 20 replicates, including all pre-analytical steps, would be done.  In 
addition, a confirmation that performance for previously cleared analytes has not 
changed in the new assay format (i.e., with the new analyte).  For the confirmation 
study, a dilution series to bracket LoD concentration with three to five extraction 
replicates per concentration testing only a representative subset of previously cleared 
analytes.  These specimens should be run on both the modified assay and the cleared 
assay.  The selection of representative analytes used in the conformation study should be 
justified by the developer.   
B.  Analytical Reactivity 
Evaluation of reactivity should be done for the new analyte.  This evaluation should be 
based on the recommendations provided in section of 6.B.ii; however, the study should 
focus on the new analyte only. 
C.  Cross-Reactivity 
Evaluation of cross-reactivity should be done for the new analyte.  This evaluation 
should be based on the recommendations provided in section of 6.B.iii, however, the 
focus should be placed on the new analyte only. 
D.  Competitive Interference By Analytes /Interference By Other Microorganisms 
Evaluation of competitive interference and interference from other microbes should be 
done for the new analyte.  This evaluation should be based on the recommendations 
provided in section of 6.B.iii.b and 6.B.iii.c.  The evaluation of competitive inhibition 
should only include relevant co-infections that include the new analyte. 
E.  Precision (Repeatability/Reproducibility)  
Evaluation of reproducibility/repeatability should be done using a single site, which can 
be in-house, using three different instruments.  The evaluation should include the new 
analyte and a subset of the previously cleared analytes.  Developers should provide 
justification for the representative panel selected for this evaluation and are encouraged 
to consider the LoDs and types of targets when designing the test panel.  See section 
6.B.v. for appropriate test levels.  
F.  Limited Clinical Evaluation 
A limited clinical evaluation should demonstrate the performance of the new analyte and 
reaffirm the clinical performance of the previously cleared analytes.  Evaluation of 
device performance with clinical specimens can be done using a single test site and can 
be done in house.  Positive clinical specimens can be either prospectively collected or 
can be archived clinical specimens as described in section 6.D.iii.  Comparator testing 
for the new analyte should be done as described in section 6.D.ii.  For the rest of the

analytes, you can perform an evaluation of the cleared device (i.e., device without new 
analyte) and the modified version compared head-to-head using a representative panel 
of analytes.  The test panel should be justified and include sufficient specimens to 
achieve the performance criteria addressed in section 6.B.iii for sensitivity and 
specificity.  If there are stored residual specimens or extracted nucleic acids from the 
evaluation of the cleared device (i.e., prior to modification with new analyte) it is 
recommended that they are utilized for this part of the evaluation.  If a sufficient number 
of specimens are not available, then additional retrospective specimens can also be used 
for the comparative evaluation.
