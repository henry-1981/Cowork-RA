Saline, Silicone Gel, and
Alternative Breast Implants
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or
the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document identifies the device description, non-clinical, clinical, and
labeling information we recommend you present in a premarket approval application
(PMA) for a breast implant. This guidance document may also be useful in preparing an
application for an investigational device exemption (IDE). This document addresses
breast implants filled with saline, silicone gel, or alternative filler intended for breast
augmentation or breast reconstruction. This guidance document does not address tissue
expanders, which are reviewed under the premarket notification (510(k)) process.
This guidance document supplements other FDA publications on PMA and IDE
applications and should not be construed as a replacement for these documents. For
general information about these applications, please refer to the following resources:
•
•

PMAs (21 CFR Part 814), https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarketsubmissions/premarket-approval-pma
IDEs (21 CFR Part 812), https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-yourdevice/investigational-device-exemption-ide.

Sponsors are responsible for developing clinical protocols and providing reasonable
assurance of the safety and effectiveness of their devices.

For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see
the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 1 For more information regarding use
of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
“Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices.” 2
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Saline-filled, silicone gel-filled, and alternative breast implants may be indicated for breast
augmentation and/or breast reconstruction, which are defined as follows:
•

Breast augmentation. Breast augmentation includes primary breast augmentation to
increase the breast size, as well as revision surgery to correct or improve the result of
an original primary breast augmentation surgery (i.e., revision-augmentation).

•

Breast reconstruction. Breast reconstruction includes primary reconstruction to
replace breast tissue that has been removed due to cancer or trauma or that has failed
to develop properly due to a severe breast abnormality. Breast reconstruction also
includes revision surgery to correct or improve the result of an original primary breast
reconstruction surgery (i.e., revision-reconstruction).

However, as discussed later in this document, we recommend you collect clinical data for
each of the individual indication subgroups of primary augmentation, revisionaugmentation, primary reconstruction, and revision-reconstruction.

A.

Saline-Filled Breast Implant

A saline-filled breast implant has a silicone rubber shell made of polysiloxane(s), such as
polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane, which is inflated to the desired size with
sterile isotonic saline. Saline-filled breast implants may vary in shell surface, shape, profile,
volume, and shell thickness. The sterile saline used as a filler material should follow United
States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards for Normal Physiological Saline (injection grade),
which has a concentration of 0.15M and a pH of 7.2-7.4.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Currently, the approved designs for saline-filled breast implants include:
•
•

a fixed volume implant with a single lumen that is intraoperatively filled with the
entire volume of saline via a valve
an adjustable volume implant with multiple lumens that is intraoperatively filled with
the entire volume of saline via a valve.

In the Federal Register of June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23856), FDA issued a final rule classifying
the silicone inflatable (saline-filled) breast prosthesis into class III (21 CFR § 878.3530).
On January 6, 1989 (54 FR 550), FDA published a notice of intent to require submission of
PMAs for these devices. On January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3436), FDA issued a proposed rule to
require submission of PMAs or completion of product development protocols (PDPs). On
August 19, 1999 (64 FR 45155), FDA issued a final rule requiring PMAs for these devices
to be filed with FDA, or PDPs to be completed, within 90 days. Thus, an approved PMA or
PDP is now required to market a saline-filled breast implant.

B.

Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implant

A silicone gel-filled breast implant has a silicone rubber shell made of polysiloxane(s), such
as polydimethylsiloxane and polydiphenylsiloxane, which is filled with a fixed amount of
silicone gel. Silicone gel-filled breast implants may vary in shell surface, shape, profile,
volume, and shell thickness.
Currently, the approved design for silicone gel-filled breast implants is a fixed volume
implant with a single lumen containing a fixed amount of silicone gel that may be shaped or
round, textured or smooth, and filled with silicone gel of more or less viscosity.
In the Federal Register of June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23856), FDA issued a final rule classifying the
silicone gel-filled breast prosthesis into class III (21 CFR § 878.3540). On January 6, 1989 (54
FR 550), FDA published a notice of intent to require submission of PMAs for these devices. On
May 17, 1990 (55 FR 20568), FDA issued a proposed rule to require submission of PMAs
or completion of PDPs. On April 10, 1991 (56 FR 14620), FDA issued a final rule requiring
PMAs for these devices to be filed with FDA, or PDPs to be completed, within 90 days. Thus,
an approved PMA or PDP is now required to market a silicone gel-filled breast implant.

C.

Alternative Breast Implant

An alternative breast implant is not a saline-filled breast implant or a silicone gel-filled
breast implant, as defined above. Instead, an alternative breast implant typically has a
silicone rubber shell with a filler other than saline or silicone gel. The filler material
may or may not be a gel. However, an alternative breast implant may also have an
alternative shell made from a material other than silicone rubber. We may recommend
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

different or additional evaluations of alternative breast implants depending on their
design, materials, and performance characteristics.
All alternative breast implants are class III post-amendment devices that require an
approved PMA or PDP for marketing (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FDCA) §§ 513(f) and 515(a) (21 U.S.C. §§ 360c(f) & 360e(a))).

III. Device Description
The Background section above (Section II) provides a very basic device description
for each of the three types of breast implants. This section recommends the type of
device description information you should include in your application. However,
depending on the particular design of your device, additional information may be
appropriate.
We recommend you provide the following device description information (as applicable):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

the type of implant, as described in the Background section (e.g., a fixed volume,
single lumen silicone gel-filled breast implant)
a written description of each component that comprises the device (e.g.,
shell, gel, patch, textured surface, valve)
the specific materials (with suppliers) used to manufacture each component
a description of any connector systems, fill tubes, and injection domes,
including materials and a magnified sketch depicting their
placement/use
a description of when the device is filled by the surgeon if it is not a
prefilled device (i.e., intraoperatively and/or postoperatively)
a description of any overexpansion/overfill of the filler material, even if on a
temporary basis (e.g., a range of saline filler allowed for a given size implant)
a description of the method used to sterilize the device
a summary table of all device styles under review in the submission, with the
following information identified for each style:
o shell surface
o shape
o profile
o volume
o width
o height
o projection
o shell thickness

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Depending on the specific design features of your device, we may recommend you include
additional information and/or columns in your summary table.

IV. Chemistry Data
A.

General Information

For the chemicals and materials used in the manufacture of your breast implant, we
recommend you provide the:
•
•
•
•
•
•

common names and trade names of each chemical/material (including additives,
plasticizers, and antioxidants)
specific role of each chemical and material in the manufacturing process and/or in
the final device
location of the material within the device (e.g., shell, filler, valve, adhesive)
chemical name, the mean molecular weight, and a measure of the polydispersity for
each polymeric component
material safety data sheets for each chemical
Master File (MAF) numbers for each material, including specific volume and page
number references, as well as a signed letter from the MAF owner granting you
permission to use its data, if applicable.

We also recommend you state whether the silica used in the elastomer shell dispersion is in
the amorphous form or the crystalline form.
Sections IV.B through IV.E of this document describe chemical analyses of the elastomer
shell (including the patch and valve) that we recommend you include in your submission.
Sections IV.F through IV.I describe chemical analyses of the filler material. Additional
analyses may be appropriate depending upon the design features of your device, such as
texturing, variations in device components (such as patches or valves), or the sterility
methods used.

B.

Extent of Crosslinking

The manufacture of the shell involves curing of polymeric components of silicones by
chemical crosslinking. We recommend you provide the extent of crosslinking from at least
three different manufacturing lots to confirm the uniformity of the degree of crosslinking
across lots. Suggested methods to determine the extent of crosslinking include:
•
•

measurement of Young’s modulus at low strain (this is approximately proportional
to crosslink density)
measurement of equilibrium swelling of the polymeric component by an
5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

appropriate solvent similar to that used for the extractable analyses
determination of the amount of unreacted crosslinker from the total extractables.

We recommend you also perform an analysis on the cured polymer to confirm the presence of
silicone functional groups. One recommended method is Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR).

C.

Extractables

We recommend you conduct an analysis of the extractables or releasable chemicals obtained
by exhaustive solvent extraction to identify potentially toxic chemicals and estimate the
upper limits of the chemicals that could be released into the patient. Soxhlet extraction is
one recommended method. Below is a general description of a protocol for attaining
exhaustive extraction of extractables or releasable chemicals.
Perform the extraction of the shell for chemical analyses with at least one polar solvent
(e.g., ethanol or a mixture of ethanol-water) and two non-polar solvents (e.g.,
dichloromethane and n-hexane) at 37°C. To determine the duration of the exhaustive
extractions, you should conduct a series of successive extractions by exposing the
sample to the solvent for a period of time, analyzing the solvent for extractables,
replacing with fresh solvent, exposing the sample again for a period of time,
analyzing, and repeating the process.
When the level of the analyte for the extraction is one-tenth (0.1) the level in the
previous extraction, the extraction is deemed complete so that a 10% correction to the
total extractable material can be applied. In cases where this condition may not occur
because of extremely slow migration of the higher molecular weight material, you
should apply the test to the contents of the extract with molecular weights of ≤1500
Daltons because these are the compounds of greatest clinical interest. You should add
all separate analyte levels to calculate the cumulative value and, via the sample/solvent
ratio, the sample and device levels. You should use the total extraction from the polar
solvent and the extraction from one of the non-polar solvents that yields the higher
amounts of extractables for both quantitative and qualitative analyses. For extracts
that may contain oligomeric or polymeric species, you should provide the molecular
weight distribution, along with the number and weight average molecular weights and
the polydispersity. You should perform an FTIR analysis on the extractable residuals.
We recommend you provide the following information from your analyses of the
extractables:
•

identification and quantification of all compounds with molecular weights of ≤1500
Daltons after exhaustive extraction of the final sterilized shell. These should include,
but need not be limited to:
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•
•
•
•

o residual monomers, cyclic and linear oligo-siloxanes
o known toxic residues such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), if
peroxide curing process is involved
o aromatic amines, if polyurethanes are used
the percent recovery, especially for the polydimethylsiloxanes (up to D20)
evidence that shows that exhaustive extraction has been achieved with one of the
solvents
identification of all experimental methodology 3
raw data (including instrument reports) with all chromatograms, spectrograms, etc.
You should also provide the practical quantitative limit when the analyte of interest
is not detected. 4

D.

Volatiles

We recommend you analyze the elastomer shell for volatile components using a headspace
detector.

E.

Heavy Metals

We recommend you provide qualitative and quantitative analyses for heavy metals on the
final finished shell. The heavy metal analyses should include, but need not be limited to,
analyses of the following metals: antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium,
chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, magnesium, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, platinum,
selenium, silver, tin, titanium, vanadium, and zinc. In addition, for the metal used as the
catalyst in the curing reaction, we recommend you provide the valence state and the amount
of residue of the catalyst.
In lieu of providing a complete heavy metal analysis on the finished shell, you may provide
the purity of the catalyst (with trace elements) used in the raw shell material, along with an
analysis of the finished shell for just the catalyst metal used.

F.

Saline Filler

Normal physiological sterile saline has a long history of use in breast implants and is
standardized by the USP. As stated above, the sterile saline used with your device should
follow USP standards for Normal Physiological Saline (injection grade), which has a
concentration of 0.15M and a pH of 7.2-7.4. If your breast implant is to be filled with any
other saline, we recommend you provide a complete chemical analysis of that saline.

G.

Silicone Gel Filler

The analyses of the silicone gel should be very similar to those for the elastomer shell. For
the final sterilized gel, we recommend you provide the:
•

•
•
•
•

qualitative and quantitative analyses for extractables (such as cyclic polysiloxanes),
including:
o characterization of the polymers present
o molecular weight averages and polydispersities of the polymers
o identification and quantification of all compounds present with
molecular weights ≤1500 Daltons
qualitative and quantitative analyses for volatiles
qualitative and quantitative analyses for heavy metal contents
physical properties of the gel, including viscosity, cohesivity, and approximate
crosslink density (if possible)
percentage of silicone oil and its chemical and physical properties (e.g., molecular
weight, viscosity).

H.

Alternative Filler – Polymer

For the final sterilized, alternative polymer filler, we recommend you provide the:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

rationale for the use of the specific alternative filler material
list of components used in the synthesis and the method of synthesis of any
polymer used in the preparation of filler (if a synthetic polymer) or the source and
isolation procedure of the polymer (if a natural polymer)
quantitative analyses of monomers (if a synthetic polymer) and their safety profiles
method of purification of the polymer
complete physical and chemical characteristics of the polymer (e.g., viscosity,
molecular weight)
formulation of the polymer (the ratio of polymer should be specified if the filler
material is a mixture of more than one component)
structural analyses of the polymer, including molecular weight distribution
quantification and identification of all chemicals with molecular weights ≤1500
Daltons and their characterization
trace metal/heavy metal analysis and the valence state if metals were used as
catalysts in the polymerization reaction
crosslink density (if a synthetic and cured material).

V.

rationale for the use of the specific alternative filler material

weight components
method of purification of the non-polymer
complete physical and chemical characteristics of the non-polymer (e.g., viscosity,
molecular weight)
source and isolation procedure of the non-polymer
structural analyses of the non-polymer, including molecular weight distribution.

Toxicology Data
A.

General Information

We recommend you provide a toxicological assessment because breast implants contain not
only the major polymeric materials (e.g., polymerized polydimethylsiloxane), but also low
molecular weight components (e.g., D4) from the manufacturing or sterilization processes
that may leach out into the patient’s body. In addition to the chemical composition
information (Section IV.A above), the toxicological safety assessment should include
information from pharmacokinetic studies and toxicological testing, as described below.

B.

Pharmacokinetic Studies

Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic behavior of potentially toxic chemicals is a scientific
assessment of the potential of the chemicals to accumulate in the body at concentrations that
cause human health risks. Your pharmacokinetic study design should address the worst case
assumption (i.e., all of the material in the device is absorbed into the body at once). If this
assumption, with the addition of safety factors, results in toxic levels of exposure,
demonstrations of slow diffusion of substances from the device into the body, or rapid
metabolism or excretion of the substances by the patient, may negate the worst case
assumption. The pharmacokinetic testing of toxicants of concern should determine the rates
of absorption into and clearance from the blood, the distribution in the body, and the rates of
metabolism and/or excretion. If radiolabeling is used, we recommend you label the device to
reflect the fates of all of the components of interest. For additional information about
pharmacokinetics, refer to ISO 10993-16. 5

degradation products and leachables.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

C.

Toxicological Testing

Toxicological testing is used to detect unidentified toxicants and to quantify the exposure to
known toxic compounds. We recommend you perform the following toxicological tests
separately on both the final sterilized shell and filler:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

cytotoxicity
acute systemic toxicity
hemocompatibility
immunotoxicity
reproductive toxicity
teratogenicity
genotoxicity
carcinogenicity
implantation testing.

Refer to ISO 10993-1 6 and the CDRH guidance document, “Use of International Standard
ISO 10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a
risk management process,’”7 for more details about the toxicological tests above. We have
included additional special considerations for some of these tests below.
Acute Systemic Toxicity
For the pyrogenicity element of the acute systemic toxicity testing, we recommend that you
perform both the rabbit pyrogen and the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) tests. For
routine batch monitoring, the LAL test should be sufficient.
Immunotoxicity Testing
For immunotoxicity testing, we recommend you assess the level of immunotoxicity of the
shell and any leachable compounds from the shell and the gel (if applicable). For more
information, you should refer to the CDRH “Immunotoxicity Testing Guidance.” 8
Reproductive and Teratogenicity Testing
For reproductive and teratogenicity testing, you should measure the rates of conception,
maturation, and cycling abnormalities, as well as the number of fetal deaths and
malformations. Obvious malformations are rare; therefore, we recommend extensive
examinations to adequately assess the malformation rates. The studies should include at least

two generations. You should test individual compounds at the highest possible exposure that
does not produce non-reproductive systemic toxicity.
Genotoxicity Testing
For genotoxicity testing, you should address the potential of leachable compounds and/or
degradation products of your device to cause cancer. The short-term genotoxicity testing
should consist of:
•
•
•

a bacterial mutagenicity test (including point mutations and frameshift mutations)
a mammalian forward mutation assay (e.g., a mouse lymphoma test)
an in-vivo rodent micronucleus test.

Genotoxicity testing may be sufficient in lieu of 2-year carcinogenicity testing, if all of the
short-term genotoxicity testing is negative. However, even if the short-term genotoxicity
testing is negative, FDA may still recommend 2-year carcinogenicity testing if your device
consists of other materials than those typically present in polydimethylsiloxane-based breast
implants or material compounds (e.g., D4) at higher than expected levels.
Implantation Testing
We recommend you provide acute, subchronic, and chronic implantation testing because
some implant components may elicit immediate tissue reactions, while others may diffuse
out of the device slowly and/or undergo chemical changes that affect the surrounding
tissues long after implantation. You should implant samples of shell and gel, as well as a
standard control (e.g., polyethylene), subcutaneously or submuscularly. We do not
recommend that you use extracts. You should report the gross and histological
observations of the effects of implantation. We recommend that the chronic implantation
testing be extended for 2 years, roughly the lifetime of the rat.
If the short-term genetic toxicology testing is negative and the clinical carcinogenic
experience with the materials continues to support safety, it may be appropriate to complete
the carcinogenicity testing and/or chronic implantation testing concurrently with an ongoing
clinical study.

VI. Mechanical Data
A.

General Information

We recommend you provide mechanical testing on the final finished product or individual
components of it (e.g., shell, valve). These tests are described in Sections VI.B through VI.G
below. Whenever possible (and applicable), testing should mimic in-vivo conditions. If your
device is sterilized by different methods (e.g., ethylene oxide, gamma radiation), you should
perform the testing on samples sterilized by the different methods, or provide an adequate
rationale why the change in sterilization method does not negatively impact the mechanical
characteristics. You should also provide complete reports for all testing, including
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

identification of the devices tested and a description of the test set-up and methods, including
sketches or photographs.

B.

Fatigue Rupture Testing of Total Device

Most materials have a finite fatigue life when repeatedly stressed in-vivo. Repeated
stressing of the device may eventually weaken the shell and lead to failure. While FDA
recommends a test method that mimics in-vivo conditions, FDA recognizes that a test
method cannot be adequately validated until in-vivo rupture from cyclic fatigue has been
analyzed and characterized. Currently available data on retrieved devices implanted for
approximately 10 years suggest that the devices may be failing due to reasons such as fold
flaw, localized shell stress, and instrument damage, rather than shell rupture due to pure
cyclic loading. Nevertheless, FDA believes that cyclic testing provides useful information
about the fatigue characteristics of the device.
Therefore, we recommend you provide a complete test report of fatigue testing on the worst
case, final, sterilized device(s) with the thinnest shells allowed by the design release criteria
using a test set-up with particular focus on the loading direction(s) on the device, the shape
of the loading apparatus that contacts the device, and the testing medium, etc., that best
mimics expected in-vivo loading. The common test methodology, in which flat plates
compress the device, may or may not be predictive of clinical failure for your device.
We recommend you perform fatigue testing in a constant load or a constant displacement
mode. However, you should perform constant displacement testing only if you measure the
actual applied loads continuously or at frequent points during the testing and the variation of
the actual applied load is minimal. You should use the minimal load applied during constant
displacement testing to establish the endurance load level.
You should cyclically load the samples at varying loads or displacements to generate an
applied force versus number of cycles to failure (AF/N) curve for each style of device tested.
You should test a minimum of 3 samples from a typical production run at a given load or
displacement because of the general variance seen in elastomer testing. We recommend the
endurance load (or the load at which the samples do not fail under cyclic loading) be
established at a minimum of 6.5 million cycles runout. The AF/N curves may be generated
by best-fit approach or by averaging the number of samples tested at each load. There
should be a tight range (e.g., 10%) of points around and at the endurance load level for an
optimal estimate of fatigue strength.
We recommend you provide the following results for each style of device tested:
•
•
•

the resulting endurance load level
the clinical relevance for the resulting endurance load level
the AF/N curve
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

the raw data (e.g., applied loads, applied displacements for displacement control
test, number of cycles to failure, sample thicknesses).

In addition to the fatigue testing described above, we recommend you perform an analysis of
the cyclic raw data to estimate a pure cyclic fatigue lifetime of your device. However, FDA
believes that this will remain unvalidated until you have analyzed and duplicated clinical
failures from pure cyclic fatigue in bench testing.

C.

Valve Competency Testing

This testing pertains only to breast implants with valves. Valve competence tests are
performed to demonstrate that valve integrity is maintained at in-vivo loads. Devices can be
subjected to hydrostatic forces that tend to force fluid out of the device, causing a deflation
and change in size and shape. The most likely source for increased pressure inside the
devices would be from patients reclining with various body parts (e.g., head, arm, trunk)
pressing on their devices.
ASTM standard F2051 9 states that there shall be no leakage observable after a normally
closed valve is subjected to a retrograde pressure equivalent to 30cm H2O for 5 minutes
and then to a retrograde pressure equivalent to 3cm H2O for 5 minutes. FDA does not
believe that the ASTM F2051 methodology is clinically relevant with respect to the load
levels. However, this methodology may provide useful information about the valve’s
response to shifts in pressure. Therefore, we recommend you provide a complete report of
valve competency testing, as described in ASTM F2051 or an equivalent method, with
pass/fail results for leakage.
In addition to the testing above, you should provide a complete report of destructive testing
to address in-vivo loading conditions. You should gradually load the samples until valve
failure occurs to define a maximum pressure for the device. We recommend you provide
the:
•
•
•

burst pressures
failure modes (including whether the failed test valves reseal upon removal of the
excess failure-inducing pressures)
rationale why the resulting burst pressures are clinically relevant.

D.

Cohesivity Testing

This testing pertains only to silicone gel-filled and, possibly, alternative breast implants.

Cohesivity of Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants
We recommend you quantify the cohesivity of the silicone gel. Although the two methods
described in ASTM F703 10 were not developed to address gels with high cohesivities, we
believe the results provide useful device characterization information. We recommend you
provide complete reports of the following testing to address gel cohesivity:
•
•

gel cohesion testing on the final gel as described in the cone/pendant method in
ASTM F703 and provide the pass/fail results
penetration testing (an indirect measure of gel cohesivity) on the in-process gel and
provide a complete description of the penetration test method, the acceptance
criteria, and the results.

Cohesivity of Alternative Breast Implants
Depending on the filler used in your alternative breast implant, FDA may recommend a
different method to assess cohesivity than described above for silicone gel-filled breast
implants.

E.

Bleed Testing

This testing pertains only to silicone gel-filled and alternative breast implants.
Bleed of Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants
Silicone gel bleed is the diffusion of gel constituents through an intact shell. It is important
to assess gel bleed for your silicone gel-filled breast implants in order to have information
accurately characterizing the gel bleed of your product, which can be included in your
labeling.
The ASTM F703 test is one method to evaluate the extent of gel bleed. However, the results
from this testing have limited clinical correlation because the ASTM F703 test method was
established for the purpose of allowing comparison between device models rather than
quantifying in-vivo gel bleed. In addition, the ASTM F703 test method was not established
to identify and quantify gel bleed constituents. Thus, FDA does not believe that this test
methodology provides adequate data to address gel bleed for the purposes of a PMA.
Accordingly, we recommend you provide a complete report of gel bleed bench testing based
on a protocol that mimics in-vivo conditions. That is, you should incubate (immerse) the
breast implants in a medium that simulates the known composition of human interstitial
fluid. 11 Animal serum that approximates this composition or any artificial medium with a
composition similar to interstitial fluid may be acceptable. Because the in-vivo environment
is dynamic, you should allow for transfer of new medium to prevent saturation. The testing

Chem (41/10), 1522-1525 (1995).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

should continue until the change in gel bleed rate of the detectable gel constituents has
leveled off. We recommend you identify the gel bleed constituents (including silicones and
platinum species (or other catalysts)), the rate that these gel constituents bleed out, and how
that rate changes over time.
FDA understands the limitations of this gel bleed bench testing in mimicking the in-vivo
environment, as well as the limitations of how these data correlate with clinical use.
Nevertheless, we believe this testing is a step closer to more accurately characterizing gel
bleed than the existing ASTM F703 test methodology. If you believe that you have an
alternative method (e.g., animal study) or clinical data that identifies and quantifies the gel
bleed constituents over time, we recommend you contact FDA.
Bleed of Alternative Breast Implants
For devices with alternative fillers, FDA is concerned about potential changes in the
composition of the alternative filler resulting from long-term chronic bleed. Therefore, in
addition to performing the testing described above for a silicone gel-filled breast implant,
we recommend you provide the results of a chemical analysis of the material remaining in
the device, over time, when evaluated in a test that mimics in-vivo conditions.

F.

Stability Testing of Alternative Breast Implants

Whereas silicone polymers (e.g., silicone gel) are considered to be highly stable, the stability
characteristics of an alternative polymer or non-polymer filler may be unknown. Therefore,
for a breast implant with an alternative polymer or non-polymer filler, we recommend you
provide a complete report of stability/aging testing to demonstrate the effects of time and
temperature (physiological temperature (37°C) and elevated temperature (≈60°C)) on the
physical properties and chemical composition of the device as a whole and of the filler
material. You should measure key physical parameters of the filler, such as viscosity and
cohesivity, at each timepoint. If there are mechanical changes, you should conduct complete
chemical analyses to explain the physical changes.

G.

Shelf Life Testing

We recommend you provide both real-time mechanical testing and packaging testing to
establish the shelf life (i.e., expiration date) for the device. Accelerated shelf life testing
may be appropriate if it has been validated by real-time data.
Mechanical Testing
We recommend you perform mechanical testing on representative aged samples at time
zero and at various intervals throughout the shelf life. The mechanical tests should include,
but need not be limited to:
•

ultimate elongation
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•
•
•
•
•

joint
tensile set
break force
valve competency (if applicable)
gel cohesivity (if applicable).

Packaging Testing
With regard to packaging testing, we recommend you test the final finished package for
initial integrity and maintenance of integrity after selecting the appropriate materials and
qualifying the package configuration. You should use test methods that are either validated
or standardized. Below is a more detailed description of what we recommend you provide
to address initial package integrity and maintenance of package integrity.
Initial Package Integrity
We recommend you test the integrity of the seal and the whole package at time zero. This
includes both seal and whole package testing. You should test the seals of the package for
seal integrity and seal strength. Seal integrity may be established by demonstrating that the
seal is impermeable and continuous. There are several standardized methods that may be
used to determine seal integrity. For example, ASTM F1929 12 is a dye penetration method
for detecting seal leaks. Seal strength should demonstrate that the fiber shedding, splitting,
and tearing of the package is within your specifications.
For whole package testing, you may use physical or microbiological test methods. Examples
of whole package integrity tests are internal pressure test, dye penetration, gas sensing test, or
vacuum leak test. Currently, there are only a few standardized physical whole package test
methods. ASTM D3078 13 is an example of a test method by bubble emission. Alternatively, a
microbial challenge test may be appropriate.
Maintenance of Package Integrity
We recommend you evaluate the ability of the package to maintain its integrity over time by
the same functional tests used for integrity testing. You should expose the package, with the
device in it, to the environmental stresses imposed by manufacturing, sterilization processes,
distribution, handling, vibration, and the storage environment. You should perform the seal
integrity and whole package testing after stressing and at various intervals throughout the
shelf life of the package. The data obtained during this time period should remain within the
validated limits of the performance specification.

VII. Device Explant Analyses
You should provide device explant analyses with the goal of characterizing modes and
causes of device failure and potentially minimizing the identified failures. In order to
provide as large a sample as possible, we recommend that the analyses include any
available explanted devices, such as those from the European market, as long as they are
the same devices for which you are seeking PMA approval.

A.

Retrieval Study

We recommend that you perform a retrieval study as the primary means of evaluating all
available explanted devices. A standard retrieval study should involve:
•
•

data collection at the time of explantation by the surgeon or appropriate
healthcare provider
laboratory analysis/testing of the explanted devices by you or a third party.

If the retrieval study involves explants from the Core Study (i.e., the primary IDE study used
to support PMA approval), FDA may also request that you provide some Core Study
clinical data, such as complication and MRI data, that correspond to the patients with
explants to better understand the results of the laboratory analyses.
Data at Time of Explantation
We recommend the following observations be recorded on a field report form by the
explanting surgeon or appropriate healthcare provider at the explant site:
•
•

•

reason(s) for the device explantation
relevant device observations at explantation, for example:
o presence of any shell defects, such as a hole or tear
o presence and extent of implant rupture (intracapsular gel, extracapsular gel,
or migrated gel)
o the condition of the valves and/or patches
o any discoloration of the filler
o fungal or bacterial contamination in shell or within filler
if applicable, whether implant rupture is believed to have occurred before or during
explantation.

You should implement a standardized method of sterilization for the explanted devices to
minimize the factors that may impact device mechanical properties.
Laboratory Analyses/Testing
We recommend you provide laboratory analyses/testing on all available explanted devices,
whether or not the explanted device is identified by the explanting party as being ruptured,
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

in order to characterize the modes and causes of failure from the available explanted
devices. While rupture (or shell opening) is one example of a failure, any undesirable
change to the device should also be characterized as a failure (e.g., gel fracture of the morecohesive silicone gel-filled breast implants).
As part of the laboratory analyses/testing, FDA recommends you provide thorough visual
and microscopic examination findings of all available explanted devices and physical
property testing to assess trends, to address retrieval study findings, etc.
FDA recommends you consider the article by Brandon, et al. 14 for a description of the type
of analyses/testing that may be appropriate for your retrieval study (e.g., control group of
unimplanted devices, detailed chemical analyses of materials, detailed mechanical testing,
scanning electron microscopy, and analysis of local tissue/capsule).
You should also consider the impact of the following factors when characterizing the modes
and causes of failure of your device:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

device type/model, lot number, size, shell thickness, surface type (smooth or
textured)
implantation duration
device handling prior to insertion
device position (subglandular or submuscular)
incision size
observations recorded at the time of explantation (section above)
surgical damage during implantation (scalpel nicks, suture punctures, surgeon’s
finger imprints, clamp grip marks)
in-vivo trauma (accident, mammography)
procedures performed while device is in-situ (biopsies, cyst aspirations)
explantation technique
in-vivo material property and chemistry changes or degradation.

B.

Supplemental Information to Characterize Device
Failure

To further characterize the modes and causes of failure of your device, we recommend you
provide:
•

an assessment of your manufacturing processes related to release specifications of
your shell to determine whether any allowances for imperfections, such as bubbles
and contaminants, may be related to device failure

Medical Implants, 13(1): 49-61. 2003.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•
•
•

an assessment of the surgical techniques that may increase the risk of rupture
a comprehensive literature review of durability studies based on explanted devices
any additional appropriate studies to assess the modes and causes of device failure.

FDA believes that this information may be used to design non-clinical tests that are more
predictive of the long-term rupture rate. We recommend that you also use the results to
design improved devices and establish new manufacturing acceptance criteria.

VIII.

Core Study Clinical Data

A.

General Information

Indications
We recommend that the Core Study (i.e., the primary IDE study used to support PMA
approval) include separate patient cohorts of:
•
•
•
•

primary augmentation
primary reconstruction
revision-augmentation
revision-reconstruction.

Because these studies are complicated by the fact that an individual patient may receive two
devices for two different reasons (e.g., a woman may receive one device for reconstruction
and one for augmentation), we recommend you record and analyze the data for both on a per
patient and a per device basis.
We recommend you classify the patient and device by the initial indication at study entry as
follows:
•
•

•

If a reconstruction patient undergoes contralateral augmentation, you should
classify that patient as reconstruction. The device should be classified as
one reconstruction and one augmentation.
If a revision-augmentation patient (i.e., the patient entered the study due to
replacement of an existing device, regardless of the type or manufacturer of the
existing device), undergoes contralateral augmentation, you should classify that
patient as a revision-augmentation patient. The device should be classified as
one revision-augmentation and one augmentation.
Even if the device is removed and replaced during the study (i.e., after
initial implantation), you should classify the patient and device under the
original indication (i.e., primary augmentation, primary reconstruction, or
revision- augmentation or revision-reconstruction).

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Core Study Duration
FDA recommends that the Core Study involve 10 years or more of prospective patient
follow-up, including some premarket and some postmarket follow-up. The premarket
duration of the Core Study will depend on the device design and all of the available safety
and effectiveness data, including, but not limited to, the Core Study data. As a whole, the
premarket data (clinical and non-clinical) should be sufficient to characterize complication
rates over time, potential health consequences of those complications, and any other specific
safety concern for your device, whether it is a saline-filled, silicone gel-filled, or alternative
breast implant.
Section IX of this document describes how additional information to address issues
associated with silicone gel-filled breast implants may be addressed by clinical data other
than the Core Study. In addition, Section IX describes how literature may provide
supplemental information to address specific breast implant topics.
At this time, a minimum of three years of premarket Core Study data have been submitted to
support approval of standard silicone gel breast implants, and a minimum of two years of
premarket Core Study data have been submitted to support approval of standard saline-filled
breast implants. However, the appropriate length of time for collection of premarket Core
Study data will be determined on a case-by-case basis for each implant after careful
consideration of all available clinical and non-clinical data.
Evaluation Timepoints
FDA recommends that you conduct regularly scheduled evaluations of complications, with
follow-up intervals of 6-10 weeks, 1 year, and annually through 10 years. We recommend
you perform annual evaluations to minimize the number of patients lost-to-follow-up.
For MRIs to screen for asymptomatic (silent) rupture (see Section VIII.E), connective
tissue diseases evaluations (see Section VIII.F), and patient reported outcome evaluations
(Section VIII.H), we recommend biennial follow-up evaluations.
Follow-up after Device Removal
For patients who undergo device removal and replacement with your device or removal
without replacement, you should continue to collect safety data on these patients as
described in your protocol.
Control Group
If you choose to incorporate a concurrent control group, we recommend that you select an
approved breast implant. If you choose not to incorporate a concurrent control group, we
recommend that you use historical controls and provide the rationale for not using a
concurrent control group.

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Sample Size
We recommend you base sample size estimates on the precision of safety and effectiveness
outcomes or the detection of a clinically meaningful difference from baseline or from a
control group, taking into account the lost-to-follow-up rates estimated for 10 years of
follow-up. If sample size estimates are based on the precision with which complication
rates can be estimated, then the sample size should be large enough to ensure this precision
is within a pre-specified number of percentage points based on 95% confidence intervals.
For example, for sufficient numbers of patients with primary augmentation or primary
reconstruction (i.e., assuming 75% primary augmentation and 25% primary reconstruction)
to determine the rupture rate with a precision as follows, data on 500 patients would be
needed at 10 years post-implantation. If you estimate a hypothetical 40% drop out rate at 10
years, then you should enroll at least 850 patients to achieve 10-year data on 500 patients.
This sample size will provide a worst case precision of +/-4%, given a rupture rate of 50%.
The precision will improve as the rate moves away from 50%, with a +/-1.9% precision at a
rupture rate of 5% or 95%. Pooling of primary augmentation and primary reconstruction
cohorts represents the overall best case (i.e. lowest) precision. However, FDA recommends
you provide the precision (i.e., confidence intervals) separately for each patient cohort.
Because both safety and effectiveness data from patients presenting for revision may be
significantly different from data from primary implantation patients, you should include a
proportion of patients presenting for revision. For example, if you estimate approximately
20% of patients present for breast implants due to revision, you should increase the sample
size by 20%. Therefore, if you need 850 primary implantation patients, you should enroll
approximately 170 revision patients, with the majority of these patients being revisionaugmentation patients. This leads to an overall sample size of approximately 1020 patients.
You should support all marketing claims of equivalence or superiority to existing implants
or therapies with statistically justified numbers of patients, clinically relevant endpoints,
and direct comparisons made to an appropriate control group.
Although the sample size example above is based on a worst-case assumption of 40% lostto-follow-up at 10 years, FDA believes you should provide a minimum of 80% follow-up
at each timepoint per patient cohort to have meaningful data to evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of your device.
Lost-to-Follow-Up Analyses
High lost-to-follow-up rates may affect FDA's ability to evaluate your PMA. Therefore, we
recommend you include a comparison of baseline characteristics between those subjects
with complete data and those without to ascertain the presence of any non-respondent bias.
We recommend you contact patients who are lost-to-follow-up at the end of the study to
determine whether the outcomes for these patients are the same as those for the patients who
were compliant with follow-up. Failure to do this may delay filing or approval of the PMA
because additional clinical data may be necessary.

Data Presentations
The sections below describe the types of safety and effectiveness data that we recommend
you provide regarding your Core Study in a breast implant PMA. We encourage you to
provide your own data presentations, as well as those described below. While most of these
presentations apply to all types of breast implants, some data presentations, such as silent
rupture (i.e., asymptomatic rupture) information, are not applicable to saline-filled breast
implants.
The majority of the data described below should be reported for the separate patient
cohorts of primary augmentation, primary reconstruction, revision-augmentation, and
revision-reconstruction (i.e., the patient status/indication at study entry). Furthermore, you
should provide the data on both per patient and per device bases for most of the items below.

B.

Patient Accounting

We recommend you provide complete patient accounting on a per patient basis for each
cohort. You should include the number of patients theoretically due, discontinued because
of death or device removal, expected for follow-up, and actually evaluated at each
evaluation timepoint. Table 1 below is an example of cumulative patient accounting.

Safety Assessment – Complications

Complications
The information described below is important in determining the safety of breast implants. 15
Regardless of whether or not the complications may be related to the device, we recommend
you provide:
•

the incidence, timing, and resolution of all complications, such as rupture, capsular
contracture (include Baker Grade), infection, calcification, malposition, extrusion,
skin erosion, necrosis, lymphadenopathy, delayed wound healing,
breast/chest/axillary mass formation, hematoma, seroma, pain, wrinkling,
asymmetry, scar formation, palpability/visibility of the device, iatrogenic injury, etc.

•

the incidence, timing, and severity of alterations in nipple or breast sensation

•

the incidence, timing, and severity of interference and/or difficulties with lactation,
as well as the frequency of attempted lactation without success

•

the incidence, timing, and nature of difficulties with pregnancy

•

the incidence, timing, and cause of patient deaths (the causes of death should be
taken from post-mortem examinations)

•

the incidence, timing, and type of new breast cancer diagnosis post-implantation,
including any mammographic difficulties/interference caused by the device

•

the incidence, timing, and extent of new connective tissue disease (CTD) diagnoses,
signs, and symptoms.

Cumulative Incidence of Complications
We recommend you provide the cumulative incidence of each complication at each
timepoint on both per patient and per device bases for each cohort. This data set should
include reoperation and removal with or without replacement.
You should provide the numerator and denominator used and describe how these values
were obtained. The denominator should be the number of patients or devices at that
timepoint.
If the same complication is reported in the same patient or breast more than once, it should
be counted once in the numerator if that same complication did not resolve during the entire
follow-up period. If a complication occurs in a patient or breast, resolves, and then recurs at
15

a subsequent timepoint in the same patient or breast, it should be counted twice in the
numerator.
If more than one different or new complication occurs in the same patient or breast
cumulatively, it should be counted each time in the numerator and once in the denominator
for per patient and per device reporting for the total (overall) data presentation.
Each capsular contracture grade should be considered a new or different complication and a
new (after implantation) diagnosis of breast cancer should be considered a new
complication.
Kaplan-Meier Analyses of Complications
We recommend you provide Kaplan-Meier analyses (i.e., 1 minus the complication-free
survival rate over time) on both per patient and per device bases for each cohort for each
complication, whether or not the complications may be related to the device. The KaplanMeier analyses should include reoperation and removal with or without replacement. For
capsular contracture, you should present capsular contracture grades II, III, and IV
separately, as well as capsular contracture grades III and IV together. For rupture of silicone
gel-filled breast implants, see Section VIII.E below for more details.
To avoid the problem of competing risks, a patient who experiences one complication
should still be considered a candidate to experience any other potential complication.
Summary Table of Reoperations, Additional Surgical Procedures, Patients, and Implants
We recommend you provide a table that summarizes the number of reoperations and
corresponding number of additional surgical procedures, patients, and implants, per
indication, for the Core Study. See the sample table below.

Primary Reasons for Reoperation
A reoperation is defined as a single surgery performed on a patient at a given timepoint,
irrespective of whether one or two implants are involved. If a patient undergoes another
surgery at a later timepoint, it should be counted as a separate reoperation. One or more
reasons for a single reoperation may be reported by a surgeon.

25

If more than one reason for a single reoperation is reported, FDA recommends you
determine the primary reason using the following hierarchy:

scarring
nipple complications
device injury/iatrogenic
breast cancer mass
biopsy
patient request for style/size change.

We recommend you provide the cumulative primary reasons for reoperation for each cohort
at each timepoint. The denominator should be the total number of reoperations since the
initial implantation until that timepoint. Because you are providing primary reasons, the
sum of the numerators should equal the denominator.
Primary Reasons for Device Removal
We recommend you provide the cumulative reasons for device removal for each cohort at
each timepoint. The denominator should be the total number of devices removed since the
initial implantation until that timepoint. If more than one reason for a single removal is
reported by the surgeon, then FDA recommends you determine the primary reason using the
same hierarchy above used to determine the primary reason for a reoperation. Because you
are providing primary reasons, the sum of the numerators should equal the denominator.
Types of Additional Surgical Procedures
Multiple surgical procedures can be performed in a given reoperation. Examples of types of
additional surgical procedures include capsulotomy, capsulectomy, device removal followed
by replacement, device removal without replacement, saline volume adjustment, reposition
of device, drainage of abscess/hematoma/seroma, excision of masses/lymph nodes in
ipsilateral axilla or arm of implanted breast, and biopsy/cyst removal.

26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

We recommend you provide the cumulative types of additional surgical procedures for each
cohort at each timepoint. The denominator should be the total number of additional surgical
procedures since the initial implantation until that timepoint. If more than one type of
procedure is reported for a reoperation, you should report all procedures performed.
Cumulative Incidence of Complications after Removal of Study Device With Replacement
As stated above, we recommend you continue to follow patients who have undergone device
removal with study device replacement. We recommend you provide the cumulative
incidence of individual complications at each timepoint on both per patient and per device
bases for each cohort. You should provide the numerator and denominator used and
describe how these values were obtained. The denominator should be the number of
patients or devices at that timepoint. See the Cumulative Incidence of Complications
section above for more details.
Cumulative Incidence of Complications after Removal of Study Device Without
Replacement
As stated above, we recommend you continue to follow patients who have undergone device
removal without replacement in order to assess complications that may occur after removal,
particularly for those patients who had their device(s) removed due to rupture. We
recommend you provide the cumulative incidence of individual complications at each
timepoint on both per patient and per device bases for each cohort. You should provide the
numerator and denominator used and describe how these values were obtained. The
denominator should be the number of patients or devices at that timepoint. See the
Cumulative Incidence of Complications section above for more details.

E.

Safety Assessment – Rupture

Rupture of Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants
FDA believes device rupture is one of the primary safety concerns presented by gel-filled
breast implants. When a silicone gel-filled breast implant ruptures, the patient and the
physician are often unaware of it (i.e., silent rupture or asymptomatic rupture). The rupture
may be intracapsular (when the gel remains within the scar tissue capsule surrounding the
implant), extracapsular (when the gel moves outside the capsule but remains within the
breast tissue), or involve migrated gel (when the gel moves beyond the breast).
Please note that the recommendations below are for safety assessments of rupture of
silicone gel-filled breast implants for patients undergoing the 10-year Core Study. For
current recommendations concerning rupture screening for patients with approved
silicone-gel breast implants, please refer to the “Rupture Screening Recommendations
Update” section of FDA’s guidance, “Breast Implants - Certain Labeling Recommendations
to Improve Patient Communication”16 (“Breast Implant Labeling Guidance”).

FDA recommends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the current method of choice for
detecting silent rupture of silicone gel-filled breast implants. In fact, the sensitivity of
physical examination to detect silicone breast implant rupture is 30% 17 compared to 89% for
MRI. 18 MRI of the breast should be performed with a dedicated breast coil, with a magnet of
at least 1.5 Tesla, and preferably in centers experienced in performing and interpreting this
type of examination. The MRI films should be read by both the local radiologist at the
center performing the exam and by a radiologist experienced in reading breast implant MRIs
(i.e., qualified MRI assessor). The radiologists should be masked to the investigator’s
judgment of a possible rupture (if applicable) and should each perform an independent
assessment of each MRI and rate the presence or absence of rupture as definitive,
suspicious/indeterminate, or none/intact.
For devices that are explanted, the final rupture determination should be made at the time of
explantation. If explantation is not performed for devices reported as definitive or
indeterminate for rupture via MRI, the determination of rupture should be based on the
worst case reading by either the qualified MRI assessor or the local radiologist.
FDA recommends that all patients receiving silicone gel-filled breast implants in the Core
Study undergo MRI evaluations at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 years to assure that patients are
adequately monitored for silent rupture consistent with the recommended method and
frequency that is included in the labeling for the approved silicone gel-filled breast
implants. In addition, this allows you to determine a single rupture rate, for each cohort,
for the purposes of patient labeling. 19
If, because of the mechanical or chemical properties of your device, rupture cannot be
visualized using MRI, we recommend you develop an alternative validated method with
sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of MRI.
To characterize rupture, we recommend you provide:
•

the rupture rate over the duration of the Core Study via prospective, sequential
screening of the study population using diagnostic radiographic or other techniques
of comparable sensitivity and specificity (some of the Core Study data may be
premarket and some may be postapproval)

•

the frequency of observed intracapsular gel, extracapsular gel, and migrated gel, as
well as the destination of the migrated gel for all patients with symptomatic or silent
ruptured devices

This is not the case with past Core Study designs that involved MRI and non-MRI cohorts because FDA
believed those cohorts should not be statistically combined.

•

a detailed description of the local and systemic health consequences for all patients
with symptomatic or silent ruptured devices, including the severity of these health
consequences and the clinical course of these patients. Systemic health
consequences can include the results of connective tissue disease (CTD) screening.

In addition, we recommend you provide the incidence, prevalence, and Kaplan-Meier rates for
each of the following rupture events:
•

MRI diagnosis of definitive or indeterminate rupture, regardless of confirmation with
removal. If there is disagreement between the MRI readings of the qualified MRI
assessor and the local radiologist, then the worst case reading from either should be
utilized in the silent rupture rate

•

rupture noted at removal, regardless of MRI diagnosis

•

rupture noted during the retrieval study, if performed and applicable

•

overall rupture rate based on rupture data from any of the sources from the 3 bullets
above.

For each device suspected of rupture or reported as ruptured, we recommend you provide a
summary of the dates and results of all diagnostic procedures performed related to rupture.
We also recommend you provide the actual reports of these diagnostic procedures (e.g., MRI
reports, mammogram reports) and provide the surgical explant reports for devices removed
with or without replacement. In addition, we recommend you provide the final status of each
device suspected of rupture or where rupture is confirmed.
Rupture of Alternative Breast Implants
Depending on the filler of your alternative breast implants, FDA may recommend you
provide rupture information similar to that described above for silicone gel-filled breast
implants.

Safety Assessment – Connective Tissue Diseases
(CTDs)

FDA recognizes that much has been learned over the last few decades about CTDs,
including data and analysis from the 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report on the Safety
of Silicone Breast Implants. 20 In addition, we recognize that the Core Study is not designed
to examine a potential association between breast implants and the development of CTDs.
We do recommend, however, that you collect CTD information as part of the overall safety

20

assessment on your device, as well as to provide complete information to patients who may
consider getting breast implants.
FDA recommends you conduct the CTD evaluations on all patients at the preoperative
timepoint and at the 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10-year postoperative timepoints. If indicated, patients
should have a follow-up evaluation(s) by a rheumatologist or other appropriate specialist
with collection of serological information (e.g., anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid
factor (RF), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), immunoglobulin levels, c-reactive protein
(CRP), anticardiolipin antibodies (both IgG and IgM), evaluation for monoclonal proteins,
complement levels).
Because you should refer patients reporting signs and symptoms that were not present at
baseline to the appropriate specialist for evaluation, please provide the criteria (i.e., number
and types of responses) for referral to a rheumatologist or other specialist. You should also
report the proportion of patients who were referred to specialists based on these evaluations.
CTD Diagnoses
CTD diagnoses include:
•

rheumatic diseases – such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus,
discoid lupus, scleroderma, vasculitis, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis

•

rheumatic syndromes – such as Raynaud’s phenomenon, Sjogren’s syndrome,
CREST syndrome, morphea, carpal tunnel syndrome, multiple sclerosis-like
syndrome, multiple myeloma-like syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and
fibromyalgia.

We recommend you provide the following on a per patient basis for each cohort:
•

Kaplan-Meier analyses (e.g., 1 minus the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-free
survival rate over time) for each CTD diagnosis separately and for having one or
more CTD diagnosis

•

the cumulative incidence of CTD diagnoses at each timepoint for each CTD diagnosis
separately and for having one or more CTD diagnosis. You should provide the
numerator and denominator used and describe how these values were obtained. The
denominator should be the number of patients at that timepoint.

CTD Sign/Symptom Categories
A sign/symptom category is an anatomical or body function area (e.g., skin, muscle, joint,
gastrointestinal, respiratory, neurological, general). For example:
•

skin includes alopecia, facial rash, pruritis, and echymoses
30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

muscle includes myalgias, muscle weakness, and elevated CRP

•

joint includes arthralgia, arthritis, and morning stiffness

•

neurological includes cognitive dysfunction, memory problems, peripheral
neuropathy, and multiple sclerosis-like symptoms

•

general includes fatigue, generalized pain, fever, and depression.

We recommend you provide the following data on a per patient basis for each cohort:
•

Kaplan-Meier analysis for each symptom category

•

Kaplan-Meier analysis describing patients who are free from one or more positive
symptoms

•

the cumulative incidence of at least one CTD sign/symptom category at each
timepoint. You should provide the numerator and denominator used and describe
how these values were obtained. The denominator should be the number of patients
at that timepoint.

Individual CTD Signs and Symptoms
Examples of individual CTD signs and symptoms include hair loss, facial rash,
photosensitivity, dry eyes, dry mouth, arthralgias, myalgias, neuralgias, difficulty
swallowing, morning stiffness that lasts more than 30 minutes, ocular
inflammation/retinitis/optic neuritis, muscle weakness, joint swelling for more than 6 weeks,
pleurisy, respiratory difficulty, skin rash, lymphadenopathy, cognitive dysfunction, fatigue,
paresthesia, dizziness, abnormal bruising or bleeding, purpura, unexplained fever, urticaria,
telangiectasia, and petechiae.
We recommend you provide the following data on a per patient basis for each cohort:
•

the cumulative incidence of each individual CTD sign and symptom at each
timepoint. You should provide the numerator and denominator used and describe
how these values were obtained. The denominator should be the number of
patients at that timepoint

•

the status of device rupture, reported complications, and patient satisfaction for
patients reporting CTD signs and symptoms that were not present before breast
implantation

•

a comparison of the incidence and types of new CTD signs and symptoms reported
with information from the published literature or other comparable sources (e.g., data
from patients with other types of devices, data from patients seeking other types of

cosmetic surgery).

G.

Safety Assessment – Mammography Data

For patients who undergo screening mammography during the study, we recommend you
provide separate analyses for mammographic suspicion for tumor:
•
•
•

regardless of biopsy results
with a biopsy positive for malignant tumor
with a biopsy negative for malignant tumor.

The analyses for each event should include:
•

the non-cumulative point prevalence at each timepoint on both per patient and per
device bases for each cohort. You should provide the numerator and denominator
used and describe how these values were obtained. The denominator should be the
number of patients or devices at that timepoint

•

the cumulative incidence at each timepoint on both per patient and per device bases
for each cohort. You should provide the numerator and denominator used and
describe how these values were obtained. The denominator should be the number of
patients or devices at that timepoint

•

a comparison of the data to that reported in the literature for aged-matched cohorts.

H.

Effectiveness Assessment

Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)
We recommend you provide the results from PRO assessments to assess the beneficial
impact of the device. These are the same assessments that were previously referred to by
FDA as health related quality of life assessments. These assessments should include, but
need not be limited to:
•
•

a measure of self esteem (e.g., Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale 21 or Tennessee SelfConcept Scale 22)
a measure of body image (e.g., Body Esteem Scale 23)

•

a measure of general health outcome (e.g., SF-36 Status Survey, 24 Medical Outcomes
Study (MOS) 20-Item Health Survey 25).

FDA recommends you conduct PRO assessments on all patients at the preoperative
timepoint and at the 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10-year postoperative timepoints. For reconstruction
patients, you should describe the timing of administration of these instruments (delayed or
immediately following reconstruction).
We recommend you provide the mean (± standard deviation) change in each validated PRO
measure (preoperative to each visit). You should report these results on a per patient basis
for each cohort. The denominator should be the number of patients evaluated at each visit
interval. FDA also recommends that you compare your results to published normative data
for those PROs for which these data exist (e.g., SF-36).
Satisfaction
We also recommend you provide data on patient satisfaction. Patient-reported satisfaction
measures should incorporate satisfaction based on:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

preoperative expectations
the initial surgical procedure
any adjunctive surgical and medical procedures
any complications
device removal, regardless of whether the device was replaced
whether the expected benefits of the devices have been met
whether the patient would have the surgery over again.

For those patients reporting dissatisfaction following breast implantation, we recommend
you provide the following information:
•
•
•

detailed reason for dissatisfaction
presence, severity, status (i.e., resolved or not resolved), and method of resolution of
any complications
reports of CTD diagnoses, signs, and symptoms.

Anatomical Effect
We recommend you provide data on the anatomical effect of the device for augmentation
and augmentation-revision cohorts. This may be accomplished by comparing matched
analyses of before and after bra and cup sizes, chest circumference, symmetry, or other

standardized measurements. For example, we recommend you provide the following on a
per patient basis:
•
•

frequency distribution of bra cup size at baseline, end of study, and change from
baseline
mean (± standard deviation) chest circumferences at baseline, end of the study, and
change from baseline.

I.

Other Statistical Analysis

Sample Size Rationale
We recommend you provide the statistical rationale for why the sample size is adequate to
evaluate the device. This should include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

identification of effect criteria (i.e., clinically significant difference in the response
variables to be detected)
statistical error tolerances of alpha and beta (as applicable)
desired precision for rate estimates (e.g., defined as ½ width of confidence interval)
anticipated variances of response variables (if known)
any assumptions or statistical formulas with a list of references used
reasonable estimations of lost-to-follow-up rates
all calculations used.

Pooling Analyses
We recommend you provide the statistical rationale for pooling across:
•
•

investigational sites
demographic and baseline characteristics.

Logistic Regression Analyses of Each Safety and Effectiveness Outcome
To determine which variables are associated with each safety and effectiveness outcome, we
recommend you provide logistic regression analyses, where appropriate, on a per device
basis for each cohort using, but not necessarily limited to, the following static covariates:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

patient age
indication for use (i.e., augmentation, reconstruction, revision-augmentation, or
revision-reconstruction)
device surface type (i.e., smooth or textured)
device type (i.e., single or multi-lumen)
device size
valve type (e.g., leaf, diaphragm)
surgical incision site (e.g., periareolar, inframammary fold, axillary)
34

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•
•
•
•
•

incision size
device placement (e.g., retromuscular, subglandular)
timing of reconstruction (i.e., immediate or delayed)
use and type of surgical pocket irrigation
use and type of intraluminal agents.

Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Analyses of Rupture/Deflation
To determine which variables are associated with rupture/deflation, we recommend you
provide Cox regression analyses of rupture/deflation on a per patient basis for each cohort
using the static covariates above, as well as time-dependent covariates (e.g., infection,
capsular contracture). The coefficient estimates should be the relative risks (hazard ratios)
of rupture/deflation based on transition to a complication. An advantage of this approach is
that rupture/deflation is clearly defined and multiple complications can be easily handled as
separate time-dependent covariates for each type of event. This also addresses the problem
of competing risks.
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) Analyses of CTDs
To analyze whether any increases in the signs and symptoms of CTDs were due to the
implant or due to the increased age of the patient, we recommend that you provide GEE
analyses on a per patient basis for each cohort, using age as a covariate.

IX. Other Clinical Data
A.

Supplemental Clinical Information to Address Rupture

This section pertains only to silicone gel-filled and alternative breast implants.
Silicone Gel-Filled Breast Implants
Because of its limited sample size, we believe the Core Study may not fully address
concerns about device rupture. Using other sources of information, such as other U.S. or
European retrospective or prospective studies or the literature, we recommend you provide
the following additional clinical information on your device:
•
•
•
•

any available long-term rupture rate data, ideally collected via prospective, sequential
screening of the study population using diagnostic radiographic or other techniques of
comparable sensitivity and specificity
the frequency of observed intracapsular gel, extracapsular gel, and migrated gel, as
well as the destination of the migrated gel
a detailed description of the local and systemic health consequences for all patients
with ruptured devices (both symptomatic and silent rupture patients), including the
severity of the local health consequences and the clinical course of these patients
the incidence, prevalence, and timing of silent ruptures that progress to symptomatic
ruptures
35

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

the incidence, prevalence, and timing of intracapsular ruptures that progress to
extracapsular ruptures.

Alternative Breast Implants
Depending on the design or materials of your alternative breast implant, FDA may
recommend supplemental clinical information similar to that described above for silicone
gel-filled breast implants.

B.

Supplemental Literature Information

Because of the limited sample size of the Core Study, we recommend you provide a current
review of the literature on breast implants for the topics below. The topics include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

cancer (both breast and non-breast)
benign breast disease
CTD diagnoses, signs, and symptoms, including fibromyalgia
interference of device with mammographic detection of tumors or rupture
neurological disease
ability to lactate
offspring issues (safety of milk for breastfeeding and 2nd generation effects)
potential systemic health consequences of extracapsular and migrated gel rupture
potential health consequences of gel bleed
depression, anxiety, and suicide.

We recommend you provide a thorough search of current medical literature on breast
implants to address the range of clinical experience with each of the topics bulleted above as
they relate to the specific type of device (i.e., silicone gel-filled, saline-filled, or alternative),
as well as the criteria and method for selecting the literature. We recommend you provide
copies of the literature references and develop a table that summarizes the information.
We recommend you provide literature information specific to the subject breast implant
type. However, if no device type-specific information is available, you should provide
pooled data (e.g., silicone gel and saline data) from the literature.
For alternative breast implants for which the alternative material is used in another type of
medical device, we recommend you provide a summary of the literature involving clinical
experience with that material.

X.

Labeling
A.

General Information

General labeling requirements for medical devices are described in 21 CFR Part 801.
Additional labeling requirements for IDE submissions are found in 21 CFR §§ 812.5 and
812.20(b)(10). Additional labeling requirements for PMA submissions are found in 21 CFR §
814.20(b)(10). The IDE and PMA regulations require that you provide copies of all labeling
for your device(s).
Below is a description of the physician labeling, patient labeling, and patient device card, which
we recommend that you provide for your device, when submitting an IDE or a PMA for
a breast implant. The labeling recommendations provided below are based on labeling
recommendations for saline and silicone-gel filled breast implants. While FDA believes that
these labeling recommendations are also generally applicable to alternative breast implants,
FDA notes that certain recommendations may not apply or that FDA may recommend different
or additional labeling for alternative breast implants depending on their design, materials and
performance characteristics. We encourage manufacturers of other breast implants to engage
with CDRH through the pre-submission process to obtain more detailed feedback regarding their
specific device. For more information on pre-submissions, please see FDA’s guidance,
“Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission
Program.”26
Please refer to FDA’s Guidance, Breast Implants - Certain Labeling Recommendations to
Improve Patient Communication27 (“Breast Implant Labeling Guidance”) for additional
recommendations concerning the content and format for certain labeling information for saline
and silicone gel-filled breast implants, including incorporation of a boxed warning and a patient
checklist into the labeling for these devices, updates to the silicone gel-filled breast implant
rupture screening recommendations, inclusion of an easy-to-find description of materials, and
provision of patient device cards. These labeling recommendations are intended to enhance,
but not replace, the physician-patient discussion of the benefits and risks of breast implants
that uniquely pertain to individual patients.

B.

Physician Labeling

We recommend you provide physician labeling (i.e., package insert) for a breast implant
PMA that includes the following types of information:
•

device name, style(s), and brief device description

The IDE physician labeling should include all elements identified in the bullets above except
for those involving specific clinical results. In addition, the labeling must include the
following statement, “CAUTION - Investigational Device. Limited by Federal (or United
States) law to investigational use.” (21 CFR § 812.5).

38

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

You should make the physician labeling available to the patient before the surgery, upon
request, whether the request comes directly from the patient or through the physician or
surgeon.

C.

Patient Labeling

The purpose of the patient labeling is to provide a patient with sufficient information (e.g.,
realistic expectations of the benefits and risks) so that the patient may make an informed
decision about the benefits and risks of breast implants.
The patient booklet/brochure and the patient device card are all part of the patient labeling
for breast implants. FDA recommends that the patient booklet/brochure include a boxed
warning, patient decision checklist, rupture screening recommendations, and materials/device
description (as described in the Breast Implant Labeling Guidance) as well as other patient
information (as described in this guidance). For those patients who decide to have breast
implants, a patient device card should also be provided to patients after surgery.
Patient labeling and the informed consent document for an IDE should not exceed the
reading comprehension level that is easily understood and usable by most readers in the
United States. For additional information, we recommend you refer to FDA’s “Guidance
on Medical Device Patient Labeling” 28 and information regarding plain language at
http://www.plainlanguage.gov.
Patient Information Booklet/Brochure
We recommend the patient information booklet/brochure include the following types of
information:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

device name, styles, and brief device description

doctor about immediately, length of recovery, physical limitations, how to monitor
her breast)
factors to consider in deciding whether or not to get breast implants (e.g., may not be
lifetime device or one-time surgery, many of the changes to breasts following
implantation are irreversible, breast implants may affect the ability to breast feed,
routine screening mammography may be more difficult, there may be health insurance
coverage issues)

For an IDE study, informed consent must be documented (21 CFR § 50.27). The basic
elements of informed consent are described in 21 CFR § 50.25, and include some of the
information in the bullets above.
Note that the informed consent document required for a patient to participate in an IDE
study should not be confused with a standard surgical consent form that a hospital requires
to be signed by any surgical patient.
Patient Device Card
We recommend you provide patient device card(s) as part of the informed consent process
for your IDE study and as part of the patient labeling for your PMA approved device. This
piece of labeling has been referred to in different ways by manufacturers, such as
manufacturer device card, patient identification card, or patient information card. Regardless
of the name used, its purpose is to provide the patient with specific information about their
device(s).
Refer to the “Patient Device Card” section of the Breast Implant Labeling Guidance for
information to include in the patient device card.

XI. Postapproval Requirements
As a condition of approval of your PMA, or in connection with the approval, FDA may require
you to conduct postapproval studies, to track your device, or to comply with restrictions
relating to the sale, distribution, or use of your device (FDCA §§ 515(d)(1)(B)(ii), 519(e),
520(e), and 522 (21 USC §§ 360e(d)(1)(B)(ii), 360i(e), 360j(e), & 360l), and 21 CFR Part 814,
40

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Subpart E). Specific postapproval commitments for your PMA will be determined at the time
of PMA approval; however, these requirements could include:
•

•
•
•

•
•

•

continued follow-up of your Core Study patients. In determining whether to require
annual mail-in questionnaires or annual physician follow-up visits, FDA will consider
the specific device and the available premarket data
a patient registry or additional postapproval study (other than postapproval Core
Study above) to collect additional postapproval data
additional studies to address the modes and causes of failure
an education and certification program to train physicians and surgeons with
regard to proper surgical technique, patient selection, patient monitoring, and
management of complications to obtain access to your device
focus group study to improve the patient labeling
a formal informed decision process that assures that the patient has been provided the
patient labeling with adequate time to read it prior to surgery and that documents that
the patient has an adequate understanding of the risks and follow-up
recommendations associated with your device
labeling updates on a regular interval to reflect any appropriate findings from
postapproval studies.

FDA also intends to require mandatory tracking upon approval of a silicone gel-filled breast
implant PMA. Mandatory tracking is not specified as a condition of PMA approval under
the PMA regulations. Instead, FDA issues tracking orders pursuant to FDCA § 519(e) (21
U.S.C. § 360i) and 21 CFR Part 821.
