TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Walk-In Workstations

Pa

BACKGROUND: The advent ‘of very large materials processing machines that

use lasers causes serious concern to manufacturers-and the Agency with
respect to product classification and protective housing requirements for
these products. The protective housing is that portion of the product that
prevents human access to laser or collateral radiation and is required
wherever and whenever access is not necessary in order for the product to
perform its intended function. Those levels of laser radiation to which
access is necessary during operation in turn determine the class of the
product.

The concept of a protective housing is relatively simple for small,
table-top products where the protective housing is clearly recognized.
However, the concept of protective housing becomes much more complex in
cases where the product is very large. Many products incorporate work
stations that enclose large multi-axis positioning tables and parts
handling machinery. The enclosures may be large enough for persons to
enter and in many instances may be considered as rooms. How can such an
enclosure be an adequate protective housing when it is large enough for
a person to be inside while the laser might be activated? There is
considerable interest on the part of purchasers of such machines and from
labor organizations for the products to be classified as Class I laser
products. In addition, the standard requires that a laser product be in
the lowest class in which the intended function can be accomplished.
Although the product may have a safety interlock as required by the
Standard, the Agency is concerned about the possibility of an operator
opening an access door, entering the work station enclosure, and closing
the door, thereby gaining access to high laser radiation levels. The
questions are: Under what circumstances will the Agency consider such a
product to be Class I and the protective housing to be adequate?

POLICY: The Center for Devices and Radiological Health will not object to

laser products that include work station enclosures large enough to permit
entry to persons being classified as Class I laser products, and will
accept the enclosure as meeting the requirement for a protective housing,
providing the following conditions are met:

LASER NOTICE #37

Page 2

The enclosure is adequate to satisfy the requirement for a
protective housing during operation, i-e., when closed,
human access is prevented,

The enclosure is safety interlocked and labeled as required by the
standard,

A means is provided as part of the overall-safety interlock
scheme to detect the presence of persons within the
enclosure, and/or to prevent operation of the laser when a
person is inside the enclosure, and

The user information clearly instructs operators to
avoid procedures that could give access to hazardous levels
of laser radiation.

The Center invites comments from the public on this interpretation of the
requirements of the standard. Please address any comments to the Director,
