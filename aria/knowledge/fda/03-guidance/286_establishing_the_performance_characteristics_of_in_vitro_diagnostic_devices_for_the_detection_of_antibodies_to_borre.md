Establishing the Performance
Characteristics of In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices for the
Detection of Antibodies to Borrelia
burgdorferi
Guidance for Industry and Food
and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations
for studies to establish the analytical and clinical performance of in vitro diagnostic
devices (IVDs) intended for the detection of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. These
devices are used to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Background
This document recommends studies for establishing the performance characteristics of in
vitro diagnostic devices for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in human serum,
plasma, and blood. Serological testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi in Lyme disease
diagnostics is a two step procedure [Ref. 1, 2]. Initial testing is done by an enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescent assay (IFA); specimens yielding positive or
equivocal results are tested further by using a Western immunoblot assay. Specimens
negative by a sensitive EIA or IFA do not need further testing. Results from Western
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
blot assays for antibodies to B. burgdorferi are supplemental rather than confirmatory.
Two-step positive results provide supportive evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi,
which could support a clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease but should not be used as a sole
criterion for diagnosis.
A manufacturer who intends to market an in vitro diagnostic device for detection of
antibodies to B. burgdorferi must conform to the general controls of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and, unless exempt, obtain premarket clearance or
approval prior to marketing the device (sections 510(k), 513, 515 of the FD&C Act; 21
U.S.C. 360(k), 360c, 360e). This document is intended to supplement 21 CFR 807.87
(information required in a premarket notification) and other FDA resources such as
“Premarket Notification 510(k)” at:

Scope
This document recommends studies for establishing the performance characteristics of
EIA or Western blot devices for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in human
serum, plasma, and blood. The following is the product code for B. burgdorferi (Lyme
disease) Class II devices cleared under 21 CFR 866.3830:
LSR – Reagent, Borrelia Serological Reagent

This document does not apply to B. burgdorferi nucleic acid amplification assays. Please
contact the Division of Microbiology Devices in the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and
Radiological Health for further information on nucleic acid amplification devices.

Risks to Health
Lyme disease is a significant public health concern. It is the most common vector-borne
infectious disease in North America. The infectious agent in Lyme disease is the
spirochete B. burgdorferi. Definitive diagnosis of B. burgdorferi infection is complicated
by the varied nature of the clinical symptoms and the overlap of these symptoms with
numerous other infectious and non-infectious diseases.
Failure of devices for the detection of B. burgdorferi antibodies to perform as expected,
or failure to correctly interpret results may lead to incorrect patient management
decisions and inappropriate public health disease reporting. In the context of individual
patient management, a false negative report could lead to a delay or failure to provide
treatment. A false positive report could lead to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment.
Therefore, establishing the performance of these devices and understanding the risks that
might be associated with their use is critical to their safe and effective use.
The studies conducted by manufacturers to establish the performance of B. burgdorferi
antibody detection devices are the basis for determining the safety and effectiveness and
substantial equivalence of these devices.

Establishing Performance Characteristics
A. Controls
When conducting the performance validation studies described below, we recommend
that you run appropriate controls every day of testing for the duration of the analytical
and clinical studies.

B. Performance Studies
We recommend you perform the following studies:
1. Cross-reactivity
Specimens known to contain potentially cross reactive antibodies to B.burgdorferi
should be evaluated. We recommend that a minimum of ten specimens should be
tested for each type. Examples of these include but are not limited to: (1) specimens
from patients with infections such as tick-borne relapsing fever; syphilis and other
treponemal infections; rickettsial diseases; ehrlichiosis; babesiosis; leptospirosis;
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
infections with parvovirus B19, influenza viruses, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, and H. pylori; and (2) patients with diagnoses that can be confused
with the late manifestations of Lyme disease such as chronic fatigue syndrome,
fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases, and multiple sclerosis.

Interference
We recommend that you characterize the effects of potential interferents on assay
performance. Examples of experimental designs, including guidelines for selecting
interferents for testing, are described in CLSI documents EP7-A2 [Ref. 3]. Potential
sources of interference can include high levels of compounds normally found in
serum, such as triglycerides, hemoglobin (i.e., hemolyzed samples), bilirubin, protein,
and lipids. We recommend that you state the criteria or level at which noninterference is determined.

2. Precision
Within-Laboratory Precision/Repeatability
We recommend that you conduct within-laboratory precision studies for devices that
include instruments or automated components. You may perform these studies inhouse, i.e., within your own company.
We recommend that you test sources of variability (such as operators, days, assay
runs, etc.) for a minimum of 12 days (not necessarily consecutive), with 2 runs per
day, and 2 replicates of each sample per run. These test days should span at least two
calibration cycles. The test panel should consist of 3-6 patient samples at three levels
of antibodies that include:
·
·

·

·

A negative sample: a sample with no analyte such that results of repeated tests
of this sample are negative 100% of the time.
A “high negative” sample (C5 concentration): a sample with an analyte
concentration below the clinical cut-off such that results of repeated tests of
this sample are negative approximately 95% of the time (and results are
positive approximately 5% of the time).
A “low positive” sample (C95 concentration): a sample with a concentration of
analyte just above the clinical cut-off such that results of repeated tests of this
sample are positive approximately 95% of the time.
A “moderate positive” sample: a sample with a concentration at which one
can anticipate positive results approximately 100% of the time (e.g.,
approximately two to three times the concentration of the clinical cut-off).

CLSI documents EP5-A2 [Ref. 4] and EP12-A [Ref. 5] contain further information
about designing and performing precision studies.

Reproducibility
The protocol for the reproducibility study may vary slightly depending on the assay
format. As a general guide, we recommend the following protocol:
·
·

·

·

Evaluate the reproducibility of your test at 3 testing sites (for example, two
external sites and one in-house site).
Use a five day testing protocol, including a minimum of two runs per day,
(unless the assay design precludes multiple runs per day) and three replicates
of each panel member per run.
Each day, have at least two operators at each facility perform the test. We
recommend that, for rapid testing or point-of-care (POC)1 devices, you
include a larger number of devices in your evaluation, in order to best
represent the settings in which the devices will be used.
Use the same sample panel as described in the repeatability study above.

CLSI document, EP15-A2 [Ref. 6], contains additional information on reproducibility
study design.
3. Specimen Collection and Handling Conditions
We recommend that you substantiate statements in your labeling about specimen storage
and transport by assessing whether the device can maintain acceptable performance over
the range of storage times and temperatures recommended to users. For example, an
appropriate study would include an analysis of aliquots stored under the recommended
conditions of time, temperature, or specified number of freeze/thaw cycles. We
recommend that you state the criteria for an acceptable range of recoveries under the
recommended storage and handling conditions as described in the CLSI document, H18A [Ref. 7].
4. Assay Cut-Off Point
We suggest that data be furnished to explain how the assay cut-off point was selected and
established. If appropriate, information should be provided on the use of an equivocal
zone for testing. If data suggests that an equivocal zone is not appropriate, this should be
explained.

5. Clinical Performance Studies
Current recommendation for Lyme disease serology testing is a two step procedure [Ref.
1, 2]:

1

Point-of-care tests, also known as bedside or near-patient tests, is a term that encompasses any diagnostic
testing near the site of patient care regardless of whether the device is intended for use by a trained medical
professional or by a lay user. The person conducting the diagnostic testing near the point of care, whether a
trained medical professional or a lay user, is the caregiver in that instance as that person is the person
providing care.

Step I: EIA tests for IgM and/or IgG antibodies
Step II: Western blot tests for IgM or IgG antibodies when EIA tests are positive
or equivocal
Since the Borrelia burgdorferi strains from the United States (U.S.) differ markedly from
Europe and other non-U.S. endemic regions, all antigenic reagents used in Lyme disease
devices to be marketed in the U.S. should be manufactured from the U.S. strain sensu
stricto B31 Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete and not from other non-U.S. strains. This is
particularly true when whole cell sonicate is used as the antigenic reagent to capture B.
burgdorferi antibodies in both EIA and Western blot devices. However, it is acceptable
to augment antigens from the U.S. strain of B. burgdorferi with recombinant proteins of
defined length but not total cell lysates from the European species of Borrelia. This
applies to first tier EIA tests only and not to Western blot tests for IgM or IgG antibodies.
Clinical studies are necessary to establish the performance characteristics for both EIA
and Western blot devices. Generally, we recommend that performance be assessed in the
testing environment in which the device will ultimately be used (i.e., clinical laboratory)
by individuals who will use the test in clinical practice (e.g., trained technologists). The
following sets forth what is expected in terms of establishing the performance
characteristics for each type of device.
Study Protocol
We recommend that you develop a detailed study protocol that includes specific
patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, the type and number of specimens needed,
directions for use, and a statistical analysis plan that accounts for variances to prevent
data bias. You need to provide a statistical justification to support the sample size of
the study population. We recommend that you include this and any other relevant
protocol information in your premarket submission.
We encourage sponsors to contact the Division of Microbiology Devices to request a
review of their proposed studies and selection of specimen types prior to study
initiation.
Study Sites
We recommend that you conduct your studies at a minimum of three separate sites,
one of which may be in-house. Note, we do not believe non-U.S. clinical testing site
data are appropriate given that different strains are found in other countries. Clinical
investigations of unapproved and uncleared in vitro diagnostic devices, including
diagnostic devices for Lyme disease, are subject to the investigational device
exemption (IDE) provisions of Section 520(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360j) and the implementing regulations. You should
consider how 21 CFR part 812 (IDEs) applies to your particular study and refer to 21
CFR part 50 (informed consent), and 21 CFR part 56 (institutional review board
review) for other applicable requirements.
We recommend that the performance evaluation for devices intended for point-ofcare (POC) use include, at a minimum, one site at a clinical laboratory as well as 2 or
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
more sites representative of non-laboratory settings in which the device is intended to
be used (e.g., an emergency department).

Study Design
The following studies should be conducted and submitted with a 510(k) application
for either a Lyme disease EIA device or a Lyme disease Western blot device. Study
designs are similar for both IgM and IgG tests.
a. Sensitivity Study: A study consisting of a minimum of 100 well characterized
clinically or culture confirmed Lyme disease specimens should be
conducted with the test device. These archived specimens should contain
samples from early, early disseminated, and late phases of the disease. The
sensitivity of the test device on these specimens should be compared to a
predicate device. A pedigree for each characterized patient contributing
samples for the studies should be included; this pedigree should encompass
available clinical and laboratory testing information.
The following breakout of the patient population is suggested for sensitivity
testing:
a.

b.

c.

Initial (acute) samples from patients with documented erythema
migrans (EM) or culture positive disease (<1 month, 1-2 months, 2–3
months after symptom onset).
Convalescent samples from patients with documented EM or culture
positive results, stratified by time of draw after initial appearance of
symptoms (3-12 months).
Testing of known Lyme disease patients with presentations other than
EM, e.g., neuro-, arthritic, etc., in which the time interval from
infection to symptom onset may be unknown or more than 1 year.

Testing of specimens from patients across all ranges is recommended.
b.Prospective Study: A study designed to test non-selected, prospectively
collected consecutive specimens from a minimum of three geographically
distinct locations within the U.S. should be conducted. Testing of these
samples using the test device and a comparison device, should occur at a
minimum of 3 sites, one of which could be internal.
i. For EIA devices: The results should be compared to a predicate
device. All positive and equivocal samples by the test device and the
predicate device should be tested by an FDA-cleared IgM and/or IgG
Western blot assay as applicable.
ii. For Western blot devices: The prospective study samples should be
tested initially by an FDA cleared first-step EIA. All EIA positive and
equivocal samples should be tested by the test device and the predicate
Western blot. Positive and negative % agreement between the two
devices should be provided.

Interpretation of Western blot results: The interpretation of Western blot results
should follow the recommended criteria described by the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) [Ref. 1] and the Second National Conference on Serological Diagnosis of
Lyme Disease [Ref. 2]. An IgM immunoblot is considered positive if two of the
following three bands are present: 23 kDa (OspC), 39 kDa (BmpA), and 41 kDa
(Fla). An IgG immunoblot is considered positive if five of the following 10 bands are
present: 18 kDa, 23 kDa (OspC), 28 kDa, 30 kDa, 39 kDa (BmpA), 41 kDa (Fla), 45
kDa, 58 kDa, 66 kDa, and 93 kDa.
Analytical Specificity Testing: For the determination of analytical specificity, testing
of samples from both endemic and non-endemic regions is recommended (minimum
of 100 samples from each region). These samples should be obtained from an
asymptomatic population but should not include pre-screened blood donors. The
results, expressed as % positives and % negatives, should be presented separately as
endemic and non-endemic subjects.
CDC Reference Panel Testing: A standard panel of positive and negative specimens
provided by the CDC for testing Lyme disease detection devices should be tested by
the new device and the results provided as % agreement with the expected results.
The data should be stratified by disease stage; early, intermediate, and late and be
compared to the predicate device.
6. Labeling
Proposed labeling for the device must comply with the requirements of 21 CFR
809.10. As part of meeting these requirements we recommend that your labeling include
a description of quality control recommendations, which should include a clear
explanation of what controls and calibrators are to be used with the assay and how often
they should be used.

C. CLIA Waiver
If you are seeking waiver for your device under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (CLIA),2 we recommend that you consult with the Division of
Microbiology Devices staff regarding the design of specific studies to support the CLIA
waiver application for your device. “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,
Recommendations: Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices,” is available at
