Real-Time Premarket
Approval Application (PMA)
Supplements
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not
binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

Introduction and Scope

This guidance provides information about the real-time review process for premarket
approval application (PMA) supplements and outlines the procedures for requesting and
submitting these types of documents.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic
and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word “should” in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
On February 4, 2003, FDA published a Federal Register notice entitled, “Medical Device
User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, Establishment of a Public Docket” 1 to provide
an opportunity for interested persons to share information and views on the
implementation of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002
(MDUFMA). 2 Subsequently, FDA issued a guidance entitled “Assessing User Fees:
PMA Supplement Definitions, Modular PMA Fees, BLA and Efficacy Supplement
Definitions, Bundling Multiple Devices in a Single Application, and Fees for
Combination Products”3 and invited comments on its topics, which included Real-Time

PMA Supplements. FDA received no comments on Real-Time PMA Supplements in
either docket.
This guidance outlines the criteria for Real-Time PMA Supplements set forth in section
737(4)(D) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and clarifies the kinds of
device modifications we believe are appropriate for real-time review. We continue to
invite comments on this guidance.

III. Which modifications are appropriate for a RealTime PMA Supplement?
According to section 737(4)(D) of the act, 4 a Real-Time PMA Supplement is defined as:
“a supplement to an approved premarket application or premarket report under
section 515 that requests a minor change to the device, such as a minor change to the
design of the device, software, sterilization, or labeling, and for which the applicant
[PMA holder] has requested and the agency has granted a meeting or similar forum
to jointly review and determine the status of the supplement.”
In general, we believe a Real-Time PMA Supplement is appropriate for a minor change
that can be expected within a product line, which includes changes to:
•

device design

•

software

•

instructions for use, warnings, or precautions or other labeling that does not
affect the indications or contraindications

•

sterilization and packaging methods.

In addition, a minor change should be one that is:
•

expected for that device type

•

validated according to scientific principles we have relied on in previous
reviews and accepted test methods or procedures for devices of that type,
wherever applicable, such as an FDA-recognized standard or guidance
document

•

adequately supported by pre-clinical or animal testing, with no new clinical data

•

typically involving review within a single scientific discipline, rather than
a multidisciplinary review. 5

We also believe that for a Real-Time PMA Supplement to be an effective route to market,
FDA and the PMA holder should agree that the review can be achieved in a “real-time”
setting before either initiates the process.

IV. How do I request a Real-Time review?
The typical request for a Real-Time review will follow these 4 steps.
1. Preliminary Discussion
Before submitting your request, we recommend you contact the Assistant Director
(AD) in the appropriate Review Division in CDRH or the applications division in
the appropriate CBER office to discuss whether the modification to your device is
appropriate for a Real-Time PMA Supplement. 6
2. Your Request
After you and FDA agree that the review can be achieved in a “real-time” setting,
we recommend you email 7, 8 your request for a Real-Time review to the
appropriate CDRH AD or CBER applications division. We recommend that your
request include the information outlined in the Sample Real Time Review Request
in Attachment I.
3. FDA’s Response
FDA plans to respond by email or fax within 14 days of receipt of Real-Time
review requests. Generally, if the information in your request is consistent with
your preliminary discussion with FDA, and FDA, after evaluating the information,
believes the modification is “minor” as defined in section III, FDA will generally
agree to review your proposed change as a real-time supplement.
4. Type of Interaction
We intend the review process for a Real-Time PMA Supplement to be interactive,
although a face-to-face meeting may not always be part of the process. We will
work with you to determine the type of interaction appropriate (e.g., face-to-face
meeting, teleconference, written responses) based on the information in your
request. If you and FDA agree a meeting is appropriate, FDA’s response will also
engineering, chemical engineering, material engineering, microbiology, or biocompatibility review.

confirm a meeting date, which should be within 30 days of the proposed
submission date of the supplement or the earliest date that both you and FDA
personnel are available to meet.

V.

Is there a user fee for a Real-Time PMA
Supplement?

Yes. As with all fee-paying submissions, the fee for a Real-Time PMA Supplement is due
upon submission of the supplement. If FDA receives the supplement prior to payment, we
will place the file on hold until we receive payment and notify you by email, fax, or
phone.9 FDA begins its review when the Office of Financial Management notifies CDRH
or CBER that payment has been received and we have received the PMA submission, and
a valid electronic copy (eCopy) has been received. See https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/premarket-submissions/medical-device-user-fees for information on remitting
user fees.

VI.

How do I submit a Real-Time PMA Supplement?

FDA requires all applicants to provide an eCopy of the Real-Time PMA supplement. 10 The
eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your signed cover letter submitted to
the appropriate Center:
•

For devices regulated by the CDRH, send it to the current address displayed on
the website http://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress.

•

For devices regulated by the CBER, send it to the current address displayed on the
website
https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofMedicalProductsandTob
acco/CBER/ucm385240.htm.

Each copy should be labeled “REAL-TIME REVIEW REQUEST GRANTED” and
contain a copy of FDA’s response granting your request for a Real-Time review.
If we have scheduled a meeting with you, we recommend you submit your Real-Time
PMA Supplement sufficiently in advance to allow FDA reviewers to adequately prepare
their reviews. If we have not received your submission at least 3 weeks before the meeting,
we will typically reschedule to assure reviewers have adequate preparation time in order to
avoid an unproductive meeting.

9

Section 102 of MDUFMA authorizes FDA to put the submission on hold until payment is received.
Please refer to the FDA guidance, “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions”
(https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/ecopy-program-medical-devicesubmissions), for additional information on the eCopy program.

VII. What should a Real-Time PMA Supplement
contain?
A Real-Time PMA Supplement should identify all modifications planned for the device
and labeling. We recommend you include testing and results, along with a detailed risk
assessment to support the continued safety and effectiveness of the modified device. Your
risk assessment should include a thorough review of all potential hazards associated with
device use, taking into account the (incremental) modification proposed in your submission
and the (cumulative) effects of any preceding modifications made since the approval of the
original PMA. Your risk assessment should also identify the steps you have taken to
minimize any additional risks that may be created by incremental or cumulative
modifications.

VIII. What is the format of a Real-Time review
meeting?
If a Real-Time review meeting is part of the process, the meeting generally proceeds as
follows:
1. You present the changes to your device, results of testing to support those
changes, and your risk analysis.
2. You and FDA discuss any questions or comments about the changes, testing, or
risk analysis.
3. The meeting briefly adjourns to allow for discussion amongst FDA staff.
4. FDA generally gives you verbal feedback that day.
After the meeting, FDA will typically send our decision letter (i.e., approval, approvable, or
not approvable letter) via mail or email to the primary correspondent identified by the
applicant.
