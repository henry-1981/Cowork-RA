Procedures for Meetings of the
Medical Devices Advisory Committee
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is issuing this guidance to provide
information regarding the processes for meetings of the Medical Devices Advisory
Committee panels other than the Medical Devices Dispute Resolution Panel (DRP).1 The
term “panel,” as used in this guidance, refers to the panels described in the Medical Devices
Advisory Committee charter, excluding the DRP. This guidance describes the general
circumstances in which CDRH consults with a panel; the process for exchange of
information between CDRH, the members of the panel, industry, and the public; and the
conduct of panel meetings.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word “should” in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
The Medical Devices Advisory Committee includes 17 panels other than the DRP.2 The
panels, according to their specialty area and authorization, advise the Commissioner in
1 For more information about the procedures of the Medical Devices DRP, see the FDA guidance, “Center for

Devices and Radiological Health Appeals Processes”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM28
4670.pdf).
2
The Medical Devices Advisory Committee is comprised of the following panels other than the DRP: (1)
Anesthesiology and Respiratory Therapy Devices; (2) Circulatory System Devices; (3) Clinical Chemistry and
Clinical Toxicology Devices; (4) Dental Products; (5) Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices; 6) Gastroenterology and

discharging responsibilities as they relate to assuring the safety and effectiveness of medical
devices and, as required, any other product for which FDA has regulatory responsibility.3 A
matter referred to a panel may relate to premarket or postmarket issues.
This guidance is intended to provide information for industry and for CDRH staff on the
processes associated with a panel meeting held for any of the reasons identified in this
guidance. This guidance replaces “Guidance on Amended Procedures for Advisory Panel
Meetings”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm073722.htm) and “Panel Review of Premarket Approval Applications #P91-2 (blue book
memo)”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm081363.htm). This guidance also supplements existing FDA-wide guidance on the
conduct of advisory committee meetings.

III. Scope
This guidance applies only to panels of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee other than
the DRP. It does not apply to other device-related or radiation-emitting product advisory
committees, such as the Device Good Manufacturing Practice Advisory Committee, the
National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee, or the Technical
Electronic Product Radiation Safety Standards Committee.

IV. Panel Meeting Topics
FDA may refer a matter to a panel either because it is legally required to do so or because it
chooses to do so at its own discretion. FDA will take a premarket approval (PMA)
application, a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application, or a proposed product
development protocol to a panel upon the request of an applicant, unless FDA finds that the
information submitted substantially duplicates information which has previously been
reviewed by a panel.4 When acting at its own discretion, CDRH intends to consider taking a
matter before a panel if, among other things, the matter is of significant public interest or

Urology Devices; (7) General and Plastic Surgery Devices; (8) General Hospital and Personal Use Devices; (9)
Hematology and Pathology Devices; (10) Immunology Devices; (11) Microbiology Devices; (12) Molecular
and Clinical Genetics; (13) Neurological Devices; (14) Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices; (15) Ophthalmic
Devices; (16) Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices; and (17) Radiological Devices. For more information on
the Medical Devices Advisory Committee, see
http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvis
oryCommittee/default.htm and
http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/default.htm

See section 515(c)(3)(B) & (f)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), as well as 21
CFR 814.44 and 814.116.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
there is additional or special expertise provided by the panel that could assist the Center in its
decision-making.
FDA may refer a matter to a panel for the following, with regards to medical device
regulation:

A.

Advice on a Premarket Submission

Panels consisting of persons with expertise relevant to the medical device premarket
submissions under review can provide valuable advice on the regulation of that medical
device for CDRH’s consideration. These meetings provide an opportunity for addressing
scientific, clinical, or public health issues with broad public input, discussion by a panel of
experts, and comment by interested parties. FDA may take any type of premarket
submission, including a premarket approval (PMA) application, a humanitarian device
exemption (HDE) application, a De Novo classification request, a premarket notification
(commonly referred to as a 510(k) submission), or a proposed product development protocol,
to a panel.
Scenarios in which CDRH may seek panel input on premarket submissions include, but are
not limited to:
·
·

·

novel technology expected to have a significant impact on clinical practice;
study results provide significant uncertainty as to whether the probable benefits of the
device outweigh its probable risks (e.g., fails to meet pre-specified endpoints or reach
statistical significance, presence of unanticipated serious safety concerns); and
significant study data quality or data integrity issues identified (e.g., substantial
amounts of missing data, large number of protocol deviations, data integrity
concerns).

CDRH intends to consider panel review for multiple types of premarket submissions. The
panel’s nonbinding recommendations are then considered as part of CDRH’s decision
whether to provide marketing authorization for the device.

B.

Regulatory Issues

CDRH may refer a matter to a panel for advice on regulatory actions or to discuss general
scientific matters. These types of meetings include, but are not limited to:

(1)

Classification/Reclassification

FDA will seek a panel’s input as part of the classification of a preamendments device5 or as
part of the process to reclassify such a device.6,7 In addition, FDA may, for good cause

5
6

See section 513(c)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 860.84.
See section 513(e)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
shown, refer a petition requesting reclassification of a postamendments device to a panel.8
For example, full-field digital mammography systems, a postamendments device type, were
presented to a panel in response to a reclassification petition submitted by a manufacturer
requesting reclassification from class III to class II for certain indications.9

(2)

General Issues

CDRH may seek the panel’s expertise on scientific issues that are related to a device type or
a general topic that is relevant to medical device safety and effectiveness but not related to
any one particular device. For example, CDRH may request expert input in formulating
recommendations for members of industry wishing to conduct a clinical trial of a device
type, to inform the development of a guidance document, or to develop regulatory strategies
to mitigate certain device risks. CDRH may also take postmarket safety issues to a panel
meeting for recommendations. For example, the General Hospital and Personal Use Devices
Panel provided advice to the FDA regarding clinical risks and benefits of postmarket actions
in response to insulin pump failures.10

V.

Panel Expertise

Issues considered by the panels of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee are generally
“particular matters” under 5 CFR 2640.103(a)(1). Thus, federal employees, including special
government employees (SGEs), with disqualifying financial interests are generally prohibited
from participating in the particular matter unless a waiver is granted. However, they may
attend the panel meeting as a member of the public. Most panel members are SGEs. The
panels may also include non-voting representatives (e.g., industry and consumer
representatives). However, industry representatives are not SGEs and not subject to the same
conflict of interest rules. For more information on conflict of interest as it relates to FDA
advisory committees, please refer to the relevant FDA guidances, “Guidance for the Public,
FDA Advisory Committee Members, and FDA Staff on Procedures for Determining Conflict
of Interest and Eligibility for Participation in FDA Advisory Committees”
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM125646.pdf) and
“Public Availability of Advisory Committee Members’ Financial Interest Information and
Waivers”
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM295372.pdf).
When a device is specifically the subject of review by a medical device advisory committee,
CDRH will ensure that adequate expertise is represented on the panel to assess the disease or
condition which the device is intended to cure, treat, mitigate, prevent, or diagnose, as well as

7

FDA will also seek panel input as part of an action to call for PMAs for a preamendments class III device. See
section 515(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or 21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1). Because this type of panel meeting does not
concern a specific premarket submission, it typically falls under the “Regulatory Issues” meeting category
rather than the “Premarket Submission” category.

the technology of the device.11 Adequate expertise is defined in statute to mean that the
membership of the advisory committee includes two or more voting members with a
specialty or other expertise clinically relevant to the device under review and at least one
voting member who is knowledgeable about the technology of the device.12

VI. Preparation for Panel Meetings
The sections below describe steps taken prior to a panel meeting, including the development
and release of briefing materials prepared for the open portions of panel meetings, consistent
with 5 U.S.C App 2.13 For more information on briefing materials, please refer to “Advisory
Committee Meetings – Preparation and Public Availability of Information Given to Advisory
Committee Members” (hereinafter, “FDA Advisory Committee Meetings Guidance;”
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM125650.pdf).
Panel meetings are scheduled based on the availability of necessary SGEs; FDA staff;
applicant14 staff, such as clinical investigators and other experts; and an appropriate meeting
venue. A notice in the Federal Register (FR) must be published at least 15 calendar days
prior to any federal advisory committee meeting,15 including those held by FDA, unless there
is an emergency or an immediate meeting is required for other reasons.16 When possible,
CDRH should announce its meetings in the FR at least 6 weeks prior to the meeting.
Upcoming FDA advisory committee meetings are announced on FDA’s Advisory Committee
Calendar, which is available at
http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/Calendar/default.htm. The public, including any
stakeholders that may be impacted by the deliberations of a panel, are encouraged to submit
relevant information to the related Federal Register docket via http://www.regulations.gov in
advance of the panel meeting. The public may also submit written materials directly to the
Designated Federal Officer (DFO) as announced in each FR notice. A DFO will be assigned
to provide administrative support for the panel meeting, including helping the applicant
throughout the panel preparation period and assisting in the preparation of background
materials. All panel-related questions should be relayed through the DFO listed in the FR
notice.

11

See section 513(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act.
See section 513(b)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.
13
No FDA advisory committee meeting may be entirely closed to the public (21 CFR 14.27(a)). However,
sometimes a portion of a meeting will be closed to the public under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) and 21 CFR 14.27. This
section only applies to briefing materials prepared for the open portions of panel meetings.
14
For purposes of this guidance, “applicant” refers to a party who submits a premarket submission that is the
subject of a Premarket Submission panel meeting, e.g., the 510(k) submitter or the PMA applicant.

A.

Premarket Submission Meetings
(1)

Briefing Material Contents

Under most circumstances, Premarket Submission panel meeting topics involve deliberations
regarding a single medical device for which marketing authorization is sought. Regardless of
the submission type under which a device is being reviewed (PMA, 510(k), De Novo, or
HDE), CDRH intends to provide to the panel members and the applicant a prepared panel
package of briefing materials, referred to as the “Panel Pack,” which may include:
·
·
·
·
·
·

FDA’s agenda;
FDA’s Executive Summary;
FDA’s draft questions for panel consideration;
FDA’s voting questions;
any information deemed relevant by the FDA (e.g., publications/literature);
applicant-provided briefing materials as requested in an information letter
communicated from FDA.17 These may include:
o Executive Summary;
o appropriate sections or excerpts from the submission;
o proposed labeling;
o protocol(s), to the extent that these were included in the submission; and
o relevant publications/literature from the submission.

(2)

CDRH-Applicant Interactions

CDRH recommends the following practices for interactions between the applicant and
CDRH on panel briefing materials for a meeting where input on a premarket submission is
sought. These recommendations further inform the timelines for review of releasable or nonreleasable information, as contained in the FDA Advisory Committee Meetings Guidance. If,
no later than 7 business days after notification that their submission is to be presented at a
panel meeting, the applicant requests a phone call or meeting with CDRH to discuss the
panel meeting logistics and preparation, FDA intends to call or meet with the applicant. As
indicated in the Appendices of the FDA Advisory Committee Meetings Guidance, the times
by which applicants should submit briefing materials differ depending on whether the
materials contain information that the applicant claims is exempt from disclosure under the
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA; 5 U.S.C. 552).

17

As discussed below, the Panel Packs will be redacted to protect any information that is exempt from public
disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. For more details about confidentiality of information, see 21
CFR 807.95, 21 CFR 814.9, 21 CFR 814.122, 21 CFR 860.5, and 21 CFR part 20, as well as the FDA guidance,
“Guidance for Industry - Advisory Committee Meetings—Preparation and Public Availability of Information
Given to Advisory Committee Members”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM125650.pdf).

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If an applicant chooses to prepare briefing materials that contain information that they
believe is exempt from disclosure under FOIA, they should prepare two versions of its
briefing materials: one version should be complete (unredacted) and the second version
should be a publicly releasable version (redacted). The complete version of the briefing
materials should be marked “Draft: Advisory Committee Briefing Materials: Not for Public
Release: Contains Trade Secret and/or Confidential Commercial Information.” Both the
complete (unredacted) and redacted version of the briefing materials should be submitted 42
business days before the advisory committee meeting, in accordance with Appendix B of the
FDA Advisory Committee Meetings Guidance. When CDRH receives briefing materials by
42 business days before the meeting, CDRH intends to review the materials for completeness
and relevance. Between 42 and 22 business days before the meeting, CDRH and the
applicant may engage in informal discussions of the accuracy, relevance, completeness, and
appropriateness of briefing materials and proposed redactions.
If an applicant chooses to submit fully releasable briefing materials, they should mark the
materials as “Advisory Committee Briefing Materials: Available for Public Release” and
submit their briefing materials no later than 22 business days before the advisory committee
meeting, in accordance with Appendix A of the FDA Advisory Committee Meetings
Guidance.
CDRH will send the final unredacted Panel Pack to all of the panel members, who are SGEs
or other government employees, and the applicant. In addition, CDRH will send a redacted
version of the Panel Pack to the Industry Representative.18 No less than 2 full business days
before the panel meeting, CDRH will post on the FDA website both the applicant’s and
CDRH’s redacted briefing materials to make them publicly available.
Approximately 5 business days prior to the meeting, the applicant and CDRH should
exchange draft slides intended for presentation to the panel at the meeting. The applicant
should identify any slides containing new information or data and clearly indicate that the
information contained in the slide has not been reviewed by the FDA. No later than the day
of the panel meeting, the applicant and CDRH should discuss any final concerns or changes
in the presentations prior to the start of the panel meeting.
The Panel Pack and applicant presentation should generally only include information that
was included in the submission or agreed upon for inclusion by CDRH. If additional
information, data, and/or analyses are included by the applicant, CDRH recommends the
applicant notify CDRH and provide the additional information, data, and/or analyses as soon
as possible. If new data or significant new analyses are submitted between 55 business days
and 22 business days prior to a panel meeting, CDRH may postpone the panel meeting
pending review of the new material. If CDRH agrees to proceed with the scheduled panel
meeting, the affected sections of the Panel Pack should prominently note that such
information was not provided to CDRH by the recommended timelines and, as such, has not
been reviewed by CDRH. Applicants are advised that such late submission may impair the
panel’s ability to consider this information before the meeting. CDRH will not consider new
18

See 21 CFR 14.86(a)(2).

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
documents or information for the Panel Packs later than 22 business days prior to the
meeting.

B.

Regulatory Issues Meetings

In general, Regulatory Issues panel meeting topics involve deliberations that impact a device
type or multiple device types.
For these meetings, CDRH intends to provide to the panel members a Panel Pack that
contains:
·
·
·
·

FDA’s agenda;
FDA’s Executive Summary;
FDA’s questions for panel consideration; and
any information deemed relevant by the FDA (e.g., manufacturer material, such as
relevant portions of a reclassification petition; publications/literature).

Consistent with the FDA Advisory Committee Meetings Guidance, CDRH intends to make
available on its website, no later than 2 full business days in advance of a Regulatory Issues
panel meeting, the publicly available briefing information from the Panel Pack.

VII. Conduct of Panel Meetings
This section describes the events that can or must occur during panel meetings, including
industry and CDRH presentations, the open public hearing, panel deliberations, and voting
procedures. The order of discussion of the presentations below does not necessarily reflect
the order of presentations at a panel meeting.

A.

Medical Device Industry Presentations

Under section 513(b)(6)(A)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),
any person whose device is specifically the subject of review by a panel shall have the same
opportunity as the Secretary to participate in meetings of the panel, including, subject to the
discretion of the panel chairperson, by designating a representative who will be provided a
time during the panel meeting to address the panel for the purpose of correcting
misstatements of fact or providing clarifying information, and permitting the person or
representative to call on experts within the person’s organization to address such specific
issues in the time provided.
Further, section 513(b)(6)(B) of the FD&C Act, before and after amendment by the 21st
Century Cures legislation, requires that meetings shall: (1) provide adequate time for initial
presentations; and (2) encourage free and open participation by all interested persons.
Accordingly, FDA continues the policy that for Premarket Submission panel meeting topic
presentations, an applicant will generally have 60 minutes, or up to 90 minutes if (1) the
applicant submits a request and the DFO accepts that request or (2) the CDRH presentation is
scheduled for 90 minutes. In addition, new section 513(b)(6)(B)(ii) provides that following

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the initial presentations, the panel may pose questions to a designated representative and
consider the responses to such questions in the panel’s review of the device.
Industry presentations for Regulatory Issues panel meetings are encouraged, and a segment
of the panel meeting agenda should be designated for this purpose. If industry stakeholders
request time to speak in advance, the same 60 (or 90) minute presentation slots described
above will generally be provided. However, the timeslot for the affected persons may be
divided among those that have requested time to present information to the panel. Industry
stakeholders who wait until the day of the panel meeting to request time to speak will be
allowed to speak at the discretion of the Panel Chair.

B.

CDRH Presentation

CDRH intends to present any necessary regulatory background and its review and assessment
of the scientific and/or clinical information for which panel input is requested. CDRH's
presentation is generally limited to 60 minutes, but up to 90 minutes may be allotted due to
the complexity of the review (or other) issues. FDA’s slides typically present the Agency’s
scientific and/or regulatory view of the issues at hand and ask for specific input from the
panel regarding FDA’s questions.
Depending on the complexity of the regulatory issues being discussed, CDRH may opt to
conduct pre-meeting training for the panel members (including any non-voting industry,
consumer, or patient representatives). Such training could include discussion of general
regulatory and/or statutory terminology and the applicability of CDRH’s regulations to the
panel meeting topic, such as classification/reclassification procedures, regulations related to
medical device marketing submissions, etc. Any pre-meeting training should provide general
background and should not include information specific to any device(s) being discussed in
the panel meeting. The panel should not deliberate on any material being brought before the
panel during pre-meeting training nor provide any advice to the Center on the training
materials. Subject to FOIA, the training materials should be made available for public
disclosure upon request.

C.

Open Public Hearing

Every advisory committee meeting includes an open public hearing (OPH) session, during
which interested persons may present relevant information or views orally or in writing. 19
FDA’s regulation, 21 CFR 14.29(a), requires that a minimum of 60 minutes per meeting be
dedicated to an OPH session for oral presentations, unless public participation does not last
that long, at which time the OPH will generally be concluded. The OPH for panel meetings
should be conducted in accordance with the FDA guidance, “The Open Public Hearing at
FDA Advisory Committee Meetings”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM236144.pdf).

19

See 21 CFR 14.25(a).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

D.

Panel Deliberations and CDRH Questions

There should be approximately 1 hour designated for general panel deliberations. During
their deliberations and before addressing the CDRH questions, the panel may require
clarification or have questions about the information presented. In such cases, both CDRH
and the affected person(s) should be provided an equal opportunity to respond to questions
from panel members. The applicant or affected person, during this time, may approach the
lectern in order to be recognized by the Panel Chair to speak at the Chair’s discretion. Under
section 513(b)(6)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, the panel may pose questions to a designated
representative, as described in Section VII.A, and consider the responses to such questions in
the panel’s review of the device.
Once the general panel deliberations are completed, CDRH should ask specific questions to
the panel. Additional input from interested parties, including an applicant, should be allowed
at the discretion of the Panel Chair. In order for the panel to provide useful information to
both CDRH and other interested parties and to allow the panel more time to discuss the
issues, CDRH will generally request that the panel members provide their scientific opinions
and recommendations to the questions posed by CDRH without interruption.
Prior to conducting the vote, if any, the applicant, FDA, industry representative, consumer
representative, and patient representative should be provided an opportunity to present
viewpoint summations. For certain panel meetings regarding device classification, panels are
also asked to provide recommendations to CDRH containing the information specified in 21
CFR 860.84(d).

E.

Panel Voting

The voting procedures for panel meetings are described in 21 CFR 14.22(d). In general,
matters are to be considered by all voting members present at the time, although the DFO
may require that any final report be voted upon by all current voting members of the panel.
There are no specific provisions in FDA regulations for absentee voting or proxy voting. A
member who leaves the meeting prior to the vote should not be able to cast a vote. All voting
should be conducted in public view. The list of voting members and those appointed as
temporary voting members should be read into the record at each panel meeting. The Charter
for the Medical Devices Advisory Committee describes who may vote for the issue at hand.
By statute, the consumer representative and industry representative are non-voting members
of a panel.20 For more information on voting procedures, please refer to the Charter
(http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/M
edicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/ucm124098.htm) and the FDA guidance, “Voting
Procedures for Advisory Committee Meetings”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM125641.pdf).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(1)

When to Vote

The formal voting process is typically used for panel meetings involving a specific device
marketing submission, i.e., Premarket Submission meetings. For Regulatory Issues meetings
involving classifications or reclassifications, guidance documents, and other general issues
brought to panel, the panel should be asked to discuss the issues and provide
recommendations on questions asked by CDRH, but no formal vote will generally be taken.

(2)

Voting Procedure for Premarket Submission Panel
Meetings

For meetings regarding PMA applications, the voting members of a panel are typically asked
to respond to three questions relating to safety, effectiveness and benefit versus risk for
specific devices that are the subject of a PMA application. After completion of the panel
deliberations and after discussion of the CDRH questions as explained in Section VII.D of
this guidance, CDRH intends to ask panel members to vote simultaneously by open ballot or
via electronic voting, and each vote for each question will be associated with a specific panel
member. Panel members should be instructed to vote on the following questions relating to
the approvability of the device based on their expertise, the information they reviewed in
preparation for the meeting, and the information presented at the meeting:
Voting Question 1:
Is there reasonable assurance that X device is safe for indication(s) A (and B, etc.)?
Voting Question 2:
Is there reasonable assurance that X device is effective for indication(s) A (and B, etc.)?
Voting Question 3:
Do the probable benefits of X device for indication(s) A (and B, etc.) outweigh the
probable risks of device X for indication(s) A (and B, etc.)?
When other types of submissions are the subject of a Premarket Submission panel meeting,
questions relevant to those submissions should be presented to the panel (i.e., for a 510(k),
the panel may vote on substantial equivalence; for an HDE submission, the panel may vote
on probable benefit). For example, the voting questions for an HDE application should read
as follows:
Voting Question 1:
Will X device expose patients to an unreasonable or significant risk of illness or injury
when used for indication(s) A (and B, etc.)?
Voting Question 2:
Does X device offer sufficient probable benefit for the proposed indications for use?

Voting Question 3:
Do the probable benefits to health from use of X device outweigh the risk of injury or
illness from use for the proposed indications, taking into account the probable risks and
benefits of currently available devices or alternative forms of treatment?
After voting, panel members should be asked to state how they answered each question and
to explain their answers. The panel may discuss changes to labeling, restrictions on use,
longer term follow-up, or other controls that may alter the benefit-risk calculus, in order to
give the applicant constructive feedback on their submission.
If the evidence provided is insufficient to allow for any of the determinations, the voting
panel member should state this as the reason for answering “no.” A description of any
remedial or mitigating studies or actions should be given.

Indications for Use and Voting

The Indication(s) for Use (IFU) to be voted on should be the IFU as described in the FDA
Executive Summary in the Panel Pack provided by CDRH prior to the meeting (see Section
VI.A(1) above). The FDA Executive Summary relies on what was submitted by the applicant
in the original submission, unless the submission was amended in a subsequent submission as
described in Section VI.A(2). Proposed changes or modifications to the IFU and what would
be needed to support such changes may be discussed during the panel deliberation portion of
the meeting; however, the vote itself should be on the IFU as stated in the FDA Executive
Summary. The members of the panel should be afforded an opportunity to explain their vote.
After voting, the panel may discuss whether a change in the IFU could have an impact on the
benefit-risk calculus. Such discussion should also include what additional pre- or postmarket
data or scientific information, if any, would be needed to pursue new IFU. If the original IFU
as presented to the panel receives any unfavorable votes, the following question should be
posed to the voting members of the panel for their consideration:
“If you answered ‘no’ to any question, please state whether changes to the IFU,
restrictions on use, or other controls, would make a difference in your answer.”
Although a formal vote on the different is not necessary and will not generally be conducted,
the considerations and concerns of the voting panel members should be clearly articulated for
the record.

Post Meeting Activities

A brief summary of the meeting should be posted to the FDA’s website no later than 2
business days after the meeting. An official transcript of the proceedings should be posted to
the FDA’s website as soon as it is available, no later than 60 days after the meeting.
Following the meeting, FDA should review the panel proceedings in their entirety and should
continue to work interactively with the applicant(s) or stakeholders.

Teleconference Panel Meetings

Panel meetings may be held by conference telephone call as provided for in 21 CFR
14.22(g), 860.125, and 814.44(b). Teleconference panel meetings will generally be limited to
discussion topics that are anticipated to be brief. They are authorized when the meeting will
be conducted to confirm the recommendations from a previously held traditional panel
meeting or where time does not permit a meeting to be held at a central location. In addition,
teleconference panels may be held to speed the classification of multiple device types—in
particular, classification of lower risk device types which are no longer in general use or for
which significant valid scientific evidence exists, and for which the proposed classification is
expected to be non-controversial and readily confirmed by the panel.
For teleconference panel meetings, some or all of the panel members, other than the Panel
Chair, may participate from remote locations. Multiple topics requiring participation by
different panel members may be combined into a single day. The Panel Chair and DFO will
manage the deliberation, question and answer, and OPH portions of the meeting consistent
with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 14. As described in 21 CFR 14.22(g), interested parties
will be afforded an opportunity to participate in the meeting. A speaker phone will be
provided at a conference room located in Washington, DC, or Rockville, MD, or the
immediate vicinity. Members of the public should be afforded the opportunity to provide
statements to the panel as described in Sections VII.A and VII.C above.
