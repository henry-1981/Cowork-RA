To: Manufacturers and Importers of Laser Products

Subject: Beam Attenuators and Emission Indicators for Class II and IIIa
Laser Systems

BACKGROUND: The 1985 amendments to the Federal Performance Standard for
Laser Products gave the Director, Office of Compliance and Surveillance,
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) authority to approve,
upon written application by the manufacturer, alternate means to
accomplish the radiation protection provided by the beam attenuator

(21 CFR 1040.10(f)(6)(ii)). This amendment recognized that for many laser
products, a beam attenuator, usually a shutter, provides little if any
improved safety, especially for laser systems that have short beam
recovery times and can readily be turned off by their operators. Many
approvals have been granted since the amendment became effective. When,
through its review of product reports or inspectional findings, the CDRH
becomes aware of noncompliance with the requirement for a beam attenuator,
notification to the manufacturer is required to be given in accordance
with 21 CFR 1003.11. In many cases, the notification results in an
application from the manufacturer for approval of an alternate means of
safety, usually a power switch, and for exemption in accordance with 21
CFR 1003.30 from the notification to affected persons as required by 21
CFR 1003.21. These cases are most common for Class II and Class IIIa
visible laser products.

Similarly, the performance standard requires Class II and Class IIIa
visible laser systems to incorporate an indicator that provides a visible
or audible indication of emission. The standard does not give the
director the authority to approve alternate means of providing an
indication except through the procedures for variances in 21 CFR 1010.4.
Many variances have been requested and granted for battery operated
products that emit low powers of visible laser radiation and that
incorporate normally off, momentary on switches for emission control. It
is understood that a normally off, momentary on switch is on only while
physical pressure is applied. The CDRH in granting variances, has
accepted the reasoning that an active light or sound indication would only
provide indication to the immediate user who certainly should be aware of
the tactile indication provided by the physical pressure necessary to
activate a momentary power control switch.

In addition, the CDRH has made known that it intends to propose new
amendments to the standard under which neither beam attenuators nor
emission indicators would be required for visible laser systems that are
now classified in Class II or Class IIIa. The administration of these
applications has been of considerable burden to the industry and to the
Center from which little or no significant protection of the public safety
results.

Page 2 - Beam Attenuators and Emission Indicators
POLICY; The CDRH will not object to:

1. The omission of a beam attenuator on a Class II or Class IIIa laser
product that is a visible laser system and that incorporates a
specific, suitable means of emission control such as a switch, or

2. The omission of a visible or audible indication of emission from a
Class II or Class IIIa laser product that is a visible laser system
and that incorporates, as the control for laser emission, a normally
off, momentary on switch that provides a clear, tactile indication of
emission.

The CDRH intends to incorporate this policy into amendments that it plans
to propose. Comments are invited and should be addressed to the
Non-Medical Radiological Devices Branch, HFZ-312, Division of Enforcement
III, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, 1390 Piccard Drive,
Rockville, Maryland 20850
