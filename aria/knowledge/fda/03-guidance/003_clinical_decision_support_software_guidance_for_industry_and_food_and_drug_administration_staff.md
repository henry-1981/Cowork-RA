Clinical Decision Support Software
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has long regulated software that meets the definition
of a device in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act),
including software that is intended to provide decision support for the diagnosis, treatment,
prevention, cure, or mitigation of diseases or other conditions (often referred to as clinical
decision support software). This guidance clarifies the scope of FDA’s oversight of clinical
decision support software intended for health care professionals (HCPs) as devices.1 Not all
clinical decision support software used in healthcare settings are devices and therefore subject to
FDA oversight as a device.
FDA recognizes that the term “clinical decision support” or “CDS” is used broadly and in
different ways, depending on the context.2 In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and
Innovation Act (FDASIA) Health IT Report of 2014, CDS is described as a variety of tools
including, but not limited to: computerized alerts and reminders for providers and patients;
clinical guidelines; condition-specific order sets; focused patient data reports and summaries;
documentation templates; diagnostic support; and contextually relevant reference information.3
For the purposes of this guidance, the term “Non-Device CDS” is used to refer to decision
support software functions that do not meet the definition of device in section 201(h) of the
FD&C Act. In accordance with section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, FDA uses criteria from section
520(o) of the FD&C Act, which was added to the FD&C Act by the 21st Century Cures Act
1

For the purposes of this guidance, the FDA uses the term HCP to mean an individual who is licensed, registered, or
certified by a State, territory, or other governing body, to administer health care, including but not limited to, nurse
practitioner, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, clinical social worker, dentist, occupational therapist, pharmacist,
physical therapist, physician, physician assistant, psychologist, respiratory therapist, speech-language pathologist,
technologist, or any other practitioner or allied health professional.
2
For example, in one context CDS has been described as providing HCPs and patients with knowledge and personspecific information, intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care. See
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, “What is Clinical Decision Support (CDS)?” at
https://www.healthit.gov/topic/safety/clinical-decision-support

(Cures Act), to determine if a software function is Non-Device CDS (see Section III). Certain
CDS software functions do not meet the criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act and are
therefore device functions. Furthermore, some multiple function device products may include
both Non-Device CDS software functions and device software functions (CDS or otherwise). In
such situations, FDA would use the approach outlined in FDA’s guidance Multiple Function
Device Products: Policy and Considerations,4 when assessing the safety and effectiveness of the
device software function, consistent with section 520(o)(2) of the FD&C Act.
The purpose of this guidance is to describe FDA’s regulatory approach to CDS software
functions. The Agency’s approach reflects changes to the FD&C Act made by the Cures Act,
which amended section 520 and excludes certain software functions from the device definition.
The focus of this guidance is to clarify the types of CDS software functions that are excluded
from the definition of device by the criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act. This
guidance further clarifies that FDA’s existing digital health policies continue to apply to software
functions that meet the definition of a device, including those that are intended for use by
patients or caregivers.5 For example, some decision support software functions may be identified
in other guidance documents as software functions for which, based on our current understanding
of the risks of these software functions, FDA does not intend at this time to enforce compliance
with applicable device requirements of the FD&C Act, including, but not limited to, premarket
clearance and approval requirements.
This guidance provides many examples of how FDA intends to consider different kinds of
software functions, including Non-Device CDS software functions and device software
functions.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
Section 3060(a) of the Cures Act amended the FD&C Act to add section 520(o) of the FD&C
Act, which excludes certain software functions from the definition of device in section 201(h) of
the FD&C Act. Certain CDS software functions are excluded from the definition of device by
section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act if the software functions meet all of the following four
criteria:

FDA intends to be consistent with existing policies, including the following documents: Policy for Device Software
Functions and Mobile Medical Applications (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/policy-device-software-functions-and-mobile-medical-applications), Software as a Medical Device (SaMD):
Clinical Evaluation (https://www.imdrf.org/documents/software-medical-device-samd-clinical-evaluation), Medical
Device Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices
(https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/medical-device-data-systems-medicalimage-storage-devices-and-medical-image-communications-devices), and General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk
Devices (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-wellness-policy-low-riskdevices).

(1) not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or a signal from an in
vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system (section
520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act);
(2) intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing medical information
about a patient or other medical information (such as peer-reviewed clinical studies and
clinical practice guidelines) (section 520(o)(1)(E)(i) of the FD&C Act);
(3) intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to a health care
professional about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition (section
520(o)(1)(E)(ii) of the FD&C Act); and
(4) intended for the purpose of enabling such health care professional to independently
review the basis for such recommendations that such software presents so that it is not the
intent that such health care professional rely primarily on any of such recommendations
to make a clinical diagnosis or treatment decision regarding an individual patient (section
520(o)(1)(E)(iii) of the FD&C Act).6
To explain FDA’s interpretation of section 520(o)(1)(E), in Section IV this guidance discusses
each element of section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act.

III. Scope
This guidance describes CDS software functions that do not meet the device definition (NonDevice CDS) based on the criteria in section 520(o) of the FD&C Act, which excludes certain
software functions from the device definition, including certain CDS software functions intended
for HCPs.
This guidance presents the Agency’s current thinking on which CDS software functions are
excluded from the definition of device by section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act. The guidance
does not address which other FDA statutory or regulatory requirements apply to device software
functions, including which regulatory requirements may apply to a device software function that is
part of a combination product, nor does it address labeling requirements for decision support
software disseminated by or on behalf of a drug or biological product sponsor.

6

The Cures Act provides that a software function described in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act will not be
excluded from the device definition under section 201(h) if the software meets the criteria under section 513(a)(1)(C)
of the FD&C Act or if the software is used in the manufacture and transfusion of blood and blood components to
assist in the prevention of disease in humans (section 520(o)(4)(B) and (C) of the FD&C Act. In addition, the Cures
Act provides that a software function will not be excluded if the Secretary of Health and Human Services issues a
final order, after notification and a period for comment, that the software function would be reasonably likely to have
serious adverse health consequences (section 520(o)(3) of the FD&C Act).

IV. Interpretation of Criteria in Section 520(o)(1)(E) of the
FD&C Act
The following sections explain FDA’s interpretation of each of the four criteria in section
520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act. In order for a software function to be excluded from the device
definition by this provision, it must meet all four criteria. Stated simply, these criteria describe
the types of CDS that are not regulated as devices. Non-Device CDS software functions do not
acquire, process, or analyze images, signals from an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD), or patterns
or signals from a signal acquisition system (Criterion 1). Non-Device CDS software functions
display, analyze, or print medical information (Criterion 2) in order to provide recommendations
about a patient’s care to an HCP user (Criterion 3). Taken together, Criterion 1 and Criterion 2
describe the types of data inputs used in devices (Criterion 1) and the types of data inputs used in
Non-Device CDS (Criterion 2). Non-Device CDS software functions provide sufficient
information about the basis for the recommendations to the HCP user, so that the user does not
rely primarily on any of the recommendations to make a clinical decision about an individual
patient (Criterion 4).

(1) Not intended to acquire, process, or analyze a medical image or
a signal from an in vitro diagnostic device or a pattern or
signal from a signal acquisition system
Under section 520(o)(1)(E), software functions that are intended to acquire, process, or analyze a
medical image, a signal from an IVD, or a pattern or signal from a signal acquisition system and
are intended for a purpose identified in section 201(h) of the FD&C Act remain devices and
therefore are subject to FDA oversight. In other words, if the type of data described in Criterion
1 (i.e., medical image or a signal from an IVD or a pattern/signal from a signal acquisition
system) is used as an input, then the software function remains a device within the meaning of
section 201(h). Such products have been regulated as devices for many years.
We generally consider the term medical image to include those images generated by use of
medical imaging systems (e.g., computed tomography (CT), x-ray, ultrasound, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI)) to view any part(s) of the body or images acquired for a medical
purpose (e.g., pathology, dermatology). Images that were not originally acquired for a medical
purpose but are being processed or analyzed for a medical purpose are also considered medical
images.
We generally consider the term signal to include those signals that typically require use of either:
·

An IVD, which can include an electrochemical or photometric response generated by an
assay and instrument that may be further processed by software to generate a clinical test
result; or

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

A signal acquisition system that measures a parameter from within, attached to, or external to
the body for a medical purpose (e.g., through continuous, near-continuous, or otherwise
streaming measurement) and often includes but is not limited to:
o Use of sensors (e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG) leads) along with electronics and
software function that is used for signal generation (e.g., ECG);
o Collections of samples or specimens such as tissue, blood, or other fluids (e.g.,
conducting a pathological study using software such as digital pathology); or
o Use of radiological imaging systems (e.g., computed tomography (CT)) and a
software function for image generation.

FDA interprets the term pattern in this provision to refer to multiple, sequential, or repeated
measurements of a signal or from a signal acquisition system. By contrast, discrete, episodic, or
intermittent point-in-time physiological measurements (e.g., routine vital signs obtained at discrete
clinical encounters) generally do not, by themselves, constitute a pattern. Examples of patterns
include, but are not limited to:
·
·

·

For ECG, an electrical signal acquired from the body is processed to create an ECG
waveform and QRS complex, which are considered patterns;
For Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), a fluorescent signal on tagged DNA is
processed by modification or transformation into base pairs and sequences. Genetic
sequences, including datasets of sequence variants that differ from reference sequences
and datasets filtered to represent disease-associated variations (such as variant call format
files or VCFs), are examples of patterns; or
For continuous glucose monitors (CGM), a photometric or electrochemical signal
generated by an assay and instrument is processed to generate repeated glucose
measurements over time, which is considered a pattern.

FDA considers software functions that assess or interpret the clinical implications or clinical
relevance of a signal, pattern, or medical image to be software functions that do not meet
Criterion 1 because they acquire, process, or analyze. Examples include:
·

·

·

·

Software functions that process or analyze a medical image, such as enhancement,
manipulation, making measurements, identifying normal/abnormal structures,
determining size/shape/location of a suspected nodule, or functions within computer
aided diagnostics (CADx) or computer aided detection (CADe) systems, do not meet
Criterion 1.
Software functions that process or analyze an ECG waveform or QRS complex, such as
measuring repeated complexes, measuring variation from baseline, or detecting heart
rate, arrhythmias, or structural abnormalities, do not meet Criterion 1.
Software functions that process or analyze the genetic sequence or patterns from an NGS
analyzer to identify genetic variants or mutations or their clinical implications or
relevance do not meet Criterion 1.
Software functions that process or analyze an electrochemical or photometric response
generated by an assay and instrument to generate a clinical test result, such as
determining a potassium level, do not meet Criterion 1.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Although many signal acquisition systems are intended to monitor signals for medical purposes
and, therefore, are considered medical devices, some are not. For example, activity monitors or
other signal acquisition systems that measure physiological parameters that are not specifically
intended or marketed for a purpose identified in the device definition are not medical devices.
We encourage manufacturers to engage with FDA if a signal acquisition system previously only
considered for a medical purpose is intended to be used for a non-medical purpose. For example,
software functions that use input from sensors and a signal acquisition system to measure
physiological parameters for purposes of biometrics identification, such as retinal image analysis
for secure access to a facility, are not devices within the meaning of section 201(h) of the FD&C
Act.

(2) Intended for the purpose of displaying, analyzing, or printing
medical information about a patient or other medical
information
Section 520(o)(1)(E)(i) of the FD&C Act describes software functions that are intended to
display, analyze, or print7 medical information about a patient or other medical information (such
as peer-reviewed clinical studies and clinical practice guidelines). In other words, if the type of
data described in Criterion 2 (i.e., medical information) is used as an input, then the software
function is not a device within the meaning of section 201(h) so long as it meets the other three
criteria. FDA interprets Criterion 2 to include software functions that display, analyze, or print
patient-specific information, such as demographic information, symptoms, certain test results,
patient discharge summaries, and/or other medical information (such as clinical practice
guidelines, peer-reviewed clinical studies, textbooks, approved drug or medical device labeling,
and government agency recommendations). Taken together, Criterion 1 and Criterion 2 describe
the types of data inputs used in devices (Criterion 1) and the types of data inputs used in NonDevice CDS (Criterion 2).
FDA interprets medical information about a patient to be the type of information used in, or that
relates to, the clinical care of the patient, including patient-specific information. Such
information is that which may generally be communicated between HCPs in a clinical
conversation or between HCPs and patients in the context of a clinical decision. Whether
particular information is commonly discussed in a clinical conversation is not, by itself,
determinative of whether it is “medical information about a patient” under Criterion 2, provided
the information’s relevance to patient care is supported by well-understood and accepted
sources8 and can be appropriately understood in context. If Criterion 1 is met, data/results from
devices (including IVD test(s)), when used in a manner consistent with the FDA-required
labeling,9 are generally considered “medical information about a patient” within the meaning of
7

Software functions that solely display or print medical information as described in section 520(o)(1)(C) or (D) of the
FD&C Act are not considered CDS.
8
Generally, the kinds of information that are from “well-understood and accepted sources” are those that reflect
knowledge and practices that are widely recognized and accepted within the medical or scientific community that are
supported by scientific evidence, including peer-reviewed literature, clinical guidelines, or authoritative consensus
documents. These can include information from sources such as medical textbooks or reference information developed
by accredited medical institutions, government agencies, and professional organizations.
9
For the purposes of this guidance, “used in a manner consistent with the FDA-required labeling” is use consistent
with the FDA approved, cleared, or authorized uses of a product. The term “FDA-required labeling” as used in this

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Criterion 2. FDA interprets other medical information to include information such as peerreviewed clinical studies, clinical practice guidelines, and information that is similarly
independently verified and validated as accurate, reliable, not omitting material information, and
supported by evidence.
A single, discrete test or measurement result10 that is clinically meaningful (e.g., a blood glucose
lab test result) is medical information, while a more continuous sampling of the same information
(e.g., continuous glucose monitor readings) is a pattern/signal. As discussed above, a software
function that is intended to acquire, process, or analyze a pattern/signal from a signal acquisition
system fails Criterion 1 and remains a device (see Section IV (1)). FDA recognizes there is a
continuum between a single sample and a continuous sample, and has included examples in
Section V for reference.
The following are examples that describe types of medical information that can be displayed,
analyzed, or printed about a patient:
·

·
·
·

The report from a radiology study (e.g., “a BIRADS category 4 lesion is present”) or
summary information about the output of legally marketed CAD software (e.g., “twelve
CAD annotations are present”).
An ECG report annotated by an HCP with a description of an abnormal heart rhythm
(e.g., “the patient shows signs of Atrial Fibrillation”).
A blood pressure result (e.g., “120/80 mmHg”) from a legally marketed device.
A lab test result (e.g., “potassium level of 4.0 mmol/L or glucose level of 95 mg/dL”) in
an electronic health record.

These software functions are not devices only if they also meet the other three criteria of section
520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act.

(3) Intended for the purpose of supporting or providing
recommendations to an HCP about prevention, diagnosis, or
treatment of a disease or condition
Section 520(o)(1)(E)(ii) describes software functions that are intended to support or provide
recommendations to an HCP about prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition.
FDA interprets Criterion 3 to refer to software that provides condition-, disease-, and/or patientspecific recommendations to an HCP to enhance, inform and/or influence a health care decision
but is not intended to replace or direct the HCP’s judgment. As discussed below, in cases where
a software function provides a specific preventive, diagnostic or treatment output or directive,
the software function fails Criterion 3 because it is not intended for the purpose of supporting or
providing recommendations under section 520(o)(1)(E)(ii). If only one option is clinically
guidance includes the labeling reviewed and approved by FDA as part of the medical product marketing application
review process. For products not subject to premarket approval, but instead subject to premarket notification (510(k))
requirements or exempt from premarket review, the term FDA-required labeling includes the labeling that provides
adequate directions for use and other information required to appear on the label or in labeling.
10
Software functions that process or analyze patterns or signals from chemical reactions generated by an assay and an
instrument, such as an electrochemical or photometric response, to generate a clinical test result do not meet Criterion 1.

appropriate and the software function otherwise meets all criteria under section 520(o)(1)(E),
FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning that FDA does not intend to enforce
requirements under the FD&C Act) for such functions.
The following examples are intended to illustrate software functions that otherwise meet the
criteria but provide only one recommendation that is clinically appropriate, as well as subexamples that would not be those for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion.
·

·

·

·

A software function that predicts risk of future cardiovascular events for an HCP to
consider based on a patient’s weight, current and historical smoking status, blood
pressure, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) IVD test results.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but also utilizes
variant genomic data as an input that does not have established relevance to
the diagnostic recommendation, would not fall under this example. Such a
software function is a device software function that would remain the focus of
FDA’s oversight.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but predicts risk of
a cardiovascular event in the next 24 hours, would not fall under this
example. Such a software function is a device software function that would
remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that creates a recommended treatment plan, including possible
medication(s), for patients diagnosed with cognitive impairment for an HCP to consider
based on the patient’s diagnosis related to cognitive impairment as well as potential
comorbidities, age, sex, and patient preferences, and that should be reviewed, revised,
and finalized by an HCP.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but also analyzes
positron emission tomography (PET) scan images, would not fall under this
example. Such a software function is a device software function that would
remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that recommends a specific FDA-approved antibiotic agent for an
HCP to consider based on the patient’s symptoms, recent hospitalizations, and previous
antibiotic exposure.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but also analyzes
spectroscopy data to diagnose bacterial infections, would not fall under this
example. Such a software function is a device software function that would
remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that analyzes a radiologist’s clinical findings of an image to generate
a proposed summary of the clinical findings for a patient’s radiology or pathology report,
including a specific diagnostic recommendation based on clinical guidelines that should
be reviewed, revised, and finalized by an HCP.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but also analyzes
the image to generate the clinical findings and/or make measurements, would
not fall under this example. Such a software function is a device software
function that would remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
o However, a software function with the same functionality, but utilizes
information that cannot be verified and validated to be from well-understood
and accepted sources to generate a specific diagnostic recommendation,

would not fall under this example. Such a software function is a device
software function that would remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that provides an HCP with a differential diagnosis based on a
patient’s symptoms, vital signs, and laboratory values, and that, depending on the
clinical context, may present either multiple diagnostic considerations or a single
clinically appropriate diagnostic recommendation when alternative diagnoses are
highly improbable. The output is intended to support clinical reasoning and to be
reviewed, revised, and finalized by the HCP.
o However, a software function that establishes a definitive diagnosis based
on analysis of medical images, waveform data, or other signal-level inputs
would not fall under this example. Such a software function is a device
software function that would remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that classifies patients with chronic low back pain into a single
recommended appropriate clinical care pathway (e.g., conservative management or
referral to a surgical spine specialist) based on patient history, symptom duration, and
documented clinical findings, where the recommendation is intended to be reviewed
and acted upon by an HCP.
o However, a software function that provides care pathway
recommendations for patients with acute back pain due to trauma or other
emergent conditions, where immediate clinical intervention may be
required, would not fall under this example. Such a software function is a
device software function that would remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
A software function that estimates 90-day and 1-year postoperative mortality and
complication risk following lung transplantation based on patient-specific clinical
characteristics and published clinical evidence, where the output is intended to
support pre-transplant planning and shared decision-making and is reviewed by an
HCP.
o However, a software function that predicts intraoperative or in-hospital
mortality based on near real-time physiologic measurements and is
intended to guide immediate escalation of care would not fall under this
example. Such a software function is a device software function that would
remain the focus of FDA’s oversight.
o However, a software function that incorporates medical images, genomic
data, or other data sources that are not well-understood and accepted for
the stated clinical use would not fall under this example. Such a software
function is a device software function that would remain the focus of
FDA’s oversight.

The following are examples of software functions that meet Criterion 3, because they are
intended for the purpose of supporting or providing recommendations to an HCP about
prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of a disease or condition. Examples of Non-Device CDS
software functions include software functions that provide:
·
·
·

Evidence-based clinician order sets for an HCP to choose from, tailored for a particular
condition, disease, or clinician preference;
Matching patient-specific medical information from records or reports to reference
information (e.g., clinical guidelines);
Contextually relevant reference information about a disease or condition;

Drug-drug interaction and drug-allergy contraindication notifications to avert adverse
drug events;
Drug formulary guidelines;
Duplicate testing or prescription product prevention notifications (e.g., medication
reconciliations and test reconciliations);
Reminders for preventive care or clinician’s orders; and
Patient data reports and summaries (e.g., discharge papers).

FDA interprets Criterion 3 to describe software that:
a) Provides condition-, disease-, and/or patient-specific information and options to an HCP
to enhance, inform and/or influence a health care decision;
b) Does not provide a specific preventive, diagnostic, or treatment output or directive; and
c) Is not intended to replace or direct the HCP’s judgment.
Such software presents recommendations based on an analysis of patient-specific information to
an HCP, who may then incorporate this information into their decision-making about the care of a
patient, along with other information and factors of which the HCP is aware. For example, a
software function that analyzes patient-specific medical information (e.g., atrial fibrillation (AF)
diagnosis from Holter report) and provides the HCP with a prioritized list of treatment options for
AF would meet Criterion 3.
Software functions that provide the following outputs may also be considered “supporting or
providing recommendations to an HCP” and would meet Criterion 3, as long as they were not
intended to replace or direct the HCP’s judgment:
1. List of preventive, diagnostic or treatment options;
2. Prioritized list of preventive, diagnostic or treatment options; or
3. List of follow-up or next-step options for consideration (e.g., after a physician office
visit, hospitalization, procedure).
The software functions described in this section as satisfying Criterion 3 are not devices only if
they also meet the other three criteria of section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act.
Software functions that support or provide recommendations to patients or caregivers – not
HCPs – meet the definition of a device. FDA understands the importance of CDS for patients
and caregivers and supports increased access to innovative, safe, and effective CDS for non-HCP
users. FDA intends to be consistent with existing policies (including the following documents:

committed to providing transparency and will update our existing policies, as appropriate, with

(4) Intended for the purpose of enabling an HCP to independently
review the basis for the recommendations that such software
presents so that it is not the intent that the HCP rely primarily
on any of such recommendations to make a clinical diagnosis
or treatment decision regarding an individual patient
In order to be excluded from the definition of a device under section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C
Act, the software function must be intended to enable HCPs to independently review the basis
for the recommendations presented by the software so that they do not rely primarily on such
recommendations, but rather on their own judgment, to make clinical decisions for individual
patients.
The software and labeling recommendations in this section are based on FDA’s experience
evaluating device CDS and software functions that are Non-Device CDS. However, sponsors
may use alternative approaches so long as their approach enables an HCP “to independently
review the basis for such recommendations” (section 520(o)(1)(E)(iii) (Criterion 4). In order to
satisfy Criterion 4, FDA recommends that:
a) The software or labeling include the purpose or intended use of the product, including the
intended HCP user and intended patient population. FDA does not consider software
functions intended for a critical, time-sensitive task or decision to meet Criterion 4,
because an HCP is unlikely to have sufficient time to independently review the basis of
the recommendations. (As described in section IV (3), software functions that are
intended to replace or direct the HCP’s judgment would not meet Criterion 3.)
b) The software or labeling identify the required input medical information, with plain
language instructions on how the inputs should be obtained, their relevance, and data
quality requirements.
c) The software or labeling provide a plain language description of the underlying algorithm
development and validation that forms the basis for the CDS implementation, sufficient
for the intended HCP user to understand the basis of the recommendation, including:
i.
A summary of the general approach relied upon to provide the recommendations
(e.g., meta-analysis of clinical studies, expert panel, statistical modeling, AI/ML
techniques), at a level of detail appropriate for the intended user and use
environment, which could include, for example, the logic or methods relied upon;
ii. A description of the data relied upon so that an HCP can assess whether the data is
representative of their patient population (e.g., relevant sub-groups, disease
conditions, collection sites, sex, ethnicity) and assess if best practices were

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
followed (e.g., independent development and validation datasets); and
A description of the results from clinical studies conducted to validate the
algorithm/recommendations so that an HCP can assess the potential performance
and limitations when applied to their patients (e.g., sub-populations with untested
or highly variable algorithm performance).
d) The software output provides the HCP user with relevant patient-specific information and
other knowns/unknowns for consideration (e.g., missing, corrupted, or unexpected input
data values) that will enable the HCP to independently review the basis for the
recommendations and apply their judgment when making the final decision.
iii.

In order to describe the basis for the recommendations, regardless of the complexity of the
software and whether or not it is proprietary, the software or associated labeling should provide
adequate background information about underlying sources in plain language. Information that
enables an HCP to independently review the basis of provided recommendations is presented in a
manner that promotes usability and avoids information overload, including prioritizing the most
decision-relevant information and making additional detail available as appropriate.
The software output or labeling should be identified and available to the intended user (e.g.,
clinical practice guidelines with the date or version, published literature, or information that has
been communicated by the CDS developer to the intended user) and understandable by the
intended user (e.g., data points whose meaning is well understood by the intended user). In
order to enable independent evaluation of its basis, the recommendation should be based on
information whose meaning could be expected to be independently understood by the intended
HCP user (e.g., the inputs used to generate the recommendations are identified, the
recommendations are based on inputs that do not omit material information, and the quality and
robustness of the datasets or clinical studies are described). FDA believes that relevant patientspecific information can also help the HCPs understand the basis of the recommendations.
Beyond the input medical information relied upon, being able to clearly understand how the
logic was applied for the patient (e.g., matching of patient-level data to criteria in practice
guidelines, comparison to a reference/normal database, development and use of a prioritized
schema for recommendation generation) will aid an HCP in understanding the basis of the
recommendations. Providing the recommendations in the context of what is known/unknown
for an individual patient may give HCPs an opportunity to assess the strength/limitations of the
CDS software function recommendations when applying their judgment to the final decision.
In some cases, developers may need to perform usability testing to evaluate if their
implementation meets Criterion 4.
Additionally, FDA considers the (a) level of software automation and (b) time-critical nature of
the HCP’s decision making when determining whether a software function allows an HCP to
independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software so that they
do not rely primarily on such recommendations.
Automation bias is the propensity of humans to over-rely on a suggestion from an automated
system. In the context of CDS, automation bias can result in errors of commission (following
incorrect advice) or omission (failing to act because of not being prompted to do so). In
situations that require urgent action, automation bias increases because there is not sufficient
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
time for the user to adequately consider other information.16 This understanding of automation
bias informs FDA’s interpretation that Non-Device CDS software functions allow an HCP to
independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software so that
they do not rely primarily on such recommendations.

Examples

The following sections describe examples of software functions that are Non-Device CDS
software functions (V.A and V.B) and examples of software functions that remain devices (V.C).
This guidance, and these examples, are not intended to include all regulatory requirements for
devices that may or may not apply to an individual software function. For additional information
about applicable regulatory requirements, please see complementary, existing digital health
policies described in the following: Policy for Device Software Functions and Mobile Medical
Applications,17 Software as a Medical Device (SaMD): Clinical Evaluation,18 Medical Device
Data Systems, Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices,19
and General Wellness: Policy for Low Risk Devices.20

A. Examples of Non-Device CDS Software Functions
The following examples are intended to illustrate FDA’s interpretation of the first three criteria
in section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act: software functions considered Non-Device CDS
provided that they also meet Criterion 4.21 (For examples focused on interpretation of Criterion
4, see section V.B below.)
Examples of non-device CDS software functions include software functions that provide:
1. Evidence-based clinician order sets for an HCP to choose from, tailored for a particular
condition, disease, or clinician preference:
a. Software function that provides groupings of standard order sets, consistent with
clinical guidelines, for patient admission to critical care.
b. Software function that provides a list of diagnostic and treatment order options to
an HCP based on clinical guidelines for the care of adult patients presenting with
pneumonia symptoms.
2. Matching patient-specific medical information from records or reports to reference
information (e.g., clinical guidelines) that is routinely used in clinical practice:

To be a non-device CDS software function, the software function would also need to be explained to the HCP user
such that the user can independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software, and the user
does not rely primarily on the outputs to make a clinical decision about an individual patient (Criterion 4).

B. Examples of Non-Device CDS Software Functions - Criterion 4
The following examples are intended to clarify FDA’s interpretation of the fourth criterion in
section 520(o)(1)(E) of the FD&C Act: software functions considered Non-Device CDS if they
also meet Criteria 1, 2, and 3.
1. Software function that analyzes patient-specific medical information (e.g., end stage renal
disease (ESRD) diagnosis, lab test results, and patient demographics from the patient’s
medical record) and provides an HCP with a list of treatment options for ESRD based on
implementation of practice guidelines. To enable the HCP to independently review the basis
for the recommendations presented by the software so that they do not rely primarily on such
recommendations, but rather on their own judgment, the software labeling and function
provide the following information to the HCP:
a. The intended use, HCP user, and patient population are clearly identified. The
intended use is not time-critical, and the intended HCP is expected to have
sufficient time and training to understand the practice guidelines that are the basis
of the recommendations;
b. The input medical information is clearly identified and relevant, with data quality
requirements to ensure compatibility to enable relevant medical information to be
extracted from the EHR;
c. A plain language description of the underlying algorithm development and
validation that forms the basis for any recommendations is provided. In addition,
the practice guidelines being implemented are clearly identified to the HCP, and
the guidelines contain sufficient information on their development and clinical
studies underlying the recommendations for ESRD treatment options; and
d. The recommendations are provided to the HCP with relevant patient-specific
information including a description of how the patient-specific information
matches the criteria for treatment options in the practice guidelines. The output
indicates whether any expected input medical information from the medical
record was missing.
2. Software function that recommends a prioritized list of FDA-approved chemotherapeutic
agents (approved for the patient’s diagnosed cancer type) to an HCP based on analysis of
reported outcomes in a database of clinical studies using the patient’s diagnosis and
demographics from the medical record. To enable HCPs to independently review the basis
for the recommendations presented by the software so that they do not rely primarily on such
recommendations, but rather on their own judgment, the following information is provided to
the HCP:
a. The intended use, HCP user, and patient population are clearly identified. The use
is not time-critical, and the intended HCP is expected to have sufficient time and
training to assess the clinical studies that are the basis of the recommendations;
b. The cancer diagnosis and patient demographics are clearly identified as the inputs
being used in the database search and analysis;
c. Information about how the clinical studies included were selected, the full reports
of the clinical studies being relied upon are clearly identified, with a brief
summary of the strength of each study (e.g., number of patients, outcome metrics,
randomization, comparison arm), and the key elements of the diagnosis or
demographics searched for in the medical record are noted;
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
d. The prioritized list of FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agents and the basis of the
prioritization is provided to the HCP, and the studies that most closely matched
the patient-specific diagnosis and demographics are identified. Other
considerations, such as the warnings and contraindications from the current
version of the FDA-approved drug labeling, are also provided to the HCP for
consideration prior to making a final decision.
3. Software function that analyzes a COPD patient’s age and average number of steps walked
per day in order to provide a list of follow-up options for the HCP to consider (e.g., office
visit, chest CT, spirometry) to evaluate disease progression. To enable HCPs to
independently review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software so that
they do not rely primarily on such recommendations, but rather on their own judgment, the
following information is provided to the HCP:
a. The intended use, HCP user, and patient population are clearly identified. The use
is not time-critical, and the intended HCP is expected to have sufficient time and
training to assess the clinical studies that are the basis of the recommendations;
b. The patient’s age and average number of steps walked per day and the date of the
measurement are clearly identified as the input information. The software also
describes how this information is collected;
c. A plain language summary is provided to the HCP describing how the algorithm
is analyzing patient age and steps walked to assess activity and any validation
studies, as appropriate;
d. The list of follow-up options is provided to the HCP to consider. The average
metrics of the patient over time are shown in comparison with a subset of subjects
from the underlying database with similar age, disease severity and demographics.
The algorithm identifies limitations to consider, such as number of days with
missing step information or high variability in daily measurements, which could
impact the analysis or the follow-up recommendation based on the HCP’s
judgement.

C. Examples of Device Software Functions
The following examples illustrate FDA’s interpretation of the criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E) of
the FD&C Act and describe device software functions which do not meet all four criteria and
for which FDA intends to focus its regulatory oversight. Certain examples focus on the first
three criteria in section 520(o)(1)(E). Others focus on the interpretation of Criterion 4 to
demonstrate scenarios where the software function does not enable the HCP to independently
review the basis for the recommendations presented by the software. If an example does not
include a statement reflecting that the software function fails a specific criterion, then for the
purposes of the example, it can be assumed that the criterion is satisfied. Note that where
Criterion 3 is referenced, as discussed in more detail in section IV(3) above, if only one option
is clinically appropriate and the software function otherwise meets all criteria under section
520(o)(1)(E), FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion (meaning that FDA does not
intend to enforce requirements under the FD&C Act) for such functions.

software algorithm is trained on a large dataset of 100,000 cases from 10 clinical sites, with
summary performance based on subsequent cancer detection rates with supplemental
imaging and biopsy. The product labeling provides information on the purpose of the
software, the intended user and patient population, and a description of the software outputs.
The intended use, HCP user, and patient population are clearly identified. The use is not
time-critical, and the intended HCP is expected to have sufficient time and training to assess
the studies that are the basis of the recommendations. However, this software is a device
function since it does not meet Criterion 4 because:
a. The input medical information is not adequately disclosed to the HCP to be able
to understand what information is being considered from the patient’s medical
record or from the radiologist’s report;
25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
b. While the HCP is informed that an algorithm was trained on a large dataset with
supplemental imaging and biopsy, specific details on the independence of the
development and validation datasets, such as the distribution of cases from
different sites, breast density, ethnicity, or other important factors, are not
available to the HCP. Without this information, the HCP will not be able to assess
if the results are generalizable; and
c. The recommendations are provided to the HCP; however, no additional
information is available to the HCP to understand the key variables that
influenced the recommendations.
Taken together, an HCP is not able to independently review the basis for the
recommendations that the software function provides. As a result, the software function is a
device.

The use is not time critical, and the intended HCP is expected to have sufficient time and
training to assess the studies that are the basis of the recommendations. The medical
information from the patient’s medical record is clearly identified to the HCP to be able to
understand what information is being considered. However, this software is a device
function since it does not meet Criterion 4 because:
a. The full report of the clinical studies being relied upon is not made available to
the user; and
b. The prioritized list of FDA-authorized depression treatment options is provided to
the user; however, the software does not identify the studies that most closely
matched the patient-specific diagnosis and demographics and other
considerations, such as the warning/contraindications from the labeling.
Taken together, an HCP is not able to independently review the basis for the
recommendations that the software function provides. As a result, the software function is a
device.
