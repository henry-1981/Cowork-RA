Spinal Plating Systems – Performance
Criteria for Safety and Performance
Based Pathway
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for spinal plating systems in support of the Safety
and Performance Based Pathway.1 Under this framework, submitters (you) planning to submit a
510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for spinal plating systems will have the
option to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial
equivalence, rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a
predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA
guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices.3
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope/Device Description
The spinal plates that are the subject of this guidance are anterior cervical or anterior/lateral
thoracolumbar spinal plating systems. These devices are Class II and are regulated under 21 CFR
888.3060 with the product code KWQ (appliance, fixation, spinal intervertebral body).
Intended Use/Indications for Use: The spinal plating systems that fall within the scope of this
guidance document are intended for fixation to vertebral bodies (anteriorly in the cervical spine
or anteriorly/laterally in the thoracolumbar spine) for the purpose of stabilizing the spine for
fusion. Plating systems that attach to the posterior spine or the occiput are outside the scope of
this guidance document.
Device Design Characteristics: The spinal plating systems that fall within the scope of this
guidance document consist of plates and associated fixed or variable angle screws, constructed
solely from one of the following materials in conformance with the associated FDA-recognized
consensus standard:
· ASTM F136 Standard Specification for Wrought Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium ELI
(Extra Low Interstitial) Alloy for Surgical Implant Applications (UNS R56401)
· ASTM F1295 Standard Specification for Wrought Titanium-6 Aluminum-7Niobium Alloy
for Surgical Implant Applications (UNS R56700)
· ASTM F67 Standard Specification for Unalloyed Titanium, for Surgical Implant
Applications (UNS R50250, UNS R50400, UNS R50550, UNS R50700).
A dimensional comparison of the subject device should be performed, and the dimensions should
fall within the dimensional ranges listed in Table 1.

** Largest thickness or profile of the subject plate should fall below the listed value. A minimum plate thickness is
not specified; however thickness should be sufficient for the plate to meet the mechanical testing acceptance criteria
outlined in this guidance.

Cervical and thoracolumbar spinal plating systems with the following features are not eligible
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway via this guidance:
· Devices that affix to the posterior spine or the occiput
· Devices for which a 2-level cervical plate or a 1- or 2-level thoracolumbar plate is not
representative of a worst-case construct for performance testing per the FDA currently
recognized version of ASTM F1717 Standard Test Methods for Spinal Implant
Constructs in a Vertebrectomy Model
· Staples or plates with fixation mechanisms other than threaded screws
· Devices with coatings
· Combination products
· Resorbable devices
· Additively manufactured devices
· Devices that are designed to allow motion post-implantation (e.g., plates designed to
“settle”).
· Buttress plating systems (i.e., plates that do not span at least one functional spinal unit)
General guidance that is beyond the scope of this safety and performance guidance document
regarding submission of a 510(k) for spinal plating systems (i.e., labeling), can be found in
FDA’s guidance Spinal System 510(k)s.4
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission5 to engage in discussion with FDA prior
to submission of the 510(k).

III. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, you do not need to provide direct comparison testing against a
legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) identified for each test or evaluation below.
Unless otherwise identified in the submission information sections below, test information such
as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should be submitted as part of the

510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance, Safety and Performance Based Pathway.6 For additional
information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please see
FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance
Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.7
Mechanical Testing
Static compression bending, static torsion, and dynamic compression bending should be
performed in conformance with the FDA currently-recognized version of ASTM F1717
Standard Test Methods for Spinal Implant Constructs in a Vertebrectomy Model. We recommend
that you perform all testing on plate system designs that represent worst-case (e.g., most likely to
loosen or fail) final design versions. You should also provide a rationale identifying how you
identified the worst-case design. Acceptance criteria are listed below for each test, which
include stiffness and yield values for the static tests and runout loads for the dynamic test. 8
For each mechanical test below, you should provide a report as specified in the relevant reporting
sections of ASTM F1717 and the Mechanical Testing section of FDA’s guidance Spinal System
510(k)s,9 in addition to a Declaration of Conformity (DoC) to the consensus standard. Any
protocol deviations should be thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain
protocol deviations may invalidate comparison to the performance criteria listed below, resulting
in the need for submission of a Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k), as appropriate.
Note: ASTM F1717 specifies the active lengths of the longitudinal element to be 35 mm for
cervical devices and 76 mm for lumbar devices (or as close to these dimensions as possible based
on plate sizes available) to simulate connection across two spinal levels in the cervical and
lumbar spine, respectively. However, since many thoracolumbar plating systems only contain 1level plates, significant modification to the specified 76 mm active length is necessary to
simulate connection across a single spinal level. Therefore, data for 1-level and 2-level
thoracolumbar plating systems were analyzed separately, and acceptance criteria are stratified for
each test below.

It should be noted that although ASTM F1717 is FDA-recognized in full, FDA believes that for the purposes of the
safety and performance based pathway, the testing, methods, and criteria identified in this section on mechanical
bench testing represent the least burdensome approach to demonstrating substantial equivalence for this pathway,
although alternative or additional methods or acceptance criteria are identified in the recognized consensus standard
for some tests.

Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization
process for medical devices
· ISO 11607-1 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1:
Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems
· ISO 11607-2 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 2:
Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes
Performance Criteria: Validation testing should demonstrate the cleanliness and
sterility of, or the ability to clean and sterilize to a sterility assurance level of 10-6, the
device and device-specific instruments. You should provide a description of the
packaging (sterile barrier system) and how it will maintain the device’s sterility, and a
description of the package test methods, but not package test data.
Performance Criteria Source: FDA’s guidance:
· Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile10
· Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and
Labeling11
Submission Information: If using an Established Category A sterilization method, you
should provide the information described in Section V.A. as specified in the FDA
guidance Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile; the validation data itself is not
needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence.

Biocompatibility Evaluation:
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH)
guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices –
Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process,12 referred to in the rest of this
document as the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices
covered by this guidance to be categorized as Implant Devices in contact with tissue/bone with a
permanent contact duration of > 30 days and you should assess the endpoints below per
Attachment A of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity
· Acute Systemic Toxicity
· Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity
· Sub-acute/Sub-chronic Toxicity
· Genotoxicity

Implantation
Chronic Toxicity
Carcinogenicity

Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: In rare cases, if you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the
identified biocompatibility endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided
for all tests performed unless a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can
be appropriately provided, per Attachment E of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance. Any testspecific positive, negative, and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol
deviations should be thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol
deviations may invalidate comparison to the performance criteria listed below, resulting in the
need for submission of a Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k).

5.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance. For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device
control samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform
as expected, as specified above for the subject device samples.
Submission Information: Refer to CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
