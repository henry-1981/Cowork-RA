Classification of Posterior Cervical
Screw Systems: Small Entity
Compliance Guide
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or
the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

On April 1, 2019, FDA published a final rule in the Federal Register entitled “Classification
of Posterior Cervical Screw Systems” (84 FR 12088). This final rule created the
classification regulation 21 CFR 888.3075 for posterior cervical screw systems and
established special controls. FDA has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in
accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act
(Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28) to assist small entities to comply
with the requirements established in 21 CFR 888.3075.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Prior to the classification, FDA regulated posterior cervical screw systems as unclassified
preamendments devices requiring premarket notification (510(k)).
On April 9, 2009, FDA published an order under sections 515(i) and 519 of the FD&C Act
(515(i) order) for the submission of safety and effectiveness information on pedicle screw
spinal systems with certain indications for use (74 FR 16214). In response to that order,
FDA received a request from the Orthopedic Surgical Manufacturers Association (OSMA) to

classify posterior cervical screw systems into class II (special controls). Because this request
was considered to be outside the scope of the 515(i) order related to pedicle screw spinal
systems, FDA requested that OSMA submit a separate petition for classification of posterior
cervical screw systems. OSMA submitted the requested petition on November 22, 2011,
under Docket No. FDA-2011-P-0851. FDA convened an advisory committee meeting of the
Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel (the Panel) regarding the classification of this
device type on September 21, 2012. At that meeting, the Panel recommended that posterior
cervical screw systems be classified as class II with special controls. On April 1, 2019, FDA
published a final rule to classify posterior cervical screw systems into class II (special
controls) (84 FR 12088). 1

III. Classification of Posterior Cervical Screw Systems
A.

Classification Regulation

The classification regulation for posterior cervical screw systems is 21 CFR 888.3075. 2 The
regulation classifies posterior cervical screw systems (product code NKG) into class II
(special controls).

B.

Identification of Posterior Cervical Screw Systems

Paragraph (a) of §888.3075 identifies posterior cervical screw systems.

C.

Posterior Cervical Screw Systems Class and Special
Controls

Paragraph (b) of §888.3075 establishes the class and special controls for posterior cervical
screw systems.
While posterior cervical screw systems 3 must comply with the special controls,4 it is not
expected that manufacturers of devices already on the market as of May 1, 2019, would need
to submit new 510(k)s, 510(k) amendments, or add-to-files to demonstrate conformance with
the special controls. 5

Viewing the Posterior Cervical Screw System
Classification Regulation

The United States government provides an electronic version of the Code of Federal
Regulations (eCFR). The posterior cervical screw system regulation can be found in the
eCFR. 6 The title number is 21. The section heading is 888.3075.
