Intent to Exempt Certain Unclassified
Medical Devices from Premarket
Notification Requirements
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the
public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for this guidance listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance describes the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) intent to exempt certain
unclassified medical devices from premarket notification requirements. FDA believes devices
identified in Section IV of this guidance document are sufficiently well understood and do not
require premarket notification (510(k)) to assure their safety and effectiveness. Until the
publication of a final rule exempting these devices from 510(k), FDA does not intend to enforce
compliance with 510(k) requirements for these devices. FDA does not expect manufacturers to
submit 510(k)s for these devices during this time period.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
In the commitment letter (section 1.G of the Performance Goals and Procedures)
(https://www.fda.gov/media/83244/download) that was drafted as part of the reauthorization
process for the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012, FDA committed to identifying
low-risk medical devices to exempt from premarket notification requirements. Under the 21st
Century Cures Act, FDA was given the authority to exempt class II and class I reserved medical
devices from premarket notification requirements on a periodic basis. To date, several class I

and class II devices have been exempted through 510(l)1 and 510(m)2, respectively, of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended. Therefore, for the purposes of this
guidance, FDA has identified certain unclassified medical devices (that FDA intends to classify
into class I or II) for which FDA believes premarket notification is not necessary to assure safety
and effectiveness before these devices enter the marketplace.

III. Scope
The goal of this document is to outline FDA’s intent to propose exempting the unclassified
medical devices listed below in Section IV from premarket notification requirements. FDA does
not intend to exempt these devices from other statutory and regulatory requirements, including,
but not limited to: registration and listing (21 CFR part 807); labeling (21 CFR part 801); good
manufacturing practice requirements as set forth in the Quality System regulation (21 CFR part
820); and Medical Device Reporting requirements (21 CFR part 803). It is not FDA’s intent to
exempt any combination products that may fall within the product codes subject to this guidance.
Also, single-entity products containing an antimicrobial agent are not within the scope of this
guidance.
