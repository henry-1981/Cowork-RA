INTRODUCTION

FDA is issuing this guidance to comply with section 3612(b)(2) of the Food and Drug Omnibus
Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), enacted as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.2
FDORA directs FDA to issue guidance describing the processes and practices applicable to
inspections of sites and facilities described in section 704(a)(5)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(5)(C)(i)),3 to the extent not specified in
existing publicly available FDA guides and manuals for such inspections. These establishments4
are inspected under FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program in accordance with section
704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act. Specifically, this guidance addresses the following (to the extent not
publicly available in FDA guides and manuals): the types of records and information required to
be provided, best practices for communication between FDA and industry in advance of or
during an inspection or request for records or other information, and other inspections-related
conduct.5
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of

the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.
II.

BACKGROUND

FDA’s BIMO program is a comprehensive portfolio of programs designed to assess and monitor
all aspects of the conduct and reporting of FDA-regulated research6 as well as certain
postmarketing activities through on-site inspections, investigations,7 and Remote Regulatory
Assessments (RRAs). The BIMO program was established to assess the quality and integrity of
data submitted to the Agency in support of regulatory decision-making, as well as to provide for
protection of the rights, safety, and welfare of human and animal trial participants involved in
FDA-regulated research.8 The program assesses compliance with statutory requirements and
FDA’s regulations governing the conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies, and applicable
postmarketing activities (e.g., in REMS and PADE).9
FDA is authorized to access, inspect, and copy records and other establishment information as
described in section 704(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)). The general authority for
establishment inspections is found in section 704(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(1)).
Section 704(a)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 374(a)(5)), as added by section 3612 of FDORA,
clarified10 and detailed the Agency’s authority for conducting BIMO inspections. Specifically, in
clarifying the Agency’s BIMO inspection authority, section 704(a)(5) addresses, among other
things, the following:
•
•

the establishments subject to BIMO inspection, e.g., those used by sponsors in connection
with developing an application or other submission to FDA for marketing authorization,
or those conducting a study related to such an application or submission; and
the records and other information that may be inspected, e.g., information related to the
conduct, results, and analyses of studies, including those involving human and animal
trial participants.

Section 704(a)(5) also underscores that those subject to BIMO inspection must provide FDA
with access to the information to be inspected (including access to all paper and electronic
records and access to electronic information systems used to hold, analyze, process, or transfer
that information), and permit FDA to inspect an establishment’s relevant facilities and equipment

See “Bioresearch Monitoring Investigations” under section 8.6 of the “Investigations Operations Manual,”
available at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/inspectionreferences/investigations-operations-manual.

The terms “research,” “trial,” and “study” are used synonymously for purposes of this guidance and include both
clinical research (also referred to as “clinical study,” “clinical trial,” and “clinical investigation”) and nonclinical
research (also referred to as “nonclinical trial” and “nonclinical laboratory study”).
9
“REMS” refers to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (see section 505-1 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 3551)). “PADE” refers to Postmarketing Adverse Drug Experience (see, e.g., 21 CFR 310.305, 21 CFR 314.80, 21 CFR
329.100, 21 CFR 600.80, and 21 CFR 4 (Subpart B)).

used in generating that information.11 For more information on the Agency’s current practices
with respect to accessing electronic databases (including electronic information systems), FDA
recommends stakeholders consult the Agency’s Investigations Operations Manual (IOM).12 At
the same time, section 704(a)(5) makes clear that existing safeguards13 against disclosure of
confidential commercial information and trade secrets continue to apply, and that BIMO
inspections – like inspections generally – are to be conducted at reasonable times, within
reasonable limits, and in a reasonable manner.14
Generally, an inspection, such as described in section 704(a) of the FD&C Act, involves duly
designated officers or employees of FDA physically entering establishments subject to regulation
under the FD&C Act to determine compliance with applicable FDA requirements. FDA also uses
other oversight tools when appropriate, such as RRAs. An RRA is an examination of an FDAregulated establishment and/or its records, conducted entirely remotely, to evaluate compliance
with applicable FDA requirements. RRAs under the BIMO Program may consist of, for
example: (1) Remote Interactive Evaluations15 and (2) requests for records or other information
including under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act from sites and facilities subject to inspection
under section 704(a)(5)(C)(i) (i.e., establishments subject to BIMO inspections) “in advance of
or in lieu of” such inspections.16 FDA generally takes a risk-based approach to inspections and
RRAs.17

FD&C Act, see “Conducting Remote Regulatory Assessments Questions and Answers Guidance for Industry”
(hereafter, the “RRA Guidance”), available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/conducting-remote-regulatory-assessments-questions-and-answers. Although an RRA is not an
inspection under sections 704(a)(1) or 704(a)(5) and the RRA Guidance notes that the Agency does not intend to
conduct an RRA at the same time as an inspection, the RRA Guidance provides information about communications
between industry and FDA during an RRA that may be relevant for communications during an inspection.

PROCESSES AND PRACTICES APPLICABLE TO BIORESEARCH
MONITORING INSPECTIONS
A.

BIMO Processes and Practices

The Agency’s processes and practices applicable to BIMO inspections are detailed in its IOM,
compliance programs, and the Regulatory Procedures Manual (RPM). In general, for all
domestic and foreign BIMO inspections, FDA follows the same processes and practices before
and during the inspection, except as noted in this guidance.
FDA’s IOM18 is the primary operational reference for FDA investigators and other FDA
personnel to perform investigational activities in support of the Agency’s public health mission
across all program areas. The BIMO compliance programs were developed to provide uniform
and specific instructions for FDA personnel. They describe the inspection focus and types of
records and information FDA personnel evaluate to assess compliance with the relevant FDA
regulations and statutory requirements for each regulated entity or program.19
These compliance programs include:
•

FDA’s centers (CBER, CDER, CDRH, HFP, CTP, and CVM) and the Office of Bioresearch
Monitoring Inspectorate (OBMI), within the Office of Inspections and Investigations (OII),
administer the applicable BIMO compliance programs.

See “Investigations Operations Manual,” available at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcementand-criminal-investigations/inspection-references/investigations-operations-manual. The IOM is reference material
for investigators and other FDA personnel. The document does not bind FDA and does not confer any rights,
privileges, benefits, or immunities for or on any person(s).
19
See “Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO) Compliance Programs,” available at
https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/compliance-programmanual/bioresearch-monitoring-program-bimo-compliance-programs. Compliance programs do not create or confer
any rights for or on any person and do not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used
as long as the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

For regulatory and enforcement matters, the RPM20 is a reference manual that provides internal
procedures and related information for FDA employees to administer these matters in support of
the Agency’s public health mission. The RPM includes information detailing administrative
actions such as clinical investigator disqualifications and related procedures such as a Notice of
Opportunity for Hearing (NOOH).
Although the IOM, compliance programs, and RPM are primarily used by FDA staff, all are
available publicly so that regulated industry and other stakeholders can better understand FDA
operations. We note that FDA regularly reviews its processes and practices described in the
IOM, compliance programs, and RPM that are applicable to establishment inspections, to
evaluate whether any updates are needed.21
See the Resource Guide at the end of the guidance for further details on the IOM, compliance
programs, and RPM as well as additional resources on BIMO inspections and RRAs.
B.

Types of Inspections

FDA personnel conduct inspections to determine an establishment’s compliance with applicable
FDA statutory and regulatory requirements (e.g., with respect to bioresearch inspections – to
help ensure trial participant safety, and to evaluate data reliability). FDA BIMO inspections
generally include: inspections conducted in support of FDA’s review of specific submissions or
marketing applications; periodic inspections of establishments with ongoing activities, such as
nonclinical laboratories or institutional review boards (IRBs); or inspections conducted to
evaluate potential noncompliance or safety issues raised in a complaint or required report (e.g.,
from IRBs or sponsors) pertaining to a study or establishment. Inspections may be
comprehensive, covering all operations of the establishment, or directed, covering a subset of
operations. As explained in Part IV below, FDA conducts both pre-announced and unannounced
BIMO inspections. Inspections, whether pre-announced or unannounced, are conducted
consistent with the Agency’s compliance programs, the IOM, and applicable statutory authority.
C.

International Inspections

Product development and marketing are often global pursuits and therefore FDA’s BIMO
inspections are not limited to the United States. International BIMO inspections may be
conducted when appropriate (e.g., when studies conducted outside the United States are in
support of, or otherwise related to, a marketing application submitted to FDA and provide data
critical to regulatory decision making). For domestic BIMO inspections, a notice of inspection

See “Regulatory Procedures Manual,” available at https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-andcriminal-investigations/compliance-manuals/regulatory-procedures-manual. The RPM does not create or confer any
rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.
21
In accordance with section 3612(b)(1) of FDORA, as part of developing this guidance, the Agency reviewed
“processes and practices in effect as of the date of enactment of this Act [i.e., FDORA] applicable to inspections of
foreign and domestic sites and facilities described” in section 704(a)(5)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act “to evaluate whether
any updates are needed to facilitate the consistency of such processes and practices.” FDA makes needed updates on
a routine basis, as part of our regular review of processes and practices, as noted above.

(e.g., Form FDA 48222) is issued at the time of inspection and FDA credentials are presented to
the top management official (or onsite designee).23 During foreign inspections, FDA credentials
are presented as in a domestic inspection, but FDA does not issue a notice of inspection.24 With
the exception of this difference and those related to pre-announcement procedures described
below,25 inspections of foreign and domestic establishments are generally the same in terms of
processes and practices.
FDA has issued guidance26 relevant to the conduct of clinical studies, including guidance on
issues specific to studies conducted internationally.27 FDA also collaborates with certain
international regulatory partner agencies to conduct joint inspections, observe inspections, share
inspection information, and develop policy.28 This collaboration promotes consistency in
regulatory approaches, which can reduce burden on regulated entities, and the efficient use of
finite inspectional resources.
IV.

BEST PRACTICES FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FDA AND INDUSTRY
IN ADVANCE OF, DURING, OR AFTER AN INSPECTION
A.

Pre-announcement Notice and Communication

The Agency’s primary purpose for pre-announcing an inspection is to confirm the location for
the inspection and ensure the appropriate records and establishment personnel will be available.
FDA may communicate a general idea of the records that may be requested during the inspection
(e.g., regarding certain establishment procedures and any associated records). In appropriate
cases, additional information about the records that should be available at the start of the
inspection may be provided during pre-announcement.

22

See section 5.5 of the IOM.
See “FDA Credentials” under section 5.1 of the IOM.
24
For additional information on FDA notice of inspection (e.g., Form FDA 482), see “Authority to Inspect” under
section 2.2 of the IOM. See also the BIMO compliance programs.
25
See Part IV. A Pre-announcement Notice and Communication.
26
See “Search for FDA Guidance Documents,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fdaguidance-documents.
27
FDA BIMO inspections include, but are not limited to, studies that are conducted under an FDA investigational
new drug application (IND), as well as studies at non-U.S. establishments that are not conducted under an IND, an
investigational new animal drug (INAD) exemption, or under an investigational device exemption (IDE). See, for
example, the “Information Sheet Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical Investigators, and IRBs: Frequently Asked
Questions Statement of Investigator (Form FDA 1572),” discussing foreign clinical studies conducted under an IND
or as non-IND studies.
28
FDA may enter into cooperative arrangements and confidentiality commitments to facilitate international
partnerships with counterpart foreign government agencies. See “International Arrangements,” available at
https://www.fda.gov/international-programs/international-arrangements. With respect to cooperative arrangements,
see section 1003(b)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 393(b)(3)) and section 307 of the Public Health Service Act (42
U.S.C 242l), and with respect to confidentiality commitments, see section 708(c) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.
379(c)) and 21 CFR 20.89.
23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Pre-announcement practices depend on the type of inspectional activity being conducted and are
explained in each compliance program.29 During pre-announcement of FDA inspections, FDA
intends to make reasonable efforts to contact the establishment, including to discuss inspection
plans, and the inspection start date and time. Pre-announcement communications also include
discussions with the establishment to ensure the availability of relevant establishment staff and
the associated records and specific operations for review during the inspection, as applicable.
Establishments using electronic information systems to hold, analyze, process, or transfer
pertinent information should be prepared to provide access to FDA personnel upon their
arrival.30
FDA investigators routinely share their names, titles, contact information, and, when appropriate,
reasons for conducting the inspection. There may be instances in which FDA investigators may
not disclose specific reasons for conducting the inspection during pre-announcement. In such
cases, if appropriate, FDA investigators may inform the establishment representative that
additional details will be shared during the opening meeting of the inspection.
Establishment staff should also confirm arrival details with FDA investigators and provide a
contact phone number. FDA believes that an establishment’s failure to acknowledge the preannouncement notification should not be a reason to delay the start of an inspection. This preannouncement notification should be provided within a reasonable time before the inspection is
scheduled to occur.31
FDA generally pre-announces both foreign and domestic inspections, but pre-announcement for
foreign inspections is generally further in advance of the inspection due to country clearance
requirements. In general, pre-announcements for domestic inspections will be given via phone
while for foreign inspections pre-announcements may be by phone and/or email. The Agency
may determine to not pre-announce an inspection (foreign or domestic) if prior notification may
impact the inspection. Credentials are presented for both pre-announced and unannounced
inspections.32
B.

Inspection Timeframe and Duration

During the pre-announcement, FDA investigators intend to communicate with the establishment
the planned timeframe and duration of the inspection, including appropriate working hours
during which the inspection is likely to take place. Inspection duration is impacted by a myriad
of factors, such as the complexities of the operations, availability of knowledgeable staff, the
nature of any observations, and if FDA needs to follow up on complaints received by the
Agency.

C.

Communication During an Inspection

When FDA personnel request records or other information as part of an inspection,33 the Agency
will typically provide an opportunity to discuss the nature, process, and timeline of the request.
The establishment may ask clarifying questions and should be prepared to provide the records in
a timely manner during the inspection. Details of the establishment’s electronic information
systems, including the technical capabilities for providing FDA access to electronic records,
should also be discussed.
FDA personnel can view electronic records (including audit trails) via a variety of methods.34
Regardless of the method(s) used to view records, establishments should be prepared to provide
requested copies from electronic systems to FDA.35 FDA may request copies be provided
electronically via a file sharing platform or on electronic storage media or as paper copies as
appropriate.
When time and circumstances permit, FDA personnel should discuss observations with the
management in charge of the establishment as they are observed, or on a daily basis. These
discussions may address findings not documented on the FDA “Inspectional Observations”
(Form FDA 483) for which FDA seeks clarification during the inspection.36
D.

Communication After an Inspection

At the end of an inspection, the FDA investigator conducts a closeout of the inspection with the
establishment representative that includes discussing the findings from the inspection. If
appropriate, FDA will issue a written Form FDA 483 to the establishment. The Form FDA 483 is
intended for use in notifying the inspected establishment’s top management in writing of
“observations of objectionable conditions and practices”37 identified during an inspection in
order to “assist firms inspected in complying with the Acts and regulations enforced by the Food
and Drug Administration.”38
If the establishment chooses to respond to the Form FDA 483 observations orally during the
closeout of the inspection, those responses may be incorporated into the inspection report.39
However, there may not be complete information about corrective and preventative actions at the
time of closeout. Although there is no regulatory requirement for the inspected establishment to
respond to a Form FDA 483, a timely written response to the Form FDA 483 that includes
33

Such requests are distinct from requests for records or other information in advance of, or in lieu of, an inspection
under section 704(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.
34
See note 12, supra.
35
See section 704(a)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act.
36
For additional detail on Form FDA 483, see Chapter 5 of the IOM. See also the BIMO compliance programs.
37
See “Reports of Observations” and “General Discussion with Management” under sections 5.5 and 5.7 of the IOM
for more on discussing the objectionable conditions observed and the potential legal sanctions available to FDA

Language on back of Form FDA 483. There may be other objectionable conditions that exist at the establishment
that are not cited on the Form FDA 483. Also see the BIMO compliance programs.
39
See “General Discussion with Management” under section 5.7 of the IOM.

appropriate corrective and preventive actions could impact FDA’s determination of the need for
subsequent Agency action. FDA encourages establishments to provide written responses to the
observations within fifteen (15) U.S. business days after the end date of the inspection.
Responses submitted to FDA during that timeframe addressing the issues identified during the
inspection generally will be considered before further Agency action or decision.
For domestic inspections, if the establishment chooses to respond in writing to the observations
discussed or listed on the Form FDA 483, the response should be addressed to the OII OBMI
division contact which is listed on the Form FDA 483. Hard copy responses may be mailed to the
address listed on the Form FDA 483 or emailed, with email being the preferred approach.40 It is
recommended that the respondent include the FDA Establishment Identification (FEI) of the
inspected location in its correspondence.41 For foreign inspections, if the establishment chooses
to respond in writing to the observations discussed or listed on the Form FDA 483, the response
should be addressed to the FDA center point of contact (POC) provided by the investigator.
There are several best practices for responding in writing to a Form FDA 483. A response should
demonstrate the establishment’s acknowledgment and understanding of FDA’s observations. It
should also demonstrate the establishment’s commitment to address the observations, including a
commitment from senior leadership.
Responses should be well-organized and structured to, as appropriate:
• Address each observation separately
• Note whether the establishment agrees or disagrees, and, why, if the establishment
disagrees
• Provide completed and/or planned corrective and preventive actions and corresponding
timelines
• Provide a method of verifying or monitoring the effectiveness of the actions
• Submit documentation (e.g., training, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), corrective
action plans, records, etc.) which supports the response to the observation
Following an inspection, the Agency evaluates the inspection findings to determine if the
establishment is in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and classifies the
inspection according to three classifications (No Action Indicated, Voluntary Action Indicated,
Official Action Indicated). 42 The Agency publicly posts the final inspection classification.43 The

Agency may also issue post-inspection correspondence. Once the inspection is closed by the
Agency, the inspected establishment will be provided a copy of the Establishment Inspection
Report.44
E.

Who to Contact at FDA for More Information

If an inspected establishment has any questions that the FDA personnel conducting the
inspection has not answered, the establishment may contact the OII OBMI management staff.
The FDA investigator who conducted the inspection generally will provide the name and
telephone number of OII OBMI division management to the establishment.45 Questions about the
inspection classification can be directed to the FDA center POC identified in the post-inspection
correspondence or in the relevant compliance program. Alternatively, the OII Ombudsman
Program is a communication resource for stakeholders facing unresolved concerns, providing a
