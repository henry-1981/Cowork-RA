TO: All Manufacturers and Potential Manufacturers of Laser Products

SUBJECT: Reproduction of Hazard Warnings in User Instructions

BACKGROUND: 2] CFR 1040.10(h) (1) (iii) requires that the user instructions
Or Operation manual for laser products contain legible reproductions (color
optional) and indicate locations of all labels and hazard warnings that are
required by 21 CFR 1040.10(g) and 1040.11 to be affixed to the product.
Some manufacturers have enclosed their laser product protective housings
within additional external "cosmetic" enclosures. Such enclosures are
intended to preserve the aesthetic integrity of the products and to
discourage users from opening the products. Since protective housing
warning labels are covered by the "cosmetic" enclosures and are not visible
in operation and maintenance configurations, manufacturers have asked
whether operation or maintenance manuals need to contain reproductions of
these labels.

POLICY: CDRH will not object to the amission of reproductions of those
labels and hazard warnings required by 21 CFR 1040.10(g)(6) or (g)(7) from
operation and maintenance information provided such labels are not visible
in any operation or maintenance configuration. However, such labels and
warnings must be visible during service and must be reproduced in service

literature in the manner specified in 21 CFR 1040.10(h)(2)(ii).

INVITATION TO COMMENT: The Center for Devices and Radiological Health
intends to propose an amendment to the Federal performance standard for
laser products which will clearly permit the conditions specified above.

In the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration will not take action
under Section 359, 360B, or 360C of the Radiation Control -for Health and
Safety Act of 1968 if certified laser products deviate from the require-
ments of 21 CFR 1040.10(h)(1)(iii) for the reproduction and locations of
certain labels and hazard warnings required by 21 CFR 1040.10(g) in user
instructions, since such deviation, while technically noncompliant with the

present performance standard, does not ey public health and

safety. Comments on this policy are invited. (ours
