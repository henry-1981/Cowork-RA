On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Surveillance and Detention Without Physical
Examination of Surgeons’ and/or Patient
Examination Gloves

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

Introduction
Health care providers, professionals, and others use surgeons’ and/or patient examination gloves
(subsequently referred to as “medical gloves” in this document) as a barrier against the
transmission of blood- and fluid-borne pathogens. Because medical glove defects, such as holes,
can compromise the effectiveness of the glove barrier and pose a potentially significant hazard to
the health of users and their patients, FDA samples medicals gloves and performs water leak
testing as described in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulation (CFR), Part 800.20.
FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is aware from its import records that
some foreign manufacturers and shippers repeatedly attempt to import medical gloves that fail
water leak testing (i.e., they do not meet the acceptable quality criteria defined in 21 CFR
§ 800.20, based on the number of defective medical gloves in the samples). To address the issue,
FDA proposed a strategy for import surveillance and detention in the draft guidance made
available on July 26, 2000. FDA is making available this final guidance document to provide
guidance to FDA staff and industry, regarding FDA’s strategy for addressing further imports of

1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
medical gloves from manufacturers/shippers1 whose medical gloves have failed to meet FDA’s
minimum acceptable quality criteria.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal
requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those
requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome,
please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments to
the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman.
Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to contact him, can be
found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

Legal Basis for Denying Admission of Medical Gloves
FDA may refuse admission of medical gloves into the United States under section 801(a)(3) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) if it appears from examination that they are
adulterated or misbranded [21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)].
FDA specifically defines sampling plans, a leak test method, and adulteration criteria for medical
gloves in 21 CFR § 800.20. If FDA determines that a sampled shipment of medical gloves
contains an unacceptable level of defects, as described in 21 CFR § 800.20, then the shipment
appears to be adulterated under section 501(c) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 351(c)], which defines a
device as adulterated if its quality falls below that which it purports or is represented to possess.
In addition, repeated shipments of adulterated medical gloves may present the appearance that
the medical gloves are not manufactured in conformance with the Quality System regulation,
Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 820, which is promulgated under section
520(f) of the Act. When a device appears to be in nonconformance with section 520(f) of the
Act, the devices may be refused admission to the United States not only under section 801(a)(3)
of the Act [21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)], but also under section 801(a)(1) [21 U.S.C. 381(a)(1)], which
authorizes refusal of admission, “If it appears from the examination of such samples or otherwise

In this guidance, the term “manufacturer” and “shipper” refer to an entity whose name and address will be listed on the Import
Alert as part of the information to identify the medical gloves that are subject to detention without physical examination because
of an appearance of adulteration. As used in this guidance, the term “firm” refers to an entity providing information to the
agency to rebut the appearance of adulteration applicable to particular medical gloves. This might be the manufacturer/shipper,
importer, distributor or other entity.

that … the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture, packing,
storage, or installation of the device do not conform to the requirements of section 520(f).”

Surveillance and Placement on Import Alert #80-04
FDA field offices may detain, without physical examination, all shipments of medical gloves
from manufacturers/shippers listed on FDA’s Import Alert #80-04, Attachments A and B.
Surveillance sampling of medical gloves from manufacturers/shippers that do not appear on
Attachments A and B of Import Alert #80-04 should be performed according to the latest import
guidance. (For information regarding sampling, see the “Sampling” section of this document on
page 11.)
Because the presence of defects in medical gloves may present a possible potentially significant
health hazard, one (1) violative sample may be sufficient to recommend detention without
physical examination, as described in Chapter 9, Section 6 of the FDA Regulatory Procedures
Manual 2008 (Import Operations and Actions; Detention without Physical Examination
(DWPE)). Therefore, in addition to detaining the violative shipment, the FDA field office at the
port of entry should also submit a recommendation for detention of future shipments without
physical examination to DIOP at HFC-170.
Medical gloves from identified manufacturers/shippers should be placed on Import Alert #80-04
under the regulatory classification for two categories of gloves only, "surgeons’ gloves" and
"patient examination gloves." Specific attributes, types/styles of medical gloves, such as color,
powdered, powder-free, vinyl, latex, nitrile, etc., are not considered separate categories for the
purposes of Import Alert #80-04 and should not be referenced in a recommendation for
detention. DIOP should review the recommendation to ensure the evidence supports detention
without physical examination in accordance with the Act, and that such detention is consistent
with the policy expressed in this guidance.
While a manufacturer/shipper is listed on the Import Alert #80-04, any subsequent shipments of
medical gloves in the category listed on the alert (“surgeons’ gloves” or “patient examination
gloves”) from the same manufacturer/shipper may be detained without physical examination,
including types, styles, or brands of medical gloves within the category that were not specifically
found violative by testing.

Purpose of Import Strategy
This guidance provides a risk-based decision process for managing the Agency’s available
resources for medical gloves. FDA’s strategy will manage the large volume of medical glove
imports while allowing adequate opportunities for firms to demonstrate that the medical gloves
offered for import conform to FDA’s acceptable quality criteria in 21 CFR 800.20. Accordingly,
FDA has devised a risk-based, tiered process for placing medical gloves from identified
manufacturers/shippers on Import Alert #80-04, for releasing individual shipments, and for
removing medical gloves from the identified manufacturers/shippers from import alert.

Import Strategy
This guidance document describes three levels of import surveillance and detention for medical
gloves from manufacturers/shippers who have offered for import to the United States medical
gloves that do not meet FDA’s acceptable quality criteria that appears in 21 CFR § 800.20, as
evidenced by failure of FDA or independent private laboratory water leak testing occurring
within a manufacturers/shippers Import Surveillance Cycle (Cycle). A manufacturer/shipper
Cycle begins on the date that it is placed on Level 1 Detention and ends when 24 months have
elapsed since the initiation of the Cycle, unless the medical gloves from the manufacturer/shipper
are placed on Level 3 detention, as described below in this guidance document.
For each level, the guidance explains the criteria for that level, the actions the agency may take
regarding import detention and refusal of admission, and what the agency will accept as evidence
to demonstrate that the medical gloves being offered for import meet FDA’s minimum
acceptable quality criteria.
Determining the Import Detention Level
Routine examination of imports of medical gloves is conducted in accordance with 21 CFR
§ 800.20. When such an examination reveals that a shipment of medical gloves is defective,
FDA's enforcement strategy for addressing that shipment and future shipments of similar
medical gloves from the same manufacturer/shipper will directly relate to the
manufacturer/shipper’s import history. That history will determine which of the three levels of
detention is appropriate.
The process used to make this determination is represented graphically in the flow chart provided
on page 13. Each stage of the process is cross-referenced with the corresponding flow chart
decision, action, and outcome boxes in the discussion below.

Level 1 Detention
Criteria for Level 1 Detention (Flow Chart Decision Box D1):
When DIOP receives a recommendation for detention, they should review the
manufacturer/shipper’s import history to determine whether:
•
•

The manufacturer/shipper is currently listed on Import Alert #80-04,
or
The manufacturer/shipper has previously been listed on Import Alert
#80-04 within an ongoing cycle.

If it is determined that neither of these conditions apply, then Level 1
detention is appropriate. If either condition is applicable, see the “Criteria
for Level 2 Detention” and the “Criteria for Level 3 Detention” sections
below.

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Placement on Level 1 Detention (Flow Chart Action Box L1):
If DIOP determines that the manufacturer/shipper has not been listed previously on Import
Alert #80-04 during an ongoing Cycle, and that the recommendation supports detention under
the Act due to the appearance of a violation, the manufacturer/shipper should be listed on
Attachment A of Import Alert #80-04 with a single asterisk ("*") along with the date of listing.
In this manner, the date on which the medical gloves from that manufacturer/shipper are placed
on Level 1 detention will initiate the firm’s Cycle.
A firm may dispel the appearance of adulteration and obtain admission of subsequent individual
shipments of medical gloves listed on the import alert by presenting evidence to the FDA field
office at the port of entry that the individual shipments are not adulterated. Evidence may
include sample testing performed by an independent private laboratory in the United States. The
testing performed should follow the sampling plan and test methods in the current regulation, 21
CFR § 800.20. For further information on how to submit private laboratory test results to FDA,
refer to the Private Laboratory Guidance, found at Volume III, Section 7 of the ORA Laboratory
Manual, available at http://www.fda.gov/ora/science_ref/lm/default.htm.
Removal from Level 1 Detention: (Flow Chart Decision Box D4)
To obtain removal of a manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves from Level 1 detention under this
guidance, the firm should provide documentation to DIOP that contains sufficient evidence to
show that imported medical gloves from the identified manufacturer/shipper consistently meet
FDA’s acceptable quality criteria. Evidence sufficient for removal of a manufacturer/shipper’s
medical gloves from Level 1 detention will generally consist of independent private laboratory
analyses, using FDA’s sampling plans and test methods, showing that a minimum of five
consecutive surgeons’ glove or patient examination glove shipments meet the FDA acceptable
quality criteria. For further information on removal from detention refer to the “Request for
Release from Detention Without Physical Examination” section on page 10 of this document.
Important Note: (Flow Chart Outcome Box O1)
Even when a manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves have been removed from
Level 1 detention, if another shipment of medical gloves from the same
manufacturer/shipper fails analysis during the remainder of the Cycle, FDA
should consider the previous placement on Level 1 detention when making further
decisions regarding detention of the manufacturer/shipper’s imports. (See “Level
2 Detention” below.)

Level 2 Detention
Criteria for Level 2 Detention: (Flow Chart Decision Boxes D1, D2)

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

When DIOP receives a recommendation for detention, they should review the
manufacturer/shipper’s import history. If DIOP determines that there is an
ongoing Cycle and:
•

•

the manufacturer/shipper was previously listed on Import Alert
#80-04, Level 1 Detention, as discussed above (“Criteria for Level
1 Detention”) during this Cycle but its surgeons’ gloves or patient
examination gloves were removed from the import alert without
advancing to Level 2 Detention, or
the manufacturer/shipper is currently listed on Import Alert #8004, Level 1 Detention, and there is further evidence that its
surgeons’ gloves or patient examination gloves are adulterated,
such as a violative private laboratory (or FDA) analysis, then
DIOP will notify CDRH. CDRH and DIOP will both review the
manufacturer/shipper’s import history to determine if the
evidence supports placing surgeons’ glove or patient examination
gloves from that manufacturer/shipper on Level 2 detention.

Placement on Level 2 Detention: (Flow Chart Action Box L2)
If the DIOP/CDRH review determines the recommendation supports detention under the Act due
to the appearance of a violation and that the criteria for Level 2 detention have been met, then the
manufacturer/shipper’s name should be listed on Attachment A of Import Alert #80-04 with two
asterisks ("**") and the date that its medical gloves were most recently placed on Level 1
detention.
At the same time, CDRH should notify the foreign manufacturer/shipper in writing about
possible deficiencies in their manufacturing procedures and practices that may be affecting the
quality of the medical gloves offered for import to the United States. The letter should advise the
foreign manufacturer/shipper that continued failure of its medical gloves to meet FDA’s
acceptable quality criteria may create an appearance that the manufacturer/shipper’s
manufacturing process does not satisfy the Quality System requirements promulgated under
section 520(f) of the Act. Such an appearance would constitute the basis for detention of imports
under section 801(a)(1) until FDA receives satisfactory evidence of compliance with the Quality
System requirements. Manufacturers will be advised that they should review their
manufacturing procedures and practices to assure they are in accordance with the Quality System
regulation (21 CFR Part 820). If the review shows that corrections are necessary to ensure
medical gloves of acceptable quality, then such corrections should be made prior to offering
further shipments of medical gloves for entry to the United States. A copy of the Quality System
regulation should be attached to the letter for the manufacturer/shipper’s information.
A firm may dispel the appearance of adulteration and obtain admission of subsequent individual
shipments of medical gloves from a manufacturer/shipper listed on Import Alert #80-04, Level 2
detention, by presenting evidence to the FDA district office at the port of entry that an individual
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

shipment is not adulterated. Evidence may include sample testing performed by an independent
private laboratory in the United States.
Removal from Level 2 Detention: (Flow Chart Decision Box D3)
To obtain removal of a manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves from Level 2 detention under this
guidance, a firm should provide documentation to DIOP that contains sufficient evidence to
show that the imported medical gloves consistently meet FDA’s acceptable quality criteria. Due
to FDA’s increased concerns at Level 2 regarding the ability of the manufacturer/shipper’s
medical gloves to meet the FDA criteria, FDA may need greater assurance than is needed for
removal from Level 1 detention. Evidence sufficient for removal of a manufacturer/shipper’s
medical gloves from Level 2 detention will generally consist of independent private laboratory
analyses, using FDA’s sampling plans and test methods, showing that a minimum of ten
consecutive medical gloves shipments meet the FDA acceptable quality criteria. For further
information on removal from detention refer to the “Request for Release from Detention Without
Physical Examination” section on page 10 of this document.
Important Note: (Flow Chart Outcome Box O1)
After DIOP receives adequate evidence, FDA may remove the
manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves from Level 2 detention. However, if
another shipment of medical gloves from this same manufacturer/shipper is found
to be defective during the remainder of the Cycle, FDA should consider its history
on Level 2 detention when making further decisions regarding detention of the
manufacturer/shipper’s imports. (See “Level 3 Detention” below.)

Level 3 Detention
Criteria for Level 3 Detention: (Flow Chart Decision Boxes D1, D2)
When DIOP receives a recommendation for detention, they should review
the manufacturer/shipper’s import history. If DIOP determines that there
is an ongoing Cycle and:
•

•

the manufacturer/shipper was listed on Import Alert #80-04, Level
2 Detention, during this Cycle but its surgeons’ or patient
examination gloves were removed from the import alert without
advancing to Level 3 Detention, or
the manufacturer/shipper is currently listed on Import Alert #8004, Level 2 Detention, and there is further evidence that its
surgeons’ gloves or patient examination gloves are adulterated,
such as a violative private laboratory (or FDA) analysis,

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

DIOP will notify CDRH. CDRH and DIOP will both review the
manufacturer/shipper’s import history to determine if the evidence supports
Level 3 detention.
Placement on Level 3 Detention: (Flow Chart Action Box L3)
If DIOP’s review determines that the recommendation supports detention under the Act due to
the appearance of a violation and that the Criteria for Level 3 Detention have been met, then the
manufacturer/shipper should be listed temporarily on Attachment A of Import Alert #80-04 with
three asterisks ("***") until CDRH completes its review of the supporting documents and other
relevant information. These documents may include, but are not limited to, results of FDA and
private laboratory sample analysis, previous import history, and the status of the current Cycle.
Firms attempting to import medical gloves that are in this temporary status may request entry of
individual shipments based on independent private laboratory testing, conducted in accordance
with 21 CFR § 800.20, which indicates the shipment is of acceptable quality.
Placement on Attachment B: (Flow Chart Outcome Box O2)
If the CDRH review finds that the supporting documents and other relevant information presents
the appearance that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, the manufacture,
packing, or storage of the device at the manufacturer/shipper’s facility do not conform to the
requirements of section 520(f), then future shipments of the medical gloves manufactured at that
facility may be refused admission pursuant to section 801(a)(1)). CDRH will then notify DIOP
that they should list that manufacturer/shipper’s facility on Attachment B of Import Alert #80-04.
At the same time, CDRH should notify the foreign manufacturer/shipper in writing that there is
an appearance of nonconformance to the requirements of section 520(f), and that future
shipments of the manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves may be refused admission in accordance
with section 801(a)(1) until the manufacturer/shipper provides adequate evidence to rebut this
appearance.
Removal from Level 3 Detention (Attachment B):
Test results showing that individual shipments of medical gloves meets FDA’s minimum
acceptable quality criteria generally will not be sufficient for release of individual shipments of
medical gloves listed in Level 3 Detention (Attachment B) nor will they be sufficient for
removal from Level 3 detention. A history of repeated shipments of defective medical gloves can
present the appearance of nonconformance with good manufacturing practices [section 520(f)].
Evidence showing that individual shipments of medical gloves are of acceptable quality, and
therefore, not adulterated under section 501(c), may not be adequate to dispel the appearance of
nonconformance with 520(f) because the medical gloves may have been produced under a
manufacturing system that does not conform to good manufacturing practices. The appearance
of failure to comply with the requirements of 520(f) provides an independent basis for refusal of
admission under section 801(a)(1).

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

To correct the appearance of violations underlying detention without physical examination for
medical gloves on Level 3 detention, a manufacturer should assess its manufacturing system and
correct any systemic problems that underlie the apparent nonconformance with good
manufacturing practices. It should demonstrate to FDA/CDRH that the medical gloves
produced at the facility listed on Attachment B are manufactured in accordance with the Quality
System regulation. Such evidence should include a FDA on-site inspection of the manufacturing
facilities that indicate conformance with the Quality System regulation, or a written certification
of conformance with the Quality System regulation provided by the manufacturer/shipper
together with the results of an independent audit performed by a qualified third party.
After the manufacturer/shipper demonstrates to CDRH that the apparent systemic manufacturing
problems have been corrected and that it is complying with section 520(f), CDRH will request
that DIOP remove the manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves from Level 3, Attachment B. The
manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves then will be placed on Attachment A of Import Alert #8004 with the statement: "[Firm name] was moved from Attachment B to Attachment A on [date],
as the result of an establishment inspection of the firm. Products from this firm remain subject to
DWPE. Districts should immediately report violative private laboratory results to DIOP
Operations and Policy Branch" to indicate they have been removed from Level 3, Attachment B,
but are now in an interim status pending submission of additional evidence to correct the
appearance of adulteration under section 501(c) caused by the past violative shipments. While
the manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves are in this interim detention status, FDA may detain
shipments of medical gloves without physical examination. However, firms may obtain entry of
individual shipments by presenting evidence to the FDA field office at the port of entry to rebut
the appearance of (501(c)) adulteration, such as independent private laboratory testing of
individual shipments to demonstrate that the surgeons’ and/or patient examination gloves meet
FDA’s acceptable quality criteria.
With sufficient evidence, the manufacturer/shipper’s products may be removed from this interim
status. Evidence sufficient for removal of a manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves from this
interim detention status will generally consist of independent private laboratory analyses using
FDA’s sampling plans and test methods, showing that a minimum of five consecutive surgeons’
or patient examination glove shipments meet the FDA acceptable quality criteria. Removal from
the interim detention status, subsequent to removal from Level 3, Attachment B, based on an
acceptable FDA or third party inspection, ends the manufacturer/shipper current Cycle. At this
point, a firm may request removal of its surgeons’ or patient examination gloves from the listing
on Import Alert #80-04 (and termination of the Cycle) as described in the “Request for Release
from Detention Without Physical Examination” section on page 10 of this document.
If a manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves are currently on the Import Alert #80-04 in
interim status and FDA receives further evidence of adulteration, such as a violative analysis
from an independent private laboratory (or FDA), the field office at the port of entry should
make a recommendation to DIOP for detention. If the DIOP review determines that the
recommendation supports detention under the Act due to the appearance of a violation, the
manufacturer/shipper should be listed on Attachment A of Import Alert #80-04 with a single
asterisk ("*") along with the date of listing. In this manner, the date on which the
manufacturer/shipper’s surgeons’or patient examination gloves are placed on Level 1
detention will initiate a new import surveillance Cycle. Likewise, if a Cycle has ended and a
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

manufacturer/shipper’s surgeons’ or patient examination gloves are removed from the Import
Alert, but a future shipment of surgeons’ or patient examination gloves from the same
manufacture/shipper is tested and found to be defective by FDA or an independent private
laboratory, the manufacture/shipper’s surgeons’ or patient examination gloves may again be
placed on Level 1, beginning a new Cycle. Once a new Cycle has begun, the import history
of the manufacturer/shipper’s surgeons’ or patient examination gloves prior to the beginning
of the new Cycle should not be taken into consideration for purposes of determining the
import detention level.

Request for Reconsideration of Detention Level
A firm who believes that its medical gloves have been inappropriately placed on Level 2 or
Level 3 detention may submit evidence to CDRH to rebut this placement. 2 For example, the
firm might present evidence that results of analyses indicating defects in its medical gloves were
actually caused by type 1 sampling errors.3 It might also present evidence that previous defective
shipments were found during a previously concluded Cycle, so that a new shipment of defective
medical gloves should result at most in placement on Level 1 detention and initiation of a new
Cycle. CDRH will review any such information submitted, in conjunction with the documents
relating to the analyses of the medical gloves in question and evaluate which level of detention,
if any, is appropriate.

Request for Release from Detention Without Physical
Examination
In order for the manufacturer/shipper’s medical gloves to be removed from Attachment A of
Import Alert #80-04,4 FDA should be provided with satisfactory results of sample analyses for a
number of consecutive shipments sufficient to demonstrate compliance with FDA requirements.
The documentation should consist of
•

documentation, including FDA entry numbers showing the FDA release of a number of
consecutive entries of the manufacturer’s devices sufficient to demonstrate compliance
with FDA requirements, (see “Removal from Level 1 Detention Without Physical
Examination” and “Removal from Level 2 Detention Without Physical Examination”)
and

•

test records (analytical worksheets) from independent qualified U.S. testing laboratories
using the FDA analytical worksheet form FDA 431 or equivalent. Testing performed at
the manufacturing facility or by private laboratories in the country of origin may not be

Firms who believe their medical gloves have been inappropriately placed on Level 1 Detention should contact
DIOP to attempt to rebut this placement.
3
Type 1 sampling error is the probability that a sampling plan for attributes will reject a lot when true percent
defective is equal to or less than (<) the Acceptable Quality Level (AQL), where the AQL is equal (=) to the percent
defective that a sampling plan for attributes will accept with probability equal (=) to 0.95.

Removal of medical gloves from Level 3, Attachment B, which results in the gloves being returned to listing on
Attachment A, is addressed above at pages 8-9.

acceptable due to the potential for rapid degradation of medical gloves during shipment
to the United States.
Firms may submit the appropriate documentation with a request for their medical gloves to be
removed from the Import Alert and from Detention without Physical Examination to the
following office in FDA:
Division of Import Operations and Policy (DIOP)
5600 Fishers Lane (HFC-170)
Rockville, Maryland 20857 USA
Phone: 301-443-6553 Fax: 301-594-0413
If FDA agrees that the results of sample analysis or other evidence submitted demonstrates
compliance of the manufacturer/shipper and medical gloves, then the manufacturer/shipper’s
medical gloves will be removed from the Import Alert and no longer subject to Detention
without Physical Examination.

Sampling
Sampling should be conducted according to the sampling plan in 21 CFR § 800.20 and the most
recent applicable sampling guidance documents, including Import Alert #80-04.
Only one brand and type of glove (powdered latex, powder-free vinyl, etc.) should be included in
a single test sample. However, all sizes of that glove type should be represented in the sample
collected to reflect the proportion of glove types in the shipment. Exact statistical representation
is not necessary. If a sample is found violative, all sizes should be detained.
If only one size, attempt to collect as many lot numbers as possible. For example, if during a
random sample collection three lot numbers are observed, the sample should represent all of the
lots as sub-samples within one sample. If the sample is found violative, all lots should be
detained.
When taking a sample of one type of a surgeons’ glove or patient examination glove from a
shipment that includes numerous boxes/cartons of that type, FDA sample collectors should
attempt to open several different cartons to obtain a representative sample.
