Product Labeling for Laparoscopic
Power Morcellators
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance contains recommendations concerning the content and format for certain labeling
information for laparoscopic power morcellators (LPMs).1 The recommendations in this
guidance reflect the state of the science and available technology regarding use of LPMs and are
being made in light of scientific information that suggests that the use of these devices
contributes to the dissemination and upstaging2 of an occult uterine malignancy in women
undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery for presumed fibroids. FDA is also recommending
that manufacturers incorporate into the labeling for these devices information providing greater
specificity regarding the risk of use as it relates to age, information regarding the risk of
spreading malignant and benign uterine tissue, and information regarding the use of LPM
containment systems. These labeling recommendations are intended to enhance, but not replace,
the physician-patient discussion of the benefits and risks of use of LPMs that uniquely pertain to
individual patients. FDA believes this effort will promote the safe and effective use of LPMs
when used for gynecologic surgeries.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.
1 This guidance uses the term “laparoscopic power morcellators” or “LPMs” in lieu of laparoscopic electromechanical

morcellators. FDA believes this terminology is understood and recognized both by clinicians and non-clinicians (e.g., American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Special Report: Power Morcellation and Occult Malignancy in Gynecologic Surgery
May 2014, available at: https://www.sgo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/ACOG_Statement.pdf and Society of Gynecologic
Oncology Position Statement: Morcellation December 2013, available at: https://www.sgo.org/resources/morcellation/).
2 A cancer’s stage is a reflection of the extent and/or severity of the disease and helps in determining the prognosis and
appropriate treatment options. “Upstaging” refers to an increase in the extent or severity of the disease in a given patient, in this
case due to the iatrogenic spread and growth of tumor within the peritoneal cavity.

II. Background
As the number of laparoscopic and minimally invasive procedures has increased with the
introduction of new surgical technologies and techniques, additional safety information has
become available regarding the use of LPMs. Discussions within the patient and clinical
communities, as well as the peer-reviewed medical literature, have raised awareness of the risk
of spreading unsuspected cancerous tissue beyond the uterus when LPMs are used during
gynecologic surgeries intended to treat benign fibroids. Numerous case reports and case series
have been published, and FDA has received Medical Device Reports (MDRs) that describe the
iatrogenic dissemination, implantation, and subsequent growth of unsuspected neoplastic tissue
within the peritoneal cavity following laparoscopic morcellation of uterine tissue believed to
contain fibroids based on pre-operative diagnosis.3, 4, 5 In 2014, FDA presented an analysis of
available information suggesting that the risk of an occult uterine sarcoma in a woman
undergoing surgical intervention for presumed fibroids is substantially higher than had
previously been assumed or reported.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 FDA’s analysis also suggested that

patient outcomes, including survival, may be significantly adversely impacted from this
upstaging of disease.3, 5, 15, 16, 17, 18
Patient selection and choice of surgical technique can reduce the risk of spreading cancer. While
unsuspected cancer can occur at any age, the prevalence of unsuspected cancer in women
undergoing hysterectomy for fibroids increases with age such that the benefit-risk profile of
using LPMs is worse in older women when compared to younger women.19, 20 Also, the surgical
technique of en bloc tissue removal eliminates the need to perform morcellation, thereby
reducing the risk of iatrogenic dissemination and upstaging of an occult sarcoma. A thorough
pre-operative screening should be conducted; however, it is important to note that no screening
procedure that can reliably detect sarcoma preoperatively has been identified. As part of shared
decision-making, physicians should discuss the risks and benefits of all relevant treatment
options with their patients prior to undergoing the procedure.
FDA considered the scientific information outlined above to represent a significant change to the
benefit-risk profile for these devices, prompting the issuance of a Safety Communication on
April 17, 201421 and the convening of the FDA’s Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel of
the Medical Devices Advisory Committee22 on July 10-11, 201423 to further discuss the use and
labeling of LPMs during gynecologic surgeries. FDA issued an immediately in effect guidance
document after considering the input of the Panel and other stakeholders, including comments
made during the Open Public Hearing portion of the Panel meeting.
Following issuance of the 2014 guidance document, FDA continued to consider new scientific
information and the input of stakeholders. FDA provided an updated analysis in 201724
considering new information that became available since the first analysis was performed. The
publications referenced in the updated analysis continue to provide evidence for differences in

patient outcomes between groups, including among groups exposed to power morcellation, nonpowered morcellation or no morcellation. Further, additional scientific information is available
that stratifies the risks of an undetected uterine cancer in women with presumed fibroids based
on age.25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
FDA also considered scientific information pertaining to the risk of spreading benign uterine
tissue beyond the uterus during gynecologic surgeries when LPMs are used.31, 32, 33 Parasitic
myomas and disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis, while benign, have been associated with
the need for additional surgery due to symptoms such as abdominal pain and distension. It is
important to note that a containment system cannot prevent all cases of benign tissue spread
during such procedures as some cases may occur spontaneously without morcellation.
Finally, FDA considered additional available mitigations for the spread of uterine tissue. Since
2014, FDA has provided marketing authorization for LPM containment systems intended to
isolate and contain tissue that is considered benign. These products have been shown, through
bench testing and simulated use testing, to contain such tissue during morcellation.34 A
containment system, however, cannot prevent against the potential spread of cancer that might
result from:
· Tissue that spreads due to manipulation of the tissue before it is placed into the tissue
containment system; or
· Cancer that may have already spread through the blood, lymphatic system or fallopian
tubes (transtubal transport) before the surgical procedure.
For these reasons, FDA is updating its recommendations, as originally described in the 2014
guidance document, concerning the content and format of certain labeling information for LPMs.
Specifically, FDA is recommending that manufacturers incorporate into the labeling for these
devices information providing greater specificity regarding the risk of use as it relates to age,
information regarding the risk of spreading benign uterine tissue, and information regarding the
use of LPM containment systems.

III. Scope
This guidance provides recommendations concerning the content and format of certain labeling
information for LPMs used for gynecologic surgeries. LPMs may include general indications for
use (e.g., laparoscopic procedures) or specific indications for use (e.g., laparoscopic gynecologic
procedures). This guidance applies to LPMs with either a general indication or a specific
gynecologic indication, as either may be used in gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. This
guidance applies to LPMs regardless of morcellation mechanism (e.g., electromechanical,
radiofrequency).
This guidance does not apply to LPMs specifically indicated only for non-gynecologic surgery. It
also does not apply to hysteroscopic morcellators, which have a different principle of operation.
FDA believes that, when used in accordance with current indications and instructions for use,
hysteroscopic morcellators do not pose the same risk as the devices addressed in this guidance
because any sarcomatous tissue present does not enter the peritoneal cavity.
This guidance is not intended to include a complete listing of all labeling components for LPMs
used for gynecologic surgery. Rather, this guidance contains recommendations regarding the
inclusion of certain information in LPM labeling that FDA believes is important to the safe and
effective use of LPMs in gynecologic surgery. Accurate product labeling for LPMs and effective
communication of that labeling are important to help ensure that physicians and patients are
aware of the risks associated with the use of LPMs in gynecologic surgery, including the
dissemination of malignant tissue and potential clinical outcomes associated with the
laparoscopic morcellation of occult uterine malignancy. FDA believes that the physician and
patient information discussed in this guidance should be included in labeling under sections
502(a), 201(n), and 502(f)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). FDA
recommends that manufacturers implement the labeling recommendations discussed herein35 and
follow them in labeling submitted with future 510(k) submissions.

IV. Labeling Components
FDA recommends that the labeling of LPMs with a general indication or a specific gynecologic
indication include a boxed warning, contraindications, and warnings regarding the risk of use as
it relates to age, spreading malignant and benign uterine tissue, and the use of LPM containment
systems. This section contains FDA’s format and content recommendations for these
components, and to help illustrate, FDA has provided examples in each subsection.

A.

Boxed Warning

FDA believes that a boxed warning should be part of the labeling materials for LPMs. In general,
boxed warnings are noticeable and easy to read and understand, and FDA believes a boxed
warning would be particularly useful in communicating the risks that have been identified in the
35 A manufacturer with an existing 510(k) clearance should: 1) add the information to their labeling; 2) submit both the current

labeling and revised labeling to CDRH; and 3) provide updated labeling to purchasers for LPMs that have already been
distributed. In addition, FDA does not intend to object if such labeling changes are submitted as an “add-to-file” to the existing
510(k) rather than as a new 510(k).

5

scientific information discussed above. FDA therefore recommends that a boxed warning
generally inform physicians, and recommend that physicians share with patients, that:
· Uterine tissue may contain unsuspected cancer; and
· The use of LPM during fibroid surgery may spread cancer and decrease the long-term
survival rate of patients.
An example of a boxed warning that follows this recommendation is below.
WARNING: Uterine tissue may contain unsuspected cancer. The use of
laparoscopic power morcellators during fibroid surgery may spread cancer
and decrease the long-term survival of patients. This information should be
shared with patients when considering surgery with the use of these devices.

B.

Contraindications and Other Warnings

In addition to the boxed warning, FDA also believes that the labeling of LPMs should include
contraindications and warnings highlighting certain key information regarding the risks of use of
LPMs in gynecologic surgeries. We recommend the labeling for LPMs generally inform
physicians, and recommend that physicians share with patients, that:
· LPMs are contraindicated in gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be
morcellated is known or suspected to contain malignancy;
· LPMs are contraindicated for removal of uterine tissue containing suspected fibroids
in patients who are post-menopausal or over 50 years of age, or candidates for en bloc
tissue removal through the vagina or via a mini-laparotomy incision;
· The risk of occult cancer, including uterine sarcoma, increases with age, particularly
in women over 50 years of age;
· Uncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of benign
uterine tissue, i.e., parasitic myomas and disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis,
potentially requiring additional surgeries; and
· LPMs should only be used with a containment system. The containment system
should be compatible with the LPM.
Examples of labeling statements that follow these recommendations are below.
CONTRAINDICATION: Laparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated in
gynecologic surgery in which the tissue to be morcellated is known or suspected to
contain malignancy.
CONTRAINDICATION: Laparoscopic power morcellators are contraindicated for
removal of uterine tissue containing suspected fibroids in patients who are:
· post-menopausal or over 50 years of age, or
· candidates for en bloc tissue removal through the vagina or via a mini-laparotomy
incision.
WARNING: The risk of occult cancer, including uterine sarcoma, increases with age,

particularly in women over 50 years of age. This information should be shared with
patients when considering surgery with the use of these devices.
WARNING: Uncontained power morcellation has been associated with the spread of
benign uterine tissue, i.e., parasitic myomas and disseminated peritoneal
leiomyomatosis, potentially requiring additional surgeries.
WARNING: Laparoscopic power morcellators should only be used with a containment
system. The containment system should be compatible with the laparoscopic power
morcellator.
