Effective September 19, 2023, the FDA is converting the Accreditation Scheme for Conformity 
Assessment program from a pilot to a permanent program. This transition is authorized by the 
Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022 (MDUFA V). This guidance was developed and 
issued prior to the enactment of MDUFA V. FDA is assessing how to revise this guidance to 
represent our current thinking on this topic, including the incorporation of best practices gained 
from the pilot phase of the Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment program. For more 
information, please contact the ASCA Program at ASCA@fda.hhs.gov.

Devices – Standards Specific 
Information for the Accreditation 
Scheme for Conformity Assessment 
(ASCA) Pilot Program 
 
Guidance for Industry, Accreditation 
Bodies, Testing Laboratories, and 
Food and Drug Administration Staff 
 
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA 
or Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding 
on FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements 
of the applicable statutes and regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the 
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.  
I. 
Introduction 
This guidance provides information on how the Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices 
standards are incorporated into the Pilot Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment 
Program (hereafter referred to as the ASCA Pilot). The ASCA Pilot is described in FDA’s 
guidance The Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot Program.1 
 
For the edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) included in the ASCA Pilot, see 
the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 For more information regarding use of 
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA’s guidance 
Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical 
Devices3 and Standards Development and the Use of Standards in Regulatory Submissions

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities.  Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and 
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory 
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that 
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.   
II. Scope 
This guidance includes the following: 
 
• A list of the FDA-recognized consensus standards and test methods included in the 
ASCA Pilot for biocompatibility testing of medical devices; 
• The program specifications for the FDA-recognized consensus standards and test 
methods in the ASCA Pilot for biocompatibility testing of medical devices; and 
• The recommended premarket submission contents specific to FDA-recognized 
consensus standards and test methods for biocompatibility testing of medical devices 
when testing is conducted by an ASCA-accredited testing laboratory. 
 
FDA’s guidance The Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot 
Program describes how accreditation bodies, testing laboratories, device manufacturers, and 
FDA staff participate in the ASCA Pilot as well as how FDA-recognized consensus standards 
and test methods are selected and how program specifications are developed.  
 
Please see FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, “Biological 
evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management 
process”5 for recommendations on biocompatibility testing to support a premarket 
submission. The ASCA Pilot for biocompatibility testing of medical devices does not include 
certain types of devices that require customized sample preparation and/or testing 
methodologies, or absorbable and in situ polymerizing devices, liquid devices, creams, gels, 
hydrogel devices, and devices containing nanomaterials.  
 
III. List of FDA-Recognized Consensus Standards and 
Test Methods in the ASCA Pilot for Biocompatibility 
Testing of Medical Devices  
Biological evaluation assesses the biocompatibility-related risks of medical devices with 
direct and/or indirect contact with human tissue. When biocompatibility testing is needed as 
part of a premarket submission to FDA to address biocompatibility-related risks, the selected, 
cross-cutting biological evaluation standards listed below are relevant to many manufacturers 
and the device types are of significant public health importance.

The extent of FDA recognition (complete or partial) is provided in the Supplemental 
Information Sheet (SIS) for each standard listed in the 
FDA Recognized Consensus 
Standards Database
.

 We support the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We 
encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable, 
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for 
equivalency to an animal test method. See generally:

IV. Accreditation and Assessment of Testing Laboratories 
by ASCA-Recognized Accreditation Bodies 
A. 
Scope of Assessments 
Section 7 of ISO/IEC 17011: Conformity assessment – Requirements for accreditation bodies 
accrediting conformity assessment bodies (hereafter referred to as “ISO/IEC 17011”) 
describes processes by which accreditation bodies assess testing laboratories. In order to 
maintain conformance to ISO/IEC 17011, an accreditation body assesses a sample of the 
scope of accreditation of its accredited testing laboratories at least every two years.9 When 
assessing a testing laboratory under the ASCA Pilot, an accreditation body is expected to 
assess all (and not a sample of) biological evaluation standards and test methods. That is, in 
the ASCA Pilot, ASCA-recognized accreditation bodies are expected to assess all (and not a 
sample) of the biological evaluation of medical devices standards and test methods in order 
to ensure competence across the testing laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation.  
B. 
ASCA Program Specifications for Biocompatibility 
Testing of Medical Devices 
The ASCA program specifications in this section provide expectations for the accreditation 
of testing laboratories for the biocompatibility testing of medical devices under the ASCA 
Pilot.  ASCA-recognized accreditation bodies, following the processes of ISO/IEC 17011, 
accredit testing laboratories to all relevant elements of ISO/IEC 17025: 2017: General 
requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories (hereafter referred to 
as “ISO/IEC 17025”) as well as the ASCA program specifications identified in this section. 
In addition, all testing should be conducted considering the recommendations in the CDRH 
Biocompatibility policy as described in FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 
10993-1, “Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a 
risk management process.” For readability and ease of reference, the numbering and 
nomenclature (including the term “requirements”)10  below correspond to the numbering and 
nomenclature of clauses/subclauses in ISO/IEC 17025.   
 
ISO/IEC 17025 Section 4 “General requirements” 
4.1 Impartiality 
If any services, such as consulting, design, or research, are offered by the testing laboratory, 
it agrees to have a policy and procedure for maintaining impartiality through separation of 
those services from its testing activities. 
A device manufacturer’s internal testing laboratory agrees to have policies and procedures 
that specifically ensure and protect the impartiality of the laboratory to test or otherwise 
                                                 
9 See 7.9.3 of ISO/IEC 17011: 2017: Conformity assessment – Requirements for accreditation bodies 
accrediting conformity assessment bodies. 
10 Some definitions within voluntary consensus standards refer to “requirements.” FDA’s references to them for 
the ASCA Pilot do not make them legal or regulatory requirements unless specifically identified as such.

criteria, steps, and approvals for extending the calibration interval of an instrument. 
d) The testing laboratory agrees to have procedures to examine the effects of equipment 
operation outside the equipment tolerances or study specified limits (e.g., temperature 
excursions) on test results. The procedures identify the personnel responsible for such 
examination of the equipment (e.g., technicians) and determination of acceptability 
with respect to test validity (e.g., study directors/toxicologists), specify their 
responsibilities, and provide the steps for determining if the equipment variation 
would impact the study results, including:  
• Determining whether the effects are unacceptable (including the accept/reject 
criteria);  
• Identifying the conducted tests affected;  
• Analyzing the results impacted for these particular tests; and  
• Determining whether retesting is required. 
6.5 Metrological traceability 
a) Testing laboratories agree to use specified methods and/or standards that clearly 
describe the following: 
• Calibration to three decimal places for spectrophotometer absorbance readings 
for hemolysis and complement activation, and  
• Particle ranges for calibration of coulter counter use for cell counting.  
b) If test-specified positive, negative, and/or reference controls are no longer able to 
distinguish between positive and negative responses, the testing laboratory agrees to 
have procedures to qualify new controls. 
c) The testing laboratory agrees that controls (positive/negative/reagent, if applicable) 
will meet assay-specific acceptance criteria. 
d) The testing laboratory agrees that, when concurrent positive controls are not 
conducted with the test article (i.e., sensitization testing), biannual testing (i.e., within 
3 months of the test article) will be conducted to confirm the ability of the test system 
to detect a positive sensitization response. If it is determined that the periodic positive 
control is no longer valid, all testing conducted after the last validated positive control 
run cannot be submitted as part of the ASCA Pilot.

8.1 Options  
 
Regardless of the option selected (i.e., Option A or Option B), the testing laboratory agrees to 
maintain an Index of SOPs and any relevant ASCA test-related documents (e.g., SOPs, work 
instructions, master protocols, test-specific protocols, data collection worksheets, training 
information) applicable to any biological evaluation of medical device standards or test 
methods. 
 
V. Premarket Submission Contents for FDA-Recognized 
Consensus Standards and Test Methods in the ASCA Pilot 
for Biocompatibility Testing of Medical Devices 
FDA recommends that the following be included in any regulatory submission that contains 
biocompatibility testing conducted by an ASCA-accredited testing laboratory.  
A. 
Cover Letter 
FDA’s recommendations regarding the content to be included in a cover letter for a 
premarket submission containing testing results from an ASCA-accredited testing laboratory 
are provided in FDA’s guidance The Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment 
(ASCA) Pilot Program.   
B. 
Declaration of Conformity 
Section IV.A. of FDA’s guidance Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in 
Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices13 recommends contents for a declaration of 
conformity (DOC) to an FDA-recognized consensus standard.  For biocompatibility testing 
from an ASCA-accredited testing laboratory, FDA recommends the device manufacturer 
include the following additional items in the DOC:  
• Date(s) the testing was conducted 
• Location(s) where the testing was conducted 
• Confirmation that the FDA-recognized consensus standards (and specific test 
methods) used during testing were within the laboratory’s scope of ASCA 
Accreditation and not subject to any temporary labeling constraints as a result of a 
suspension of ASCA Accreditation at the time testing was conducted. If the relevant 
standard (and specific test method) was impacted by a suspension of ASCA 
Accreditation, the DOC should include an explanation of how this suspension may or 
may not affect the testing results.   
• Limitations on the validity of the DOC:

• How the test article compares with the device provided in this premarket 
submission (including selection of “representative” devices/portions)14  
• How any concerns communicated by the test lab were resolved  
• How any observations and/or degradations during testing were resolved 
• Whether any adverse or unusual findings as described in the list in Section V.C.  
occurred and, if so, rationale for acceptability 
An example DOC is provided in Appendix A of this guidance. This example provides one 
approach to how a single DOC might contain testing to FDA-recognized consensus standards 
included and not included in a testing laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation.  
C. 
Supplemental Documentation 
An ASCA summary test report is recommended for all testing conducted under the ASCA 
Pilot. Example ASCA summary test reports are provided in Appendices B- J of this 
guidance. Note that the ASCA-accredited testing laboratory provides the ASCA summary 
test report to the device manufacturer who then includes it with its own DOC in a premarket 
submission to FDA. Depending on the information provided in the DOC or the ASCA 
summary test report, FDA may or may not need to review the complete test report for 
biocompatibility testing,15 and the testing laboratory and/or device manufacturer may also be 
requested to provide a rationale to support a decision on a premarket submission. 
 
During the ASCA Pilot, FDA generally will accept determinations from ASCA-accredited 
testing laboratories (i.e., test results) when the standard and test methods are within the 
testing laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation at the time of testing. Circumstances where 
FDA may request and review additional information related to testing from an ASCA-
accredited testing laboratory are described in the bulleted points of Section XIII. A of the 
guidance titled The Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot 
Program.  
 
The ASCA Pilot processes and policies enhance confidence in testing results only when 
specific test methods and acceptance criteria are used. For example, FDA reviews a copy of 
the Index of SOPs and any relevant ASCA test-related documents (e.g., SOPs, work 
instructions, master protocols, test-specific protocols, data collection worksheets, training 
information) for testing laboratories that apply for a scope of ASCA Accreditation that 
includes biocompatibility testing. This review provides FDA an understanding of how testing 
is conducted, thereby providing confidence in the competence of ASCA-accredited testing 
laboratories. Depending on the specific device or intended use, deviations or amendments 
relative to the testing documentation submitted to FDA during the ASCA Accreditation 
                                                 
14 Please see FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, "Biological evaluation of medical 
devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process" for considerations regarding the use 
of medical devices in their final finished form or a representative test article for biocompatibility testing.” 
15 A complete test report for biocompatibility testing is described in Attachment E of FDA’s guidance Use of 
International Standard ISO 10993-1, “Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing 
within a risk management process”

application process16 may be appropriate. In such cases, FDA recommends a complete test 
report be included in the premarket submission.  FDA also recommends a complete test 
report be included in the premarket submission for specific circumstances when (based on 
FDA’s review experience) results may indicate a potential concern; these cases are noted 
below and in each example ASCA summary test report (Refer to Appendices B-J). 
 
To allow FDA to determine if any additional information is needed, and whether the ASCA 
summary test report was insufficient for evaluation, a complete test report (in addition to the 
ASCA summary test report) is recommended for biocompatibility testing of medical devices 
in the cases outlined below.  
• If test article was prepared per the ASCA Test Article Prep SOP specified on the 
ASCA summary test report (Refer to Appendices B-J of this guidance) with 
deviations/amendments (e.g., filtering, extract manipulation, pH adjustment) 
• If extraction solvent, ratio, or conditions other than those specially called out in the 
example ASCA summary test report (Refer to Appendices B-J of this guidance) were 
used  
• If there were any changes in color/turbidity or particles in the test article and/or 
extract OR there was swelling/degradation of the test article 
• If testing was conducted per the  ASCA Test Method SOP specified on the ASCA 
summary test report (Refer to Appendices B-J of this guidance) and per 21 CFR 58 
with deviations/amendments.

results for any of the sodium chloride control sites in any animal or results 
greater than 1 for any of the oil control sites in any animal at any timepoint.  
• If adverse clinical findings or animal deaths occurred.  
• For cytotoxicity – MEM Elution (ISO 10993-5) testing: if there were non-zero results 
for the test article, vehicle control or negative control, or if there were results less 
than 3 for the positive control at any timepoint. 
• For dermal irritation (ISO 10993-10):  
• If direct contact was used and the test article was not the entire final finished 
device or a representative sample selection per the ASCA Test Article Prep 
SOP 
• If the primary irritation score is calculated using different timepoints besides 
24hrs, 48hrs and 72hrs, if there were any non-zero test or control (e.g., direct 
contact control: gauze; extract test control: sodium chloride or oil) results at 
any time point. 
• If adverse clinical findings or animal deaths occurred.  
• For guinea pig maximization sensitization (ISO 10993-10 and ASTM F720): 
                                                 
16 Testing that includes deviations (and for which a DOC would not be appropriate) does not meet the criteria 
for inclusion in the ASCA Pilot as described in Section XII.B. of the guidance titled The Accreditation Scheme 
for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot Program.

 The complete test report should be included with ASCA Summary Test Report during the ASCA Pilot if the 
primary irritation score is calculated using different timepoints besides 24h, 48h and 72h, if there were any non-
zero test or control (e.g., direct contact control: gauze; extract test control: sodium chloride or oil) results at any 
time point.   
49
 We support the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We 
encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable, 
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for 
equivalency to an animal test method. However, these alternative methods would not be eligible for the ASCA 
pilot. See generally: https://www.fda.gov/science-research/advancing-regulatory-science/vi-modernizing-safety-

 Since deviations/amendments were noted, the complete test report should be included with ASCA Summary 
Test Report during the ASCA Pilot (depending on the information provided, FDA may or may not request to 
review the complete test report). Test Laboratory/Manufacturer may also be requested to provide a rationale to 
support a regulatory decision.

 The complete test report should be included with ASCA Summary Test Report during the ASCA Pilot if test 
medium, negative, positive, and comparator controls did not perform as expected, or there was a statistically 
significant increase in SC5b-9 for test article compared to negative or comparator controls.
