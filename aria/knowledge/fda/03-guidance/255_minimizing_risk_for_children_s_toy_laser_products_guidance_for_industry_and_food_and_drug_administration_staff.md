Minimizing Risk for Children’s Toy
Laser Products
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This guidance is intended to inform manufacturers of laser products, FDA staff and the public
of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH) current thinking on the safety of
children’s toy laser products. Lasers with outputs above certain levels that are operated in an
unsafe and uncontrolled manner may cause injury to the user and/or others within range of
the laser beam. This is a particular concern for lasers intended for entertainment purposes,
especially when intended to be used as toys by children.
Federal law requires that, other than for certain exceptions, laser products manufactured or
assembled after August 1, 1976 must be in compliance with the Federal Performance
Standards for Laser Products (21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1040.10 and 1040.11).
At present FDA regulations do not specifically identify what constitutes children’s toy laser
products. In June 2013, FDA issued a proposed rule that proposed to define children’s toy
laser products and require them to be within the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) Class 1 emission limit. 1 While this rulemaking process is ongoing, CDRH
recommends that manufacturers keep children’s toy laser products within the FDA Class I or
IEC Class 1 emission limits in order to minimize the risk they pose to users and/or others in
range of the laser beam, including the vulnerable population for whom they are intended. 2

See proposed 21 CFR 1040.10(b)(1), (2) and 1040.11(d) at 78 FR 37723 (June 24, 2013).
For those children’s toy laser products that meet the definition of a “demonstration laser product”
or “surveying, leveling, or alignment laser product,” CDRH will not object to compliance with the

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
This guidance, in question and answer format, is derived from questions CDRH has received
from persons in industry, the public, and other stakeholders.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Children’s Toy Laser Products
1. Question: Why is CDRH concerned about the use of laser products?
Answer: FDA has statutory authority to regulate radiation-emitting electronic products
pursuant to sections 531 through 542 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C
Act) (21 U.S.C. §§ 360hh - 360ss). Federal law requires that, other than for certain
exceptions, laser products manufactured or assembled after August 1, 1976 must be in
compliance with the Federal Performance Standards for Laser Products (21 CFR 1040.10 and
1040.11). Lasers products may be used in unsafe or uncontrolled ways and can cause injury
to the user and/or others in range of the laser beam. Accordingly, FDA requires that
manufacturers of these products incorporate safety features, warnings, and instructions for
safe use(see 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11).
2. Question: What types of lasers fall within the scope of this guidance document?
Answer: Any toy that constitutes, incorporates or is intended to incorporate a laser or laser
system is a laser product. See 21 CFR 1040.10(b)(21). As stated above, laser products are
subject to the Federal Performance Standards for Laser Products contained in 21 CFR
1040.10 and 1040.11. For purposes of this guidance, “children’s toy laser product” means a
product primarily used as a toy that is manufactured, designed, intended or promoted for
novelty or visual entertainment use by children under 14 years of age.
This definition is intended to exclude laser products that are used in professional or academic
settings that may be used by children (for example, laser printers, CD players, educational
and science kits). This guidance provides CDRH’s current thinking on what constitutes

International Electrotechnical Commission Class 1 emission limit (set forth in IEC 60825-1:2007).
To that end, this guidance supersedes in part the policy set forth in the Guidance on Laser Products –
Conformance with IEC 60825-1 and IEC 60601-2-22 (Laser Notice No. 50) (June 2007), available at
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../ucm094366.pdf, which will cease to be effective
by its own terms upon the effective date of amendments to the regulations applicable to laser
products. However, because IEC Classes 1M and 2M do not have comparable analogs in FDA’s
classification system, manufacturers should not conform to the parameters for IEC Classes 1M or 2M
unless they also comply with FDA’s performance standards for laser products.

children’s toy laser products, as well as specific safety recommendations for their
manufacture and labeling.
When assessing whether a laser product is a children’s toy laser product within the scope of
this document, CDRH considers the following information:
•

•
•

Promotion, advertising, labeling, packaging, and product graphics – For example,
advertisements, especially in children’s publications or other media, showing a
child playing with the product or otherwise suggesting the product is intended for
a children’s novelty or child’s visual entertainment use, would generally indicate
it is a children’s toy laser product. Pictures on packages or labels showing play
with the product, especially when cartoon characters make the product attractive
to children, would also generally indicate it is a children’s toy laser product.
Location of product sales – For example, sales in toy stores or other settings
specifically geared towards children’s entertainment, would generally indicate it is
a children’s toy laser product.
Purpose of the product – Features or the nature of the product itself may indicate it
is intended for use by children.

CDRH may use this and other information to identify a children’s toy laser product, and
engage manufacturers in discussions or investigations related to product safety.
The following are examples of children’s toy laser products:
•
•
•
•
•

Lasers mounted on toy guns that can be used for “aiming”;
Spinning tops that project laser beams while they spin;
Hand-held lasers used during play as “light sabers”;
Dancing laser beams projected from a stationary column with bright colors or
pictures on the box that might appeal to children; and
Lasers intended for entertainment that create optical effects in an open room with
bright colors or pictures on the box that might appeal to children.

3. Question: Why is CDRH concerned in particular about children’s toy laser
products?
Answer: CDRH believes that toys containing lasers and lasers marketed as toys are
particularly susceptible to being used in an unsafe or uncontrolled manner. All children’s toy
laser products should “minimize risk” (refer to Q&A #4). Due to the nature of children’s toy
laser products, the dangers of these products may not be evident to children or the adults
supervising them. Retinal injuries caused by laser light may go unnoticed and unreported in
part because the retinal injuries may not be evident. Lasers can also cause skin burns.

4. Question: What is meant by “minimize risk” as used in this guidance?
Answer: A children's toy laser product in which the levels of laser radiation or light output
exceed the emission levels for Class I as defined in the Federal Performance Standard for
Laser Products ("FDA Class I") (21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11) or for Class 1 as defined by
the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) ("IEC Class 1") under conditions of
operation, maintenance, service, failure, or breakage do not "minimize risk" to users.
Because children’s toy laser products are not specifically identified in the Federal
Performance Standard, manufacturers may not think they have to comply with the current
standard, and consequently certain children’s toys may contain lasers with power limits that
pose a significant risk to eyesight. As discussed above, FDA published a proposed rule that
includes a new section to specifically identify what constitutes children’s toy laser products.
See 78 FR 37723, 37741 (June 24, 2013). This new section, as proposed, includes the
definition of a children’s toy laser product and requires that the emissions of children’s toy
laser products not exceed the IEC Class 1 limit.
5. Question: Why does CDRH believe the emission limit of IEC Class 1 sufficiently
limits risk for children’s toy laeser products?
Answer: CDRH recognizes that IEC Class 1 has a higher power limit than FDA Class I.
CDRH has determined that lasers with emissions under either the FDA Class I or IEC Class 1
limit sufficiently minimize risk, even when these products are used by children. As stated in
IEC 60825-1:2007, Annex C.2, IEC Class 1 lasers are “Laser products that are safe during
use, including long-term direct intrabeam viewing, even when exposure occurs while using
optical viewing instruments (eye loupes or binoculars).” Output levels in excess of the IEC
Class 1 limit are not necessary for the intended functions of toys – toys with lasers under this
limit produce the intended visible laser light while still sufficiently minimizing risk.
6. Question: Does CDRH recommend a Class 1 label for children’s toy laser product
within IEC Class 1 limits?
Answer: Yes. IEC Class 1 designation labeling is recommended because CDRH believes the
presence of this designation in the labeling would clearly advise purchasers that the products
sufficiently “minimize risk” (refer to Q&A #4) and have been certified as such by the
manufacturer. Such designation would indicate that the product is not in a higher emission
level laser class, and that the safety controls and warnings required for higher class lasers are
unnecessary for the product.
7. Question: For toys that contain parts that emit laser light, does the entire toy need to
be certified?
Answer: The entire toy needs to be certified as a laser product, unless the part or parts of the
toy that can emit laser light are removable and can emit laser light independently when
separated from the other parts of the toy, in which case only those laser-emitting part or parts
would need to be certified. For example, a laser gunsight that is detachable from a toy gun is

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
itself subject to applicable laser safety regulations and must be certified because it is a
removable laser system (see 21 CFR 1040.10(c)(2)). The requirement for a certification is
based on the removable laser’s class, which is based on the accessible emission of laser
radiation when the laser is removed. 21 CFR 1040.10(c)(2).
8. Question: Toys are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).
Why is CDRH providing this guidance when the CPSC already regulates toys?
Answer: Toys may be subject to laws administered by the CPSC, such as the Consumer
Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 2051 - 2089), as amended by the Consumer Product Safety
Improvements Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110–314, 122 Stat. 3016 (2008)), and the Federal
Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C.§§ 1261 - 1278a). FDA has statutory authority to
regulate radiation-emitting electronic products, such as laser products, pursuant to sections
531 through 542 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 360hh - 360ss). In the case of children’s
toy laser products, CPSC and FDA authorities complement one another to minimize the risk
from using these products and facilitate compliance by manufacturers.
