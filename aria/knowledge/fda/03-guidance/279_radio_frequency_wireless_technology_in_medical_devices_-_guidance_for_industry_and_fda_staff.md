Radio Frequency Wireless Technology in
Medical Devices
Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

1. Introduction
FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry and FDA staff in identifying and
appropriately addressing specific considerations related to the incorporation and integration of
radio frequency (RF) wireless technology in medical devices. There has been rapid growth in
medical devices that incorporate RF wireless technology due to the expansion of this
technology. With the increasing use of RF wireless medical devices, continuing innovation
and advancements in wireless technology, and an increasingly crowded RF environment, RF
wireless technology considerations should be taken into account to help provide for the safe
and effective use of these medical devices. This guidance highlights and discusses RF wireless
technology considerations that can have an effect on the safe and effective use of medical
devices. These considerations include the selection of wireless technology, quality of service,
coexistence, security, and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Consideration of these areas
can help provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for medical devices that
incorporate RF wireless technology, and are supplementary to other device-specific guidances
or guidelines.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2. Scope
This guidance document addresses considerations that may affect the safe and effective use of
medical devices that incorporate RF wireless technology (also referred to as wireless medical
devices), including the selection of wireless technology, quality of service, coexistence,
security, and EMC. These issues should be considered for all medical devices that
incorporate RF wireless technology, such as Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS);
Medical Device Radiocommunication Service (MedRadio) (including the former Medical
Implant Communications Service (MICS)) as well as Medical Micropower Network (MNN)
and Medical Body Area Network (MBAN); cellular communication chipsets; and RF
identification (RFID) products. Such RF wireless technologies operate under a grant of
certification and/or issuance of a license from the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC).
This guidance also provides recommendations for information to be included in FDA
premarket submissions for medical devices and device systems that incorporate RF wireless
technology. Requirements by other agencies are not covered within this document, although
we note that requirements established by the FCC may be applicable.
The recommendations in this guidance are intended for RF wireless medical devices
including those that are implanted, worn on the body or other external wireless medical
devices intended for use in hospitals, homes, clinics, clinical laboratories, and blood
establishments. Both wireless induction-based devices and radiated RF technology device
systems are within the scope of this guidance. The use of RF energy to generate images of
the internal structures of the body such as in magnetic resonance imaging systems is outside
the scope of this guidance document.
See Appendix A for a glossary of key terms associated with RF wireless technology and
wireless medical devices that have been adapted from the IEC 60050-161 International
Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV) and other sources.

3. Considerations for Design, Testing, and Use of Wireless
Medical Devices
Designers and manufacturers of wireless medical devices should consider the ability of their
devices to function properly in the intended use environments where other RF wireless
technologies will likely be located. In the design, testing, and use of wireless medical
devices, the correct, timely, and secure transmission of medical data and information is
important for the safe and effective use of both wired and wireless medical devices and
device systems. This is especially important for medical devices that perform critical
functions such as those that are life-supporting or life-sustaining. For wirelessly enabled

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

medical devices, risk management should include considerations for robust RF wireless
design, testing, deployment, and maintenance throughout the life cycle of the product. 1
Examples of potentially problematic wireless-related hazards and effects include:
•

poorly characterized or poorly utilized wireless systems (e.g., wireless networks);

•

lost, corrupted, or time-delayed transmissions, and degradations in wireless
transmissions including when caused by competing wireless signals or
electromagnetic interference (EMI) to the medical device or its wireless
transmissions;

•

lack or compromise of wireless security; and

•

potential misuse of a wireless medical device because of lack of or inadequate
instructions for use.

As part of a comprehensive quality system under 21 CFR Part 820, medical device
manufacturers must manage risks including those associated with RF wireless technology
that is incorporated into the medical device or device system. ISO 14971 Second edition
2007-03-01 Medical devices—Application of risk management to medical devices can be a
useful tool in risk analysis and risk management. 2 Because there are risks associated with RF
wireless systems, we recommend that you carefully consider which device functions should
be made wireless and which device functions should employ wired connectivity.
FDA recommends that you address known safety issues involving RF wireless technologies
early in the device design and development process. Safety issues might be discovered
during the design and development process for which risk mitigation measures might be
necessary to ensure an overall acceptable level of risk. FDA also recommends that risk
acceptability criteria be based on information about the device and its intended use,
including, but not limited to, applicable standards, accepted design practices, and experience
with similar devices. For example, FDA recommends that you use reports of EMI-related
events and other relevant experience when estimating probability of occurrence as part of risk
analysis. In addition, where multiple alarms are incorporated into a device or device system
via wireless links, we recommend that you address priorities for accessing the wireless
system, and priorities related to the function of the wireless technology itself.
In validating the design of your wireless medical device under 21 CFR 820.30(g), you must
include risk analysis of RF wireless communications and control functions as part of your
design validation. Because it is possible for an electromagnetic disturbance (EMD) to affect
important medical device functions, mitigation measures for some risks could aid the device
operator in recognizing a hazardous situation and taking action to prevent harm. For

design control requirements under the quality systems regulation. 21 CFR 820.30(g).

example, design validation might reveal that steps to reestablish an RF wireless connection
such as re-initialization could compromise safety under some use conditions.
When considering possible adverse outcomes, you should also consider risks to other devices
and patients whose wireless connections might suffer from, or be the source of, interference.
In addition, you should consider the potential impact of unintended interference and
purposeful attempts to disrupt a wireless medical device or an associated device network’s
functionality.
The following considerations should be appropriately tailored to the selected RF wireless
technology, and the intended use and use environments for your medical device. The
following discussion of these considerations includes information dealing with general and
design considerations, risk management, verification and validation, and information shared
with users. Note that access to information (e.g., user manual, other device labeling)
concerning these key considerations plays an important role in users being able to properly
set up, use and maintain medical devices and device systems with wireless technology.

a. Selection and performance of wireless technology
When selecting the type(s) of wireless technology, it is vital to determine and understand
the medical device functions that are to be wirelessly enabled and the intended use of the
medical device. The medical device functions and intended uses should be appropriately
matched with the wireless technology’s capabilities and expected performance. In
addition, issues relating to the integrity of data transmitted wirelessly (including latency
and throughput, detection, correction, and corruption control and/or prevention) and
safety-related requirements of your device should be considered. Potential risks that can
affect consistent and timely wireless medical device functions include data corruption or
loss and interference from simultaneous transmitters in a given location, which can
increase latency and transmitted signal error rates. For wireless medical devices and
device systems, error control processes should be incorporated to assure the integrity of
data transmitted wirelessly and to manage potential risks related to maximum delay of
data transfer. Parameters such as bit error rate, packet loss, and signal-to-noise ratio are
useful tools in assessing and assuring data integrity and timeliness of data transmission.
In addition, the device performance and specifications related to the wirelessly enabled
medical device functions should be considered in choosing the appropriate RF wireless
technology (e.g., WMTS, IEEE 802.11) and RF frequency of operation. It is important to
note that many medical devices are authorized to operate as unlicensed devices (under
Part 15 of the FCC rules 3) in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency bands
(e.g., 2400-2493.5 MHz), and as such, are not entitled to interference protection. There is
3

http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/accessing-spectrum and http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/rules-regulationstitle-47.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

a potential for interference in this frequency band because it is already heavily used by
many other communications and industrial products. In many cases, RF wireless medical
devices and transmission streams can incorporate technology (e.g., frequency hopping
protocols, correction protocols) to minimize effects of interference that may lead to data
errors or corruption. Also, to help protect against EMI to other medical devices in the
vicinity, FDA recommends that wireless medical device manufacturers limit the RF
output of their devices to the lowest power necessary to reliably accomplish the intended
functions.
Consideration should be given to any limitations or restrictions for proper operation and
RF wireless performance (e.g., alarms, back-up functions, alternative modes of operation)
when the RF wireless link is lost or corrupted. In addition, worldwide frequency band
allocation and international compatibility is critical to the operations of RF wireless
devices, and should be considered in the design and development of wireless medical
devices.
When choosing a RF wireless frequency band or a commercial wireless radio component,
FDA recommends that you consider:
•

International availability and band allocation (e.g., applicable International
Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) 4
recommendations) for medical devices because medical devices serve patients
located in multiple geographic locations and patients may change their geographic
locations.

•

Whether your device needs to have primary or secondary radio service
classification, which depends upon the wireless frequency band you choose.

•

Incumbent users of the selected and adjacent bands, if any, and how they can
impact a medical device’s operation.

•

Applicable interference mitigation techniques if you are planning to use a shared
RF wireless frequency band.

•

For implantable and body-worn medical devices, tissue propagation
characteristics and specific absorption rate as appropriate.

When considering commercial off-the-shelf RF wireless components or systems that
conform to industry standards (such as IEEE 802.11 standards), medical device
manufacturers should take into account that some equipment might not have been
adequately tested or qualified to address the needs and risks for use in medical devices.
This is because such equipment may conform to standards that are not written specifically
for medical devices. Under the quality system regulation, procedures and controls must
be established for wireless medical devices and their components, including components
4

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

that are purchased and included as part of the device or device system, to ensure that the
device and its components conform to specified design requirements related to the RF
wireless considerations noted above. 5

b. Wireless Quality of Service
Wireless Quality of Service (QoS) refers to the necessary level of service and
performance needed for the wireless functions of the medical device. While the QoS of
cellular telephone networks might be acceptable for voice communication, it might not be
sufficient for certain medical functions. Connections lost without warning, failure to
establish connections, or degradation of service can have serious consequences, especially
when the medical device relies heavily on the wireless connection. Such situations can
compromise the wireless transmission of high-priority medical device alarms, timesensitive continuous physiological waveform data, and real-time control of therapeutic
medical devices (such as wireless footswitches).
If the wireless medical device will be part of a network, wireless QoS should be carefully
considered in conjunction with the intended use of the wireless medical device. The
following should be assessed: acceptable latency, acceptable level of probability for loss
of information within the network, accessibility, and signal priorities of the network.
When the network is chosen or designated, FDA recommends use of a risk management
approach to deployment, security, and maintenance of the network’s QoS. Depending on
the intended use of the device, additional failure modes may need to be considered. Once
failure modes and associated risks are identified, we recommend a justification of
acceptable risk, or testing or other measures to demonstrate appropriate risk mitigation.

c. Wireless coexistence
A key factor affecting a wireless medical device’s performance is the limited amount of
RF spectrum available, which can result in potential competition among wireless
technologies for simultaneous access to the same spectrum. Because conflicts among
wireless signals can be expected, most wireless communication technologies incorporate
methods to manage these conflicts and minimize disruptions in the shared wireless
environment. The selection of RF wireless operating frequency and modulation should
take into account other RF wireless technologies and users that might be expected to be in
the vicinity of the wireless medical device system. These other wireless systems can pose
risks that could result in medical device signal loss or delay that should be considered in
the risk management process. To address this issue, FDA recommends that you address
your device’s environmental specifications and needs, including:
5

See, e.g., 21 CFR 820.30(f) (design verification); 21 CFR 820.30(g) (design validation); 21 CFR 820.50
(purchasing controls); and 21 CFR 820.80 (acceptance activities).

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

Associated sources of EMD expected in specific known use environments, and

•

Co-channel and adjacent channel interference from medical devices and other
users of the RF band.

If the RF wireless medical device is expected to be used in proximity to other RF wireless
in-band (i.e., the same or nearby RF frequency) sources, FDA recommends addressing
such risks through testing for coexistence of the device wireless system in the presence of
the number and type of in-band sources expected to be in proximity to the device.
Depending upon the wireless medical device, this should also include multiple units of
the subject device operating in the same vicinity, such as when patients are sitting
adjacent to one another in a waiting room. Once failure modes and associated risks are
identified, we recommend a justification of acceptable risk, or testing or other measures
to demonstrate appropriate risk mitigation.

d. Security of wireless signals and data
Security of RF wireless technology is a means to prevent unauthorized access to patient
data or hospital networks and to ensure that information and data received by a device are
intended for that device. Authentication and wireless encryption play vital roles in an
effective wireless security scheme. While most wireless technologies have encryption
schemes available, wireless encryption might need to be enabled and assessed for
adequacy for the medical device’s intended use. In addition, the security measures should
be well coordinated among the medical device components, accessories, and system, and
as needed, with a host wireless network. Security management should also consider that
certain wireless technologies incorporate sensing of like technologies and attempt to
make automatic connections to quickly assemble and use a network (e.g., a discovery
mode such as that available in Bluetooth™ communications). For certain types of
wireless medical devices, this kind of discovery mode could pose safety and effectiveness
concerns, for example, where automatic connections might allow unintended remote
control of the medical device.
FDA recommends that wireless medical devices utilize wireless protection (e.g., wireless
encryption, 6 data access controls, secrecy of the “keys” used to secure messages) at a
level appropriate for the risks presented by the medical device, its environment of use, the
type and probability of the risks to which it is exposed, and the probable risks to patients
from a security breach. FDA recommends that the following factors be considered during
your device design and development:
•

Protection against unauthorized wireless access to device data and control. This
should include protocols that maintain the security of the communications while

6

At the time of publication of this guidance, this included WiFi Protected Access (WPA2) for IEEE 802.11
technology.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

avoiding known shortcomings of existing older protocols (such as Wired
Equivalent Privacy (WEP)).
•

Software protections for control of the wireless data transmission and protection
against unauthorized access.

Use of the latest up-to-date wireless encryption is encouraged. Any potential issues
should be addressed either through appropriate justification of the risks based on your
device’s intended use or through appropriate design verification and validation.
For more information on this topic, see FDA’s draft guidance “Content of Premarket
Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices.”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument
s/ucm356186.htm). FDA’s draft guidance represents FDA’s proposed approach on this
topic.

e. EMC of the wireless technology
FDA recommends that EMC be an integral part of the development, design, testing, and
performance for RF wireless medical devices. This should include consideration of
applicable telecommunications standards and regulations and the potential for device RF
emissions that might cause EMI with other equipment. In addition, RF wireless
technology (by itself and in conjunction with the medical device) would also need to meet
applicable FCC requirements. Risk management activities should include using risk
analysis to identify any potential issues associated with EMC and determining risk
acceptability criteria based on information about the device and its intended use,
including foreseeable misuse, sources of environmental EMD (e.g., radio transmitters,
computer RF wireless equipment), and the potential for RF emissions to affect other
devices.
EMC testing should include tests focused on the medical device wireless functions and
technology. Some voluntary consensus standards such as the FDA-recognized 7
consensus standard IEC 60601-1-2 “Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 1-2: General
requirements for safety and essential performance – Collateral standard: Electromagnetic
compatibility – Requirements and tests” contain an exemption from the electromagnetic
immunity provisions in the “exclusion band” (passband) where the medical device’s RF
wireless receiver or transmitter operates. Consequently, such standards do not adequately
address whether the wireless communications will operate properly in the presence of inband EMD (e.g., other RF emissions overlapping the frequency band utilized by the
medical device wireless signals). Therefore, the medical device’s wireless

7

at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

communication(s) should be actively transmitting while testing for susceptibility during
all EMC immunity testing.
EMC considerations are also covered in other standards that might be helpful for medical
devices that incorporate RF wireless technology. For example, EMC considerations for
active implantable medical devices are covered under documents such as the ISO 147081 standard (see Appendix B).
Adequate information for the user is especially important if the device might be used in
high electric or magnetic field strength environments, and particularly if the device
cannot be made to function as intended in these environments. To help ensure safe and
effective use of your device, FDA recommends that the information for users include the
following:
•

Conformance to the IEC 60601-1-2 standard or other appropriate standards, and

•

EMC susceptibilities discovered during testing, and mitigations such as
recommended separation distances from other devices or EMD sources.

The IEC 60601-1-2 standard specifies that certain information based upon the EMC
testing be included in “accompanying documents.” This information includes a summary
of the test findings and additional EMC-related information such as classification of the
electrical power supply and use conditions.

f. Information for proper set-up and operation
To help assure proper set-up, configuration, and performance of the wireless medical
device, appropriate information should be provided to users. The following are suggested
items to consider as part of this information:
•

The specific RF wireless technology type (e.g., IEEE 802.11b), characteristics of
the modulation, and effective radiated RF power.

•

Specification of each RF frequency or frequency band of transmission and the
preferred frequency or frequency band (if applicable), and specification of the
bandwidth of the receiving section of the equipment or system in those bands.

•

Appropriate FCC labeling.

•

A warning that other equipment could interfere with the medical device or
device system, even if the other equipment complies with CISPR 8 emission
requirements.

Radio Interference). CISPR electromagnetic emission standards are referenced in the IEC 60601-1-2 standard.
See Appendix B.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

Information about the needed quality of service and security for the wireless
technology.

•

Functions and performance of the wireless data transmissions including data
throughput, latency, and data integrity.

•

Information about any limitations on the number, output power, or proximity of
other in-band transmitters used in the vicinity that might adversely impact a
device’s system operation.

•

Information for the user to understand the RF wireless technology’s capabilities
and be able to recognize and address issues that might arise. For devices with
intended use locations that are in complex RF wireless environments and consist
of multiple wireless products, this should include assessment and management
of the RF wireless transmitters and their use in the vicinity including
transmitters both inside and outside the facility.

•

Information for the user to understand the implications and limitations of using
RF wireless technology outside the United States, where allocations and
technical parameters may be different, possibly affecting the functioning of the
device.

g. Considerations for maintenance
Device Life Cycle - FDA recommends that you continue to manage the risks associated
with the use of wireless technology described above for the entire life cycle of your
device. Your procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action must include,
among other things, analyses for possible trends in nonconformance information and
complaints, such as reports of failures, which could include erratic or unexpected
behavior of the medical device. 9 Examples of such behavior include reprogramming of
stimulation devices, commands missed or misinterpreted by operating room controllers,
unexplained inconsistencies of an infusion pump, and failure to activate alarm signals in
alarm conditions.
Because electromagnetic emissions and exposure can vary significantly with various
structures, materials, and RF wireless emitter sources in the vicinity, FDA recommends
that in analyzing failure trends, you consider factors such as location, user application,
and repeat component failures. Potential problems include:

9

•

Additional events that may have contributed to the EMI or disruption of wireless
technology resulting in inappropriate or unnecessary diagnostic procedures or
interventions;

•

Additional equipment used in conjunction with the device;

•

Environmental conditions that might have contributed to the event; and

21 CFR 820.100(a).

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

Repeated device failures at the same facility or in other geographic areas.

If you identify a failure or malfunction of an RF wireless function, you must investigate
the cause and take action(s) to correct the problem and prevent its recurrence. 10 You must
analyze production and repair records and other sources of quality data to determine the
cause of the nonconformance. 11 Any corrective action and preventative action taken must
be verified or validated to ensure that such action is effective and does not adversely
affect the finished device. 12 FDA further recommends that you assess any product lines
that use similar designs or are subject to the same environment to determine whether
corrective and preventive actions are needed for those products.
Servicing - When servicing electrically powered medical devices, FDA recommends that
you maintain the integrity of RF wireless functions and design elements intended to
ensure EMC. Care should be taken to ensure EMI protection is present and in good
condition. Such EMI protection can include components that may be removed during
service such as shields, metal covers, ferrite beads, bonds, screws, ground wires and
straps. In addition, FDA recommends that you do not paint metal surfaces that are
intentionally left bare for RF shielding continuity. To reduce EMI susceptibility as
electronic equipment ages, we recommend that you clean connector contacts that might
have oxidized because oxidized contacts can act as semiconductors.

4. Recommendations for Premarket Submissions13 for
Devices that Incorporate RF Wireless Technology
When preparing a premarket submission for a device that incorporates RF wireless
technology, FDA recommends that you include the following information, as appropriate, for
your specific medical device.

10

11

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

a. Description of device
In order to facilitate the review of the submission, the device description for a wireless
medical device should include the following information specific to the wireless
technology and functions:
•

A description of the wireless technology and functions, and the intended use of the
medical device and intended use environment. This should include the form and
specific type of wireless technology that is incorporated into the device (e.g., IEEE
802.11b, IEEE 802.15 BluetoothTM), RF frequencies and maximum output powers,
range, and where and how the wireless technology is to be used.

•

A description of how the design of the device’s wireless function(s) assures timely,
reliable, accurate, and secure data and wireless information transfer. This includes the
wireless QoS needs and security measures.

•

If wireless technology is used for transmission, reception, or process involving alarm
signals, a description of the alarm signal, its priority, and how the RF wireless-related
risks are managed and, if appropriate, mitigated.

•

Identify whether other wireless products or devices are able to make a wireless
connection to the device. If so, summarize the products or devices and their function
and how the subject medical device functions are protected from adverse effects of
such connections to the other products or devices.

b. Risk-based approach to verification and validation
1. Wireless Quality of Service – The submission should include information to
describe the wireless QoS needed for the intended use and use environment of the
medical device. This includes addressing any risks and potential performance issues
that might be associated with data rates, latency, and communications reliability as
described in Section 3-b.
2. Wireless coexistence – Any risks and potential performance issues that might be
associated with wireless coexistence in a shared wireless environment should be
addressed via testing and analysis with other wireless products or devices that can be
expected to be located in the wireless medical device’s intended use environment. See
Section 3-c. The information addressing coexistence should include the following:
•

A summary of the coexistence testing, set-up, findings, and analysis.

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

The wireless products (interferers) that were used in the coexistence testing,
and their wireless RF frequencies, maximum output powers, and separation
distances from the device.

•

The specific pass/fail criteria for this testing.

•

How the device and wireless functions were monitored during the testing and
determined to meet the pass/fail criteria.

•

If it is reasonable to expect multiple units of the subject wireless medical
device to be used in the same vicinity, the information should also address how
the association and security between devices is established and maintained to
prevent cross-talk among the devices.

3. Security of wireless signals and data - The submission should identify any risks,
potential performance issues, and, if appropriate, risk mitigation measures that might
be associated with wireless security. The information should include the specific
measures needed to protect against unauthorized wireless access to the medical device
control or data and to ensure that information and data received by a device are
intended for that device. For wireless technology with a discovery mode or similar
active connection mode, specific information should be included addressing the
discovery mode and how outside users can be prevented from sensing or connecting to
the medical device. See Section 3-d.
4. EMC of the wireless technology – Information should be provided about how
EMC has been addressed for the device and all wireless functions. However, as
mentioned in section 3-e., the widely used IEC 60601-1-2 consensus standard does not
at present adequately address wireless technology EMC. Therefore, testing, analysis,
and appropriate mitigation might be necessary to adequately address any risks or
potential performance issues that might be associated with the EMC of the wireless
medical device. If modifications to the medical device were made to pass any EMC
testing, please include a description of, and justification for, the modifications.

c. Test data summaries
FDA recommends that the final RF wireless and EMC testing14 and results be
summarized in your premarket submission, which should contain the following
information:
•

14

Description of the tests performed (e.g., RF wireless performance, EMC
immunity and emissions, test levels or limits) and the protocol used;

By final testing we refer to testing performed on the final integrated product.

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

Reference to appropriate medical device, RF wireless technology, or EMC
standards for the tests;

•

Explanations for any deviations from the selected standards;

•

Mode(s) of device operation during testing, with an explanation of the
significance of these modes;

•

Specific pass/fail criteria for the testing such as specific device-related
acceptability criteria for each device mode or function tested. These criteria
should include the following:
o Specific device functions that should not degrade (such as CPU failure);
o Device functions that may degrade (such as display fluctuation); and
o Device recovery from degradation (such as after removal of the
electrostatic discharge (ESD)).

•

If modifications were made to the medical device in order to pass testing, a
statement that all modifications will be incorporated into all final production
units.

d. Labeling related to wireless medical devices
To facilitate the safe and effective use of the wireless medical device, the proposed
labeling should include risk mitigation measures that address RF wireless issues and any
precautions users should take. You should be aware that while labeling statements, such
as warnings, may be helpful, they are not a substitute for risk mitigation measures or
other design control activities, and are typically not adequate to prevent adverse events.
FDA recommends that the following information be included in the device labeling:
•

A summary of the medical device wireless functions and specific wireless
technology incorporated into the medical device or device system including
equipment or system specifications (e.g., the standard IEEE 802.11 b/g, IEEE
802.15.4 BluetoothTM class II);

•

A summary of the operating characteristics of the wireless technology, effective
RF radiated power output and operating range, modulation, and bandwidth of
receiving section;

•

A brief description of the wireless QoS needed for safe and effective operation;

•

A brief description of the recommended wireless security measures such as the
WPA2 wireless encryption for IEEE 802.11 technology;

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

Information addressing wireless issues and what to do if problems occur;

•

Information about any wireless coexistence issues and mitigations. This can
include precautions for proximity to other wireless products, and specific
recommendations for separation distances from such products;

•

Appropriate EMC and telecommunications standards compliance and test
results summary;

•

Appropriate RF wireless communications information such as those required by
FCC rules; and

•

Warnings about possible effects from RF sources in the vicinity of the device
(e.g., electromagnetic security systems, cellular telephones, RFID or other inband transmitters).

In addition, FDA recommends that your labeling also include all of the information as
outlined in the appropriate reference standards (e.g., IEC 60601-1-2). You should also
consider any other appropriate FDA guidances or special controls guidelines applicable to
your device for additional labeling information.

Appendix A: Glossary for Wireless Medical Devices and
Device Systems
The following definitions were adapted from IEC 60050-161 International Electrotechnical
Vocabulary (IEV), IEEE Standard 802.15.2™-2003, the IEEE Standard 11073-00101™ 2008, and other sources. 15
Data integrity — Assurance that transmitted files are not deleted, modified, duplicated, or
forged without detection.
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) — the ability of a device to function (a) properly in
its intended electromagnetic environment, and (b) without introducing excessive
electromagnetic disturbances that might interfere with other devices.
Electromagnetic disturbance (EMD) — any electromagnetic phenomenon that might
degrade the performance of an equipment, such as medical devices or any electronic
equipment. Examples include power line voltage dips and interruptions, electrical fast
transients (EFTs), electromagnetic fields (radio frequency radiated emissions), electrostatic
discharges, and conducted emissions.
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) — degradation of the performance of a piece of
equipment, transmission channel, or system (such as medical devices) caused by an
electromagnetic disturbance. Note: Disturbance and interference are cause and effect,
respectively.
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) — the rapid transfer of an electrostatic charge between
bodies of different electrostatic potential, either in proximity in air (air discharge) or through
direct contact (contact discharge).
Emissions — electromagnetic energy emanating from a device generally falling into two
categories: conducted and radiated. Both categories of emission can occur simultaneously,
depending on the configuration of the device.
Conducted emissions — electromagnetic energy emanating from a product through a
conductor by means of resistance, inductance, or capacitance. Conductors include AC
power cords, metallic enclosures of a subsystem, or cables that interconnect subsystems
or the patient to the product. Conducted emissions include power line harmonics, surges,
and radio frequency energy, especially in the frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz.
Radiated emissions — electromagnetic energy emanating from a device and propagating
through space or a medium (which can affect the distance and direction of propagation).
Radiated emissions include both intentional emissions such as radio transmissions

carrying information and unintentional emissions associated with electrically powered
equipment such as motors, power supplies, and computer components.
Immunity — the ability of an electrical or electronic product to operate as intended without
performance degradation in the presence of an electromagnetic disturbance.
Latency — the time it takes for a unit of information to cross a wireless link or network
connection from sender to receiver, which is also known as transfer delay.
Quality of service (QoS) — the necessary level of performance in a data communications
system or other service, typically encompassing multiple performance parameters, such as
reliability of data transmission, transfer rate, error rate, and mechanisms and priority levels
for time-critical signals.
Radio frequency (RF) — a frequency in the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is
between the audio-frequency and the infrared portions, and is useful for radio transmission.
Commonly used radio frequencies range from 9 kHz to 100 GHz.
Radio frequency interference (RFI) — one type of EMI resulting from radiated emissions
at one or more radio frequencies, which causes degradation of the reception of a wanted
signal by a radio-frequency electromagnetic disturbance.
Radio frequency (RF) wireless medical device — a medical device that includes at least
one function that is implemented using RF wireless communications; examples of functions
that might be implemented wirelessly include data transfer, device control, programming,
power transmission, remote sensing and monitoring, and identification.
Security — a collection of services, policies, mechanisms, and controls that provides
information confidentiality, integrity, and availability by restricting unauthorized parties from
accessing, manipulating, or leveraging particular system resources. Some security services
might include data encryption, data integrity-checking, user and device authentication, and
non-repudiation.
Specific absorption rate (SAR) — a measure of the rate at which energy is absorbed by the
body when exposed to an RF electromagnetic field. It is defined as the power absorbed per
mass of tissue and has units of watts per kilogram. SAR is usually averaged either over the
entire body, or over a small sample volume (typically 1 g or 10 g of tissue).
Susceptibility — the potential for equipment (including medical devices) to respond to an
electromagnetic disturbance. The inability of a device, equipment or system to perform
without degradation in the presence of an electromagnetic disturbance. Note: Susceptibility is
a lack of immunity.
Wireless coexistence — the ability of one wireless system to perform a task in a given
shared environment where other systems (in that environment) have an ability to perform
their tasks and might or might not be using the same set of rules.
