To: All Manufacturers and Potential Manufacturers of Medical
Laser Products

Subject: User Instructions for Medical Laser Products.
BACKGROUND :

Medical laser systems are very varied in their construction
and configuration. Some emit radiation of wavelengths in the

ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectral bands and may

include delivery optics that may be fixed, articulated or
flexible. Emissions may be collimated or have differing
degrees of convergence or divergence. Some systems deliver
their energy through unsheathed fiber optics that are subject
to breakage during use which can result in emission at
unintended locations and in unintended directions. Other
concerns involve applications with endoscopes, side-firing
fibers, and interactions of the laser with substances likely
to be encountered in the use environment. These factors make
it difficult to determine the precautions that are necessary
to avoid possible exposure to hazardous levels of radiation.

The Federal Performance Standard for Laser Products, 21 CFR
1040.10 and 1040.11, requires that user instructions for laser
products include "Adequate instructions for assembly,
operation and maintenance, including clear warnings concerning
precautions to avoid possible exposure to laser and collateral
radiation..." [See 21 CFR 1040.10(h) (1) (i)]. The Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has received numerous
inquiries from manufacturers and users about the practical
implementation of this requirement.

The CDRH recognizes that the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) Z136 series are the most widely accepted
standards of safety in the use of lasers in the United States.
These standards include 2136.1 (1993) - American National
Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers, and 2136.3 (1988)?* -
American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers in
Health Care Facilities. These standards define maximum
permissible exposures, give procedures for establishment of
hazard zones in the vicinity of laser equipment, provide
guidance on protective equipment such as eyewear and establish
the responsibilities of laser safety officers.

* A revision to this standard may be published in 1995. G®

INTERPRETATION:

The CDRH interprets the regulation in 21 CFR 1040.10 (h) (1) (i)
to require that the user information to be supplied with
medical laser products is to be in sufficient detail to enable
users to readily comply with accepted user safety standards
such as the ANSI Z136.1 and 2136.3. This information would
include:

- Definition of the emitted radiation propagation
pattern(s) and the nominal hazard zone in which the
radiation level exceeds the Maximum Permissible Exposure
(MPE) level during operation, maintenance and reasonably
expected conditions of failure;

- Protective equipment, such as eyewear, by make and model
or performance specifications and the location and
conditions of recommended use;

- Placement of the laser and delivery system relative to
the location of doorways or other access to minimize the
risk of accidental exposure; and

- Description of failures that may be reasonably expected
to occur, such as optical fiber breakage, that would
result in unintended emission and the safety measures to
be taken to avoid exposure to hazardous emission in such
occurrences.

The CDRH believes that the manufacturers of health care laser
systems are the most knowledgeable in the operation and
emission characteristics of their products and are best able
to provide this information. The CDRH is also concerned that
many health care facilities, especially individual practices
or free-standing facilities, may lack the capability to
establish a laser safety program as comprehensive as might be
expected in major hospitals. For this reason, the CDRH is
issuing this notice of interpretation to underscore the
requirement already contained in the regulation for
manufacturers of laser products to furnish adequate
instructions for assembly, operation and maintenance including
procedures to avoid unnecessary exposure to laser or
collateral radiation.

The CDRH welcomes comments on this notice. Please address any
comments to Director, Office of Compliance (HFZ-342), Center
for Devices and Radiological Health, 2098 Gaither Road,
Rockville, MD 20850.
