Guidance for the Content of Premarket Notifications for
Esophageal and Tracheal Prostheses
This document reflects the current review guidance for esophageal and tracheal prostheses
devices. It is based on 1) current scientific knowledge, 2) clinical experience, 3) previous
submissions by manufacturers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and 4) the Safe
Medical Devices Act of 1990 and FDA regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). As
advances are made in science and medicine, and changes occur in implementation of
Congressional legislation, these review criteria will be reevaluated and revised as necessary.
This document is an adjunct to the CFR and other FDA Guidance documents for the preparation
and review of 510(k) submissions. It does not supersede those publications but provides
additional clarification on what FDA believes is needed before a device can be cleared for
marketing. The submission must provide evidence that the device is substantially equivalent in
safety and effectiveness to a predicate device legally marketed in the United States.
Device Identifications
In 21 CFR 878, the following identifications are given for the esophageal and tracheal prostheses,
respectively:
878.3610, an esophageal prosthesis is a plastic tube or tube-like device that may have mesh
reinforcement that is intended to be implanted in, or affixed externally to, the chest and throat to
restore the esophagus or provide pharyngoesophageal continuity.
878.3720, a tracheal prosthesis is a tubular device intended to be implanted to reconstruct the
trachea.
Since these devices were first classified, metal self-expandable esophageal and tracheal prostheses
have been found substantially equivalent to esophageal and tracheal prostheses, respectively.
Therefore, these devices are also included under these classifications. These devices are intend to
restore the structure and/or function of the esophagus and trachea or trachealbronchial tree.
These devices may include any accessories and delivery systems used to deploy them.
The primary reference for the information required in a premarket notification (510(k)) for a
medical device is found in 21 CFR 807.87. Substantial equivalence to a legally marketed device is
to be established with respect to, but not limited to, intended use, design, energy used/delivered,
materials, performance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, and other applicable characteristics. To
expedite review of your 510(k) submission, please provide the information listed below. FDA
recommends that your 510(k) submission include numbered pages, a table of contents and clearly
titled sections.

DEVICE MATERIALS AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY
A.

An exact identification of all materials used to fabricate the device and deployment
system, including any colorants (inks, dyes, markings, etc.), plasticizers or
additives should be provided. Materials should be separated according to whether
they have direct or indirect body contact and according to the duration of contact.

B.

Biocompatibility data, as recommended by Blue Book memorandum, G95-1 "Use
of ISO-10993 Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and
Testing” should be provided.
Esophageal and tracheal prostheses are considered implanted devices, tissue and
bone contacting, extended duration (category C). The delivery systems are
considered implanted devices, tissue and bone contacting, limited duration
(category A). If the esophageal or tracheal prosthesis or delivery system is made of
materials that have been well-characterized chemically and physically in the
published literature (including any colorants, plasticizers or additives), and have a
long history of safety in products with a similar intended use, the FDA will accept
adequate justification for not conducting some or all of the following suggested
tests. The tests should be performed on the materials of the final, ready-to-use
device.
Esophageal and Tracheal Prostheses*:
•
Cytotoxicity
•
Sensitization (Guinea pig maximization with polar and non-polar extracts)
•
Implantation
•
Sub-chronic toxicity

page 3

•

Chronic toxicity**

Delivery System:
•
Cytotoxicity
•
Sensitization (Guinea pig maximization with polar and non-polar extracts)
•
Irritation or intracutaneous reactivity
*Genotoxicity testing is not required for this device because it is intended for
implantation in patients with malignant strictures.
**The device remains in the body for a prolonged duration. A long-term
implantation study with histopathology may replace implantation and chronic
toxicity.
VIII. PERFORMANCE TESTING - BENCH
Bench testing of esophageal and tracheal prostheses is required to establish substantial
equivalence. The following tests are recommended:
A.

Deployment Testing. This test is performed to validate the accuracy and
repeatability of the delivery system. The device is usually deployed in a tube
having similar characteristics (i.e., size, lubricity) to the esophagus or trachea or
trachealbronchial tree. Ease of deployment and accuracy of placement are
recorded. This test is only required for the largest diameter device that is to be
marketed.

B.

Expansion Force Testing. This test is performed to measure the force exerted by
the metal self-expanding types of esophageal and tracheal prostheses during
expansion. The predicate device should be tested with the same apparatus, and the
results should be provided for both the proposed and the predicate devices. These
test results should be provided for representative device diameters, including the
smallest and the largest diameter devices that are to be marketed.

C.

Compression Force Testing. This test is designed to measure the force required to
compress the metal self-expanding types of esophageal and tracheal prostheses
after expansion. Similar to the expansion force test, the predicate device should be
tested with the same apparatus and the results should be provided for the proposed
and the predicate devices. These test results should be provided for representative
device diameters, including the smallest and the largest diameter devices that are to
be marketed.

D.

Dimensional Testing. This test is performed to verify the reproducibility of the
metal self-expanding types of esophageal and tracheal prostheses length and
diameter after deployment. These test results should be provided for every
page 4

diameter device that is to be marketed.
E.

Corrosion Testing. This test is performed to establish the compatibility of the
esophageal prosthesis materials with the corrosive environment in the esophagus.
The device should be in contact with simulated gastric contents for a period of
time that is representative of the implantation time of the device. After exposure
to the simulated gastric contents, the tensile strength of the device material should
be measured and compared to the untreated device. Visual inspection of the
device using microscopy should also be performed. Accelerated exposure
conditions may be used (e.g., elevated temperatures), however, a rationale should
be provided on how the accelerated conditions are representative of the actual
clinical use conditions.

F.

Tensile strength tests. This test should be performed for any deployment system
that includes components that are bonded or welded.

It is recommended that all data be presented in a clear tabular or graphical form. In
describing each test protocol include the following: test objective, equipment used,
rationale for test conditions, number of devices tested (FDA recommends that at least
three devices of each type be tested for every test), results and analysis.
IX.

PERFORMANCE TESTING - ANIMAL and CLINICAL
If the technology and/or materials of the esophageal or tracheal prosthesis and/or delivery
system are significantly different from the predicate device, animal testing will be required.
Clinical data may also be required, depending upon the extent of the difference between
the proposed and predicate devices. FDA recommends that manufacturers contact us
before submitting a 510(k) to discuss these issues if appropriate.

X.

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS/ SPECIAL CONTROLS
There are no performance standards or special controls for esophageal and tracheal
prostheses at this time.

XI.

STERILITY
Guidance on sterility issues is described in ODE Bluebook Memorandum #K90-1,
"Sterility Review Guidance (2/12/90)". A copy can be obtained from Division of Small
Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) at 1-800-638-2041. All sterile devices must meet the
sterility assurance level (SAL) of 10-6. Please provide the following information:
A.
B.
C.

Sterilization method, if applicable
Sterilization validation method and SAL
Description of packaging method
page 5

D.

XII.

Radiation dose or the maximum levels of residuals of ethylene oxide, ethylene
chlorohydrin, and ethylene glycol which remain on the finished sterilized device,
whichever is applicable.
PROPOSED LABELING
A label includes any identification on the device and on the package in which it is stored
and shipped. Additional guidance on labeling in issues is provided by Bluebook
Memorandum #G91-1, "Device Labeling Guidance (3/18/91)." A copy can be obtained by
contacting DSMA at the telephone number listed above. A draft or sample copy of the
labeling should be provided in the submission. The labeling should include the device
name, indications for use, U.S. point of contact, corporation name, address and phone
number, sterility, expiration date (if applicable), and a statement whether the device is for
single or multiple use. Instructions for use should be provided which clearly describe the
indications for use, any warnings, precautions or contraindications for the device and clear
instructions for proper deployment and positioning of the device. Also, provide copies of
advertisement and promotional literature, if available.

XIII. 510(K) SUMMARY or STATEMENT
