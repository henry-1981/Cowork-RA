Fostering Medical Device
Improvement: FDA Activities and
Engagement with the Voluntary
Improvement Program
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is issuing this guidance to
describe its policy regarding participation in the Voluntary Improvement Program (VIP). The
VIP is a voluntary program facilitated through the Medical Device Innovation Consortium
(MDIC) that evaluates the capability and performance of a medical device manufacturer’s
practices using third-party appraisals, and is intended to guide improvement to enhance the
quality of devices. The VIP builds on the framework piloted through FDA’s 2018 Case for
Quality Voluntary Medical Device Manufacturing and Product Quality Pilot Program (CfQ Pilot
Program)1 and incorporates some of the successes and learnings from the pilot.2 The VIP is only
available to eligible manufacturers of medical devices regulated by CDRH and whose marketing
applications are reviewed under the applicable provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (including under sections 510(k), 513, 515, and 520).
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
As captured in CDRH's 2016-2017 strategic priority to “Promote a Culture of Quality and
Organizational Excellence,”3 CDRH envisions a future where the medical device ecosystem is
inherently focused on device features and manufacturing practices that have the greatest impact
on product quality and patient safety. Among its other regulatory activities, FDA evaluates
manufacturers' compliance with regulations governing the design and production of devices.
Compliance with the Quality System Regulation, 21 CFR Part 820, is a baseline requirement for
medical device manufacturing firms.4
In an effort to elevate and enhance manufacturing practices and behaviors through which quality
and safety of medical devices can be improved, FDA collaborated with various stakeholders,
brought together through the MDIC public-private partnership, to develop the CfQ Pilot
Program. FDA announced the voluntary Pilot Program in the Federal Register on December 28,
2017 (82 FR 61575). Details and results from the 2018 CfQ Pilot Program are outlined in
MDIC’s Case for Quality Pilot Report.5
As in the CfQ Pilot Program, the VIP oversees third-party appraisers who evaluate voluntary
industry participants, and the VIP assesses the capability and performance of key business
processes using a series of integrated best practices. The practices are detailed in the Information
Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) Capability Maturity Model Integration
(CMMI) system. CMMI provides a roadmap that guides improvement towards disciplined and
consistent processes for achieving key business objectives, including quality and performance.
The VIP uses a version of the CMMI appraisal appropriate for the medical device industry.6 This
appraisal tool is referred to as the Medical Device Discovery Appraisal Program (MDDAP)
model.7 The baseline appraisal using the MDDAP model covers 11 practice areas, such as
Governance, Implementation Infrastructure, and Managing Performance and Measurement.
Participants may adjust the practice areas on the subsequent appraisals compared to the baseline
set to better align with the organizational improvement goals. As part of the VIP, and as in the

2016-2017 Strategic Priorities: Center for Devices and Radiological Health, available at
https://www.fda.gov/media/95317/download.
4
On February 23, 2022, FDA proposed to amend the device QS regulation, 21 CFR part 820, to align more closely
with international consensus standards for devices (87 FR 10119; available at
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/23/2022-03227/medical-devices-quality-system-regulationamendments). Specifically, FDA proposed to withdraw the majority of the current requirements in part 820 and
instead incorporate by reference the 2016 edition of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485,
Medical devices- Quality management systems for regulatory purposes, in part 820. As stated in that proposed rule,
the requirements in ISO 13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the current
part 820, providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to consistently
manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. FDA intends to
finalize this proposed rule expeditiously. When the final rule takes effect, FDA will also update the references to
provisions in 21 CFR part 820 in this guidance to be consistent with that rule.

CfQ Pilot Program, the program provides firms and FDA with information about the firm’s
capability and performance for activities covered in the third-party appraisal.

III. Program Features
The VIP is a third-party quality maturity appraisal and continuous improvement program
facilitated through the MDIC, which was developed to improve medical device design,
production, and quality. The VIP is a voluntary program, not a regulatory requirement. The VIP
evaluates a participating manufacturer’s capability and performance in key business processes by
having qualified, third-party appraisers discuss, observe, and review the participant firm’s
practices. The appraisers evaluate the firm’s practices for the business processes established in
the appraisal scope against the integrated best practices within the CMMI model. Then, based on
the third-party appraiser’s evaluation of a participant’s practices, the VIP identifies the firm’s
strengths and potential opportunities for improvement. The VIP allows the third-party appraiser
to share some of that information with FDA. For example, the Agency receives high-level
appraisal scores for each assessed practice area, by firm name and location, as well as deidentified, aggregate information from the program.
The site visit and/or analysis is not intended to be a regulatory inspection or an audit, and
appraisers do not assess the firm’s compliance with applicable regulatory standards. As part of
the appraisal process, appraisers may review relevant information including, but not limited to,
documents and systems, and conduct interviews. Appraisers do not make regulatory observations
or findings. Although the VIP produces information conveyed to both the firm and to FDA, it
does not issue a rating or a certification.
Participating manufacturing sites who demonstrate ongoing engagement with the program and
sustained or improved capabilities and performance, may benefit from several opportunities that
the VIP offers, following FDA’s review of the site’s appraisal, including:
·

Opportunity for FDA Consideration in Risk-Based Inspection Planning – Section 701
of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) amended section 510(h)(2) of the
FD&C Act to require FDA inspections of device establishments to occur “in accordance
with a risk-based schedule established by the Secretary.” In establishing such a schedule,
section 510(h)(4) requires FDA to consider the following factors: (1) the compliance
history; (2) the record, history, and nature of recalls linked to the establishment; (3) the
inherent risk of the device manufactured, prepared, processed at the establishment; (4) the
inspection frequency and history of the establishment, including whether the
establishment has been inspected pursuant to section 704 within the last 4 years; (5)
whether the establishment has been inspected by a foreign government or agency
recognized under section 809; and (6) any other criteria deemed necessary and
appropriate by the Secretary for the purposes of allocating inspection resources.
While appraisals performed through the VIP do not constitute a new regulatory
requirement or serve as an equivalent to an FDA inspection, FDA may consider
information from a participant’s appraisals, as appropriate, in risk-based inspection

planning. FDA retains the inspection authority granted under the FD&C Act and may
conduct inspections at VIP sites, including, but not limited to surveillance, premarket, or
for cause inspections as appropriate.
·

Opportunity to Utilize a Modified Submission Format for Premarket Approval
Application (PMA) and Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) 30-Day Change
Notices for Modifications to Manufacturing Procedures or Methods of Manufacture –
FDA intends to offer participating manufacturing sites the opportunity to submit 30-Day
Change Notices for modifications to manufacturing procedures or methods of
manufacture using a modified submission format. See Appendix A for additional
information regarding content of the modified submission format. FDA intends to review
changes related to quality improvements within 10 calendar days as resources permit.
When appropriate, FDA may use the full 30-Day review time and, when such notice is
inadequate, FDA intends to inform the applicant that a 135-Day PMA supplement or 75Day HDE supplement must be submitted as defined by section 515(d)(5)(A) of the
FD&C Act and 21 CFR 814.39(f) and 814.108. For more information generally regarding
30-Day Change Notices please refer to FDA’s guidance titled “30-Day Notices, 135-Day
Premarket Approval (PMA) Supplements and 75- Day Humanitarian Device Exemption
(HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing Method or Process Changes.”8

·

Opportunity to Utilize a Modified Submission Format for PMA and HDE
Manufacturing Site Change Supplements – FDA intends to offer participating
manufacturing sites the opportunity to submit 180-Day PMA or 75-Day HDE
Manufacturing Site Change Supplements using a modified submission format. See
Appendix A for additional information regarding content of the modified submission
format. FDA intends to review such supplements as resources permit within 25 calendar
days. The site change should be to a site already accepted into the VIP. When
appropriate, upon notification to the applicant, FDA may use the full 180-Day or 75-Day
review time as defined by section 515(d)(5)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR
814.39(a)(3), 814.108, and 814.114. For more information generally regarding 180-Day
PMA or 75-Day HDE Manufacturing Site Change Supplements please refer to FDA’s
guidance titled “Manufacturing Site Change Supplements: Content and Submission.”9

·

Opportunity to Utilize a Modified Submission Format for PMA or HDE Manufacturing Modules – FDA intends to offer participating manufacturing sites the
opportunity to submit manufacturing modules for a PMA or HDE using a modified
submission format for review by FDA staff. See Appendix A for additional information
regarding content of the modified submission format. For more information generally
regarding the submission format for PMA or HDE manufacturing modules please refer to

FDA’s guidance titled “Quality System Information for Certain Premarket Application
Reviews.”10
FDA aims to remain agile and continue to actively engage with MDIC to improve processes,
features, and potential opportunities to participate in the VIP as the program generates new data
and the program evolves. FDA may provide examples, share lessons learned, or expand
innovative approaches with the participating organizations in order to continue to improve the
effectiveness and efficiency of the VIP.

IV. Voluntary Improvement Program Operations
The VIP currently uses the Medical Device Discovery Appraisal Program (MDDAP), which is a
tailored version of CMMI Performance Solutions, to evaluate the capabilities and performance of
the medical device manufacturer's current business processes and objectives against the best
practices outlined by the maturity model. While the VIP does not evaluate compliance with any
regulatory requirements, the manufacturers’ business processes are evaluated to determine if they
support ongoing achievement of business objectives, including quality improvements. The
MDDAP program is administered by ISACA11, which also certifies and coordinates third-party
appraisers, maintains the detailed results of the appraisals, and evaluates the collected data.
ISACA is an independent body and has established certification procedures to prevent conflicts
of interest for the third-party appraisers. To establish the scope of the appraisal, the appraisal
team12 is expected to meet with participants’ staff and obtain information regarding work units,
products manufactured, the number of employees, and the manufacturing volume. Appraisers use
this information to help determine the evaluation strategy and appropriate sampling across
products and processes. Appraisers may also use this information to evaluate the participant’s
business processes by comparing how participant manufacturers meet the best practices outlined
by the maturity model. The appraisal team may use such information to identify opportunities to
improve. This is intended to provide the participating manufacturer with data and granularity that
reflects its own organizational performance against the practices outlined in the maturity model,
and a roadmap to improve performance, increase quality, and enhance value. FDA also benefits
by receiving a summary of the individual firm’s information and aggregated information across
all participating manufacturers. Additional details of the process for MDDAP appraisals can be
found at https://www.isaca.org/enterprise/medical-device-discovery-appraisal-program#mddapthree-simple-steps. Finally, FDA understands that there are other potentially viable appraisal
programs and may consider assessing those programs and their suitability for future use in the
VIP.

The program has established enrollment and participation criteria for manufacturing sites. To
participate in VIP, manufacturing sites should meet specified enrollment criteria. Manufacturing
sites are also expected to meet additional participation criteria, including an MDDAP appraisal.
Both the enrollment and participation criteria are available at
https://www.isaca.org/enterprise/medical-device-discovery-appraisal-program#mddap-threesimple-steps. FDA intends to review and confirm an applicant’s eligibility for enrollment in the
VIP. Any current CfQ Pilot Program participants who wish to participate in the VIP do not need
to reapply and are considered enrolled in the VIP unless they express an intention to withdraw
(and subject to the principles outlined in Section V.C. below).
If a manufacturing site believes that it meets the enrollment criteria and would like to be
considered for participation in the VIP, it may apply at
http://medicaldevice.enrollment.sgizmo.com/s3/.
If you have questions regarding enrollment, contact FDA at CaseforQuality@fda.hhs.gov.

Additional Eligibility Considerations
Generally, to be eligible for the VIP, a manufacturer is expected to have a history of being in
compliance with the applicable requirements of the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.
To make that determination, FDA may consider the firm’s inspectional history, and, if
applicable, other relevant information. On a case-by-case basis, VIP may consider enrolling
manufacturing sites that do not have previous compliance history with the Agency, including for
example: manufacturers that may not be responsible for complying with 21 CFR Part 820 (i.e.,
component manufacturers) and/or firms that do not meet all of the eligibility factors outlined
above. These companies may be able to benefit from the VIP by building capability in their
employees and processes and focusing on continuous improvement in the same way as the
companies that have established a good compliance standing with the Agency. These companies
may not be eligible for certain opportunities offered under the program, as noted in Section III
above, until FDA has verified the manufacturer is in compliance with the FD&C Act and its
implementing regulations.

VIP Participating Manufacturing Site Expectations
The VIP anticipates that participating manufacturing sites:

13

·

Receive an annual appraisal.

·

Engage with appraisers and commit to the mutually agreed upon appraisal process.13
o Appraisers are encouraged to stop the appraisal at any time in the process if a
manufacturer does not engage as the appraiser expects, or if the manufacturer fails
to follow any of the appraisal process boundaries and expectations, mutually
agreed upon during the appraisal scoping. The appraiser may follow its
established process with the VIP, which may involve FDA.

See https://www.isaca.org/enterprise/medical-device-discovery-appraisal-program

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

·

Perform a quarterly progress check-in with lead appraisers.

·

Submit quality performance measures according to the criteria set forth in the CMMI
system and appraisal method. These measures fall into quality domains such as safety,
effectiveness, reliability, and availability, but VIP does not prescribe individual
performance measures, only that they be relevant to participants. Information provided by
the participants establishes context for a given performance measure, including:
· the quality objective of the measure
· business objective of the measure
· name or title of the measure
· the level of the measure (e.g., product, aggregate, site)
· how the measure is calculated
· indications of improving performance
· known limitations of the measure or data
· why the measure matters/how the measure is used
· how often the measure is captured
· how often the measure is reported within the organization (i.e., daily, monthly,
quarterly)
Please refer to Appendix B for an illustrative example of how participants could define
this performance measure information.

·

Proactively notify FDA regarding product safety issues or recalls following all current
regulatory requirements, including reporting (see also Section V.B. below).

VIP Process Flow
The process flow for participation in the VIP is as follows:
·

Manufacturing sites apply to participate in the VIP through the application portal at
http://medicaldevice.enrollment.sgizmo.com/s3/.

·

The manufacturing site’s application information is provided to FDA by the recognized
third-party appraisal program. FDA intends to review a manufacturing site application
within 5 calendar days and provide confirmation to the manufacturing site and the
recognized third-party appraisal program of eligibility for participation in the VIP. If
FDA does not agree that the manufacturing site has met the eligibility criteria for
enrollment, the site will be notified accordingly.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

·

The third-party appraisal program notifies FDA when a contract for appraisal between
recognized third-party appraisal program and the participating manufacturing site has
been established and provides FDA with the appraisal schedule.14

·

The participating manufacturing site and the recognized third-party appraisal program are
expected to scope, coordinate, and execute the appraisal. Appraisals are targeted to be
conducted within 90 calendar days from confirmation of enrollment.

·

Recognized third-party appraisal program provides FDA appraisal summary within 30
calendar days of completing appraisal.

·

Participating manufacturing site meets quarterly with lead appraiser for progress checks
and provides quality performance metrics.

·

Participating manufacturing site and recognized third-party appraisal program plan and
schedule follow-up appraisal activities on an annual basis.

·

FDA may consider recommendations from recognized third-party appraisal programs
regarding frequency of these activities (appraisals, check-ins, and submission of quality
performance measures) as participants demonstrate continuing engagement, increased
performance, or capability in their business process.

V.

FDA Activities and Engagement with VIP

FDA maintains representation on the VIP governance committee and provides input to overall
program operation and changes. This ensures that VIP continues to align with FDA’s
expectations of improving participating manufacturing sites’ capability and performance and that
VIP provides value to industry stakeholders. VIP establishes information that a recognized thirdparty appraisal program should provide FDA, and that FDA intends to consider in the benefitrisk considerations FDA routinely uses to inform planning and FDA resource allocations,
improve review efficiency, and may inform risk-based inspection planning, for firms that
demonstrate capability and transparency around their manufacturing and product performance.

FDA Commitment to VIP Participating Manufacturing
Sites
In response to the commitment by the participating manufacturing site to meet VIP expectations
(Section IV.C) and to foster continuous improvement, safety, and transparency, FDA intends to:
·

Engage proactively with participating manufacturing sites to resolve any issues (such as
signals, potential safety issues, or recalls) according to the principles outlined in Section
V.B. (Existing Regulatory Obligations and FDA Involvement).

14

ISACA will work with the manufacturer to help determine scoping, schedule, and the logistics of the appraisal
process.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

·

Contact and engage with participating manufacturing sites to discuss and resolve any
issues brought to FDA’s attention during an appraisal. If there is no resolution for such
issues, the appraisal should end, and the participant may no longer continue to participate
in the program. Please see Section V.C. below for information regarding withdrawal and
removal of participants from the VIP.

Existing Regulatory Obligations and FDA Involvement
Participation in the VIP does not alter a firm’s existing regulatory obligations under the FD&C
Act, nor does it impact FDA’s enforcement authority under the FD&C Act. As is always the
case, the Agency retains discretion to take enforcement action when appropriate. FDA retains the
inspection authority granted under the FD&C Act and may conduct inspections at VIP sites,
including, but not limited to surveillance, premarket, or for cause inspections as appropriate.
Participants are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including the
FD&C Act and its implementing regulations (including, but not limited to, 21 CFR 803, 806,
807, and 820). Information obtained through the course of the VIP is not intended to be a
substitute for evidence collected during the course of an FDA inspection.
If issues (such as safety) are brought to FDA’s attention during a firm’s participation in the VIP
program, FDA intends to collaborate with participating manufacturing sites first to mitigate the
impact of the issue, then to identify and to implement the most effective and efficient resolution
which may include an action plan and regular communication. In addition to notifying the
relevant FDA Medical Device Program Division, the participating manufacturing site should also
contact the review team in the appropriate Office of Health Technology (OHT) within CDRH’s
Office of Product Evaluation and Quality (OPEQ), as well as the Case for Quality team at
CaseforQuality@fda.hhs.gov, to facilitate working interactively with FDA to address the
identified issues that may impact participation in VIP.
If FDA, in its discretion, determines that there has been significant and satisfactory progress
towards resolution or it has been completed in the established timeline, no additional action is
recommended from a VIP perspective and program opportunities available to participants
continue. However, if FDA, in its discretion, determines that there has not been significant and
satisfactory progress towards a resolution or the issue escalates into a serious injury or
death, FDA may consider limiting program opportunities and/or recommending removal from
participation in VIP as outlined in Section C below.

Withdrawal and Removal from the VIP After Acceptance
The VIP is a voluntary program and participants may choose to withdraw from participation at
any time by providing notice to the recognized third-party appraisal program or by notifying
FDA at CaseforQuality@fda.hhs.gov. Withdrawal from the VIP may affect the opportunities
provided by FDA (as identified in Sections III and IV of this guidance). Participants who
withdraw from the VIP may be eligible to enroll again at a later time.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA and VIP participants have a shared goal to proactively and quickly address quality issues or
safety risks that arise during program participation through collaboration and communication.
FDA may remove participating manufacturing sites from the VIP if participants do not engage
with FDA on certain issues as noted in Section V.B., or for any other reason that FDA
determines is in the best interest of the public health.
A participating manufacturing site in the VIP who may not be fulfilling the expectations or
commitments, such as by,
·
·
·
·
·

missing a check point or delaying the checkpoint by greater than 60 calendar days
without communication with the third-party appraiser;
not providing performance measures or delaying performance measures by greater than
60 calendar days without communication with the third-party appraiser;
delaying appraisal or reappraisal by greater than 90 calendar days without
communication and agreement by FDA;
providing false or misleading information; or
not fulfilling financial commitments to the third-party appraiser or delaying payments by
greater than 30 calendar days unless otherwise agreed on by the third-party appraiser

may be subject to principles outlined in Section V.B., and, if appropriate, may have their
eligibility for the program opportunities noted above (Section III) suspended for a period of time
depending upon the issues identified, until the VIP determines that the participant is progressing
sufficiently towards resolving these issues. If the participant and FDA cannot resolve any such
issues by utilizing the principles and procedures described in Section V.B. of this guidance, FDA
may recommend a participant’s removal from the VIP. Typically, participants who have been
removed from the VIP may not be eligible to enroll in the program again until any outstanding
issues have been resolved and verified by FDA.

VI. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

Appendix A: Modified Submission Formats
Through guidance documents, FDA has made recommendations for some information that would
be useful to include in certain submission types (i.e., PMA/HDE 30-Day Change Notices,
PMA/HDE Manufacturing Site Change Supplements, PMA/HDE Manufacturing Modules). FDA
anticipates that, in the course of the VIP, it will gain insights into the participant’s manufacturing
processes and control capabilities that would likely address some recommendations for these
regulatory submissions. Thus, participants in the VIP may be able to avail themselves of
efficiencies that might prevent duplicate information and/or allow for least burdensome
submissions15 to the FDA.
30-Day Change Notice Submissions
Recommendations for content to be included in a 30-Day Change Notice are listed in FDA’s
guidance titled “30-Day Notices, 135-Day Premarket Approval (PMA) Supplements and 75- Day
Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing Method or Process
Changes.” 16 FDA anticipates that, during the course of the VIP, participants may provide FDA
with information that will likely address some FDA recommendations regarding 30-Day Change
Notices. The results of the appraisal and the VIP performance metrics may provide FDA with an
understanding of the participating site’s control capabilities and sufficient assurances to make a
knowledgeable judgment about the quality control used in the manufacture of the device. FDA
has created a modified submission format available to VIP participants for addressing the
remainder of those recommendations.
·

The VIP appraisal evaluates the participating site’s capability to support, manage,
sustain, and improve its established processes. As such, FDA intends to offer VIP
participants the opportunity to use a modified submission format which does not
recommend:
·

·
·

·

A summary of the procedures established for the identification, documentation,
validation, review, and approval of the manufacturing changes submitted in the
30- day notice.
A description of how you will monitor and control any manufacturing process you
intend to change.
Within the summary of the completed validation study that demonstrates that the
manufacturing change can be made without significantly changing the operation
of the final device, an explanation of how change control procedures were
implemented, including whether the submitter modified the manufacturing or
quality control instructions, or the manufacturing specifications.
A summary of how purchasing control procedures were implemented to evaluate
any new supplier or contractor, if the manufacturing change involves changes in

During the course of the VIP, the appraisal is expected to evaluate sampling methods. As
such, FDA intends to offer VIP participants the opportunity to use a modified submission
format which does not recommend:
·

·

suppliers of components or raw materials that are critical to the performance of
the device, or the use of a new contractor for a manufacturing process or quality
control testing.
A description of the type and extent of control to be exercised over the component
or raw material, including specifications for the incoming material and a
description of in-coming acceptance activities. Also, a description of any testing
that was completed to evaluate the use of the component or material and include
a summary of the data.

the statistical rationale for the sampling method, if the submitter plans to verify
the changed processes by routine sampling and independent measurement.

Other FDA recommendations from the guidance may also be addressed as follows:
·
·

A description of the device may be replaced by the Device Identifier (DI), as
applicable.
An identification of the manufacturing facilities where the change will be
implemented may be captured through the FEI and CMMI Appraisal Numbers.

PMA/HDE Manufacturing Site Change Supplement
Recommendations for content to be included in a PMA or HDE Manufacturing Site Change
Supplement are listed in FDA’s guidance titled “Manufacturing Site Change Supplements:
Content and Submission.”17 FDA anticipates that, during the course of the VIP, participants may
provide FDA with information that will likely address some FDA recommendations regarding
Manufacturing Site Change Supplements. The results of the appraisal and the VIP performance
metrics may provide FDA with an understanding of the participating site’s control capabilities
and sufficient assurances to make a knowledgeable judgment about the quality control used in
the manufacture of the device. FDA has created a modified submission format available to VIP
participants for addressing the remainder of those recommendations.
·

The VIP appraisal evaluates the participating site’s capability to support, manage,
sustain, and improve their established processes. As such, FDA intends to offer VIP
participants the opportunity to use a modified submission format which does not
recommend:
·

If the manufacturing site change results in the use of a different supplier or
contract manufacturer, within the current purchasing control procedures
detailing the supplier evaluation process:

How the submitter maintains records of acceptable suppliers and how the submitter
addresses the purchasing data approval process.
· How the submitter balances purchasing assessment and receiving
acceptance to ensure that products conform to specified requirements.
Additionally, based upon review of control capabilities as part of the VIP appraisal, FDA
intends to offer VIP participants the opportunity to use a modified submission format
which does not recommend the following for processes that are consistent across
manufacturing sites:
·
·
·
·
·

·

·

A description of the equipment and processes that would be affected by the site
change.
A list of any standards used in the new manufacturing processes, if applicable
The process validation or revalidation procedures (and reports, if applicable)
The procedures for environmental and contamination controls if such conditions
could adversely affect the device (21 CFR 820.70).
If different from the original PMA, any procedures that explain how inspection,
measuring, and test equipment are routinely calibrated, inspected, checked, and
maintained (21 CFR 820.72). If this involves a large number of procedures, a
sample of the most relevant procedures would be sufficient. If procedures are the
same as those contained and approved in the original PMA, the submitter should
provide a statement indicating this.
The procedures for the incoming acceptance activities at the subject
manufacturing site, if different from the procedures contained and approved in
the original PMA. If procedures are the same as those contained and approved in
the original PMA, the submitter should provide a statement indicating this.
The procedures for the final acceptance activities at the subject manufacturing
site, if applicable and different from the procedures contained and approved in
the original PMA. If procedures are the same as those contained and approved in
the original PMA, the submitter should provide a statement indicating this.

However, if processes differ from the original manufacturing site, FDA may continue to
recommend one or more of the previously listed elements.
·

FDA anticipates reviewing a VIP participant’s master plan as a part of a manufacturing
site change supplement. As such, FDA intends to offer VIP participants the opportunity
to use a modified submission format which does not recommend:
·

·

A list of processes at the new site that the submitter does not plan to validate but
will verify by inspection and test.

Other FDA recommendations may also be addressed as follows:

PMA/HDE Original Manufacturing Module
Recommendations for content to be included in a PMA or HDE Original Manufacturing Module
are listed in FDA’s guidance titled “Quality System Information for Certain Premarket
Application Reviews.” 18 FDA anticipates that, during the course of the VIP, participants may
provide FDA with information that will likely address some FDA recommendations regarding
PMA/HDE Original Manufacturing Modules. Because participation in the VIP depends upon
FDA’s verification that the manufacturer complies with the FD&C Act and its implementing
regulations, FDA anticipates that the recommendations regarding information to provide about
the design control process (i.e., recommendations under 21 CFR 820.30) will likely have already
been verified and reviewed accordingly. Additionally, the results of the appraisal and the VIP
performance metrics may provide FDA with an understanding of the participating site’s control
capabilities and sufficient assurances to make a knowledgeable judgment about the quality
control used in the manufacture of the device. FDA has created a modified submission format
available to VIP participants for addressing the remainder of those recommendations.
·

FDA anticipates that the following recommendation from the guidance will likely be
addressed for VIP participants based upon their inspection/audit history:
·

·

You should provide a copy of your basic quality system procedure(s).

Several items may only continue to be recommended from VIP participants if the
processes or procedures for controls have changed since last FDA review. This includes
information regarding:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

Production and Process Controls, 21 CFR 820.70
Inspection, Measuring, and Test Equipment, 21 CFR 820.72
Receiving Acceptance Activities, 21 CFR 820.80(b)
Final Acceptance Activities, 21 CFR 820.80(d)
Nonconforming Products, 21 CFR 820.90
Complaint Files, 21 CFR 820.198
Servicing, 21 CFR 820.200

The Device Identifier (DI), as applicable, and FEI and CMMI Appraisal Numbers may also be
useful to describe the device and identify the site, respectively.
