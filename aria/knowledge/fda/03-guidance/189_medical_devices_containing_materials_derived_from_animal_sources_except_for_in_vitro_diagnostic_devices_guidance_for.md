Medical Devices Containing Materials
Derived from Animal Sources (Except
for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices)
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of
the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA
staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this guidance to update the policy
regarding the use of animal-derived material in medical device manufacturing. The role of
animal-derived material in medical devices is well established. However, these materials may
carry a risk of transmitting infectious disease when improperly collected, stored, or
manufactured. The purpose of this guidance is to provide further clarification and updated
information on the use of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 22442-1
“Medical devices utilizing animal tissues and their derivatives – Part 1: Application of risk
management,” ISO 22442-2, “Medical devices utilizing animal tissues and their derivatives –
Part 2: Controls on sourcing, collection and handling,” and ISO 22442-3 “Medical devices
utilizing animal tissues and their derivatives – Part 3: Validation of the elimination and/or
inactivation of viruses and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents” to support
applications to FDA. This guidance also provides recommendations regarding methods for
controlling the sourcing of animal tissues with regard to viral pathogens and evaluating the
ability of manufacturing methods to remove such pathogens from the final product. This
guidance replaces “Medical Devices Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources
(Except for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices)” issued November 6, 1998 (“the 1998 guidance.”)

Throughout this guidance document, the term “we” refers to FDA staff from CDRH. “You”
and “your” refers to the manufacturer.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something
is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
This guidance updates the 1998 guidance by addressing aspects of potential risk from the use of
animal tissues and now includes recommendations related to viral pathogens and all
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). The 1998 guidance addressed ways to
reduce the potential for exposure to one specific TSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). This document continues to focus on the control of transmissible disease, and contains
recommendations for documenting the source of animal tissue and conducting viral inactivation
validation studies. Commercial production of animals as sources of bodily tissues used in
medical devices can introduce several kinds of risks. The 1998 document primarily addressed
geographical factors in the sourcing of the animal tissue. In addition to geographical factors,
this document includes recommendations that recognize the role of appropriate animal
husbandry to ensure safe tissue sources.
International Standard ISO 22442 series, “Medical devices utilizing animal tissues and their
derivatives – Part 1: Application of risk management,” “Part 2: Controls on sourcing, collection
and handling,” and “Part 3: Validation of the elimination and/or inactivation of viruses and
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents,” provides recommendations for
selection and handling of animal tissues as well as evaluating the risk of pathogen
contamination in medical devices. Used in concert with the ISO 22442 series of standards, this
guidance is intended to help you identify the possible risks related to medical device
components and/or manufacturing reagents that are sourced from animal tissues.
We also recognize that an ISO standard is a document that undergoes periodic review and is
subject to revision. Through the FDA standards recognition process, CDRH provides
information regarding the extent of recognition of the ISO 22442 series of standards through
Supplementary Information Sheets published on the FDA website.2 FDA will make updates to
this guidance document as appropriate, should future revisions to the ISO 22442 series of
standards result in significant changes to the recommendations in this document.

III. Scope
The information in this guidance is applicable to all medical devices that contain or are exposed
(e.g., through a manufacturing reagent) to animal-derived (e.g., bovine, ovine, porcine, avian)
materials with the exception of in vitro diagnostic devices and materials generally recognized to
be safe based on their method of manufacture (e.g., tallow derivatives as described in Annex C
of ISO 22442-1: 2015). This guidance addresses the risks of human pathogens that could
contaminate animal material and be present in a medical device. For devices that indirectly
contact humans, this guidance considers the risk to patients (e.g., how might indirect contact
result in pathogen exposure) and the healthcare provider who may handle device components
that do not contact a patient.
This guidance provides: 1) information that FDA believes is important to document the safe
and consistent manufacture of medical devices containing animal tissue; 2) information that
should be included in a premarket submission for products within the scope of this guidance;
3) recommendations regarding how specific aspects of the Quality System (QS) Regulation3
should be applied to control and document the safe and consistent manufacture of medical
devices containing animal tissue; and 4) additional information on specific approaches for
determining the ability of manufacturing methods to eliminate viral contamination in the final
product. In general, premarket submissions should include information on the specifics
identified below or the methods by which the risks are mitigated. In addition, records at the
manufacturing facility should continue to document this information on each lot of product
manufactured consistent with the QS Regulation.
FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing Premarket Approval
(PMA) applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) applications, Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE) applications, Premarket Notification (510(k)) submissions, and De
Novo requests for medical devices that contain device components derived from animal sources
and come into direct or indirect contact with the human body. This guidance is not applicable
to medical devices that are derived from human tissues because the potential contaminants
associated with human donor tissues are considerably different than those that are found in
animal tissues.
Should a manufacturer have questions about the applicability of this guidance to their specific
product, we recommend consultation with FDA.

IV. Considerations When Using Animal­Derived Materials
A.

Control of Animal Tissue Collection

To ensure the safety of medical devices containing or contacting animal tissue, FDA believes
that it is important: 1) to document the sourcing and handling of animal tissues as well as 2) to
understand the capabilities of the manufacturing and sterilization processes to eliminate human
pathogens. Consequently, FDA recommends that you collect and document the information
outlined below for animal tissue-derived materials that are used as either device components
(e.g., pericardium, viscera, bone, hyaluronic acid, collagen) or manufacturing reagents (e.g.,
tissue culture media, enzymes). For devices prepared from animal tissues that have a reduced
risk of human pathogen contamination (e.g., crustaceans), FDA recommends that you address
the information outlined below if applicable to that particular source material. If determined
not to be applicable, FDA recommends providing a scientific explanation (i.e., based on
published literature or information from a recognized source (e.g., WHO, CDC, USDA)) that
identifies the human pathogens that may be present in the animal species, and how your
approach ensures device safety.
Premarket submissions should include information on the items identified below, consistent
with ISO 22442-2 and the methods by which the risks are mitigated4 if applicable. You may
document this information in a premarket submission or by reference to other regulatory
submissions (e.g., Master File, PMA, 510(k)).

the animal species;
the age of the animal at slaughter;
the specific tissue(s) used (if multiple tissues are used, please identify all such tissues);
the animals’ country of origin and residence (with more specific geographic information
when appropriate) when such information is available;
the status of the herd or collection of organisms (e.g., closed herd/group);
the methods for actively monitoring the health of the herd and the health of specific
animals from which tissues are collected (e.g., vaccinations with live modified viruses
that can co-purify in the desired tissue, active surveillance for human pathogens);
the methods and conditions for transporting animal tissue (e.g., tissue refrigeration and
quarantine);
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) status of the abattoir;5
the tests performed (and release criteria) for permitting tissue to be further processed
and/or combined with other tissues and device components (e.g., a Certificate of
Analysis); and
Material Safety Data Sheets may be helpful information to include in a regulatory
submission, when available, because they provide an overview of the safety and

potential toxicities related to that component, including information on any reagents
used in the processing of the tissue, to support biocompatibility assessments.
Certification of compliance with USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
importation and/or USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) inspection requirements
may be provided in lieu of any aforementioned items provided in these forms.
In addition, the manufacturing facility should document 1) procedures for maintaining records
on the above cited items6 and 2) all information outlined above on each lot of product
manufactured (Device History Record).7 If necessary to ensure the safety of the medical device,
this information may be reviewed during inspection.

B.

Manufacturing Controls for Animal Tissue Components

FDA also recommends that you collect and document the information listed below for each
animal-derived material (and facility) used in device manufacture. Premarket submissions
should include information on the items identified below and the methods by which the risks
are mitigated8 if applicable. You may document this information in a premarket submission or
by reference to other regulatory submissions (e.g., Master File, PMA, 510(k)). The recommended
information is:
·

test methods and release criteria permitting animal tissues to be further processed and/or
combined with other animal tissue(s) or device components for manufacture;
quarantine procedures for tissues until they have met/failed release criteria;
test methods and acceptance criteria for assessing in-process and final product bioburden
or sterility; and
methods for facility decontamination/sterilization so that cross-contamination is avoided.

In addition, the manufacturing facility should document: 1) procedures for maintaining records
on the above cited items;9 2) all information outlined above on each lot of product
manufactured (Device History Record);10 and 3) information to validate the effectiveness of
manufacturing equipment cleaning, decontamination, and sterilization relative to the specific
pathogen exposure.11 If necessary to ensure the safety of the medical device, this information
may be reviewed during inspection.
The QS Regulation includes requirements related to the methods used in and the facilities and
controls used for designing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storing, installing, and

servicing of medical devices. Purchasing Controls, under 21 CFR 820.50, require final device
manufacturers to establish procedures that ensure all purchased or otherwise received products
and services conform to specified requirements, including those materials derived from animal
sources. The controls applied to manufacturing materials are expected to be appropriate to the
manufacturing material, the intended use, and the effect of the manufacturing materials on
safety and effectiveness (61 FR 52602, 52624). Further information on the QS Regulation for
certain premarket applications can be found in “Quality System Information for Certain
Premarket Application Reviews; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff.”12

When a viral pathogen in an animal tissue is part of the risk to the public health for a medical
device, we recommend that you consider the extent to which processing and sterilization can
inactivate or remove the virus(es). FDA recommendations for validating viral inactivation
methods are described below.
Virus Validation Studies
You should assess the processing methods and sterilization techniques used in product
manufacture for their ability to inactivate and remove viruses. Viral inactivation data are
usually determined by comparing an estimate of the amount of virus in the unprocessed source
material with the magnitude of virus inactivation /clearance provided by manufacturing and
sterilization processes. As suggested in ISO 22442 Part 3 (Section 5), a review of the published
literature should be performed to estimate the amount of virus in the unprocessed source
material and to optimize the design of the viral inactivation/elimination study (e.g., selection of
model viruses and processing steps to be evaluated). Such studies are generally performed
using a scaled down version of specific production and sterilization steps (e.g., acid extraction
of collagen or dry heat sterilization) with appropriate model viruses. The model viruses used in
these studies should be selected to reflect the actual viral contaminants that may be present in
the source animal tissue (e.g., DNA-based and RNA-based, enveloped and non-enveloped
viruses).
The results of your viral inactivation studies should demonstrate that the sum of the log10
reduction in virus from selected processing steps and sterilization process(es) (i.e., the overall
virus reduction factor) is sufficient to produce a safe product.14 For example, a device in which
virus has been reduced by at least six logs greater than the virus concentration estimated in the
unprocessed source material has historically been considered a safe device. A final report
describing these studies should be submitted in your premarket submission. This report should
discuss: 1) the animal species and tissue source material in the device as well as the amount of
virus(es) that might be present in the source material (as identified by in-house research or
published literature); 2) the appropriateness of the model viruses selected; 3) the relevance of
the conditions used in the virus inactivation studies to the commercial manufacturing methods;
and 4) why these studies demonstrate that the final product will be safe.
ISO 22442-3 and the referenced ICH document15 provide additional insight into the general
design and interpretation of viral clearance studies. ISO 22442-3 also recommends, whenever
possible, to determine kinetics of viral inactivation to determine the theoretical time necessary
to inactivate the total virus population. While such information can be valuable in specific
https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176, for more
information regarding requesting FDA feedback through the Pre-Submission process.

circumstances, FDA has found that measurement of the extent of viral inactivation at a single
time point, rather than the multiple time points required for a kinetic study, may provide
adequate evidence of viral clearance provided that: 1) the model system conditions evaluating
viral inactivation closely resemble the conditions of device manufacture; 2) the model viruses
tested accurately reflect the sensitivity of viral contaminates within the tissue to the inactivation
methods tested; and 3) the extent of viral clearance observed in the study is significantly greater
than the concentration of any pathogen present in the source tissue.
While data demonstrating the viral inactivation properties associated with manufacturing and
sterilization processes are often determined in laboratory studies with the intended product,
published literature demonstrating the viral inactivation parameters of device
manufacture/sterilization processes may be submitted in lieu of such testing when appropriate.
FDA recommends that literature information be submitted when: 1) the publication contains
sufficient information to evaluate the study results (e.g., test conditions, sample composition,
and the control studies performed to validate the test conditions); 2) information is provided
which explains why the published test samples accurately reflect your product; and 3)
information is provided which explains why the published viral inactivation procedures
accurately reflect your manufacturing/sterilization methods (e.g., reaction temperature, solution
pH and ionic strength, and time of product exposure to the inactivation step as well as the
concentration of proteins and other impurities in your product and the cited publication).
Finally, please note that viral inactivation studies are not generally recognized to reflect the
extent of prion contamination clearance or inactivation.

D. Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy-Specific
Issues
BSE is a degenerative disease that affects the central nervous system of cattle and is similar to
other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) found in sheep (scrapie), deer (chronic
wasting disease),16 and humans (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease or CJD and similar less common
diseases). Current data suggest that the incubation period of two to eight years after exposure is
required before BSE symptoms are detectable. Currently, there are no treatments for TSE
diseases and no validated screening tests that detect infection in a live animal or human.
Diagnosis is achieved by post-mortem microscopic examination of brain tissue, as well as
assays using ELISA, Western Blot, or other techniques that detect abnormal forms of the prion
protein.
The BSE infectious agent is widely theorized to be a prion (i.e., an abnormally folded form of a
normal protease-sensitive cellular prion protein [called PrPC or PrP(sen)]) that facilitates the
16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
conversion of additional normal cellular proteins to an abnormal misfolded infection-associated
protease-resistant prion structure (called PrP(res) or PrPTSE). PrP(res) has been detected in
bovine brain, spinal cord, eye, ileum, lymph nodes, proximal colon, spleen, tonsil, dura mater,
pineal gland, placenta, cerebrospinal fluid, pituitary, adrenal, distal colon, nasal mucosa,
peripheral nerves, bone marrow, liver, lung, pancreas, and thymus.17 The detection of TSE
infectivity in other tissues may occur in the future after data become available from more
sensitive assays or larger animal studies. Transmission has been experimentally demonstrated
in animal studies.18 The TSE agent is known to be extremely resistant to traditional forms of
disinfection and sterilization. Please refer to FDA’s website regarding BSE, available at
https://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/ComplianceEnforcement/BovineSpongiformEncephalo
pathy/ucm2006517.htm, for the most current information.19
Given the long incubation times before disease onset, the absence of a validated screening test
for live animals, and vCJD’s fatal outcome, we recommend that you collect and document the
following information, in addition to the information listed in Sections A and B above, in your
premarket submission for any material derived from ruminant animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, goats,
cervids such as deer and elk) that have the potential to incubate a TSE infection:
·
·

·

·
·

whether animals were sourced from a country with Negligible, Controlled or Unknown
BSE risk (per OIE);20,21
information concerning the long-term health of the herd (e.g., documented breeding
history, animal traceability, absence of TSE disease and the surveillance program to
detect a TSE);
the animal feed composition (e.g., animal feed history records, including recordation of
commingling of feeds, and labeling of animal feed composition at distribution locations)
(note that in 2008, FDA issued a final rule prohibiting certain material from being fed to
ruminants, see 73 FR 22719);
the animal stunning and slaughter methods that reduce the risk of cross contaminating
non-TSE tissues with material from tissues that could contain TSE; and
the specifics of the ante mortem and/or postmortem inspections (e.g., gross visual
inspection, specific organs and anomalies exams, lab tests such as PrPTSE testing).

In addition, the manufacturing facility should document 1) procedures for maintaining records

on the above cited items22 and 2) all information outlined above on each lot of product
manufactured (Device History Record).23 If necessary to ensure the safety of the medical
device, this information may be reviewed during inspection.
Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that the residence time of TSE-infectious material
on surfaces is unknown and methods to completely assure removal of TSE-infectious material
from surfaces have yet to be fully defined. Cleaning processes developed to remove surface
contamination in abattoirs after exposure to potentially TSE-infected animals (e.g., cattle,
sheep, cervids such as deer or elk) may not have been fully characterized or validated for more
critical sites or equipment used to manufacture devices. Therefore, for facilities involved in
device manufacture using tissue from potentially TSE-infected animals, your documentation
should also identify when/whether any potentially TSE-infected material may have been
previously processed in the facility and what steps were taken to address any potential
contamination. This information could include the information previously discussed under
“Manufacturing Controls for Animal Tissue Components” in section IV.B. of this guidance and
the dates of previous tissue processing (see also 21 CFR 820.50).
Because screening assays cannot ensure TSE-free tissues from cows or other ruminant
animals, the methods discussed above (e.g., monitoring animal feed, controlling animal
husbandry, and tissue handling) reflect the best available approaches for preparing safe
medical devices from animal tissue. However, when a TSE-screening assay is validated to
accurately identify TSE-contaminated tissues, FDA will consider revising this guidance as
appropriate and recommending that such a test be introduced into the standard operating
procedures for tissue collection and processing.
