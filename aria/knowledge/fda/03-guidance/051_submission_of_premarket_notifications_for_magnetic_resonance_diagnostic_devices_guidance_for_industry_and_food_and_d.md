Submission of Premarket Notifications
for Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic
Devices
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or
the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or Office
responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document provides a detailed description of the information that should be included in
a premarket notification for a magnetic resonance diagnostic device (MRDD). This document is
intended to be used in conjunction with information regarding the content and format of a 510(k)
premarket notification1. The approach outlined in this guidance document is intended to facilitate the
timely review and marketing clearance of MRDDs.
The guidance reflects an update to harmonize with the 4th edition of the FDA recognized standard
IEC 60601-2-33 Medical electrical equipment - Part 2-33: Particular requirements for the basic
safety and essential performance of magnetic resonance equipment for medical diagnosis. In the 4th
edition of IEC 60601-2-33, the main magnetic field (B0) hazard area was re-defined as anywhere
where the magnetic field is equal to or greater than 0.9 mT as the space around MR equipment where
the static magnetic field can cause harm. Prior versions of IEC 60601-2-33 had defined this
controlled access area as 0.5 mT. For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus
standard(s) referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 If
submitting a Declaration of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the
appropriate supporting documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in

regulatory submissions, refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”3
MRDDs are also electronic products under section 531(2) of Subchapter C (Electronic Product
Radiation Control (EPRC)) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). As such,
MRDDs are subject to the radiological health requirements in Title 21, Subchapter J, Parts 1000
through 1050 of the Code of Federal Regulations, including applicability of general and specific
performance standards (21 CFR Parts 1010-1050) and other general requirements for reporting and
recordkeeping (21 CFR Part 1002), notification and corrective actions for defective or non-compliant
electronic products (21 CFR Parts 1003 and 1004), and importation (21 CFR Part 1005).
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. Instead,
guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word
should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
This document is applicable to MRDDs as defined in 21 CFR 892.1000:
21 CFR 892.1000: Magnetic resonance diagnostic device.
(a) Identification. A magnetic resonance diagnostic device is intended for general diagnostic
use to present images which reflect the spatial distribution and/or magnetic resonance spectra
which reflect frequency and distribution of nuclei exhibiting nuclear magnetic resonance.
Other physical parameters derived from the images and/or spectra may also be produced. The
device includes hydrogen-1 (proton) imaging, sodium-23 imaging, hydrogen-1 spectroscopy,
phosphorus-31 spectroscopy, and chemical shift imaging (preserving simultaneous frequency
and spatial information).
(b) Classification. Class II.
MRDDs are Class II medical devices that require premarket notification and an agency determination
of substantial equivalence prior to marketing. Three product codes are currently used to identify these
devices:
LNH – Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging System
LNI – Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic System
MOS - Magnetic Resonance Specialty Coil
The principal components of current MRDDs include the main magnet, shim and gradient systems,
radiofrequency transmitter and receiver, transmit and receive coils, power supplies, computer and
software, patient supports, and physiological gating devices.

Contain Nonbinding Recommendations
This guidance document is applicable to premarket notifications for magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) systems, components, and accessories, and
modifications to systems, components, and accessories, which could significantly affect the safety or
effectiveness of the MRDD and trigger the need for premarket notification submission prior to
marketing.
The information in this guidance document is also applicable to the MRI system components of dualmodality devices, such as PET/MRI systems.

III. Relevant Standards
Standards may be used only when applicable (section 514(c)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act); not all
standards specified below are applicable to all MRDD 510(k) submissions.

A.

NEMA Standards

Standards promulgated by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) provide
standardized test methods for the assessment of performance and safety parameters for MRDDs. The
NEMA standards only prescribe standard measurement methods and do not specify acceptance
criteria. You should define acceptance criteria for your device. FDA will evaluate acceptance criteria
on a case-by-case basis depending on the intended use and specific technological characteristics of
your device. NEMA test methods recognized by FDA include:

Contain Nonbinding Recommendations
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard, IEC 60601-2-33 Medical Electrical
equipment – Part 2-33: Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of
magnetic resonance equipment for medical diagnosis, is the international standard for the safety of
magnetic resonance equipment intended for medical diagnosis. IEC 60601-2-33 provides particular
specifications for magnetic resonance diagnostic equipment and takes precedence over the
specifications provided in the general IEC 60601 series.
The NEMA standards for measuring acoustic noise (NEMA MS 4) and SAR (NEMA MS 8) have
been incorporated into IEC 60601-2-33. However, IEC 60601-2-33 does not address performance
issues, such as SNR, image uniformity, geometric distortion and slice thickness.

Other Applicable Standards

ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and Testing
within a Risk Management Process. This standard applies to patient-contacting materials in
MRDDs.
NEMA PS 3.1 - 3.20 Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM). This
standard specifies formats for the digital exchange of medical images.
ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1 Medical electrical equipment - Part 1: General Requirements for
Basic Safety and Essential Performance

Safety and Essential Performance - Collateral standard: Electromagnetic Disturbances Requirements and tests

IV. Describing Your Device in a 510(k) Premarket Notification
When submitting a 510(k) premarket notification for a MRDD, you must include the information
required under 21 CFR 807.87. You should identify your device by regulation and product code and
should also include the information below.

A.

Indications for Use

You should describe with particularity, as described below, the Indications for Use (IFU) for your
device. The device labeling, training materials, performance claims, promotional materials, and any
other materials in the submission should all be consistent with the IFU.
Specific clinical indications (for example, disease identification or rule-out, diagnosis or prognosis
with respect to disease staging or severity, and prevention or reduction in morbidity and/or mortality
associated with particular diseases) are beyond the scope of this document. While the Agency
handles each such application on an individual basis, the Agency believes that clinical studies are
4

Contain Nonbinding Recommendations
often necessary to support such specific clinical indications. Prior to the submission of any such
application, you are encouraged to contact the Agency to discuss the level of supporting evidence
required and clinical trial study design. For information on FDA’s Q-submission process, refer to
FDA guidance titled “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The QSubmission Program.”4
MRDDs often contain protocols recommended for specific applications (for example, adult abdomen,
pediatric brain, etc.). For MRDDs, these specific protocols do not necessarily create a new specific
indication for the MRDD, provided that disease-specific or diagnostic claims are not made. For
example, a “Pediatric Brain” protocol would be acceptable under a general IFU, but a “Pediatric
Epilepsy Foci identification” protocol would likely be interpreted as a new specific indication.
The Indications for Use for radiofrequency (RF) coils and accessory devices should specify the MRI
system(s) with which the devices are intended to be used. The level of detail necessary will depend
upon the individual device and the MRI systems with which it is intended to be used. For example,
FDA generally believes that specifying the manufacturer and field strength of the compatible MRI
system is appropriate for an RF coil.

B.

the FDA guidance titled “Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of Medical Devices”8.
If your MRDD incorporates wireless technology for data communication meeting the IEC 60601-1-2
standard is insufficient to demonstrate that the wireless technology will not be susceptible to
electromagnetic interferences and continue to perform as intended. For additional information, refer
to the FDA guidance titled “Radio-Frequency Wireless Technology in Medical Devices”9.

VI. Physical Laboratory Testing
To demonstrate the substantial equivalence of your MRDD, you should provide the performance
testing specified below. A number of the tests specified below can be performed in accordance with
FDA-recognized consensus standards.
Not all of the testing below is applicable to all accessories. You should perform testing of relevant
characteristics that may affect safety and effectiveness.

A.

Performance

To demonstrate the performance of your MRDD, you should include an assessment of image quality
metrics (such as signal-to-noise ratio, geometric distortion, image uniformity, slice thickness, and
spatial resolution), as well as spectroscopy performance. The measurement method used should be
specified for all testing, including for the performance metrics outlined below:

(1)
·
·
·

·
·

Imaging

Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) – The measured SNR value as well as pre-determined pass/fail
acceptance criteria for all coils included in the scope of the submission.
Geometric Distortion – Distortion measured in all three slice orientations (sagittal, coronal
and transverse) as well as pre-determined pass/fail acceptance criteria.
Image Uniformity – Image uniformity measurements and/or gray-scale uniformity maps, as
well as pre-determined pass/fail acceptance criteria for all coils included in the scope of the
submission.
Slice Thickness – Full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) values as well as pre-determined
pass/fail acceptance criteria.
Spatial Resolution – High contrast spatial resolution of the system demonstrated using
suitable phantoms for the clinical pulse sequence protocols using the smallest field of view
(FOV).

·

Image contrast validation – The image contrast behavior for new pulse sequences. For
example, fat saturation pulse sequences should demonstrate adequate fat signal suppression in
a phantom composed of fat and water.

(2)

Spectroscopy

No standardized tests have been developed for magnetic resonance spectroscopy performance. FDA
recommends the following performance testing for systems with spectroscopy scan protocols. All test
results should be accompanied by a description of the test methods used, including the pulse
sequences and coils utilized, and the geometry and composition of the phantoms. The target
anatomical region and the RF hardware used should be specified. Phantom testing should include
performance characteristic such as:
· Spatial Localization Accuracy – Comparison of desired and actual volume
· Spectral Resolution – Full-width-half-maximum of the water resonance using the clinical
protocols (for example, single voxel or chemical shift imaging)
· Signal to Noise Ratio – Ratio of peak amplitude to standard deviation of background for key
metabolites (for example, N-Acetyl aspartate or lactate)
· Water suppression – Ratio of area of water peak with and without suppression
· Decoupling – Comparison of SNR with and without decoupling
· Spectral Data Processing – Validation of spectral post-processing techniques

B.

Safety

To demonstrate the safety of your MRDD, you should address acoustic noise, gradient-induced
electric fields, RF energy deposition and biocompatibility and flammability of patient-contacting
materials as outlined below.

(1)

Acoustic Noise

You should measure the acoustic output of your system and specify the measurement method used
(for example, maximum gradient acoustic noise or maximum clinical acoustic noise). You should
report unweighted peak sound pressure level (Lpeak) and the time integral of the A-weighted sound
pressure level (LAeq).

(2)

Gradient-induced Nerve Stimulation

For gradient systems capable of producing dB/dt greater than 20 T/s, you should conduct volunteer
studies with a minimum of 11 subjects to determine the threshold value for mild and painful
peripheral nerve stimulation. If painful stimulation can be induced in your system, you should also
determine the threshold of painful stimulation and provide an explanation of how painful stimulation
is avoided.

(3)

RF Energy Deposition

For volume-transmit coils, you should measure whole-body averaged, head averaged, and/or partial
body SAR values. You should specify the test method used (for example, pulse energy or
calorimetry). You should report both the measured and the scanner-displayed SAR values and should
specify the uncertainty boundaries for all reported SAR values.
10

Contain Nonbinding Recommendations

For surface transmit coils, you should measure local 10g-averaged SAR values. You should report
both the measured and the scanner-displayed SAR values and include uncertainty boundaries for all
reported SAR values.
For multi-channel transmit coils, you should provide a discussion of how the peak local (10gaveraged) SAR values in your system compare to peak values in quadrature volume coils that
conform to the current whole-body and whole-head IEC 60601-2-33 SAR limits. This discussion
should encompass the entire patient population and anatomical scan landmarks for which your device
is indicated. If computational models are used to support substantial equivalence, these models
should be accompanied by validation and uncertainty data. You should include uncertainty
boundaries for all reported SAR values.

(4)

Surface Heating of RF Receive Coils

To ensure patient safety and prevent thermal injury to patients undergoing MR exams, you should
measure the temperature rise of all receive-only coils included with the system. The results reported
to FDA should include an assessment of why the measured temperature rise is acceptable and does
not pose a risk to patients. FDA recommends that temperature be measured at locations in the coil
pre-determined to be the local hot spots, and that you conduct this test for the coil in the normal
operating condition, and for the single fault condition of the coil left in the bore of the magnet
unplugged.

(5)

Biocompatibility

You should address biocompatibility for any patient-contacting materials. For additional information,
refer to FDA guidance titled “Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1 “Biological evaluation of
medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process””10.

(6)

Fixed parameter options

If fixed parameter options (such as FPO: B) are implemented on your system, you should
demonstrate that your device operates within the FPO limits.

VII. Clinical Images
You should provide sample clinical images to support the ability of your system to generate
diagnostic quality images.
For newly introduced systems, you should provide sample clinical images for all pulse sequences.
If a pulse sequence is employed in multiple clinical protocols, the sample clinical images should
support the ability of the pulse sequence to achieve the desired contrast characteristics in those
clinical protocols. Scientific rationale and a limited set of sample clinical images may be adequate to
support the use of a pulse sequence across multiple protocols.

11

Contain Nonbinding Recommendations

You should provide images to the Agency in electronic DICOM format. You should remove any
patient identifiers prior to submitting images to FDA. FDA requests that all images be accompanied
by a description of the target anatomical site, scan parameters employed, and the total imaging time.
In lieu of submitting the full set of sample clinical images to the Agency, you may provide a
statement from a U.S. Board Certified radiologist attesting that images produced by the device are of
sufficient quality for diagnostic use. A description of the sequences and anatomical regions reviewed
by the radiologist should be provided. Any issues with image evaluation or image quality should be
fully explained. In addition, you should provide a small, representative subset of clinical images.

VIII.

Device Modifications

In accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device change or modification “that could significantly
affect the safety or effectiveness of the device” or represents “a major change or modification in the
intended use of the device” requires a new 510(k).11 The changes or modifications listed below are
examples of changes that FDA believes may require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is
not exhaustive but provides examples of modifications that will generally require submission of a
new 510(k). For additional details, see FDA guidances “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a
Change to an Existing Device”12 and “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to
an Existing Device.”13

·

Main Static Magnetic Field. FDA considers a change in the main static magnetic field to be
a significant change or modification in design and has determined that this change could
significantly affect both the safety and effectiveness of the device by altering the system’s
resonant frequency. Thus, modifications to the main static magnetic field generally require a
new 510(k). You should support this modification with testing for SNR, geometric distortion,
and image uniformity (all measured over the system’s maximum FOV). Additionally, you

Section 3308 of the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, FDORA added section 515C “Predetermined
Change Control Plans for Devices” to the FD&C Act (Pub. L. No. 117-328). Under section 515C, FDA may under certain
circumstances approve or clear a predetermined change control plan (PCCP) for a device that describes planned changes
that may be made to a device and that would otherwise require a supplemental premarket approval application or a new
premarket notification. For example, section 515C provides that a supplemental premarket approval application (section
515C(a)) or a new premarket notification (section 515C(b)) is not required for a change to a a previously approved or
cleared device if the change is consistent with a PCCP that is approved or cleared by FDA. Section 515C also provides
that FDA may require that a PCCP include labeling required for safe and effective use of the device as such device
changes pursuant to such plan, notification requirements if the device does not function as intended pursuant to such plan,
and performance requirements for changes made under the plan. If you are interested in proposing a PCCP in your
marketing submission, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in further discussion with CDRH. See

should also provide measurement of magnetic field homogeneity and stability of the field
(ppm/hr) over a prolonged period of time.
Gradient System. FDA considers a change to the gradient system to be a significant change
or modification in the design of the device and has determined that this change could
significantly affect both the safety and effectiveness of the MRI system by altering the PNS
potential, slice selection efficacy, and acoustic output of the system. Thus, modifications to
the gradient system generally require a new 510(k). Changes to the gradient system should be
supported by measurement of geometric distortion and slice profile thickness (with a
representative volume coil), as well as an assessment of the acoustic output of the system.
Any changes to PNS control should also be provided.
RF Body Transmit Coil. FDA considers a change to the integrated RF body transmit coil to
be a significant modification in design and has determined that this change could
significantly affect the safety and effectiveness of the system by modifying the RF energy
output. Thus, modifications to the integrated RF body transmit coil generally require a new
510(k). Such modifications should be supported by testing for RF energy deposition, SNR,
and image uniformity.
Other Transmit Coils. Modifications to transmit coils other than the integrated RF body
transmit coil may also require a 510(k) submission. Changes in coil transmit architecture are
usually a significant change or modification in design that could significantly affect both the
safety (e.g., heating) of the coil as well as effectiveness (e.g., image quality) of the MRI
system. Thus, modifications to the coil transmit architecture generally require a new 510(k).
The 510(k) should include testing for RF energy deposition, coil surface heating,
biocompatibility (if patient contacting), SNR, and image uniformity. However, changes in
material type, formulation, chemical composition, or material processing for non-patient
contacting coil housing materials are unlikely to significantly affect safety and effectiveness,
and thus, do not generally require a new 510(k) submission. When deciding whether a 510(k)
is needed for modification of transmit coils, you should consider whether modifications have
been made to the intended use, design, or technological characteristics of the device and the
impact of such modifications.
RF Receive Coils. FDA considers the introduction of a new RF receive-only coil to be a
significant modification in design and has determined that this change could significantly
affect the safety and effectiveness of the device by altering the performance of the system.
Thus, the introduction of a new RF receive-only coil generally requires a new 510(k). Such a
510(k) submission should include testing for SNR, image uniformity, coil surface heating,
and biocompatibility (if intended to contact the patient). Modification of existing RF receiveonly coils may or may not require a 510(k) submission depending on the modifications being
made. Changes in material type, formulation, chemical composition, or material processing
for non-patient contacting coil housing materials are unlikely to affect safety and
effectiveness of the device, and thus, such changes are unlikely to require a new 510(k).
Pulse Sequences. The introduction of a new pulse sequence or a modification of a pulse
sequence may or may not require a 510(k) submission. For example, introduction of a metal
artifact reduction pulse sequence is usually a major change or modification in the intended
use of the device that significantly affects safety or effectiveness. Thus, such modification
would generally require a new 510(k). Performance data should include an assessment of
SNR and appropriate contrast behavior, as well as data supporting the intended use of the

pulse sequence. Modifications of previously-cleared pulse sequences that do not affect
intended use generally do not require a new 510(k) submission.
Protocols. Modifications to protocols may or may not require a 510(k) submission. For
example, the addition of a pediatric epilepsy foci identification protocol is generally
considered a major change or modification in the intended use of the MRDD that significantly
affects safety or effectiveness. Thus, such a modification would generally require a new
510(k). Factors that should be considered in determining whether a 510(k) is needed include
changes to target anatomical area, desired contrast characteristics, coil restrictions, and
contrast media requirements. Re-ordering of existing pulse sequences within an existing
protocol would generally not require a new 510(k), as the intended use and technology
generally remain unaltered.
A new 510(k) is generally not required for the addition of a protocol to a new device model if
the protocol has been cleared in another model manufactured by the same manufacturer, and
has similar technological characteristics as the model in which the protocol has been cleared.

IX. Labeling
You must include in the 510(k) submission labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of
21 CFR 807.87(e). For a MRDD, such labeling should include the following items:

conservative limit, manufacturers may also continue to recommend 0.5 mT as the controlled access
area in their labeling. Recommendations for the size and shape of this area based on the fringe field
of the MRDD in all three dimensions should be specified, accompanied by a sketch.
The need for the controlled access area should be explained. You should provide recommendations
