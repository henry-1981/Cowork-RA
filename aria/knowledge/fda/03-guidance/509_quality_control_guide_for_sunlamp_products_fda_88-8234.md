FOREWORD
In October 1982, the Food and Drug Administration established the Center for
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) by merging the Bureau of Medical Devices and
the Bureau of Radiological Health.
The Center develops and implements national programs to protect the public health
in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are intended to

assure the safety, effectiveness and proper labeling of medical devices, to control
unnecessary human exposure to potentially hazardous ionizing and nonionizing radiation,
and to ensure the safe, efficacious use of such radiation.
The Center publishes the results of its work in scientific journals and in its own
technical reports.
These reports provide a mechanism for disseminating results of
CDRH and contractor projects. They are sold by the Government Printing Office and/or
the National Technical Information Service.
Also, CDRH technical reports in radiological health are made available to the World
Health Organization (WHO) under a memorandum of agreement between WHO and the
Department of Health and Human Services.
Three WHO Collaborating Centers,
established under the Bureau of Radiological Health, continue to function under CDRH:
WHO Collaborating Center for Standardization of Protection Against Nonionizing
Radiations;
WHO Collaborating Center for Training and General Tasks in Radiation Medicine;

and
WHO Collaborating Center for Nuclear Medicine.
We welcome your comments and requests for further information.

PREFACE
The Performance Standard for Sunlamp Products (21 CFR 1040.20) became effective
May 7, 1980, and was amended effective September 8, 1986. Sunlamp products and
ultraviolet lamps manufactured on or after that date must conform to the applicable
provisions of the standard. In addition, manufacturers are required to certify that their
products comply with the standard and to furnish reports, to the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health, that clearly substantiate the product's compliance. Because sunlamp products are also medical devices, they are subject to the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) regulations developed under the authority of that Act.
All manufacturers of sunlamps and sunlamp products and ultraviolet lamps must establish and
implement GMPs to ensure that the devices conform to their specifications, and implement quality control procedures to ensure compliance with the Federal performance
standard.
This guide has been prepared to assist manufacturers in satisfying the G MP requirements and in developing and implementing quality assurance programs, including
appropriate testing. This guide also provides what we believe to be fair and standard
criteria by which manufacturers' programs will be evaluated. Because of variation in
product designs and manufacturing processes, a detailed step-by-step protocol would be
of limited application. The purpose here, therefore, is to set forth a general description
of the procedures and philosophy of quality assurance as appropriate for sunlamp
products and ultraviolet lamps. This document is intended for use in conjunction with
the "Reporting Guide for Initial Reports and Model Change Reports on Sunlamps and
Sunlamp Products."
We strongly emphasize that the manufacturer may adopt other alternative procedures that are equivalent to, or are as effective as, those methods described in this
guide. Each manufacturer's test procedures and testing program will be evaluated on an
individual case-by-case basis. If the alternative procedures constitute good manufacturing practices and provide adequate safeguards to ensure compliance with the
standard,
the Center
for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) would have no
to disapprove
such a program.
. reason
However, neither the fact that CDRH did not disapprove a testing program, nor the
fact that such a program was established pursuant to this guide, relieves a manufacturer
from his obligations to comply with the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of
1968 and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended.

HHS Publication

Sunlamp products and ultraviolet lamps manufactured on or after May 7,
1980 must conform to applicable portions of a performance standard (21 CFR
1040.20, amended effective September 8,1986), and their manufacture must be
in accord with the medical devices Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regulations promulgated under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C). This
guide is intended to assist manufacturers of these products in satisfying both the
GMP requirements and in developing and implementing quality assurance (QA)
programs. This guide provides the criteria and the underlying philosophy used by
FDA to evaluate manufacturers' QA programs. This document is intended to be
used in conjunction with "Reporting Guide for Initial Reports and Model Change

QUALITY CONTROL GUIDE FOR SUNLAMP PRODUCTS

1. QUALITY ASSURANCEPROGRAM
1.1 ELEMENTS OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM
A viable quality assurance program ensures the performance of a product at a
designated level at the time of manufacture and throughout its useful life.
It is
essential for a manufacturer to establish such a program to ensure compliance of a
product with the Federal performance standard and its conformance with design
specifications. The adequacy of a specific quality assurance and testing program must
be judged solely on its own merits and applicability to the product. The essential
elements of a quality assurance program include the following:
1. proper organization, personnel, facilities,
sure an objective and defensible program;

and administrative

procedures to en-

2. preproduction evaluation and testing of the product and testing of components
and material obtained from other manufacturers;

3. valid measurement techniques, calibrations, and treatment of measurement
uncertainties;
4. testing and evaluation of the product during and after production and statistical
analyses of data (the establishment of confidence limits and rejection criteria are
important components of such an evaluation);
5. procedures to ensure that only accepted units are distributed and that any
rejected units, if modified and recycled back into the production sequence,
undergo the same level of scrutiny as other units that have been found acceptable;

6. an audit procedure to measurethe degree of conformance and the effectiveness
of the quality assurance program, including product audits;
7. lifetime
whether

and reliability
testing procedures or other suitable means to determine
the product will continue to meet its design specifications
during its

usefullif e;
8. a continuous review of the product's performance throughout its useful life and a
procedure to ensure that any problems discovered are corrected, and that appropriate design changes are made to eliminate them from subsequent units
produced;
9. documentation control to assure that all manufacturing, component, and finished
product specifications adequately renect the product design and provide an
effective and consistent mechanism for changes of specifications or quality
control procedures; and
10. quality control records, including a device master record and a device history

record.

1.2 OBJECTIVITY OF PROGRAM
The quality assurance program should be carefully designed and administered to
ensure the objectivity of the program. Certain safeguards against personal prejudice
and conflicting interests should be built into the system to avoid biased decisions. This
may present a problem in small manufacturing firms that employ only a few persons.
However, the division of responsibility between production and quality control personnel
should be maintained. This may be accomplished, for example, if one person, who is
responsible for the receiving, inspection, and accountability of components, is also
designed responsible for in-process checks and finished product inspection. Another
person should be held responsible for all the production processes. This arrangement (or
similar ones) may sustain the objectivity of the quality control program by dividing the
responsibilities.
1.3 DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS
Complete documentation of the quality assurance program must be maintained as
required by 21 CFR 1002.30. This should include such items as description of tests
performed and their sequence, description of the measurement instrumentation and
techniques, rejection criteria or confidence limits and justification for choosing such
limits, methods of data analysis and sampling plans. If all the units produced are not
tested, a sampling technique must be used and must be scrupulously documented and
followed.
Standardized forms for data recording should be used. The forms should
provide space for logging all information relevant ,to the product and the test, including
the product model and serial numbers, date of test, date of manufacture, samples per
lot, results of test, identification of personnel performing and reviewing the test, and
model and serial numbers of test instruments. A device master record as required by 21
CFR 820.181 must be established for each type of device and include, or refer to the
location of, the information concerning:

1. the device specification, including drawings and componentspecifications;
2. production process specifications, including the appropriate equipment specifications, production methods, and production procedures;
3. packaging and labeling specifications; and
4. quality assurance procedures and specifications, including quality assurance
checks used and the quality assurance apparatus used. The device master record
shall be prepared, dated, and signed by a designated individual(s).
A device history record as required by 21 CFR 820.184 must also be maintained and
it shall include, or refer to the location of, the information concerning the dates of
manufacture, the quantity manufactured, the quantity released for distribution, and any
control number used.
Among small manufacturers of sunlamp products, the manufacturing process may be
limited to assembling components into the final product, and there should be no problem
with communication and managing operations. In this situation, written manufacturing
procedures may be reduced to a practical extent. In some cases, training and work
experience may be considered valid substitutes for written manufacturing procedures.
However, manufacturers must still ensure uniformity of procedures and keep records of
test results necessary to ensure the quality of the product.

2

Records required by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act are to be kept
for 5 years (21 CFR 1002.31(a», and for no less than 2 years if required by the Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR 820.180(b». Test records, complaints, trends analyses,
failure analyses, and audits should be used to identify and provide solutions to quality

assuranceproblems.
1.4 VALIDITY OF MEASUREMENT
A valid program of measurements made as part of quality assurance testing involves
periodic evaluation of the test methods and calibration of the instruments. A schedule
to recalibrate measuring instruments against an acceptable standard is important to
ensure a consistent measurement capability. Calibration services from the instrument
manufacturer or other qualified outside sources, with traceability to National Bureau of
Standards primary measurement standards, should be used when adequate calibration
facilities are not available within a company.
The instrumentation should be carefully specified and selected to ensure that it is
capable of performing the tests required by the standard. For example, instruments for
ultraviolet (UV) radiation measurements should have sufficient spectral sensitivity in
the UV region to measure the anticipated radiation levels from the product. After the
measurement instruments have been obtained, they need to be evaluated for proper
performance and operation. Control charts and logs of instrument performance and
calibrations are essential, as well as service and maintenance schedules. Any changes of
the operator, or in the instrument, its components, its techniques of use, calibration
standards, or other relevant components of the measurements system should be documented.
..

~;:

1.5 AUDIT PROCEDURES
The purpose of the quality audit is to check the degree of conformance of the quality
control procedures and the effectiveness of the quality assurance program, and to
ensure that all procedures established are adequate and consistently followed.
The
quality audits are in addition to the routine quality assurance program and should
include, but not be limited to, product audits. A product audit is an independent
evaluation of product quality to determine if the product complies with the standards
and if the product conforms to design specifications.
Random sampling is the only
acceptable method in selecting units for product audit. The person responsible for the
audit should not have responsibility for the matter being audited but must have
sufficient training and experience in the manufacturing process and testing procedures.
For small manufacturers, a simple checklist with appropriate instructions may suffice.
Documentation of audits and their results must be kept; results of findings should be
reviewed by management. Audit frequency should be consistent with findings, but the
interval between audits should not exceed 1 year.
1.6 PERSONNEL TRAINING
All quality assurance and production personnel shall have the necessary training to
perform their assigned responsibilities adequately.
They should have a thorough
understanding of their jobs and be made aware of defects and errors likely to be encountered in performing their assigned functions.

3

2. PREPRODUCTIONEVALUATION
Preproduction evaluation and testing should include a review of the design,
evaluation of components and material obtained from other manufacturers, and
engineering and prototype testing to confirm that the product as designed can be
manufactured in compliance with the standard and in conformance with the design

specifications.
2.1 DESIGN REVIEW
Before the manufacture of the product begins, the product design must be reviewed
to determine if the product will comply with the Federal performance standard and
other applicable criteria for product safety, including electrical and mechanical safety.
This review allows the manufacturer to perform a step-by-step evaluation of the
requirements for the product and the means used to fulfill these requirements.
In
addition to the performance requirements, the conditions and environments under which
the product will be used should be considered carefully.
For example, if a product is
intended to be used at a commercial facility and an alternate timer such as a coin box is
permitted, then a mechanism must be incorporated into the coin box to allow the user to
terminate exposure before completion of the timer cycle and to prevent the timer from
operating continuously in excess of the recommended maximum exposure time. The
coin box timer must also provide intermediate exposure times compatible with the
recommended schedule. The goggles should be evaluated to ensure adequate eye
protection for the user under all possible exposure positions and uses. The location of
controls, particularly the radiation emission control, should be convenient for the user
to reach in case of emergency. The contents and locations of the required labels should
be carefully reviewed to assure they comply with the standard and policies.
The
development of a recommended exposure schedule for the particular product design is of
utmost importance and should be checked against the agency guidelines. In general, an
adequate safety factor regarding the use of the product should be built into the product
design, because the product is not only expected to be in compliance at the time of
manufacture but also during its entire useful life (see Appendix B for details of

compliance requirements).
Further, the manufacturing process must be reviewed to assure that the design basis
for the product, components, and packaging is correctly translated into approved
specifications.
The approved design specifications
must be adequately documented.
The
manufacturing process must be described in writing and implemented according to the
written description in order to ensure the finished product is manufactured acording to
the approved design. Any changes in the design and/or manufacturing process must be
reviewed, approved, and dated before implementation.
2.2 ENGINEERING AND PROTOTYPE TESTING AND EVALUATION
Engineering models and prototypes should be built and tested thoroughly to ensure
that the product can be manufactured as designed and be in compliance with the

performance standard during the product's useful life.

4

This testing must include adequate transportation tests, tests of performance under
expected environmental condidtions, use and abuse testing, and accelerated life tests.
A consistent effort is required to keep drawings and prototypes up-to-date and accurate.
Any design changes must be properly documented, tested, and evaluated in relation to
product safety.
3. COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTION TESTING
3.1 COMPONENT EVALUATION AND TESTING
Components should be received, stored, and handled in a manner to prevent damage,
mixup, contamination, and other adverse consequences. Components should be inspected, sampled, and tested for conformance to specifications because certain components can affect the compliance of ultraviolet lamps and/or sunlamp products. For
example:, glass structure or an electrical or mechanical component, such as timer,
eyewear, or emission control, will definitely affect the product's compliance. (Tags and
labels are also important for compliance.)
Whether such components are fabricated by the manufacturer of the ultraviolet
sunlamp or sunlamp product, or purchased from a vendor, proper evaluation of the
components is essential in determining if the ultraviolet or sunlamp product will comply
with the applicable standard after manufacture. Manufacturers who obtain components
from different vendors may choose to rely on a supplier's certificate of analysis and
approval in lieu of component testing. These certificates should be made part of the
quality assurance documentation.
However, the responsibility for product compliance rests with the manufacturer of
the final product rather than with the supplier of components or material. Therefore,
any decision to totally rely on a supplier's evaluation must be carefully considered; some
type of incoming acceptance examination or testing is recommended. An exception
applies to the lamp manufacturers' certification of compliance for their UV lamps. This
certification is acceptable because the lamp manufacturers are legally liable for the
validity of that certification.
In general, three points must be considered in evaluating components prior to their
use in the ultraviolet lamp or sunlamp product.
1. Performance specification for components should be developed, taking into
consideration both the requirements of the performance standard and a tolerance
analysis of the product. A tolerance analysis is a calculation of a product's
performance range that can result from component variations. Such an analysis
would, whenever possible, be experimentally validated.
2. All components should be tested to verify that their performance is within the
range of specifications required of them by the manufacturer of the final
product. Switches and timers may need to undergo accelerated life testing to
ensure reliability.
Durability and ruggedness of, such components may be appropriately tested under expected environmental conditons. Components also may
be appropriately tested after assembly of a subsystem or entire product.
3. If at any time the design specifications or materials of a component are changed,
the design of the entire product should be reviewed to ensure that the change
does not in any way affect the compliance of the product with the performance
standard.

3.2 PRODUCTIONTESTING
In designing the production quality assurance and testing program, it is first
necessary to identify the parameters that need to be examined or tested in order to
determine compliance with the performance standard. The identification and critical
nature of these parameters depend to a large extent upon the design, function, and
anticipated use of a specific product.
Some examples of such parameters are the
irradiance ratio, reliability of timers and switches, the inclusion and durability of labels,
mechanical construction, electrical safety, and so forth. Some examinations or tests
may consist of simple inspections. For example, the product should be inspected to
determine that all labels are in the correct positions and properly attached to the
product.
However, other tests, such as those involving the irradiance ratio of the
ultraviolet lamp or sunlamp product and the spectral transmittance of the protective
eyewear, are more complicated and require design of test methods and the use of
defensible measurement instrumentation and techniques.
Testing will be of two types: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative testing refers
to a functional test of performance features and inspections, such as tests that confirm
the inclusion of labels or instructional material.
Quantitative testing refers to the
measurement of variable parameters such as the spectral irradiance of the ultraviolet
lamp. Individual tests may be designed for each parameter.
Rejection or acceptance criteria need to be determined for different tests.
In
qualitative tests, it is easy to establish the criteria because one is faced with a "has" or
"has not" or "functions" or "does not function" situation. The establishment of rejection
or acceptance criteria for the quantitative test is more involved. An example is the
measurement of ultraviolet radiation from an ultraviolet la~p.
The rejection or
acceptance criteria must assure the manufacturer that ultraviolet radiation is within
the irradiance ratio limits for sunlamp products as specified in the sunlamp products
performance standard, even when the total measurement uncertainty is taken into
account. If the testing is not done on every unit, it may be necessary to have more
stringent criteria than if every unit were tested.
3.3 QUALITATIVE TESTING

{

Qualitative testing should be conducted on all of the units produced and should
include checks or testing of the following:
the presence, secure attachment, and proper content of a label certifying
pliance of the product;

com-

the manufacturer and place and date of manufacture;

and sunlamp products.

lamps

3.4 QUANTITATIVE TESTING
Quantitative testing includes the following types of tests:
1. measurement of ultraviolet radiation output to determine if the spectral irradiance is within the expected range for the product and its recommended
exposure schedule;
2. measurement of the irradiance output within the specified wavelength ranges to
determine the irradiance ratio;
3. measurements of protective eyewear spectral transmittance, to determine that it
does not exceed the values required by the performance standard; and
4. measurement of timer acuracy to determine that the error is not greater than
fIG percent of the maximum timer interval.
There are many ways to conduct these measurements. CDRH does not object to any
method that would, when correctly executed, yield the correct physical values. Procedures for compliance testing at FDA's Winchester laboratory are provided in Appendix
B for
manufacturers'
referencein only.
Procedures for developing the
recommended
exposure schedule
are provided
Appendix C.
.

3.5 TEST CONDITIONS FOR DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE
In order for the product to have a valid certification (21 CFR 1010.2), the test on
which the certificaton is based must meet the following conditions:
1. The tests for the irradiance ratio and to develop and verify the recommended
exposure schedule (and/or to establish lamp compatability)
and protective
eyewear transmittance must account for all measurement errors and statistical
uncertainties in the measurement process and, wherever applicable, for changes
in radiation emission or degradation in radiation safety with age of the product.
The measurements to check irradiance ratio, recommended exposure (and/or
lamp compatability) and protective eyewear transmittance must be made under
the operational conditions of lamp voltage, current, and user position as recommended by the manufacturers. The measuring instrument must be positioned at
the recommended exposure position orientation and so oriented as to detect the
maximum amount of radiation detectable by the instrument.

regularly calibrated.

It is

4. It must provide procedures to check for all items mentioned in 3.3 and must also
provide for checksheets to include date, initials of tester, and product identifying
marks.
3.6 SAMPLING, AUDIT AND RECYCLING

3.6.1 Sampling
CDRH recommends testing 100 percent of the products to determine compliance.
However, in the case of products built in large quantity on a production line, a sampling
plan that randomly allows selection of some units for some tests and inspections may be
appropriate.
When this is done, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to
demonstrate that the sampling plan will ensure compliance of the product with the
standard and with the design specifications. A random sampling scheme must be truly
random, i.e., the probability of a unit being selected is the same for all produced units.
The so-called "random" selection of units from a production line based on a judgment of
randomness by an individual does not constitute true random sampling. A scheme that is
based on generating random numbers or other specified statistical schemes is a more
objective basis for random sampling. Examples of sampling plans are contained in MilStd-105D and Mil-Std-414 (See References 1 and 2).
In addition to random sampling to test for compliance, any systematic problem areas
may warrant testing; e.g., at the beginning of a production run, or at the beginning of
each day, or when a new assembler begins work on a product, and so forth.

3.6.2 Product Audit
A product audit is a GMP requirement. It is desirable to establish such an audit to
test the validity of the quality control and testing program. A product audit includes
testing previously tested and accepted products to provide a check on the measuremnt
process and the acceptance procedures. A specific sampling procedure should be used to
select accepted units that should be subjected to all the tests and inspections of the
product quality assurance program.
Repeated failures of audited samples indicate
problems in the product design or the quality assurance program, which must be traced
and corrected.

3.6.3 Recycling
Units or lots that fail to conform to specifications and which are refurbished,
repaired, reworked, and so forth must be subjected to the testing and scrutiny and the
same acceptance or rejection criteria to which the original was subjected for the
characteristics that may be adversely affected by the reprocessing.

APPENDIX A
DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE SUNLAMP STANDARD

A. FOR ULTRAVIOLET LAMPS
1. Each ultraviolet lamp, unless exempted, must have on 1:he product a permanent
label which contains (21 CFR 1040.20(d)(2» (i) the words "Sunlamp-DANGERUltJ:,aviolet radiation. Follow instructions," (ii) the model identification and (iii)
the words "Use ONLY in fixture equipped with a timer."
2. Each ultraviolet lamp must be permanently labeled or marked in such a manner
that the name of the manufacturer and month and year of manufacture (all of
which may be expressed in code) can be determined (21 CFR 1040.20(d)(3».
Labels or marks shall be legible throughout the useful life of the lamp.
3. When a lamp is sold separately from a sunlamp product, the lamp packaging
uniquely associated with an ultraviolet lamp (i.e., innermost lamp packaging)
m\l~;t bear a label or tag that contains the full name and address of the
manufacturer, place of manufacture and month and year of manufacture if such a
label or tag is not affixed or inscribed on the lamp itself (21 CFR 1040.20(d)(3)
and 21 CFR 1010.3(a». If the lamp is sold under a name other than the
manufacturer, the full name and address of the company under whose name the
lamp is sold may be set forth, provided sufficient information is furnished to
CDRH to allow the Agency to identify the manufacturer. The place of manufacture may be expressed in code. However, no specific place of manufacture
identification will be required if the place of manufacture is the same as the
address of the manufacturer stated on the label, or if the manufacturer has only
one place of manufacture for such lamps and has identified that place of manufacture to CDRH. The month and year of manufacture must appear in full, without abbreviation, as in the following example -Manufactured:
December 1998.
Ho1wever, when the date of manufacture is provided in code on the lamp, CDRH
will not object to the omission of the date of manufacture on the packaging if the
ke~r to the date code and the location of the coded information are provided on
the packaging in a manner that will allow the date to be readily decoded. The
month and year of manufacture on the packaging must be the same as that which
appears on tne lamp.
t

4. Thl~ lamp packaging uniquely associated with the ulraviolet lamp not accompanying a sunlamp product must also bear a label or tag which contains a
statement by the manufacturer certifying that the lamp conforms to the requirements of the Federal performance standard for such lamps if the certification
label or tag is not affixed or inscribed on the lamp itself (21 CFR 1040.20(d)(3)
and 21 CFR 1010.2(b». The certification
statement can be in any of the
following acceptable formsc
"Product complies with DHHS radiation

"Product complies with applicable DHHS standards under the Radiation
Contirol for Health and Safety Act of 1968."
Other certification

statements

may be used as long as they are clear and

unambiguous.
5. The ratio of the irradiance within the wavelength range of greater than 200
nanometers through 260 nanometers to the irradiance within the wavelength
range of greater than 260 nanometers through 320 nanometers must not exceed
0.003 at any distance and direction from the lamp (21 CFR 1040.20(c)(1».
6. The lamp must not be capable of insertion and operation in the "single-contact
medium screw" and/or "double-contact medium screw" lampholders (21 CFR
1040.20(c)6).
7. Instructions containing information as required by 21 CFR 1040.20(f) must be
provided to the purchasers of the lamp not accompanying a sunlamp product.
8. A clear identification by brand and model designation of all lamp models for
which the lamp manufacturer claims equivalency (see CDRH policy on lamp
compatability dated September 2, 1986).

B. FORSUNLAMPPRODUCTS
1. Each sunlamp product must have a label that contains the information as required
by 21 CFR 1040.20(d)(1)(i) through (vi), including the warning statement,
designation of the ultraviolet lamp type which is to be used in the product,
instructions concerning minimum use distance, recommended exposure schedule,
and a statement of the time it may take before the expected results appear. The
design must clearly define the contents and locations of the labels required in
Section 1040.20(d), and their permanence and visibility must be assured. See
CDRH policy statement on warning label dated June 25, 1985, and policy
statement on "Maximum timer interval and exposure schedule" (Appendix C).
2. Each sunlamp product must bear a label or tag that contains the full name and
address of the manufacturer, place of manufacture and month and year of
manufacture (21 CFR 1040.20(d) and 21 CFR 1010.30(a». If the sunlamp product
is sold under a name other than the manufacturer, the full name and address of
the company under whose name the product is sold may be set forth, provided
sufficient information is furnished to CDRH to allow the Agency to identify the
manufacturer. The place of manufacture may be expressed in code.
However, no specific place of manufacture identification will be required if the
place of manufacture is the same as the address of the manufacturer stated on
the label or if the manufacturer has only one place of manufacture for such
products and has identified that place of manufacture to CDRH. The month and
year of manufacture must appear in full, without abbreviation, as in the following
example -Manufactured December 1998.
3. Each sunlamp product must also bear a label or tag which contains a statement
by the manufacturer certifying that the product conforms to the requirements of
the Federal performance standard for such products (21 CFR 1040.20(d) and 21

SUBJECT:

POLICY ON MAXIMUM TIMER INTERVAL AND EXPOSURE SCHEDULE

FOR SUNLAMPPRODUCTS

The amended performance standard for sunlamp products (21 CFR 1040.20)was
published in the September 6, 1985 issue of the Federal Register and will become
effective September 8, 1986. Any sunlamp product manufactured on or after that date
must comply with the amended standard.
The ten (10) minute maximum timer interval requirement was removed from the original
performance standard since there are newer sunlamp products on the market for which
ten (10) minutes is not appropriate. The maximum timer interval now depends on the
intensity and spectral distribution of ultraviolet (UV) radiation emission of each
individual model of sunlamp product and must not exceed the maximum recommended
exposure time provided on the required product warning label. Therefore, sunlamp
product manufacturers must develop an exposure schedule and establish the maximum
recommended exposure time (and therefore the maximum timer interval) based on the
characteristics of their particular products.
The intended purposes of a sunlamp product timer are to provide for r.eliable control of
exposures and to limit acute (and delayed) damage from unintentionally long exposures.
However, the maximum timer setting should also allow for selection of exposure times
needed to build up and maintain a tan. The maximum timer interval is in no way to be
considered as a safe limit; all ultraviolet radiation is potentially hazardous.
The standard requires the manufacturer to provide an exposure schedule in the product
warning label. The purpose of the exposure schedule is to allow a person to gradually
build-up skin pigmentation and to maintain a tan while controlling the risk of acute
injury and delayed adverse effects. Since the UV radiation dose that causes a barely
discernible pink coloration (minimal erythemal dose or MED) is not the same for
different skin types, the exposure schedule for first time users will depend on the skin
type of the user. Furthermore, suberythemogenic doses of UV radiation received at 24
hours intervals initially lead to lowering of the erythema and tanning thresholds.
Therefore, the exposure schedule and maximum recommended exposure time should be
constrained by the potential for erythema as well as the quantity of radiation necessary
to achieve and maintain a tan.
POLICY:
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) will use the following criteria
to evaluate the adequacy of the exposure schedule and the recommended maximum
exposure time (and therefore the maximum timer interval):

BACKGROUND:

26

1) The maximum recommended exposure time (and maximum timer interval) must
not exceed a value which will result in an exposure of four (4) times the minimal
erythema dose (MED) for untanned Type II skin (always burns, then tans slightly).
This is based on the CDRH Erythema Action Spectrum [proposed action spectrum
of Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) modified by CDRH]. See
Appendix A [of this appendix] for the action spectrum and weighting factors and
equations needed to derive it.
The formula for determining the recommended maximum exposure time, "Te" in
seconds is:
T =
e

624J/M2
"""' V.R.
L

I

I

where Standard MED = 156J/M2 at 296 nm
Vi = weighting factor
Ri = irradiance in W/M2

2) The recommended maximum exposure time must not exceed a value which will
result in an exposure of four (4) times the minimal melanogenic dose (MMD) for
untanned Type II skin. This is based on the melanogenic action spectrum
developed by Parrish et ale (1982). See Appendix 8 [of this appendix] for this
action spectrum.
The formula for determining the recommended maximum exposure time, "Tm" in
seconds is:
Tm -

1836J/M2

where standard MMD = 459J/M2 at 296 nm
Ji = weighting factor
Ri = irradiance in W/M2

3) The recommended exposure schedule should provide for exposures of no more
than 0.75 MED three times the first week, gradually increasing the exposure the
following weeks until maximum tanning has occurred (approximately four weeks
total) and then provide for maintenance of a tan by biweekly or weekly exposures
of up to four (4) MEDs or four (4) MMDs, whichever is less.

':r

CDRH believes that the above criteria balance the need to limit acute (and delayed)
damages from unintentionally long exposure and the need to provide for single exposure
durations adequate to achieve and maintain a tan.
