Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Keratome and Replacement Keratome Blades
Premarket Notification [510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket notification
submissions for keratomes and replacement keratome blades. The device is intended to shave
tissue from sections of the cornea for a lamellar (partial thickness) transplant. Keratomes,
originally used during cornea transplant surgery, are now widely used during the laser refractive
surgical procedure known as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues
we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the "A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues" document. It is
available on our Center web page at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type should conform to the general
controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), including the premarket
notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a substantial
equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also 21 CFR 807.81 and
807.87). This guidance document identifies the classification regulation and product codes for
keratomes and replacement keratome blades (refer to Section 4. Scope). In addition, other
sections of this guidance document provide additional information to manufacturers on
addressing risks related to these devices in premarket notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements of
a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and "How to
Prepare a 510(k) Submission" on FDA Device Advice at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial
Equivalence in Premarket Notifications,” http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html, a
manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or has the option of submitting either an
Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least
burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device, particularly once
FDA has issued a guidance document addressing that device. Manufacturers considering certain
modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a
Special 510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA may consider the
contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the meaning of 21 CFR
807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary report. The report should
describe how this guidance document was used during the device development and testing and
should briefly describe the methods or tests used and a summary of the test data or description of
the acceptance criteria applied to address the risks identified in this document, as well as any
additional risks specific to your device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the
requirements of section 807.87 as well as some other items that we recommend you include in an
Abbreviated 510(k).

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and cite
the title of this guidance document.

Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Please refer to Section 14. Labeling for specific information that
should be included in the labeling for devices of the types covered by this guidance
document.)

Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the performance specifications and, when appropriate,
include detailed, labeled drawings of the device. Please refer to Section 5. Device
Description for specific information that we recommend you include in the device
description for devices of the types covered by this guidance document. You should also
submit an “indications for use” enclosure. 1
Description of device design
We recommend that you include a brief description of the device design requirements.
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess the risk
profile, in general, as well as the specific device’s design and the results of this analysis.
(Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health and Section 7. Hazards Assessment for the
risks to health generally associated with the use of this device that FDA has identified.)
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks identified
in this guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in your risk analysis.
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have used or
intend to use to address each performance aspect identified in Sections 5 - 13 of this
guidance document. If you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the method
rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method
1

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
but should provide sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for the
modification. For each test, you may either (1) briefly present the data resulting from the
test in clear and concise form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that
you will apply to your test results. 2 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design
Controls for the Quality System Regulation.)
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or testing,
you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

declaration of conformity to the standard. 3

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe you cannot
properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the testing the
standard describes. For more information, please refer to section 514(c)(1)(B) of the act
and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence Determinations,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html.
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks identified
through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of the device’s
performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we need it to assess
the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we may request any
additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding substantial
equivalence.)
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k) that
provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in this
guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods, data, acceptance criteria, and
conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices
should consider submitting Special 510(k)s.
2

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the subject
device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being introduced into
interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance criteria and, thus, differs
from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends that submitters apply the same
criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to
determine whether marketing of the finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

We recommend you provide data from validation testing of your keratome. This testing should
address the accuracy, precision, and quality of the corneal flaps produced by your device, as well
as the overall design of the device at a system level.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A. Validation of Cut
We recommend you provide the mean flap thicknesses, flap diameters, and hinge widths
when the keratome is used in a statistically justifiable number of pig or cadaver eyes (e.g., 30
eyes per diameter and thickness). We recommend you test all the combinations of flap
thicknesses, flap diameters, and hinge widths. We also recommend you provide data
showing the nominal values, mean values, repeatability limits (i.e., the variability associated
with cuts on a series of eyes using the same device and operator), and reproducibility limits
(i.e., the variability associated with several series of eyes using different devices and
operators) for all measured quantities. A tabular format of this data is desirable. We
recommend you fully describe all associated test methods. We also recommend you provide
general comments on your results, specifically addressing:
•

the quality of the stromal bed produced (smooth, saw tooth, rough or other
appropriate description)

•

quality of the flap produced

•

any significant differences between the nominal and measured values, wide
variances or outliers, if present

•

any anomalies noticed during the testing or in the data

•

why you believe the flaps, hinges and stromal beds produced by your device are
clinically acceptable.

If the device is an epikeratome, we recommend you also perform testing to determine the
percentage of successful flaps (i.e., no residual patches of epithelium and an intact flap),
percentage of partial cuts, percentage of torn flaps, and percentage of eyes with cellular
debris requiring additional scraping. (Note that flap thickness testing is not recommended
for epikeratomes, but flap diameters and hinge widths should be validated as described
above.) We recommend you fully describe all associated test methods and provide general
comments on your results. Specifically, we recommend that your comments explain why the
rates of unsuccessful flaps, partial cuts, torn flaps, and cellular debris you observe are
clinically acceptable.
You may include any available clinical data to support the validation information
recommended above for keratomes and epikeratomes.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

B. Validation of Device Design
We recommend you conduct system level validation testing to ensure all hardware and
software systems in the device are functioning properly. We recommend you validate all
alarms and warnings (e.g., warnings or alarms for insufficient vacuum or improper assembly)
under realistic fault conditions. For more details on software validation, please refer to
Section 8 below.

8.

Software Validation

Manufacturers of class I devices automated with computer software must comply with the
requirements of Design Controls (21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C) under the Quality System
Regulations, 21 CFR 820.30(a)(2)(i). In accordance with these requirements, you must perform
design validation, which includes a software validation and risk analysis, where appropriate, and
document the design validation results in your design history file as described under 21 CFR
820.30(g).
Please refer to the Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in
Medical Devices, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/337.html, for a discussion of the
software documentation that you should provide. Please also refer to the General Principles of
Software Validation, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/comp/guidance/938.html, for a discussion of
general principles that the FDA considers applicable to the validation of medical device software.
We encourage you to take advantage of any recognized software standards and provide
statements or declarations of conformity as described in the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in
Substantial Equivalence Determinations, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html.
Please visit the following website to search for the standards that have been recognized when a
medical device contains software,
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.

9.

Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility

We recommend you address the electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility of your device
by following both standards below or equivalent methods:
•

International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) standard IEC 60601-1, Medical Electrical
Equipment Part 1: General Requirements for Safety

•

IEC 60601-1, Part 1-2: General Requirements for Safety - Collateral Standard:
Electromagnetic Compatibility - Requirements and Tests

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) encompasses both emissions (interference with other
electronic devices) and immunity (interference with device performance created by emissions
from other electronic devices). We recommend you evaluate the EMC of your device as
discussed below.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Emissions
EMC testing should demonstrate that the device will not adversely interfere with the
performance of other electronic devices (emissions). Testing should include radio
frequency (RF) electromagnetic, low frequency magnetic, and conducted emissions
testing.
Immunity
EMC testing should also demonstrate that the device will perform as expected in the
presence of other electrical and electronic devices or other sources of electromagnetic
disturbance (EMD) in the intended environment of use (immunity). The device should
operate in an acceptable manner (few EMC standards require operation within
specification) during and after exposure to various forms of electromagnetic disturbance.
Testing should include:
•

electrostatic discharge (ESD)

•

radiated RF electromagnetic fields

•

electrical fast transient and bursts

•

surges

•

conducted RF electromagnetic energy

•

voltage dips, short interruptions, and voltage variations on power supply input
lines

•

low- frequency magnetic fields

•

quasi-static electric fields.

We recommend that you test your device according to IEC 60601-1-2 Medical Electrical
Equipment – Part 1: General Requirements for Safety; Electromagnetic Compatibility –
Requirements and Tests (Second Edition, 2001) to demonstrate the EMC characteristics of your
device.

10. Material Characterization and Biocompatibility
FDA recommends you conduct biocompatibility testing as described in the FDA guidance, Use of
International Standard ISO-10993, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part-1:
Evaluation and Testing (the Biocompatibility guidance). 5 We consider keratome blades as
devices with limited contact with breached or compromised surfaces. We recommend you select
biocompatibility tests appropriate for the duration and level of contact with your device. You
should prepare samples for biocompatibility testing in a way that reflects the actual conditions of
use (e.g., if the material will be heated during use, it should be heated to adequate temperature
prior to testing). If identical materials and identical material processing are used in a predicate

5

http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/g951.html

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
device with the same type and duration of patient contact, you may identify the predicate device
in lieu of providing biocompatibility testing.

11. Sterilization
For single use devices that are provided sterile, we recommend you provide sterilization
information described in the guidance entitled, Updated 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance
K90-1. 6 The device should be sterile with a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 1 x 10-6 using a
sterilization cycle validated in accordance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) 21 CFR
Part 820. In addition, we recommend you provide a description of the packaging that maintains
the device’s sterility.
If the device is reusable, we recommend you identify the method that you used to validate the
cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of your device. (See also Section 12. Labeling.) In
addition, we recommend you specify any limit on the number of times re-sterilization and reuse
can be done without adversely affecting the safety, effectiveness, or performance of the device.

12. Labeling
The premarket notification must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of
21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are intended to assist you in preparing labeling that
satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 7
Directions for use
As a prescription device, under 21 CFR 801.109, the device is exempt from having adequate
directions for lay use. Nevertheless, under 21 CFR 807.87(e), we recommend providing clear and
concise instructions that delineate the technological features of the specific device and how the
device is to be used on patients. Instructions should encourage local/institutional training
programs designed to familiarize users with the features of the device and how to use the device
in a safe and effective manner.
The user’s manual should include instructions for cleaning and sterilization procedures, if
appropriate.
Your labeling should include indications for use, for example:
A keratome is indicated for cutting the cornea prior to lamellar (partial thickness) transplant
or to create a flap in the cornea prior to LASIK surgery or prior to another procedure requiring
a corneal flap.
6

http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/361.html.
Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with the
requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate commerce.
In addition, final labeling for prescription medical devices must comply with 21 CFR 801.109.
Labeling recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements of Part 801.
7

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

We also recommend that you include the nominal values, mean values, repeatability limits, and
reproducibility limits for flap thickness, flap diameter, and hinge width in the user’s manual. You
should also include the basic details about the study design (e.g., porcine or human eyes, sample
size) used to determine these values.

Appendix – Information for Replacement Keratome Blades
A.

B.

For each keratome, for which your blades are intended for use, we recommend you
provide the:
•

name of the keratome original equipment manufacturer (OEM)

•

model of the keratome

•

510(k) number (if known) for each keratome.

We recommend you include a side-by-side comparison for each of your blades with
each keratome’s OEM blade. We also recommend you address the following
parameters for each of your blades and the OEM blades. For each comparison and each
parameter in each comparison, we recommend you comment on the similarities between
blades and explain the impact on blade performance of any differences you observe. We
also recommend presenting each comparison clearly and separately; a tabular format is
desirable.
1. Dimensions
We recommend you include a diagram (drawing or manufacturing blue print) of
the device that illustrates the dimensions you have measured. We recommend you
also include a key to the diagram (a tabular format is desirable) that shows the
dimensions and tolerances for your device (blade, blade holder, keratome head, as
appropriate).
We recommend you provide all of the measurements (mean, standard deviation,
and measurement precision for each) of the blade (length, width, thickness, and
bevels), blade holder (if applicable), mounting holes in blade (if applicable),
keratome head (if applicable), and any other specifications to compare your device
and the OEM blades. We also recommend you measure a statistically justifiable
number of your blades and the OEM blades, for example 30 blades.
2. Materials
We recommend you identify and compare (by ASTM standard, specification, type,
grade, certificate of analysis, etc.) the materials in the final product of your blade
and the OEM blade: the blade, blade holder (if applicable), and coatings on the
blade (if applicable). We also recommend you identify any remaining substances
on the blade due to polishing or sharpening.
3. Hardness
We recommend you compare the hardness of the blade and the OEM blade and
indicate the test used to measure the hardness.

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
4. Sharpness
We also recommend you compare the sharpness of your blade and the OEM blade
and indicate the test used to measure the sharpness. Testing may combine
photomicrographs and validation testing, or be stand-alone sharpness tests.
C.

Preclinical Assessment: See Section 7. Preclinical Assessment. We also recommend
you provide documentation of validation testing demonstrating the equivalency of your
blade to the OEM. For each comparison and each parameter in each comparison, we
recommend you comment on the similarities between the blades and explain the impact
of any differences you observe on the blade performance.

D.

Sterilization: See Section 11. Sterilization.

E.

Labeling: See Section 12. Labeling. Labeling should include an indications for use that
identifies the OEM manufacturers and model numbers your blades are intended for use
with.

F.

FDA recommends that manufacturers of replacement keratome blades include the
accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility information for all combinations of flap
thickness, flap diameter, and hinge width compatible with the OEM keratome in the
package labeling.
