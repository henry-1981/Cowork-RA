Guidance on the Department of Defense
Exemption from the FDA Performance
Standard for Laser Products (Laser
Notice No. 52)
This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the
public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.

Purpose
This guidance clarifies and updates the conditions of FDA exemption no. 76EL-01DOD
granted in 1976 to the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for laser products procured for
combat or combat training or that are classified for reasons of national security. This
guidance supplements Laser Notice Nos. 9 and 15 and identifies the current resources in
the military services for the administration of this exemption.
Issue
The U.S. Department of Defense established a joint services group, the Laser Systems
Safety Working Group (LSSWG), to coordinate laser safety issues within the DoD. The
LSSWG requested FDA to reissue its earlier guidance to industry on the subject of the
DoD exemption. The LSSWG request was based on a concern that laser products not in
compliance with the FDA standard are offered to various DoD purchasing authorities and
procured without appropriate control measures implemented to assure the safest possible
use.
Background
Laser products sold in or imported into the United States must comply with the Federal
Performance Standard for Laser Products issued by the Food and Drug Ad ministration
(FDA), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), in Title 21, Code of Federal
Regulations, Subchapter J, Parts 1040.10 and 1040.11 1 . The Federal Laser Standards
require laser products to incorporate certain safety features, which may include warning
lights, warning labels, and housing interlocks.
In 1976, the FDA Commissioner allowed the Department of Defense (DoD) or its
components to exempt certain military laser products from the provisions of the Federal
Laser Standard and associated reporting and recordkeeping requirements. This
exemption applies to DoD lasers used for actual combat or combat training or those

See 21 CFR 1040.10 (a) for details on the applicability of the FDA standard and exceptions from
applicability.

classified in the interest of national security. The exemption was granted with the
following provisions:
•
•
•

Laser product specifications must include, to the extent practicable, the safety
features required by the FDA standard;
Laser product specifications will be supplemented with safety controls specified
by DoD; and
DoD exempted laser products will be clearly identified through labeling.

An example of how the DoD exemption may be applied is to exempt a military laser
product from the FDA requirements for laser radiation emission indicators and warning
labels. These visible or audible emission indicators and brightly-colored labeling are
inappropriate for products intended for use in a combat environment where camouflage
and concealment are necessary.
The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those we believe need to be
addressed before your product can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to comply with the guidance and address
the issues we have identified. We believe that we ha ve considered the least burdensome
approach to resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you
believe that there is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the
procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome
Issues” document. It is available on our Center web page at:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
Guidance
The manufacturer must obtain an exemption letter from an authorized DoD procuring
agency to allow the use of the DoD exemption for a specific product. The manufacturer
must obtain the DoD exemption letter prior to sale and retain it for subsequent sales to
any DoD agency. Any subsequent modification to a “military exempt” laser product by
the manufacturer requires a new DoD exemption letter. The DoD exemption letter may
specify a number of units, an armed service, and/or a period of time.
A manufacturer violates Federal law if it sells a laser system not in compliance with the
FDA standard to the DoD or falsely labels a laser product as exempt without a written
DoD exemption letter. Several laser system manufacturers market laser products that are
labeled as “military exempt.” Many of these systems lack written documentation of DoD
exemption. An appropriate DoD laser safety representative must evaluate all “military
exempt” laser products to determine compliance with relevant military or Federal
requirements. Manufacturers of “military exempt” laser products should not assume the
DoD exemption applies to its product unless DoD provides an exemption letter.
Once the DoD exemption is applied to a specific laser system, the system cannot be sold,
surplused, or distributed to organizations outside the DoD, unless the laser system is

brought into full compliance with the FDA standard, certified, and reported in accordance
with FDA regulations.
For further information on this process, contact an appropriate DoD laser safety
representative.
