This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s Good
Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both. This guidance will be
updated in the next revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

PREFACE
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to the sponsors of premarket notifications
[510(k)'s] for restorative devices.  This document is intended to assist the sponsors in organizing
and providing the essential information that should be submitted to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for review.
This guidance is based on the Restorative Devices Branch's (REDB's) identification of specific
criteria necessary to conduct an adequate evaluation of a 510(k) for the purpose of determining
substantial equivalence for physical medicine/restorative devices.  The objective of this document is
to delineate to the device manufacturer important administrative, descriptive, and scientific
information that should be included in a 510(k) for a restorative device.  Individual 510(k)
submissions may require additional information pertinent to each specific device.  The suggestions
and recommendations included in the guidance reflect the minimal requirements that would allow
an evaluation of the device as determined by REDB.  While the use of this document in the
preparation of a 510(k) premarket notification will not ensure FDA clearance of a device, following
the guidance will ensure that sufficient basic information is available to initiate a substantive
review.
Note that the guidance document is a living document.  It will be periodically revised as scientific
knowledge and regulations change.
Guidance document preparation was accomplished by the joint efforts of the REDB staff.

The following information must be provided:
a.
The proprietary name of the new device;
b.
The generic name of the device;
c.
The classification of the predicate device e.g., Class II.  Refer to 21 CFR and section
513 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act;
d.
The proposed regulatory class for the new device, e.g., Class II.  (21 CFR 862-892
contains the regulatory classifications for medical devices); and
e.
The panel code(s) for the device.  [If the product is not classified under the physical
medicine devices panel, identify the panel under which it is classified and provide
the panel identification code (e.g., 89 is the code for the physical medicine devices
panel)].

SUBSTANTIAL EQUIVALENCE INFORMATION
1.
The legally marketed predicate device with which the subject device is to be compared for
the determination of substantial equivalence must be identified.  Evidence must be provided
that the device was placed into interstate commerce for other than research uses or as part of
a plant-to-plant transfer and was actually labeled and promoted for the intended use to
which the submitter of the premarket notification is claiming substantial equivalence.  This
may be accomplished by providing copies of the firm's advertisements, catalog pages, or
other promotional material dated prior to May 28, 1976 and shipping documents such as
invoices, bills of lading, receipts showing the interstate transit of the device (for other
information which can be used to prove Pre-Amendment status contact DSMA).
Alternatively, the 510(k) number(s) of the predicate device(s) may be identified.  The
510(k) number may be obtained from the Electronic Docket (ED), an automated retrieval
system of the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA), which provides
medical device regulations, FDA talk papers and press releases, device evaluation guidance,
and the listing of all approved 510(k)s sorted by applicant name.  This 510(k) information is
located under the Product Clearance Main Menu Item # 12.  Dial (301) 594-4802 or (800)
