Guidance for Industry and Food
and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

This guidance document provides recommendations for premarket notification (510(k))
submissions for guidewires intended for use in the coronary vasculature, peripheral
vasculature, and neurovasculature. The recommendations reflect current review practices
and are intended to promote consistency and facilitate efficient review of these submissions.
For the purposes of this guidance, the coronary vasculature includes blood vessels within the
heart, including the ostium of the left main coronary artery; the neurovasculature includes
blood vessels within the cranium, typically considered the vasculature distal to the cervical
segment of the internal carotid artery; the peripheral vasculature includes all other
cardiovascular vasculature. This document is intended to assist industry in designing and
executing appropriate performance testing to support a 510(k) submission and provides
recommendations for content and labeling to include in the submission.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standards referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database web site at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/
scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm. For more information regarding use of consensus
standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of
Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”1

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Guidewires are used to facilitate the placement of therapeutic devices during percutaneous
interventional procedures. In the context of this guidance, the guidewires being discussed are
intended for use in the coronary vasculature, peripheral vasculature, and neurovasculature.
There have been many technological advancements since the initial regulation of these
devices. Therefore, updated information and additional clarity is needed regarding FDA’s
recommendations for performance testing and labeling for a 510(k) submission for new or
modified guidewires.
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content
requirements and recommendations of a 510(k) submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR
807.87 and FDA’s guidance, “Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s.”2

III. Scope
The scope of this document is limited to guidewires indicated for use in the coronary
vasculature, peripheral vasculature, and neurovasculature, regulated under 21 CFR 870.1330
and with product codes listed in the table below.

·

Device components: FDA recommends that you identify and explain the function of
all components and accessories, including packaging. You should include a clear
description of the basic operation of the device and identify any unique features (e.g.
steerable tip), when applicable. You should also identify all sizes, configurations and
models included within the scope of the submission. If your device contains any
joints (i.e., locations where adhesives, thermal fusion, or other joining methods are
used for bonding components of the guidewire), we recommend that you identify the
joint location and bonding method used.

·

Engineering drawing(s) of the device: FDA recommends that you provide
engineering drawing(s) with all dimensions, tolerances, and components clearly
labeled (e.g., tip configuration, tip performance, and dynamic material interactions
(e.g., mechanism to control tip deflection)). In addition to the engineering drawing(s),
a photograph of the device can also be provided. FDA recommends that you include
this for each device, accessory, and/or component included within the scope of the
submission.

·

Technological characteristics: FDA recommends that you describe the technical and
performance specifications and include a brief description of the device design in the
device description section of the submission. The specifications may include
performance-related product measurement tolerances, operating limitations, and any
other functional, physical, and environmental specifications of the device. We also
recommend that you describe ranges and/or accuracy of the specifications.

·

Materials: FDA recommends that each material(s) be clearly identified along with its
corresponding contact duration. We recommend identifying both the generic
material(s) of construction and the unique material identifier(s). If your device
includes coating(s), we recommend that you identify the coating name, chemical
formulation, coating purpose, whether the coating is hydrophobic or hydrophilic,
thickness, length, location and details of how the coating is applied to the guidewire
substrate. For some device materials, it may be appropriate to provide a reference to
either a recognized consensus standard, or to a Letter of Authorization (LOA) for a
device Master File (MAF) for this information.

B. Predicate Comparison
For devices reviewed under the 510(k) process, manufacturers must compare their new
device to a similar legally marketed predicate device to support its substantial equivalence
(21 U.S.C. 360c(i); 21 CFR 807.87(f)). This comparison should provide information to show
how your device is similar to and different from the predicate. Side by side comparisons,
whenever possible, are desirable. See below for an example of how this information may be
organized. This table is not intended to represent an exhaustive list of comparative
parameters; ensure you provide all relevant device descriptive characteristics, as outlined in
Section IV.A. Device Description, above.

As part of your comparison, we recommend that you clearly explain the intended clinical
environment and intended use of your device. The indications for use statement should
identify whether the device is intended to navigate into the coronary vasculature, peripheral
vasculature, and/or neurovasculature. If your device contains any feature(s) that is unique to
your device compared to the predicate, we recommend that you clearly describe the
feature(s), the location(s), and the operational characteristics and provide an explanation as to
why the differences do not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness.

C. Biocompatibility
Significance: Guidewires contain patient-contacting materials, which, when used as intended
(i.e., limited direct contact with circulating blood), may induce a harmful biological response.
Recommendation: You should determine the biocompatibility of all patient-contacting
materials present in your device. If your device is identical in composition and processing
methods to guidewires with a history of successful use, you may reference previous testing
experience or the literature, if appropriate. For some device materials, it may be appropriate
to provide a reference to either a recognized consensus standard, or to a LOA for a device
MAF.
If you are unable to identify a legally marketed predicate device with similar
location/duration of contact and intended use that uses the same materials as used in your
device, we recommend you conduct and provide a biocompatibility risk assessment. The
assessment should explain the relationship between the identified biocompatibility risks, the
information available to mitigate the identified risks, and identify any knowledge gaps that
remain. You should then identify any biocompatibility testing or other evaluations that were
conducted to mitigate any remaining risks. We recommend that you follow FDA’s guidance
“Use of International Standard ISO-10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process’”3 which identifies the types of
biocompatibility assessments that should be considered and recommendations regarding how
to conduct related tests.
Per ISO 10993-1: Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing
within a risk management process and Attachment A of FDA’s guidance on ISO-10993-1,
guidewires are externally communicating devices with limited (<24 hour) duration direct
contact with the circulating blood. Therefore, the following endpoints should be addressed in
your biocompatibility evaluation:
· cytotoxicity;
· sensitization;
· irritation/intracutaneous reactivity;
· acute systemic toxicity;
· material-mediated pyrogenicity;
· complement activation (SC5b-9 pathway is recommended and C3a pathway
optional);
· in vivo thrombogenicity; and
· direct and indirect hemolysis.
The following additional considerations are recommended for guidewires. If novel materials
are used, then genotoxicity testing may also be needed. Testing should be conducted with the
largest surface area device model and worst-case exposure. Test samples should represent the
final, sterilized device.

D. Sterility
Significance: Depending on the intended use, guidewires will contact blood and possibly
cerebrospinal fluid and therefore should be adequately sterilized to minimize infections and
related complications.
Recommendation: For guidewires labeled as sterile, we recommend that you provide
information for the final, sterilized device in accordance with FDA’s guidance “Submission
and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for
Devices Labeled as Sterile.”4

E. Pyrogenicity
Significance: Pyrogenicity testing is used to help protect patients from the risk of febrile
reaction due to gram-negative bacterial endotoxins and/or chemicals that can leach from a
medical device (e.g., material-mediated pyrogens).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Recommendation: To address the risks associated with the presence of bacterial endotoxins,
guidewires should meet pyrogen limit specifications by following the recommendations
outlined in FDA’s guidance “Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile.”5 You should also follow
the recommendations in “Guidance for Industry Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions
and Answers.”6 To address the risks associated with material-mediated endotoxins, follow
the recommendations in FDA’s guidance “Use of International Standard ISO-10993,
'Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing’.”7
For devices intended to be labeled as “non-pyrogenic,” we recommend that both the bacterial
endotoxin and rabbit material-mediated pyrogen testing be conducted.

F. Shelf Life and Packaging
Significance: Shelf life testing is conducted to support the proposed expiration date through
evaluation of the package integrity for maintaining device sterility and/or evaluation of any
changes to device performance or functionality.
Recommendation: With respect to package integrity for maintaining device sterility, you
should provide a description of the packaging, including how it will maintain the device’s
sterility, and a description of the package integrity test methods, but not the package test data.
We recommend that package integrity test methods include simulated distribution and
associated package integrity testing, as well as simulated (and/or real-time) aging and
associated seal strength testing, to validate package integrity and shelf life claims. We
recommend you follow the methods described in the FDA-recognized series of consensus
standards AAMI/ANSI/ISO 11607-1: Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices –
Part 1: Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging and
AAMI/ANSI/ISO 11607-2: Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 2:
Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes.
With respect to evaluating the effects of aging on device performance or functionality, shelf
life studies should evaluate the critical device properties to ensure it will perform adequately
and consistently during the entire proposed shelf life. To evaluate device functionality, we
recommend that you assess each of the bench tests described in Section IV.G. Non-Clinical
Performance Testing and repeat all tests that evaluate design components or characteristics
that are potentially affected by aging.
We recommend that you provide a summary of the test methods used for your shelf life
testing, results and the conclusions drawn from your results. If you use devices subject to
accelerated aging for shelf life testing, we recommend that you specify the way in which the

devices were aged. We recommend that you age your devices as per the currently FDA
recognized version of ASTM F1980: Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile
Barrier Systems for Medical Devices and specify the environmental parameters used to attain
the expiration date. For devices or components containing polymeric materials or coatings,
you should conduct testing on real-time aged samples to confirm the results of the
accelerated aging study(ies). This testing can be conducted in parallel with 510(k) review and
clearance, with results documented to file in the design history file (i.e., complete test reports
do not need to be submitted to FDA).

G. Non-Clinical Bench Testing
The purpose of the non-clinical bench testing is to ensure that the device performs as
intended under the specified conditions of use and supports a demonstration of substantial
equivalence to the predicate device. The non-clinical performance testing recommended for
each device’s intended use may vary based on its respective risk profile associated with the
intended target vasculature. FDA recommends that you provide the information below to
evaluate the material and performance characteristics of your final, sterilized device that
represents the worst-case design for each performance test. Where appropriate, the
performance of the proposed device should be compared to that of the predicate device.8 If a
test listed in Section IV.G. Non-Clinical Performance Testing is excluded from your
submission, we recommend that you provide a clinical and risk-based justification for its
omission.
For information on recommended content and format of test reports for the testing described
in this section, refer to FDA’s guidance, “Recommended Content and Format Non-Clinical
Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.”9

1. Pre-Conditioning
Pre-conditioning can include a variety of test sample preparations and may depend on the test
being conducted. Prior to conducting the non-clinical performance testing, we recommend
that you prepare the device per the instructions for use. For certain device characteristics
being evaluated (e.g., coating integrity, particulate generation), you should also subject the
device to additional pre-conditioning (e.g., extended soaking in physiologically relevant
solution at 37˚C), and tracking through a simulated use model as discussed in Section
IV.G.2. Simulated Use Model) to present worst-case clinical use. We recommend that you
clinically justify pre-conditioning parameters used for each test, where applicable.

2. Simulated Use Model
The simulated use model may be used when pre-conditioning or when testing in simulated
anatomy is recommended. Your anatomical model should be appropriately tortuous to
represent a challenging vasculature for the patient population intended to be treated. When
designing your anatomical model, you should consider lumen diameter, bend radii, bend
reversals, number of bends, tracking length, and coefficient of friction of tracking materials
(e.g., polyurethane, silicone, Teflon, glass latex, native vessel). We recommend that your
anatomical model include all relevant pathway attributes to represent the human anatomy.
Should a two-dimensional anatomical model be chosen rather than a three-dimensional
model, all native pathway attributes should be maintained and represented within the model.
Furthermore, the anatomical model should appropriately model the various anticipated
curvatures and disease states, if applicable, the device will encounter from all proposed
access sites. While there are currently no standardized models of the coronary vasculature,
peripheral vasculature and/or neurovasculature, an example of a tracking fixture that FDA
has previously accepted in premarket submissions is described in Figure X2.4 of ASTM
F2394-07: Standard Guide for Measuring Securement of Balloon Expandable Vascular Stent
Mounted on Delivery System.
When describing your simulated use model(s), we recommend that you identify the materials
of construction of the model and include images and engineering diagrams with dimensions
(e.g., lengths, tubing diameters, radii of bend). We also recommend that a clinical rationale
supporting the selection of the anatomical model parameters include a review of available
imaging data or literature regarding the anatomy of the intended population. In addition, for
devices intended to be used in the neurovasculature, your simulated use model should be as
tortuous as the relevant vasculature included in your instructions for use. Specifically, we
recommend that you use a full three-dimensional anatomical model including the intended
access site (e.g., femoral, radial) to the intended target location in the neurovasculature. To
simulate a clinically challenging tortuosity, your full neurovascular anatomical model should
include, at a minimum, the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) siphon, two (2) 180-degree turns
and two (2) 360-degree turns, at the distal portion of the anatomical model. Alternative
neurovasculature anatomical models should be justified with respect to clinically challenging
neurovasculature tortuosity based on the intended use of the device and/or specific
performance test being evaluated.

3. Dimensional Verification
Significance: Accurate device dimensions help the physician to select appropriate product
sizes. They can also affect the functional behavior of the device.
Recommendation: We recommend providing dimensional specifications and tolerances for
the device as manufactured. The tolerances chosen should be based on risk and should have
an appropriate clinically or scientifically relevant justification. We recommend using a
calibrated tool to verify each dimension. At a minimum, the length and outer diameter should
be measured and reported. If applicable, tip length, coating length, or other guidewire
features should also be reported.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

4. Visual Inspection
Significance: Guidewire defects, including kinks, cracks, deformations or debris, can
contribute to clinical complications, affecting the safety and performance of the device.
Recommendation: We recommend testing to ensure that the devices are free of extraneous
matter and surface defects due to processing that could cause trauma to the vessels during
use. If the device is coated, the coating should appear uniform. We recommend examining
the devices with a minimum 2.5X magnification. This test may be conducted independently
or in conjunction with another performance test if performed prior to performance testing to
represent the as-manufactured product. Please note that for coated devices, visual inspection
alone at 2.5X magnification is likely insufficient to adequately evaluate the coating integrity
and additional test considerations should be followed (see Section IV.G.10. Coating
Integrity).

5. Simulated Use
Significance: Use of the device in a simulated use model, in combination with other
interventional devices, as appropriate, can provide more clinically relevant information about
its performance than isolated bench top performance testing.
Recommendation: We recommend that you use your device in combination with ancillary
devices (e.g., introducer, guiding catheter) according to the instructions for use and track the
device through the simulated use model multiple times. Please see Section IV.G.2 Simulated
Use Model for recommendations in developing your anatomical model. You should report
observations regarding compatibility with ancillary devices, appropriate preparation, and the
maneuverability of the device through the simulated use model. You should also report the
integrity of the device prior to, during (e.g., kinking, compromised push ability), and after
use. This test may be conducted in conjunction with other tests when appropriately justified.

6. Tensile Strength
Significance: Joint failure could lead to device failure and/or vessel damage.
Recommendation: We recommend testing the strength of each unique joint to failure. If there
are multiple joints composed of the same material and adhesion method, then the worst-case
joint may be used to represent all joints. Prior to testing we recommend that the samples are
prepared per the instructions for use and then pre-conditioned as needed to simulate worstcase conditions and tracked through a simulated use model. Tensile strength testing should
demonstrate that your device is capable of withstanding tensile forces greater than those
expected in clinical use. When setting your acceptance criteria, we recommend that you
consider testing the predicate device concurrently or determine the theoretical force based on
clinical information. When the acceptance criteria are established, a clinical basis for their
appropriateness should be included in your protocol. Because the strain rate used may affect
the resulting data, and thus, the acceptability of the acceptance criteria and results, we also
recommend that you report the strain rate used to test each sample and justify this rate.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

7. Tip Pull
Significance: Tip detachment may adversely impact clinical performance (e.g., result in distal
embolization).
Recommendation: For guidewires that contain one or more joints at the distal tip (e.g., spring
or coil tips), we recommend evaluating the tensile force to separate the distal tip from the
guidewire. Prior to testing, we recommend that the samples are prepared per the instructions
for use and then pre-conditioned as needed to simulate worst-case conditions and tracked
through a simulated use model. This test may be performed as part of the tensile strength
assessment (see Section IV.G.6 Tensile Strength above), if applicable.

8. Torque Strength
Significance: Inability to withstand torsional forces typical of clinical use (i.e.,
torqueing/rotating the device to navigate to the target vasculature) may lead to device failure
and/or vessel damage.
Recommendation: We recommend that you prepare the samples per the instructions for use,
pre-condition as needed to simulate worst-case conditions and track each device through a
simulated use model. We recommend the distal end of the device be constrained from
movement and the proximal end of the guidewire be rotated until failure. We recommend
that you report the number of rotations to failure and the failure mode for each device tested.

9. Torqueability
Significance: An inability of the distal tip to respond to manipulations made at the proximal
end may adversely impact clinical performance (e.g., whipping effects may cause vessel
damage and/or inability to navigate vessels).
Recommendation: We recommend that you prepare the samples per the instructions for use,
pre-condition as needed to simulate worst-case conditions and track each device through a
simulated use model. With the sample in the simulated use model and the distal end
unconstrained, we recommend that you rotate the proximal end of the guidewire. You should
report the rotational input to the resulting distal rotation at 90-degree intervals (with your
applied rotation angle determined with reference to the device risk and intended use) and
calculate a proximal-to-distal rotational ratio for each sample.

10. Coating Integrity
Significance: Coating separation (i.e., peeling, flaking, shedding delamination and/or
sloughing off) or degradation may adversely impact clinical performance (e.g., result in
inflammation at access site, pulmonary embolization, pulmonary infarct, myocardial
embolization, myocardial infarct, embolic stroke, cerebral infarct, tissue necrosis, or death).10

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Recommendation: Coating integrity testing should include an interpretation of the data
collected (including a discussion of why any observed defects are acceptable given the
intended use and potential risk associated with the intended use) before and after subjecting
the device to simulated use testing in a representative tortuous model. We recommend
assessing the device for any coating delamination or degradation during simulated use. You
should provide representative images (using scanning electron microscopy and/or optical
microscopy) of the coated surface pre- and post-simulated use testing. Images should be
taken using ≥40X magnifications in order to detail any coating defect. Multiple
magnifications (up to 500X) may be needed to properly visualize any observed defects. If
your coating is clear, it may be beneficial to dye the coating prior to assessing the device
surface in order to allow for proper visualization. It may be helpful to include baseline (i.e.,
before simulated use) reference samples for comparative purposes if the guidewire is dyed.
We recommend that you conduct the coating integrity testing simultaneously with the
particulate evaluation as described in Section IV.G.11. Particulate Evaluation to assess the
origin, quantity, and size of particulates that may be removed from your device during
simulated use. If your device contains coating defects, you should provide a scientific
rationale explaining why the coating anomalies do not pose a safety risk.

11. Particulate Evaluation
Significance: Particulate generation during clinical use may result in serious adverse events
including pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, myocardial embolism, myocardial
infarction, embolic stroke, tissue necrosis and death; therefore, guidewires intended to
navigate the coronary vasculature or neurovasculature pose the greatest clinical risk and
should be evaluated for particle generation along with coating integrity assessment in a
representative simulated use model. If your device is intended to only navigate the peripheral
vasculature and the coating integrity evaluation identified coating defects (e.g., along the
length of the guidewire) that may raise additional clinical concerns, particulate evaluation
may be needed to address potential safety concerns.
Recommendation: To accurately account for particulates generated during the use of your
device, the particles should be characterized after simulated use. We recommend that the
number of particulates generated at each evaluation be quantified and characterized by size
and count using a validated method (e.g., light obscuration, light refraction) under continuous
flow conditions to simulate blood flow. Specifically, we recommend that the total number of
particulates be reported in the following size ranges: ≥ 10μm, ≥ 25μm, and at the largest size
for which validation yields ≥ 75% recovery. At a minimum, the largest size should be
≥ 50μm. For particulates that are greater than 50 µm, we recommend that you distinguish, by
percentage, the amount that are ≥ 200 µm, ≥ 500 µm and ≥ 1000 µm, if those measurement
methods are available, as these larger sized particulates pose a greater embolic risk.
Appropriate precautions should also be implemented to ensure that the particles are
suspended during particle counting and sizing to minimize aggregation and other artifacts
from the test system. For further guidance on particulate evaluation, please refer to Section
VIII.A.13. of FDA Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, “Class II Special Controls
Guidance Document for Certain Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA)
Catheters” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
documents/class-ii-special-controls-guidance-document-certain-percutaneous-transluminalcoronary-angioplasty).
You should provide a clinical discussion explaining why the results of the particulate
evaluation and the associated coating integrity assessments do not raise a safety concern. If
the particulate evaluation raises safety concerns, then chemical characterization may be
needed to identify the particulate source(s).

12. Lubricityy
Significance: Lubricious coatings may be incorporated to decrease frictional forces
experienced when navigating the target vasculature, and the functionality and performance of
these coatings should be demonstrated.
Recommendation: We recommend that you characterize the drag force of the coating (e.g.,
pinch test) after the samples are prepared per the instructions for use and then preconditioned as needed to simulate worst-case conditions. In addition to coating integrity
testing (Section IV.G.10), you should consider assessing the coating durability by performing
the lubricity test multiple times (i.e., a clinically relevant number of passes). The mechanism
of lubrication (e.g., hydrodynamic) should be identified. Any observations (e.g. the changes
in the drag forces with cycling, coating defects using high resolution imaging) and
conclusions should be reported.

13. Corrosion Resistance
Significance: Guidewire corrosion can cause or contribute to premature device failure. In
addition, corrosion byproducts may be toxic or cause other adverse biological and tissue
responses.
Recommendation: We recommend that any metallic component of the device be examined
for signs of corrosion after an immersion test (e.g., exposure of the device to a series of saline
baths at room temperature, boiling, and 37˚C beyond the maximum expected clinical use
duration). For more information regarding recommendations of methodology for this testing,
please refer to the currently recognized version of ISO 10555-1: Intravascular catheters –
Sterile and single-use catheters – Part 1: General requirements, Annex A. Although this
standard has been written for intravascular catheters, the method used to evaluate corrosion
resistance is applicable to guidewires.

14. Kink Resistance
Significance: Guidewires may be subjected to bending forces during use, and an inability to
withstand forces that are typical of clinical use could lead to device failure and/or vessel
damage.
Recommendation: Your device should demonstrate resistance to kinking (and other failure
modes) when bent around anatomically relevant radii. The samples should be prepared per
the instructions for use and then pre-conditioned as needed to simulate worst-case conditions.
To evaluate the resistance to kinking, you should bend the guidewire around mandrels of
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
decreasing radii until kink, plastic deformation, and/or fracture occurs or to the smallest bend
radii expected during clinical use, whichever comes first. This evaluation should account for
all joints. When reporting the results, you should identify the mandrel sizes tested, which
mandrel caused device failure, the location of failure and the type of failure observed.

15. Tip Flexibility
Significance: Safe and successful navigation through tortuous vessels relies on the
mechanical properties of the guidewire tip. Inappropriately designed guidewire tips may
result in vessel perforation, dissection and/or other vessel damage.
Recommendation: After the samples are prepared per the instructions for use and then preconditioned as needed to simulate worst-case conditions, we recommend that you identify the
force that induces buckling deformation when the device is held at 5, 10 and 20 mm from the
distal tip.

16. Radiopacity
Significance: Insufficient radiopacity could impede safe and appropriate usage of the device
as it will not be clearly visible during use.
Recommendation: We recommend choosing a sample size up to 5 devices to ensure that the
radiopaque markers or radiopaque portions of the device are visible using clinical imaging
techniques. We recommend a qualitative or quantitative measure of radiopacity, wherein the
guidewire is compared to a standard material or predicate device as a control via real-time or
plain film x-ray. It is acceptable to use data acquired as part of animal studies, in vitro
phantoms, or equivalent models.11 For additional information regarding recommendations of
methodology for this testing, please refer to the currently recognized version of ASTM F640:
Standard Test Method for Determining Radiopacity for Medical Use. We recommend
including high-quality images of the guidewires and the control(s) in your submission.

A. Clinical Performance Testing
Significance: In some cases, pre-clinical evaluation does not fully characterize all clinical
experience, outcomes, and risks. In such cases, we recommend that you conduct in vivo (i.e.,
clinical) studies to evaluate device safety and effectiveness for new and modified guidewires.
Recommendation: Clinical evidence is generally unnecessary for most guidewires; however,
such testing may be requested in situations such as the following:
· indications for use in complex clinical scenarios (e.g., crossing chronic total
occlusions (CTOs)) of the coronary and peripheral arteries;

11

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible.
We encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is
suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for
equivalency to an animal test method.

cases where engineering and/or animal testing raise issues that warrant further
evaluation with clinical evidence;
indications for use dissimilar from legally marketed devices of the same type; or
new technology, i.e., technology different from that used in legally marketed devices
of the same type yet does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness.

We will consider alternatives to clinical testing (such as animal testing) when the proposed
alternatives are supported by an adequate scientific rationale. If a clinical study is needed to
demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to obtaining 510(k) clearance of
the device, the study must be conducted under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE)
regulation, 21 CFR Part 812. Generally, FDA believes guidewires addressed by this guidance
document are significant risk devices subject to all requirements of 21 CFR 812. See the
FDA Guidance titled, “Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies.”12
In addition to the requirements of Section 21 CFR 812, sponsors of such trials must comply
with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR Part 56) and informed
consent (21 CFR Part 50).
In some cases, “real-world data” (RWD) may be used to support expansion of the indication
for a device for which 510(k) clearance has already been obtained. Whether the collection of
RWD for a legally-marketed device requires an IDE depends on the particular facts of the
situation. Specifically, if a cleared device is being used in the normal course of medical
practice, an IDE would likely not be required. For additional information regarding this topic,
please refer to the FDA Guidance entitled “Use of Real-World Evidence to Support
Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices.”13

B. Labeling
The premarket notification must include proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). Proposed labels and labeling, sufficient to describe
guidewires, their intended use, and the directions for use must be provided.
As a prescription device, guidewires are exempt from having adequate directions for lay use
required under section 502(f)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)
(21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1))) as long as the conditions in 21 CFR 801.109 are met. For instance,
labeling must include adequate information for the intended user of the device, including
indications, effects, routes, methods, frequency and duration of administration and any
relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects and precautions (21 CFR 801.109(d)).

Lubricious Coating”14, which includes specific labeling recommendations for this subset of
guidewires. The instructions for use or package insert should include the following
information. The list below is not intended to be exhaustive of all the labeling requirements
under part 801.

1. Device Description
We recommend that you include a description of the guidewire identifying the important
components and the functions of each such as the length, outer diameter along the length
including transition zones, tip shape, coating location(s) and characteristics (e.g.,
hydrophobic or hydrophilic), if applicable.

2. Indications for Use Statement
The indications for use statement described in the labeling should be supported by
information in the 510(k) submission and clearly identify any specific regions of the
vasculature.

3. Contraindications
We recommend including contraindications to describe situations in which there are known
hazards or risks, as applicable, in the instructions for use. If you believe there are no known
contraindications, please state “none known”.

4. Warnings/Precautions
We recommend including the following warnings/precautions, as applicable, in the
instructions for use. Sample language is provided in italics. If you believe any of these
warnings/precautions are not applicable to your device, please provide a justification for each
omission.
· A warning statement regarding the indications for which the device has been
confirmed to perform as intended, such as the following: “The safety and
effectiveness of the device has not been established or is unknown in vascular regions
other than those specifically indicated.” For example, if a specific guidewire is only
indicated for peripheral vascular use based on the information provided in the 510(k)
submission, the device should include a warning that the safety and effectiveness of
the device has not been established in the coronary vasculature or neurovasculature.
· A warning against reuse or re-sterilization of the device, which could affect medical
device materials and components, such as “This device is intended for single use. Do
not reuse or re-sterilize.”
· A warning statement about the unestablished safety and effectiveness of a
reprocessed device intended for multiple uses. For example, “The device is intended
for single-patient use and should not be reprocessed or used after reprocessing.”

Guidewires should be used under fluoroscopic guidance. We recommend that you
consider the inclusion of important precautions and/or warnings to ensure the safety
of device use associated with fluoroscopy for both patients and clinical operators.

5. Potential Adverse Events
We recommend that you include information on the potential adverse events that may result
from use of your device. FDA acknowledges that the specific adverse events may depend on
the specific design and intended use of the device. Such adverse event may include, but are
not limited to:
· Access site complications
· Allergic reaction (to contrast, device or other)
· Aneurysm
· Angina or unstable angina
· Bleeding/hemorrhage
· Cardiac tamponade/pericardial effusion
· Death
· Embolization (plaque, thrombus, device, tissue, or other)
· Infection
· Myocardial infarction or ischemia
· Stroke/cerebral vascular accident (CVA)/transient ischemic attack (TIA)
· Thrombosis/Thrombus
· Vasospasm
· Vessel trauma, perforation, dissection
· X-Ray radiation exposure complications (e.g., alopecia, burns ranging in severity
from skin reddening to ulcers, cataracts, and delayed neoplasia)

6. Directions for Use
We recommend that you provide specific directions for use of the guidewire. If your device
contains a coating(s), then the directions for use should clearly explain how to properly
prepare the device prior to clinical use.

V.

Modifications

In accordance with 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), a device modification “that could significantly
affect the safety or effectiveness of the device” or represents “a major change or modification
in the intended use of the device” requires a new 510(k). The changes or modifications listed
below would likely require submission of a new 510(k). Note that this list is not exhaustive
but provides examples of modifications that will generally require submission of a new
510(k). For additional details, please see FDA guidance “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k)
for a Change to an Existing Device.”15
Such changes or modifications include:

Guidewire Material – A change in core guidewire material could significantly affect
both safety and effectiveness of the device by altering the biocompatibility risk
profile or device performance.
Coating(s) Location, Material, Amount, or Processing – A change in the coating
composition, location, and the processes used to apply the coating could significantly
affect both safety and effectiveness of the device by altering the biocompatibility risk
profile and/or device performance.
Dimensions Not Previously Cleared – A change to a critical dimensional
characteristic of the guidewire that is beyond the previously cleared range for your
device could significantly affect both safety and effectiveness by significantly
affecting the performance risk profile.
Tip Configuration – A change to the tip shape, material, or adhesion process could
significantly affect both the safety and effectiveness of the device because of a
change to the known risk of tip detachment and the ability of the guidewire to
properly navigate the intended vasculature.
Additional Vasculature – A change in the target vasculature could significantly affect
both safety and effectiveness due to new or altered risks associated with different
clinical conditions than those previously addressed in prior submissions.

FDA believes that the following changes or modifications would likely not require
submission of a new 510(k):
· minor changes to the device packaging (e.g., hard copy of the Instructions for Use is
replaced by an electronically available copy);
· an extension of shelf life implemented according to the test protocols previously
reviewed under the cleared submission; or
· a dimensional change within the existing specification tolerance or a critical
dimensional characteristic that is within the range of the previously cleared device.
