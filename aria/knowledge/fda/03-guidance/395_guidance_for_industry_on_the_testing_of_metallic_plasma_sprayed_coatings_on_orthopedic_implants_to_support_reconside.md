Guidance1 for Industry on the Testing of
Metallic Plasma Sprayed Coatings on
Orthopedic Implants to Support
Reconsideration of Postmarket
Surveillance Requirements
This guidance document supersedes an earlier document titled “Draft Guidance for Industry on the
Testing of Metallic Plasma Sprayed Coatings on Orthopedic Implants to Support Reconsideration of
Postmarket Surveillance Requirements”. The previous version was released for public comment on
February 22, 1999. In preparing this document, consideration was given to comments submitted to
earlier drafts of this document.

I. BACKGROUND
On February 21, 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reclassified the metallic porous
coated hip prosthesis intended for biological (i.e., cementless) fixation from class III (premarket
approval required) to class II (see 21 CFR 888.3358). The reclassified porous coated hip prostheses
achieved cementless fixation by using metallic porous coatings. Sintering, or diffusion bonding,
processes were used to attach the metallic porous coatings to the solid metal of the prostheses. On
February 15, 1994, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) Orthopedic and
Rehabilitation Devices Branch (ORDB) determined that hip prostheses intended for biological fixation
through porous coatings applied by plasma spray production methods can be substantially equivalent to
the reclassified porous coated hip prosthesis. As part of the latter decision, CDRH, using the then
existing authority of section 522(a)(1)(C) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the act), required
manufacturers of plasma sprayed porous coated hip prostheses to conduct postmarket surveillance of
their devices. The required postmarket surveillance consisted of prospective, long-term, follow-up of a
population of patients receiving cementless implantation of the manufacturer's plasma spray coated hip
prosthesis. The objective of patient follow-up was to determine the long-term revision rate for each
manufacturer’s plasma sprayed porous coated hip prosthesis.
When CDRH required postmarket surveillance, it believed that the term ‘plasma spray’ represented a
single manufacturing technique that produced a single form of coating, having a single set of material
properties. Since that time, CDRH has come to recognize that plasma spray

This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current thinking on the above. It does not
create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach
may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.

manufacturing methods are a subset of a larger group of ‘thermal spray’ metallic coating production
methods. CDRH now recognizes that thermal spray coating methods, including plasma spray methods,
can produce a wide range of metallic coatings with a wide range of material properties.
The CDRH does not believe that postmarket surveillance is necessary for thermal spray coated hip
prostheses whose coatings have mechanical properties equal to, or better than, sintered or diffusion
bonded porous coatings. CDRH is willing to reconsider, on a case-by-case basis, its orders requiring
postmarket surveillance of a plasma spray coated hip prosthesis. Manufacturers of plasma spray
coated hip prostheses who received an order to conduct postmarket surveillance, are invited to apply
for reconsideration of the surveillance order. A request for reconsideration should include all of the
information identified in this guidance document, should be addressed to the Required Postmarket
Surveillance file number, and should be sent to:
Center for Devices and Radiological Health
Postmarket Surveillance Document Mail Center
Room 330Q (HFZ-544)
1350 Piccard Drive
Rockville, MD 20850
A request for reconsideration may be supported by data or information previously submitted to CDRH.
Previously submitted data or information may be resubmitted or incorporated by reference. If data or
information is incorporated by reference, applicants should state the document number, the date of
submission, the section, chapter, or attachment number, and page number of the information. CDRH
believes that requests for reconsideration that contain copies of all necessary data and information will
be easier and faster to review.
CDRH requests that manufacturers of joint prostheses having metallic thermal spray coatings include
data from the test methods described in this document in future 510(k)s for new products. CDRH
intends to use the data to determine if new thermal spray coatings have material properties equal to, or
better than, those described in this guidance document. The information requested can be used to
determine if the new metallic thermal spray coated hip prostheses should be subject to postmarket
surveillance requirements. If a new joint prosthesis requires postmarket surveillance, the requirements
could be expected to be similar to those required of metallic plasma spray coated hip prostheses.
Note: This guidance document represents the agency’s current thinking on the testing results that will
enable FDA to reconsider the requirement for postmarket surveillance of plasma sprayed hip
prostheses. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate
to bind FDA or the public. If alternative approaches satisfy the requirements of the applicable
statute, regulations, or both, the alternative approaches may be used.
Suggestions and recommendations presented in this document are not mandatory requirements,
but reflect data and methodologies that CDRH believes could be acceptable. In this context,
please note:

This document suggests some important evaluation criteria, test procedures, and end
points. There may be circumstances where alternative methods or additional information
may be useful.
If the objectives of this document can be accomplished by means other than those stated
herein, do not refrain from using those means.
Some of the following recommended test methods may have to be modified, and/or
additional methods may be needed, to address the individual properties of a particular
product.
As scientific knowledge changes and scientific techniques improve, CDRH may update this
document. The basic objectives of the document, however, are likely to remain the same.

II. REQUESTED INFORMATION
Metallurgical Analysis of the Materials
The composition, trace elements analysis, and material microstructure (e.g., grain size, amounts of
different phases, etc.) of the substrate and modified surfaces of the final product should be expressed
quantitatively. Photomicrographs of the microstructure of the finished material should be included.
If the device assembly is made of material combinations with limited, or no, history of successful use as
orthopedic implants, the corrosion over the entire surface of the final device, and interfacing
components, should be equal to or less than that measured in a legally marketed device of the same
function. Electrochemical methods for determining corrosion potential (Ecorr) and rate (Icorr) may be used,
though they may not be sensitive enough. For example, differences in particle size, sharpness and stress
may cause differences in rates of corrosion for which ion release measurements may be more sensitive.
Ion release measurements provide direct quantitative data on the parameter of greatest interest, viz., the
amount of ions in solution. To address galvanic potential between different materials, the interfaces
between coatings and substrate should be examined for signs of corrosion by optical and scanning
electron microscopy.
Microstructure of the Modified Surface
The total number of different modified surface layers and the following parameters concerning each
physically and/or chemically distinct layer of the modified surface should be provided:
_

the surface thickness (average and range) as per American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM) F1854;

Page 3

_
_
_
_

either drawings or photographs of the product illustrating the position of the modified surface(s)
and any variation in modified surface thickness;
the shape and size (average, standard deviation and range) of the particles or material between
the pores;
the diameter or area of the welds (average and standard deviation) between surface coating
particles and between coating particles and substrate; and
microphotographs at appropriate magnifications and locations within the modified surface so all
geometrical characteristics of the microstructure listed in this document will be recognizable
(either the original magnification or a magnification bar should be included with each image).

The following parameters concerning the spaces within the modified surface (i.e., voids) should be
provided as per ASTM F1854:
_
_
_

void size (average and standard deviation) at the surface;
the minimum void intercept length or minimum void size of the interconnecting porosity (average,
standard deviation and range) for each physically distinct layer; and
the mean volume percent of voids.

Mechanical Properties - Modified Surface
CDRH recommends that a statistically adequate number of samples be tested at each load in each test.
Generally, five plasma sprayed coating samples will be needed, unless it can be shown that a smaller
number of samples can give adequate power of the test and adequate Type I and Type II errors.
Either finished devices or surface treated coupon samples processed identically to the final device
should be used in the tests below.
1.

The shear fatigue strength of surface coating should be tested out to at least 107 cycles as per
ASTM F1160, or a justification for the test method used should be provided, e.g., Pilliar, 1975;
or Manley, 1987.

2.

The static shear strength of the surface/substrate interface should be tested by either method
described in ASTM F-1044. The thermal sprayed coating should exceed 20 Mpa in shear
strength. (ASTM F 1044, Levine, 1985).

3.

The static tensile strength of the surface/substrate interface should be tested by either method
described in ASTM F-1147. The coating should exceed 22 Mpa in tensile strength. (Levine,
1985; Ducheyne, 1986). Tension may be applied to the modified surface using a polymeric
adhesive with a minimum tensile strength of 24.1 Mpa (ASTM C 633: Adhesion or Cohesive
Strength of Flame-Sprayed Coatings). The properties of the adhesive should be reported.

Page 4

4.

The abrasion resistance of the coating should be tested as described in ASTM 1978-99. The
Taber Abraser should be loaded with an H-22 wheel, use a total load of 250 g-f and each
sample should be run for 100 cycles. Samples should have mass loss and cumulative mass loss
determinations reported after 2, 5, 10 and 100 cycles. Mass losses should be reported as
means with standard deviations. Thermal spray coatings should lose less than a total of 65 mg
(by weight) when abraded for 100 cycles.

III. MANUFACTURING
The manufacturing process of the final product and the test samples should be described in enough
detail to explain any significant differences in properties between the test sample and currently marketed
devices.

IV. REPORTING
To help in the review, and to facilitate a reconsideration, a very brief summary (including numerical
values and their units) of all information should be organized as suggested in Section VI, MODIFIED
SURFACE DATA FORMS. Any additional and important information not specifically mentioned in
this document should be inserted where appropriate. All the data summarized in one set of modified
surface data forms should pertain to only one modified surface design. A separate set of modified
surface data forms should be submitted for every modified surface having a significant difference in any
property, including those listed in this document. Detailed test reports, summarizing the original data,
should be included in the submission to FDA. The detailed reports should include, but not be limited to,
the following information:
1.

material structure and processing methods between the test samples and the device to
be marketed;

Page 5

c.

the assumptions of the test, including assumed physiological loading values and
environmental conditions;

d.

at least 5 identical samples for each type of test specimens or statistical justification for
the number of each chosen;

e.
