Institutional Review Board (IRB) Written Procedures:
Guidance for Institutions and IRBs
This guidance represents the Office for Human Research Protections’ (OHRP’s) and the Food
and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic. This guidance does not create
or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind OHRP, FDA, or the public.
You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate
OHRP or FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the
appropriate OHRP or FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the second title page of
this guidance.
I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance has been prepared jointly by the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). To enhance human subject protection and reduce regulatory burden, OHRP and FDA
have been actively working to harmonize the Agencies’ regulatory requirements and guidance
for human subject research. This guidance document was developed as a part of these efforts. In
addition, on December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) (Pub. L. 114-255) was
signed into law. Title III, section 3023 of the Cures Act requires the Secretary of HHS to
harmonize differences between the HHS human subject regulations and FDA’s human subject
regulations. This guidance document is consistent with the goals of section 3023 of the Cures
Act. This guidance is intended for institutions and institutional review boards (IRBs) responsible
for review and oversight of human subject research under the HHS and FDA regulations.
OHRP and FDA believe that when institutions and IRBs develop and follow clear written
procedures, there is an increased likelihood that the rights and welfare of human subjects will be
protected. The purpose of this guidance is to assist staff at institutions and IRBs who are
responsible for preparing and maintaining written procedures. The guidance includes a Written
Procedures Checklist (also referred to in this guidance as the Checklist) that incorporates the
HHS and FDA regulatory requirements for written procedures for the IRB and recommendations
on the type of operational details to include to support each of these requirements. In addition,
the Checklist includes some additional topics the institution/IRB may consider when developing
comprehensive procedures.
OHRP’s and FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes OHRP’s and FDA’s current thinking on
a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word must in OHRP and FDA joint guidance means that
something is required under the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46 or the FDA regulations at 21
CFR parts 50 and 56. The use of the word should in OHRP and FDA joint guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II.

BACKGROUND

IRBs must comply with HHS and FDA regulations in 45 CFR part 46 and 21 CFR parts 50 and
56, respectively, when reviewing research subject to those regulations. Both the HHS
regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4) and (5) and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.108(a) and (b)
state that IRBs must follow written procedures for the following functions and operations:
1. Conducting initial and continuing review of research and reporting findings and
actions to the investigator and the institution;
2. Determining which projects require review more often than annually and determining
which projects need verification from sources other than the investigator that no
material changes have occurred since previous IRB review;
3. Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity and
ensuring that changes in approved research, during the period for which IRB approval
has already been given, may not be initiated without IRB review and approval except
where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the human subjects;
4. Ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the
department or agency head (i.e., OHRP) for research conducted or supported by HHS,
and FDA for FDA-regulated research of any:
•
•
•
III.

Unanticipated problems involving risks to human subjects or others;
Instance of serious or continuing noncompliance with the applicable HHS and
FDA regulations or the requirements or determinations of the IRB;
Suspension or termination of IRB approval.

DISCUSSION

OHRP and FDA frequently receive questions about the scope and content of written procedures.
We recognize that written procedures may vary among institutions and IRBs because of
differences in the way organizations are structured, the type of research studies reviewed by the
IRB, institutional policy or administrative practices, the number of IRBs at the institution,
affiliation with an institution, and local and state laws and regulations. To provide guidance on
the appropriate content of written procedures, while considering these variations, this guidance
provides a Written Procedures Checklist to assist institutions and IRBs in preparing and
maintaining detailed written procedures. The Checklist is designed to prompt a thorough
evaluation of written procedures that help to ensure the protection of human research subjects.

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
HHS and FDA regulations 1 allow flexibility in both format and content of written procedures,
which gives IRBs the ability to establish procedures best suited to their own operations. Written
procedures may be maintained electronically or may be paper-based and formatted in a style that
conforms to the needs of the institution. Institutions/IRBs may choose to create written
procedures that focus solely on the regulatory responsibilities of the IRB, or they may choose to
also incorporate institutional policies and procedures that are a function of the institution’s
Human Research Protections Program (HRPP). Detailed administrative procedures for the IRB
support staff (e.g., how and where to track study approvals for calculating continuing review)
may be included, or may be managed through other locally written policies and procedures (e.g.,
work instructions, standard operating procedures (SOPs), or a staff operations manual).
Institutions and IRBs should use the flexibility afforded by the regulations to adopt written
procedures that are suitable for their organizations.
OHRP and FDA have observed that some IRBs develop written procedures for the IRB that
simply restate the regulations at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4) and (5), and at 21 CFR 56.108(a) and (b).
In general, this approach does not provide sufficient detail about the IRB’s operations to ensure
that the IRB’s operations meet the applicable regulatory requirements. Developing meaningful
content for written procedures involves a comprehensive and critical assessment of the IRB’s
responsibilities, functions, and operations, and the institution’s organizational structure. Written
procedures should be sufficiently detailed to help IRB members and institutional administrative
staff understand how to carry out their duties in a consistent and effective way that ensures that
the rights and welfare of subjects are protected and that the IRB operates in compliance with the
regulations. When preparing written procedures, institutions/IRBs should generally identify who
carries out specific duties by reference to position title (e.g., IRB chairperson) rather than by
name to avoid the need to update written procedures if duties change, or there are changes in IRB
membership.
Both OHRP and FDA have issued many guidance documents 2 that cover numerous topics that
may serve as useful resources to staff at institutions and IRBs who prepare written procedures.
For example, guidance on IRB continuing review of research 3 offers recommendations about the
type of information to include in written procedures specific to continuing review, which should
be incorporated into the written procedures for the IRB. We recommend that institutions/IRBs
review all relevant OHRP and FDA guidance documents when preparing written procedures.
Institutions/IRBs may decide to make their written procedures available to ensure that others
(e.g., investigators, sponsors) are aware of the IRB’s requirements, and to facilitate compliance.
Some institutions/IRBs post their written procedures on a website to provide broad access.
Written procedures should be reviewed on a regular basis and updated as necessary to ensure
they reflect the institution’s/IRB’s current processes.

WRITTEN PROCEDURES CHECKLIST

Sections I-IV of the Written Procedures Checklist identify each HHS and FDA regulatory
requirement for written procedures for the IRB set forth in 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4) and (5) and 21
CFR 56.108(a) and (b) (REGULATORY REQUIREMENT) along with suggestions
(RECOMMENDATIONS) about operational details to include in support of each regulatory
requirement. Section V of the Written Procedures Checklist identifies some additional topics the
institution/IRB may consider when developing comprehensive procedures.
Although the IRB must follow written procedures for functions and operations specifically
described at 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4) and (5), and/or 21 CFR 56.108(a) and (b), there are other IRB
activities that require findings and determinations for which the underlying regulations do not
explicitly require the IRB to follow a written procedure. The Checklist includes footnotes that
identify these underlying regulations, as well as other relevant regulations that we recommend
institutions and IRBs consider when preparing written procedures.
For example, an IRB that reviews studies involving children must follow the regulatory
requirements for additional safeguards for children at 45 CFR part 46, subpart D, and/or 21 CFR
part 50, subpart D, and approve only those studies that satisfy the conditions of all applicable
sections of those subparts. Although the subpart D regulations do not explicitly require an IRB
to follow a written procedure for review of studies involving children, OHRP and FDA
recommend that written procedures for the IRB address the review of such studies (see
recommendation #10 in the Checklist under the regulatory requirement regarding written
procedures for conducting initial and continuing review).
As previously stated, institutions and IRBs have flexibility in how they choose to format their
written procedures and how much detail to include. For example, topics listed in the Checklist
may not be applicable to all institutions/IRBs. On the other hand, the institution/IRB may
determine that additional topics not found in the Checklist should be included (e.g., written
procedures related to how the IRB interacts with an Institutional Biosafety Committee or a
Radioactive Drug Research Committee). In addition, institutions/IRBs may choose to combine
items in the Checklist as needed to avoid redundancy, or use a different order than that presented
in the Checklist.
OHRP and FDA remind institutions and IRBs that the Checklist is intended to facilitate an
improved understanding of regulatory requirements in 45 CFR 46.103(b)(4) and (5) and 21 CFR
56.108(a) and (b) for written procedures for the IRB, to provide recommendations on the
operational details to include in support of these regulatory requirements, and to provide some
additional topics the institution/IRB may consider when developing comprehensive procedures.
The Checklist is intended to be a tool to assist in determining what information should be
covered in written procedures rather than a tool for assessing compliance.

On December 13, 2016, the President signed the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) into law. Title III, section 3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act amended
sections 520(g)(3) and 505(i)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to provide FDA with the authority to permit an exception from informed
consent when the proposed clinical testing poses no more than minimal risk to the human subject and includes appropriate safeguards to protect the rights, safety, and
welfare of the human subjects. FDA intends to promulgate regulations to permit this exception and to specify appropriate human subject protection safeguards. FDA
issued guidance in July 2017 for sponsors, investigators, and IRBs on enforcement of FDA regulations governing informed consent requirements for clinical
investigations that involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects – see https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm566474.htm.
