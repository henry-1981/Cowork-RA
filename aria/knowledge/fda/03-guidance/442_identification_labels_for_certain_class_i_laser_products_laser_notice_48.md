Subject: Identification Labels for Certain Class I
Laser Products

BACKGROUND AND QUESTION

The regulations for electronic products require each
electronic product for which a standard has been promulgated
to be identified with the name and address of the manufacturer
(21 CFR 1010.3). This identification is to be on a tag or
label permanently affixed to the product. Identification of
the product is required so the product may be traced for
recall in the event there is a defect in the product or the
product is found to be noncompliant. This requirement is
applicable to all laser products certified as complying with
the Federal performance standard for laser products, 21 CFR
1040.10 and 1040.11.

A manufacturer of certain types of laser products that are
Class I under all circumstances of operation, maintenance,
service or failure has requested that its company name not
appear on the identification label. The products are
certified and may be, for example, compact disc players or CD
ROM units that will be integrated into other products such as
music systems, automobiles, or computers. The manufacturer
(the integrator) of the music system, automobile or computer
is intended to be the primary contact for service rather than
the manufacturer of the laser product. The laser product
manufacturer wishes to hold large quantities of products as
ready-to-ship inventory that can be sold to any integrator
without having to be relabeled. The regulations already
permit, under 21 CFR 1010.3(a) (1), labeling a certified
product with a brand name other than that of the manufacturer
as long as the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH) is advised of the true identity of the affected
product.

POLICY

The CDRH will not object to the name of the original laser
product manufacturer not appearing as part of the
identification label when the following criteria are met:

1. The certified product is not modified in any aspect of
performance or intended use,

2. The level of laser radiation accessible during any
conditions of operation, maintenance, service or single
failure does not exceed the accessible emission limits
of Class I.

3. The identification label required by 21 CFR 1010.3
contains a code in lieu of the name and address of the
manufacturer, such as: FDA/CDRH ID: XXxXXx. This code
will be assigned by the CDRH to the manufacturer of the
certified product upon application, as permitted under
21 CFR 1010.3 (b).

Comments are invited and should be addressed to the Electronic
Products Branch, HFZ 342, Office of Compliance, Division of
Enforcement III, Center for Devices and Radiological Health,
2098 Gaither Road, Rockville, MD 20850.
