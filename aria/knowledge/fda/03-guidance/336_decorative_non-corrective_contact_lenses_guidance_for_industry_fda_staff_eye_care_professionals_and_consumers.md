On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Guidance for Industry, FDA Staff, Eye
Care Professionals, and Consumers
Decorative, Non-corrective Contact Lenses
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
On November 9, 2005, section 520(n) was added to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (the Act) by Public Law 109-96 to establish that all contact lenses are devices under
section 201(h) of the Act. Because all contact lenses are now regulated as devices, including
decorative, non-corrective contact lenses intended only to change the normal appearance of
the eye, all contact lenses must be the subject of a cleared premarket notification (510(k)) or
an approved premarket approval application (PMA) before they may be legally marketed.
Additional device authorities, such as the requirement that lenses be dispensed only upon a
prescription order, also apply. This guidance explains how section 520(n) affects FDA’s
regulation of non-corrective contact lenses intended to change the appearance or color of a
normal eye for decorative use.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal
requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those

1

requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less
burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your
written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH
Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to
contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

I. Background
FDA is aware of the distribution and use of non-corrective contact lenses that are used to
change the normal appearance of the eye in a decorative fashion, such as with colors or
designs (decorative contact lenses). Decorative contact lenses that do not have FDA
premarket authorization have been marketed directly to consumers. Consumers have
used such lenses without the benefit of a valid prescription.
Without a valid prescription, fitting, supervision, or regular check-ups by a qualified eye
care professional, decorative contact lenses, like all contact lenses, can cause a variety of
serious injuries or conditions. For example, lens wear has been associated with corneal
ulcer, which can lead rapidly to internal ocular infection if left untreated. Uncontrolled
infection can cause corneal scarring, which can lead to vision impairment, and in extreme
cases, blindness or the loss of an eye. Other risks include conjunctivitis; corneal edema
(swelling); allergic reaction; abrasion from poor lens fit; reduction in visual acuity,
contrast sensitivity, and other visual complications that can interfere with driving and
other activities.
Because of these risks, contact lenses, including decorative contact lenses that are noncorrective, are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by
law to direct the use of such devices. The Agency believes that these risks cannot be
sufficiently controlled unless the wearer does the following under professional
supervision:
•
•
•
•

Obtains advice about using contact lenses;
Has a valid prescription;
Has the lenses fitted properly; and
Remains under appropriate professional care for contact lens use.

II. How does recent legislation affect FDA’s regulation
of contact lenses?
FDA has reviewed premarket notification submissions (510(k)s) under section 510(k) of
the Act (21 U.S.C. 360(k)) and premarket approval applications (PMAs) under section
515 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 360(e)) for most corrective and non-corrective contact lenses
marketed in the United States, including certain decorative contact lenses intended to
2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
change the appearance of a normal eye. All currently approved or cleared decorative
contact lenses are legally marketed only as prescription devices (21 CFR 801.109).
However, some non-corrective, decorative contact lenses have not been reviewed by
FDA and are sold without a prescription. Although FDA had taken the position that
contact lenses intended solely for decorative use may be regulated as cosmetics under
section 201(i) of the Act, enactment of section 520(n) requires that all contact lenses be
regulated as devices.
Thus, all contact lenses in commercial distribution, including decorative contact lenses
that are non-corrective, require either a cleared 510(k), an approved PMA, or an
exemption for investigational use (IDE). Without such premarket authorization by FDA,
decorative contact lenses are adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C.
351(f)(1)(B)), and misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 352(o)).

III. Can manufacturers, importers, distributors, or
retailers market decorative contact lenses as over-thecounter products?
No. Decorative contact lenses should not be marketed or made available to consumers by
manufacturers, importers, distributors, or retailers as an over-the counter item.
Manufacturers or initial importers should cease distribution of the devices and submit to
FDA an appropriate premarket notification for clearance or application for approval if
they intend to distribute any type of non-corrective contact lenses, including decorative
lenses used to change the appearance of a normal eye. Guidance for 510(k) submissions
for contact lenses is located at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/conta.html. Contact lenses,
including decorative, non-corrective contact lenses, are also subject to general controls of
the Act, including the Quality System regulation (21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Part 820), and other applicable device regulations and statutory requirements, including
conformance with labeling requirements such as 21 CFR 801.109.

IV. Are manufacturers, importers, distributors, or
retailers subject to inspection by FDA?
Yes. FDA has inspected several firms distributing decorative contact lenses and warned
firms that selling decorative contact lenses without a valid prescription or proper labeling
that includes information about the risks and proper instructions for safe use violates
federal law. FDA has also alerted mass marketing firms and operators of on-line sites
about the risks associated with decorative contact lenses distributed without appropriate
eye care professional involvement.

V. How are imported lenses affected by FDA’s law?

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
As devices, imported decorative contact lenses that do not comply with applicable premarket
device requirements are subject to detention without physical examination under the
procedures described in FDA’s Import Alert #89-08, “Detention without Physical
Examination of Devices without Approved PMA’s or IDE’s and Other Devices not
Equivalent or no 510(k)” (see also section 801 of the act, 21 U.S.C. 381). The import alert
instructs FDA personnel and officials of the United States Customs Service to detain
automatically all devices presented at the United States ports of entry that are in violation of
federal law. Import Alert #89-08, can be accessed on the Internet at:
http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia8908.html.

VI. Can consumers still buy contact lenses used for
decorative purposes only?
Yes, if there is a valid prescription. As when buying all contact lens, consumers should
be seen by an eye care professional and obtain proper fitting and instructions for using a
contact lens. These devices present significant risks of eye injuries, including blindness,
if distributed without a valid prescription and the involvement of a qualified eye care
professional and appropriate follow-up care.
More information for consumers on the use of decorative lenses can be found on FDA’s
web site http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2003/NEW00955.html.
