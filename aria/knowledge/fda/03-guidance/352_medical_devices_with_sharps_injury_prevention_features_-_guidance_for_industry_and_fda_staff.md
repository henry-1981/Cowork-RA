Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Medical Devices with Sharps Injury
Prevention Features
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
list ed on the title page of this guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket
notification submissions for medical devices that incorporate a sharps injury prevention
feature (e.g., anti- needlestick feature). A sharps injury prevention feature is designed to
protect the user from a sharps injury. Most medical devices that include sharps injury
prevention features are either intravascular (IV) administration sets (21 CFR 880.5440),
piston syringes (21 CFR 880.5860), or hypodermic single lumen needles (21 CFR 880.5570).
This guidance pertains only to the sharps injury prevention feature. It does not provide
FDA’s recommendations for the device itself. Therefore, you should also consult FDA
guidance, if available, for the device, as in the examples below.

Piston Syringes http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/odegr821.html
Some sharps injury prevention features are incorporated as integrated components of finished
devices. Others are marketed separately as accessories that are attached to a device by the
user at the point of use, for example, a needle shield, marketed separate ly, which the user

1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
attache s to a piston syringe before use. This guidance applies to both integrated sharps injury
prevention features and accessories marketed separately.

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe should be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also
considered the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and
address the issues we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least
burdensome approach to resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If,
however, you believe that there is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you
should follow the procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least
Burdensome Issues” document. It is available on our Center’s Web page at https://
www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/UCM588914.pdf.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or sta tutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type should conform to
the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), including the
premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a
substantial eq uivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also
21 CFR 807.81 and 807.87 ).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content
requirements of a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR
807.87 and "How to Prepare a 510(k) Submission" on FDA Device Advice at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial
Equivalence in Premarket Notifications ,” http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html, a
manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or has the option of submitting either an
Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides the
least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device,
particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing that device.
Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen the
regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA may cons ider the
contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the meaning of 21
CFR 807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary report. The
report should describe how this guidance document was used during the device development
and testing and should briefly describe the methods or tests used. We recommend that you
also include a summary of the test data or description of the acceptance criteria applied to
address the risks identified in this document, as well as any additional risks specific to your
device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the requirements of 21 CFR
807.87, as well as some other items that we recommend you include in an Abbreviated
510(k).

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k)
and cite the title of this guidance document.

Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Refer to Section 11 for specific information that we recommend
you include in labeling.)

Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the performance specifications and, when
appropriate, include detailed, labeled drawings of the device. (Please refer to
Section 5. Device Description for specific information that we recommend you
include in the device description for devices of the types covered by this guidance
document.) You should also submit an "indications for use" enclosure. 1

1

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Description of device design
We recommend that you include a brief description of the device design
requirements.
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess the
risk profile, in general, as well as the specific device’s design and the results of this
analysis. (Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health for the risks to health
generally associated with the use of t his device that FDA has identified.)
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks
identified in this guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in
your risk ana lysis.
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have
used or intend to use to address each performance aspect identified in Sections 7-11
of this guidance document . If you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the
method rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may
cite the method but should provide sufficient information to explain the nature of
and reason for the modification. For each test, you may either (1) briefly present
the data resulting from the test in clear and concise form, such as a table, or (2)
describe the acceptance criteria that you will apply to your test results. 2 (See also
21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design Controls under the Quality System Regulation.)
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or
testing, you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance
criteria be fore the device is marketed, or

2

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the
subject device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being
introduced into interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the accep tance
criteria and , thus, differs from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends
that submitters apply the same criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed
devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to determine whether marketing of the finished device
requires clearance of a new 510(k).

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

declaration of conformity to the standard. 3

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe you
cannot properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the
testing the standard describes. For more information, please refer to section
514(c)(1)(B)of the Act and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial
Equivalence Determinations; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html.
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks identified
through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of the device’s
performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we need it to assess the
adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we may request any additional
information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence.)
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k) that
provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in this
guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods, data, acceptance criteria, and
conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices should
consider submitting Special 510(k)s.

4.

Scope

The scope of this document is limited to medical devices that contain a sharps injury
prevention feature. A medical device with a sharps injury prevention feature is a device
designed with a component or attachment, either active or passive, that protects the user from
a sharps injury.
This document does not address sharps containers or needle recapping devices. There is a
separate FDA guidance document for sharps containers and needle destruction devices
entitled Guidance on the Content and Format of Premarket Notification [510(k)]
Submissions for Sharps Containers , http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/895.pdf.

Device Design

Typically, devices with sharps injury prevention features are class II devices, subject to 21
CFR Part 820 Quality System Regulation, which include Design Controls. Design controls
(21 CFR 820.30) are an interrelated set of practices and procedures that are incorporated into
the design and development process, i.e., a system of checks and balances. Design controls
make systematic assessment of the design an integral part of a device’s development. As a
result, deficiencies in design input requirements, and discrepancies between the proposed
designs and requirements, may be discovered and corrected earlier in the development
process. We believe design controls increase the likelihood that the design transferred to
production will translate into a device that is appropriate for its intended use.
The design recommendations in Table 1 below are related to function and human factors
engineering and are intended to help you address user needs for a device or feature intended
to prevent sharps injuries.
Table 1. Design Recommendations for Sharps Injury Prevention Features
Type of Feature

Recommendation

All

The user should be able to easily tell whether the
sharps injury prevention feature is activated.

All

Once activated, t he sharps injury prevention feature
cannot be deactivated and should remain protective
through disposal.

Active (i.e., feature requires
activation by the user)

It should be possible to activate the feature with a
single- handed technique, allowing the user’s hands to
remain behind the exposed sharp.

Needle S hield

The shield should completely enclose the needle and
prevent finger access when activated.

Retractable S harp

The sharp should be fully retracted within the housing
of the device.

Fixed Recessed Needle

The housing should extend beyond, i.e., fully cover
the sharp and prevent finger access.

Colored Feature or Component

The use of color should achieve a specific purpose,
(e.g., differentiate device models or sizes) and
conform with user conventions, (e.g., orange hubs and
needle covers for insulin syringes).

Device Description

We recommend that you identify the device with a sharps injury prevention feature by
regulation and product code. We also recommend that you provide information to show how
the sharps injury prevention featur e is similar to and different from other legally marketed
devices by comparing:
•
•
•
•
•

indications for use
design features; e.g., materials, configurations, size
specifications and dimensions
materials, including chemical formulation
any relevant voluntary standards.

We recommend that you include a s ide-by-side comparison of the information described
below, whenever possible, in tabular format. We also recommend that you describe how any
differences may affect the comparative safety and performance of the sharps injury
prevention feature.

Material Composition
We recommend that you provide a complete listing of all device materials (trade name
and chemical formula) used in fabricating the s harps injury prevention feature, and
identify any metallic components. Me tallic components may affect the safety of the
device in an MRI environment. We also recommend that you identify any PVC
plasticizers, bonding agents, or other additives (e.g., color additives, ink, dyes, markings,
radiopaque materials) and provide their amounts.
It is helpful to present the information in the form of a listing, noting the component
name followed by specific material identifier. We believe generic class alone (e.g.,
polyvinylchloride [PVC]) is not adequate because there are many formulations of
material compositions.

Physical Specifications
When describing physical specifications, we recommend that you explain how the
specifications below compare to unprotected hypodermic needles or deactivated sharps
injury preventions features. We recommend that you indicate:

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•
•

dimensions such as inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), height, length, width,
thickness, gauge
diameter of housing (for fixed recessed needle safety devices)

•

cannula/needle tip configurations

•

priming volume

•
•

residual volume in injection access port or syringe
connector type: e.g., Luer lock, slip fit,

•

dimensions of other features

•

the color of all components

•

opacity of any components that could affect use (e.g., visualization of flashback or entry
of needle into skin)
markings and scales: color, type of scales, indicating whether they can be read under all
conditions of use (e.g., when a needle shield is retracted before use when filling a
syringe, inverted)
any other unique physical features and specifications of the device.

•

•

Mechanical Specifications
When providing mechanical specifications, we recommend that you indicate the :
• strength of materials (tensile, flexural, elongation, etc.)
•

strength of joints, bonds, connections, hinges, valves, locking mechanisms, etc.

•

rigid ity of safety shield or sheath

•

puncture/reseal limits of septa.

Design Features
We recommend that you describe any similarities or differences between the features of your
device and similar legally marketed device of the same type, which may affect safe ty and
effectiveness. For example, we recommend that you compare a new syringe with a safety shield
to a legally marketed syringe with a safety shield.

7.

Risks to Health

In the table below, FDA has identified the risks to health generally associated with t he use of sharps
injury prevention features addressed in this document. The information we recommend you include
in your 510(k) to address these identified risks are given in this guidance document, as shown in the
table below. We recommend that you cond uct a risk analysis (before submitting your 510(k)) to
identify any other risks specific to your device. The 510(k) should describe the risk analysis method
and include the risk analysis and its results. If you elect to use an alternative approach to address a

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
particular risk identified in this document or have identified risks additional to those in this
document, you should provide sufficient detail to support the approach you have used to address that
risk.

Bench Testing

We recommend that you conduct all testing under both a dry test condition and a wet environment
simulating body fluids or fluids being administered. We recommend that you evaluate your device
compared with a similar legally marketed device, using worst case simulated static and dynamic
forces to the failure point of the component. We also recommend that you describe how you
determined the worst case conditions used. We recommend your testing assess the :
•

force to attach and detach connections

•

fo rce to activate and deactivate the safety feature (s)

•

reaction force generated by the activation mechanism, if any (e.g., with a passive
spring loaded feature, or an elastic component)

•

number of activations to failure

•

puncture resistance of shie ld or sheath, i.e., the force to failure (puncture)

•

rate of fluid flow simulating extremes of pressure (e.g., the maximum force applied to
the piston or maximum flow through an access port)

•

accuracy of the dose administrated, if your device has atypical or unusual markings,
e.g., inverted syringe markings .

•

strength of joints, bonds, connections, hinges, valves, locking mechanisms, etc.

In addition to the above, we recommend you assess the tensile, flexural, and elongation
strength of the materials. We also recommend you state the specifications and tolerances
related to strength, pass/fail test ing criteria, and the basis for the specification and criteria.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Where appropriate to your device’s intended use or design, we also recommend that you
follow ISO 594, Conical Fittings with a 6% (Luer) Taper for Syringes, Needles, and Certain
Other Equipment or equivalent measures in addition to the testing already described.

9.

Microbial Ingress Tests

We recommend that you conduct microbial ingress testing of sharps injury prevention
features that are needleless (i.e., needle-free). 4 For guidance on microbial ingress testing, see
Guidance on Premarket Notifications for Intravascular Administration Sets,
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/ucm070850.pdf.

10. Simulated Clinical Use Testing
For devices that include sharps injury prevention features, we recommend that you conduct
simulated clinical use testing and provide an analysis of the results from simulated clinical
use testing and a summary of the results and conclusions. If your sharps injury prevention
feature is currently legally marketed as a part of another device, you may identify that device
in lieu of performing simulated clinical use testing.
Simulated use testing mimics actual clinical use by using patient substitutes (e.g.,
instructional models) rather than actual patients. Bench testing recommended in section 7
may also serve as part of simulated testing if done by health care professionals. The use of
fruit as an instructional model may mimic a subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) route
of administration, but is not feasible simulation of IV administration. S imulated use test ing
helps:
• isolate problems with the device
•

optimize the device design

•

identify deficiencies in labeling

•

evaluate the type of training needed for device users.

There are no standardized, validated methods to simulate clinical use of sharps injury
prevention features. We recommend that you devise a protocol specific for your device.
Whenever possible, p rotocols should be based on statistical considerations, such as sample
size, response variables, pass/fail criteria, comprehensive report forms/questionnaires, proper

4

Needleless Systems are those that allow repeated access to a patient’s vascular system
without the use of sharps. Fluid flow through the system may be uni or bi-directional, with
the latter enabling the user to administer or withdraw fluids or medication. Needleless
mechanisms generally include three types: pre-pierced septum and blunt cannula; valved
connector (also called reflux valve); and capped Luer connector.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
controls, and appropriate statistical test methods. The protocol should be comprehensive , in
other words it should:
•

state a clear objective

•

include a determination of sample size

•
•

explain how the number of evaluators was determined
explain how evaluators were selected

•

define terms and evaluation parameters used

•

explain how the data will be analyzed.

Study Design
The evaluators should include a variety of health care professionals who routinely use the
type of device you are testing. We believe a simulated clinical use study using
experienced health care professional volunteers generally helps avoid learning curve
artifacts. We recommend that the study also include observers who comment on the
evaluators’ adherence to protocol and their technique .
We recommend that you minimize b ias by selecting a s ufficient number of evaluators to
each use a large enough sample of devices (such as 1/8 of the total number per evaluator )
to allow them to gain familiarity with the device and t hus provide objective opinions.
The evaluators should have no conflicting financial interest in the device, but they may
be compensated for their time. Studies conducted at more than one test site will decrease
test bias.
The device should be tested under conditions that simulate the critical clinical variables
(e.g., models to simulate patients, gloved hands, dry and wet fingers, one - handed
technique).
You should make every effort to devise and execute the simulation properly. You should
include all data points in the analysis. A deficient protocol or incomplete data is unlikely
to provide sufficient information to support FDA’s evaluation. If your protocol is
deficient or your data incomplete, FDA may request additional simulated data.

Evaluator Training
We recommend that you instruct the evaluators on the study protoco l, to ensure
uniformity of technique, simulation of adherence to universal precautions, consistent
observations, scoring, and evaluations, and complete data collection.

Report Forms
The evaluators should record the results of testing on report forms (i.e., e valuator
questionnaires ). Examples of report forms are available at Training for Development of

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Innovative Technologies Project, http://www.tdict.org. There should be ample space for
narrative comments in your report forms. We recommend that report forms contain:
•

general introductory questions for tracking purposes, such as date, time periods,
study site, evaluator's name

•

characteristics and experience of the evaluator (e.g., left or right handed, size of
ha nd according to a defined scale, sex, age, number of similar devices
used/day, work environment)

•

numbers and types of devices used by the evaluator

•

graded ability of the user to perform the intended function of the device such as
injection, administe ring fluid

•

graded ability of the user to visualize important use factors, such as scales,
flashback

•

any required changes in usual technique, such as modifications of one -handed use

•

ability to maintain aseptic technique while extracting the device from packaging,
preparing, and using the device

•

ease of activation of the safety feature, and resistance to unintended activation

•

all adverse effects or problems encountered, whether it’s device or user related,
such as a sharps injury, multiple venipunctures required, safety feature failed to
remain activated, line disconnection

•

comparison of perceived or actual time required to use the safety device to the
control/legally marketed device and impact upon user acceptance

•

ability to detect activation of safety feature, and comments on associated
problems with detection that may be encountered during actual clinical use

•

opinion on extent of learning curve with use of device

•

a general assessment of the comparative acceptability of the device, including its
advantages and disadvantages

•

space for any other comments or noteworthy observations.

Failed Tests
We recommend that you report all data, including any failed tests. If a test includes a
failure, FDA recommends that you include a detailed explanation of t he failure and steps
taken to ensure that the failure has been corrected. If you redesign your device, FDA
recommends that you repeat the simulated clinical use study and report its results,
including any failed tests.

12

Sample Size Determination
A sample size can be based upon a confidence interval of an observed failure rate in a test
run of “N” devices. Failure is defined as a needlestick injury or significant problem with
the safety feature that may lead to an injury. The upper limit of the interval serves as the
worst case approximation for the “true” failure rate of the new device.
The following tables, generated using STAT EXACT TURBO® statistical software, list
the upper 95% and 99% confidence limits based on the binomial distribution for an
observed failure of 0, 1, 2, or 3 devices in a test sample of 100, 200, and 500 devices. 5

Because a confidence interval generally involves both the upper and lower limits, when
dealing only with one limit the actual confidence levels become 97.5% and 99.5% for
95% and 99%, respectively, because the 5% and 1% differences are split equally between
the two tails of the distribution curve.
Thus, for example, if there were no failures observed in a test run of 500 devices, we
would be 97.5% confident that the true failure rate was no higher than 0.7% and 99.5%
confident that it was no higher than 1.1%. If, on the other hand, there were two failures
among 200 devices tested, the true failure rate could be as high as 3.5% (95% upper
bound) or 4.5% (99% upper bound).

This model shows that smaller sample sizes increase the chance of accepting a device that
has a potentially higher injury rate, even if no failures were reported. However, we
recognize that sample sizes large enough to detect real differences in needlesticks rates
are generally not feasible. We recommend that simulated use testing of devices wit h
sharps injury prevention features include a sufficient number of devices to provide
confidence in the performance of the device. FDA believes that for many devices with
sharps safety features it is feasible to test 500 devices, which will enable detection of
grossly defective devices at a 1% level (see previous confidence tables).
With a sample size of 500, a successful study should report zero failures of the protection
feature. No test control device is needed for comparison of a sharps injury endpoint since
the endpoint is predetermined as a 0% rate of injury, based on the confidence intervals
described above.
FDA will consider alternative approaches to sample size determinations, when the
proposed alternative is supported by an adequate scientif ic rationale.

11. Sterilization
FDA recommends that you provide sterilization information in accordance with the Updated
510(k) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA.
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/ucm109897.pdf. The device should be sterile with a sterility assurance
level (SAL) of 1x10-6 using a sterilization cycle that has been validated in accordance with
the Quality Systems Requirements (QSR). 21 CFR 820.30.

12. Biocompatibility
We recommend that you conduct biocompatibility testing for your device as described in the
guidance, Use of International Standard ISO-10993, Biological Evaluation of Medical
Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/
deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm348890.pdf. We recommend that you
select tests that are appropriate for the duration and level of contact and submit your pass/fail
criteria. We also recommend that you document the results in your design history as part of
the QSR (21 CFR 820.30). If identical materials and identical material processing are used in
a predicate device with the same type and duration of contact, you may identify the predicate
device in lieu of performing biocompatibility t esting.

13. Labeling
Labeling should provide sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21CFR 807.87(e).
The following information will assist you in meeting the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 6

Intended Use
We recommend that the intended use cle ar ly identify the therapeutic, preventative, or
diagnostic use of the device and its use in the prevention of needlestick (sharps) injuries.
Labeling should prominently indicate that the device with the sharps injury prevention
feature is part of a system marketed by the submitter that is intended to be used with
other devices or accessories as a part of that system.

Directions for Use
We recommend that your directions for use include instructions for:
•

positioning the hands on the device at all times dur ing use for safe operation

•

aseptic technique, particularly when technique for using the device with the safety
feature differs from the techniques for commonly used devices without the safety
feature

•

deactivating the device after use

•

pre-decontamination procedures, such as pre-swabbing a septum

•

safely transport ing sharps

•

disposing of a used device

•

visualizing blood flashback.

We recommend that you include illustrations, pictures, posters, cards, and other visuals that may
clarify and reinforce the d irections for use.
We also recommend that your directions for use include instructions for determining with
certainty that any active safety feature is activated. For example, if the safety feature is a active

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply
with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 before a device is introduced into interstate
commerce. In addition, final labeling for prescription de vices must comply with 21 CFR
801.109. Labeling recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements of
part 801.

system, such as a stop mechanism, directio ns should instruct the user to listen for an audible
click to ensure the mechanism has been activated.

Precautions
We recommend that labeling include any special limitations related to hand size or
dexterity.

Warnings
We recommend that labeling warn that leakage of fluid may occur when disconnecting
co mponents.

Description of the Device
We recommend that the description includ e whether the device is :
• single use only, non-toxic, non-pyrogenic fluid path, where applicable
•

sterile, if package is intact, undamaged, and protective caps are secure.

Accessories
In addition to the information above, we recommend that labeling for an accessory:
•

identify the specific devices that are compatible with the accessory (e.g., trade
names and/or models of syringes, device specifications)

•

instructions for connect ing the sharps injury prevention accessory to the device

•

instructions for discard ing used device.
