This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides an assessment paradigm for radiofrequency (RF)-induced heating for
multi-configuration passive medical devices in the magnetic resonance (MR) environment,
including multi-component and single-component device types with various dimensions and
shape. Multi-component passive devices, such as orthopedic fixation devices, may result in a
very large number of possible device configurations and combinations of individual components.
Single-component devices, such as cardiovascular stents, are also frequently available in
multiple sizes or configurations. For these multi-configuration passive devices, it can be
challenging to leverage RF-induced heating testing from one device configuration or
combination to other device configurations or combinations because the geometry or
configuration of the device can affect heating in an unknown manner. As a result, the total
number of possible configurations or combinations that need to be assessed for RF-induced
heating of some passive devices can be very large.
This document provides an approach to reduce the number of possible device configurations or
combinations to a manageable number for the testing of RF-induced heating in the MR
environment. Additionally, this document provides guidance on how to assess RF-induced
device heating for multi-configuration passive medical devices. The information provided in this
guidance is intended to be used to support MR Conditional labeling claims in conjunction with

the information provided in FDA’s current guidance document for Establishing Safety and
Compatibility of Passive Implants in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM107708.pdf).

FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
This document provides guidance on a recommended method to select worst-case device
configurations or combinations to be tested for RF-induced heating in the MR environment.
Additionally, this document provides guidance on how to assess RF-induced device heating for
multi-configuration passive medical devices.
This guidance applies to multi-configuration passive devices consisting of multiple components,
as well as single-component devices, which can be used in multiple configurations. A passive
device is one that functions without the supply of electrical power. These devices may be
completely implanted (e.g., cardiovascular stents, spinal fixation devices), partially implanted in
the patient’s body (e.g., external fracture fixation devices), or used entirely externally (e.g.,
electroencephalographs). This document is applicable to all electrically conductive multiconfiguration passive medical devices intended to be used in the MR environment that include
MR Conditional labeling, regardless of their size, or number and configuration of components.
Active devices, or devices that require use of internal or external electrical power, are not within
the scope of this guidance. In addition, this guidance document does not establish a heating
acceptance criterion in general or for any specific medical device. Such a criterion will depend
on the intended use and the benefit-risk profile of the device. Rather, this guidance document
recommends a basis to assess the temperature rise induced by interaction between the device and
the electromagnetic fields in the MR environment.

III. Overview of Heating Assessment
The methodology below describes the recommended method to reduce a large number of
possible device configurations or combinations to a manageable number (i.e., test set) for the
assessment of RF-induced heating in the MR environment, and the recommended method to
conduct an assessment of RF-induced heating for the devices within the identified test set.

1.

Define and describe the MR Conditional scan conditions for the proposed
labeling, such as magnetic field strength, whole-body average Specific
Absorption Rate (SAR) levels, B1+rms levels, coil types, landmark position (i.e.,
position of the device relative to the MR bore), and scan area.

2.

Provide a scientific rationale based on benefit-risk considerations, using
information from previous human trials, animal data, and/or published literature
to establish the heating acceptance criterion (i.e., the maximum in vitro or in vivo
heating allowed for your medical device). This criterion should be defined as the
peak rise in temperature over a 15-minute period.

3.

Define and describe all possible device configurations and combinations (CCall)
using tables, lists, and/or drawings. The description should include device size,
geometry, surface properties, and design variations, in addition to all materials
used, their electrical properties (i.e., the electrical conductivity and the
permittivity at the frequency of interest) and thermal properties (i.e., thermal
conductivity and specific heat capacity). While it is not necessary to describe
each individual configuration/combination, the limits in dimensions, geometry,
and the different types of configurations/combinations should be clearly
identified, preferably in a tabular or matrix format.

4.

Use a scientific rationale or a scientific method, such as those described in section
IV below, to reduce CCall to a subset of potential worst-case device configurations
and combinations (CCtest) for heating assessments. The scientific method used to
reduce CCall to CCtest should include a detailed description of the algorithm and
parameters used. The scientific rationale should note any clinically relevant
information and known worst-case factors for RF-induced heating. Additionally,
the rationale should include a consideration of the risk and the potential harm to
the patient.
Factors influencing RF-induced heating include, but are not limited to, the
following:
a. Device Dimensions and Resonant Effects: The half-wavelength of the
electromagnetic field inside a patient for 1.5T systems is about 25 cm, and for
3.0T systems about 12 cm. For implants with dimensions on the order of a
half-wavelength to a wavelength (i.e., 25 to 50 cm or 12 to 24 cm), resonant
effects between the device and electromagnetic field can lead to significantly
high heating (i.e., more than twice the background heating).1 RF-induced
heating can change significantly if the device dimensions change by about

Imaging, vol. 26, pp. 450–451.

one-tenth of a wavelength.2 Therefore, device heating for dimension
increments of about one-tenth of the wavelength should be assessed (i.e.,
approximately 5 cm for 1.5T and 2.4 cm for 3.0T).
b. Device Geometry: The RF-induced heating can depend on the: 1) shape of the
device, 2) cross-section of the device, and 3) position of the device relative to
the RF transmit coil.
c. Device Components (e.g., screws): All possible component configurations
should be considered. Because a worst-case screw configuration cannot be
determined by length alone, all screw lengths and screws in all possible
openings/holes of the device, and all possible directions should be considered
(e.g., in increments of 15 degrees with a scientific justification for the subset
of screw directions examined).
d. Device Configuration: Sub-components in electrical contact with each other
can significantly change the RF-induced heating. Therefore, devices should
typically be studied as the entire construct rather than individual subcomponents. However, if sub-components are not electrically connected and
you can demonstrate that the heating of the individual sub-components is
independent of each other, then the individual sub-components can be
assessed independently.
e. Surface Properties: Devices with smoother surfaces typically heat less, while
devices with sharp edges tend to heat more.
f. Device Construction: Devices constructed of a continuous conductive material
(e.g., bare metal stents) may exhibit different heating properties than devices
constructed of multiple individual components connected through nonconductive materials (e.g., endovascular stent grafts).
5.

The minimum number of configurations/combinations within CCtest depends on
the number of CCall, the proposed scan conditions, the device size and geometry,
and the electrical and thermal properties of the device materials used.

6.

Once an appropriately justified CCtest has been defined, you should perform an
assessment to identify which device configuration/combination within CCtest is
worst-case for each MR environment (i.e., scan condition) in which your device is
intended to be used. This assessment can be done by:
a. in vitro temperature measurements according to ASTM F2182,3

b. computer modeling to determine temperature,
c. computer modeling to determine local SAR, or
d. a combination of a, b, and/or c.
Note that all results using computer modeling should be validated against
measurements using standardized methods, e.g., ASTM F2182, and include a
detailed uncertainty analysis.4
Using one of the above methods, the location of the maximum heating on the
device surface should be determined for all devices in CCtest. The heating at this
location for a specified local SAR should then be determined experimentally or
computationally. The local SAR should be determined before performing the
heating tests.
With the exception of simple elongated structures (e.g., stents), where the location
of the maximum heating is usually at the end of the structure, the location of the
maximum heating on the device surface should be estimated with an experimental
or computational method. Also, if the geometry of your device is highly irregular
and has geometrical features oriented in more than one direction, testing of all
devices in CCtest in all three exposure orientations (i.e., alignment of the three
major axes of the device relative to the tangential induced electric field) should be
performed. If the device is located outside of the patient, you should determine
the heating for a specified electric field in air. If the device is partially outside
and partially inside of the patient, you should determine the heating of the device
in a clinically relevant position partially outside and partially inside of a test
phantom for both a specified local SAR, and for a specified electric field in air.
For all testing, you should report the computationally or experimentally assessed
heating for the worst-case configuration as the peak rise in temperature for a 15minute RF exposure; you should also report the local SAR (e.g., 10 W/kg) and/or
the local electric field (e.g., 100 V/m) at which the device was tested. You should
also report the location on the device surface where the worst-case heating was
assessed. Shorter evaluation times (e.g., 2 minutes) are possible to assess the
relative heating between individual configurations/combinations and to assess the
location of the maximum heating on the device surface of an individual
configuration/combination. However, the heating for the worst-case
configuration/combination should be reported as the peak rise in temperature for a
15-minute RF exposure.
The scope of ASTM F2182 is limited to devices entirely implanted inside the
body. However, for medical devices with other implantation conditions (e.g.,

external fixation devices, catheters), RF-induced heating can be evaluated
experimentally and/or computationally using a method similar to that described in
ASTM F2182, with modifications for the specific medical device and the context
of use. ASTM F2182 should not be used to assess the worst-case MR-induced
RF-induced heating for medical devices used in multi-channel transmit RF coils.
7.

Provide an estimate of the accuracy of the results (i.e., an uncertainty analysis for
all measured or computed results).5 In addition, validation data for all
computational models should be provided.

8.

If the observed worst-case in vitro heating exceeds your specified heating
acceptance criterion, i.e., the peak rise in temperature over a 15-minute period,
you may estimate the expected worst-case in vivo heating to demonstrate the
safety of your device in the MR environment. Because in vitro testing outlined in
ASTM F2182 does not consider the actual in situ electric fields, in vitro heating
results may be substantially higher than the actual in vivo heating. The estimated
in vivo assessment should consider the patient population for which your device is
indicated and should include the worst-case scan conditions. Alternately, you
may elect to define additional constraints for your MR Conditional labeling.

For complex multi-component devices we recommend that you submit a pre-submission to
obtain feedback on your plan for identifying and assessing CCtest and your plan for conducting in
vitro RF-induced heating measurements before conducting the assessments. Please refer to
FDA’s Guidance Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission
Program and Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen
ts/ucm311176.pdf).

IV. Recommended Methods to Reduce the Number of
Configurations and Combinations for Testing
The number of possible device configurations can become very large for RF-induced heating
testing if multiple parameters vary between configurations or if each parameter has a range of
options. For example, if a device is defined by three parameters (e.g., length, width, and
thickness), and each of these parameters has 100 different options there will be 1003 = 1,000,000
possible combinations for CCall. Because many combinations or configurations within CCall will
be very similar to neighboring combinations or configurations, statistical or stochastic sampling
of the same parameter set and eliminating certain parameters based on a scientific rationale can
significantly reduce the number of devices to be tested to a smaller subset (CCtest), while still
providing an accurate representation of CCall.
To reduce CCall to CCtest, first perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of each
parameter on RF-induced heating. One simple type of sensitivity analysis is the minimum5

maximum differentiability. Using this method, the sensitivity of RF-induced heating to each
parameter can be assessed by testing its maximum and minimum value, while other parameters
are set at their mean values. Once the critical parameters are determined, a selection method
such as, but not limited to, those outlined below, or a combination thereof, should be used to
identify device configurations and combinations for heating assessments:
1.

Constant Value Justification: If many parameters are varied between design
configurations, it is possible that some parameters have little or no influence on
RF-induced heating (i.e., less than 5%) and may justifiably be set at a constant
value to reduce CCall. The maximum-minimum approach outlined above may be
an appropriate sensitivity analysis to support this justification.

2.

Sampling Methods: CCall can often be reduced substantially, while providing a
comprehensive response evaluation, by using a non-deterministic, pseudo-random
sampling technique such as a Monte-Carlo analysis (e.g., Haldar and Mahadevan,
20006). A Monte-Carlo analysis generally consists of the following components:
a. Creating a deterministic model which can reliably reach a solution for the
range of random distribution of device parameters in the problem.
b. Defining the appropriate probabilistic characteristics of each random
parameter. These could take the form of distribution parameters (e.g., the
mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution), or as a set of
cumulative distribution percentiles (without a named distribution). For the
purpose of identifying worst-case configurations/combinations for RFinduced heating tests, a uniform distribution may provide an effective
parameter sweep. For a design parameter with a specific set of nominal
values (e.g., length = 10, 15 or 20 mm) a discrete random variable, with equal
likelihood for each nominal value, may be most effective.
c. Generating samples of these random parameters for testing (to identify
devices for CCtest). Several sampling methods are commonly used: a) random
sampling, b) Latin hypercube sampling, and c) importance sampling (Helton
et al., 20067).
In random sampling, the input parameters are sampled according to their
probability density functions, with each sample independent of the others.
This approach offers the advantage of conceptual simplicity and the ability to
easily add new samples if sufficient accuracy has not been achieved (see item
‘f’ below).

Analysis. Reliability, Engineering and System Safety, vol. 91, pp. 1175-1209.

The Latin hypercube method may increase sampling efficiency relative to
random sampling. In this method, the number of samples (N) are selected at
the outset. Each parameter is stratified into N, i.e., the number of samples,
equally likely intervals, each of which is randomly sampled only once (Helton
et al., 20068). The relative efficiency of this method arises from the
stratification that prevents overlapping samples and guarantees more complete
parameter space filling than random sampling.
Importance sampling concentrates sampling near parameter values that are
most likely to induce higher levels of RF-induced heating. This method can
be used to focus tests towards those combinations of parameters to which RFinduced heating is most sensitive. The disadvantage of this approach is that it
requires distortion of the sampling distributions, which should be justified and
corrected for, when evaluating the system results.
In generating samples, it is first necessary to estimate the number of samples
needed to achieve the required accuracy. An estimate can be calculated from
N = 4 / ε2
where N is the estimated number of samples and ε is the uncertainty of the
mean RF-induced heating; e.g., <10% (Haldar and Mahadevan, 20009).
d. Solving the deterministic model for all samples.
e. Combining the individual model solutions into probabilistic system
information. In the present application, the maximum expected level of RFinduced heating is quantified. In practice, the maximum heating identified
from all tests will depend on the number of tests, such that a higher maximum
will be likely when more samples are taken. Therefore we recommend
reporting a consistent percentile of RF-induced heating, such as the 95th or
99th percentile; other percentile values are possible. You should choose the
percentile base on the risk associated with RF-induced heating of your
particular device.
f. Evaluating the accuracy of the simulation study and the necessity of additional
analyses. As noted in item ‘e’ above, the observed RF-induced heating results
will depend upon the number of samples, with uncertainty remaining about
intermediate, un-sampled, cases. Therefore, we recommend that you evaluate
the degree of convergence of the RF-induced heating results to ensure the
conclusions are not dependent upon the specific sample used.

In random sampling, each sample point is independent of the others and
additional random points can be added until a stopping criterion is converged
upon. A recommended stopping criterion could be when the standard
deviation of the mean RF-induced heating (taken from bootstrapped datasets
of e.g., 20 to 50 sub-samples converges within a pre-defined uncertainty of the
mean RF-induced heating (e.g., <10%). Note that this criterion can be applied
to evaluate a completed Latin hypercube analysis; however, a post-hoc
addition of sample points will disturb the original scheme and result in a nonLatin hypercube sample and hence slower convergence to the stopping
criterion than might be anticipated.
An alternative approach, often used with Latin hypercube sampling, is to run
multiple, equally-sized, sample sets (e.g., two or three sets of 100 samples).
Once the analyses are completed, the results of the samples can be compared
(e.g., T-test) to confirm that the mean RF-induced heating from the different
samples is statistically equivalent. Once this is confirmed, the data from the
different samples can be combined into one dataset (Helton et al., 2006 10).

V.

Hypothetical Example

A fracture fixation system contains 10 plates of the same thickness, but different lengths (50mm
to 250mm in 5mm increments) and two widths (8mm and 12mm). The plate can be used with 5
to 20 screws. There is only one compatible screw diameter, but a continuously variable screw
length (15-25mm), and the screws can be angled in any direction up to 30 degrees.
First, a sensitivity analysis of parameters reveals that RF-induced heating does not change
significantly (less than 5%) with the plate width, with the direction angle of the screws, or with
various contouring (plate bending to fit the fracture) of the plate. Therefore the plate width is
kept constant at 12mm (which showed slightly higher heating than the 8mm width), the screw
direction angle is kept constant at 0 degrees, and the plate is kept unbent.
Next, the number of samples is estimated to give approximately 10% uncertainty in the mean
RF-induced heating. Using the equation in Section IV, 2.c. above (i.e., N = 4/ε2 = 4/0.12), 400
random models (CCtest) of the fracture fixation system are created for different combinations of
plate length, screw number, and screw length. Plate length is defined as a discrete random
variable with equally likely possible values at intervals of 5mm from 50-250mm. Screw number
is defined as a discrete random variable with equally likely possible values at intervals of 1 from
5-20 screws. Screw length is defined as a uniform distribution with minimum and maximum
values of 15mm and 25mm, respectively. A random sampling method is used for each parameter
to generate the 400 models to be solved.

After all 400 models are solved, the stopping criterion is evaluated to confirm that the calculated
mean RF-induced heating does not vary by more than 10% regardless of the addition of more
samples. This is done in five steps:
1.

The mean RF-induced heating of the 400 results is calculated (e.g., 3.5°C);

2.

the 400 heating results are randomly resampled into sub-samples (e.g., 25 subsamples), each containing 16 results;

3.

the mean of each sub-sample is calculated as 25 different values;

4.

the standard deviation of the 25 sub-sample means is calculated (e.g., 0.31°C);
and

5.

the standard deviation from the mean of all 25 sub-samples is less than 10% of the
mean RF-induced heating of the 400 results (i.e., 0.31°C < 10% of 3.5°C),
indicating that the stopping rule has been satisfied.

The device configurations/combinations that result in the highest heating are identified from all
400 models tested. The highest device heating is calculated as the 99th percentile of the
distribution of RF-induced heating observed in all 400 tested models.
