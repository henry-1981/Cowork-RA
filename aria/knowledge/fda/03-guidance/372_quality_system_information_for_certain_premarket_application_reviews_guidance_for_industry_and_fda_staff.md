Quality System Information
for Certain Premarket Application
Reviews
Scope: Use this guidance for PMA; PMA Supplement;
PDP; HDE; and Modular Review Submissions.

This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public. An
alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statute and regulations.

Introduction
Medical device premarket applications submitted under section 515(c)(1)(C) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 360(e)(c)(1)(C)], are required to include
a number of information components, as set forth in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)
Sec. 814.20. One component covers the current good manufacturing practice requirements
included in the Quality System (QS) regulation. A Premarket Approval Application (PMA)
is required to include a complete description of the methods, facilities, and controls, in
sufficient detail so that FDA can make a knowledgeable assessment of the quality control
used in producing the medical device (21 U.S.C. 515(c)(1)(C)).
This guidance has been prepared by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH), in coordination with the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), to
assist medical device manufacturers in preparing and maintaining the QS information
required in premarket submissions1.
This guidance replaces “Guidance for Preparation of PMA Manufacturing Information,”
found in FDA 91-4245 and FDA 92-4165. This updated guidance includes information that
is consistent with the QS regulation that became final on October 7, 1996. ("Medical
1

PMA amendments or supplements should include design and/or manufacturing information that differs from
what has already been submitted in the original PMA or in a prior amendment or supplement for the device.

Devices; Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Final Rule; Quality System
Regulation" (61 FR 52602--52662) 2.
CDRH's Office of Compliance (OC) will review the QS information submitted in your
premarket submission at the same time the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) reviews the
other portions of your application. The appropriate Offices in CBER will review the QS
information submitted in CBER regulated premarket submissions. This QS information
guidance is meant to help applicants in providing the necessary information in a clear format
for efficient review and timely decisions.
This guidance document requests that you provide copies of written procedures or lists of
items related to the QS regulation. In most cases, these procedures or lists are explicitly
required under provisions of the QS regulation. In the case where the information is not
explicitly required under statute or regulation (e.g., production flow diagram, list of any
standards used, process validation master plan), we believe the information is the type you
are likely to create and maintain as part of your Quality System. Your submission of such
information as part of the application process may reduce or eliminate the need for us to
request additional information to determine your compliance with the QS regulation under 21
CFR 820. In addition, we believe your submission of this information can help us focus the
preapproval inspection process and limit the amount of time our field staff will need to spend
in your facility.
A manufacturer who chooses to meet application requirements for the QS information in an
alternative way may wish to consult with the appropriate office within the Center prior to the
submission. The FDA staff can help identify areas that might raise particular concerns for
Center reviewers or investigators.
Note: During a pre-approval inspection, FDA may assess any of the requirements of the
Quality System regulation, not just the ones referenced below.

The Least Burdensome Approach
In developing the guidance, we carefully considered the relevant statutory criteria for
Agency decision-making. We also considered the burden that may be incurred in your
attempt to comply with the guidance and address the issues we have identified. We believe
that we have considered the least burdensome approach to resolving the issues presented in
the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there is a less burdensome way to
address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach
to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is available on CDRH's web page at:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
A. General Information
2

The Quality System regulation (Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 820) text and preamble is located at
www.fda.gov/cdrh/humfac/frqsr.html.
2

1. Format

The "Cover Letter" and the general information described below in
"What to Send" may be submitted only once if all the QS information
is submitted at the same time. If the design control information and
the manufacturing information are submitted separately, as allowed in
programs such as the PMA modular review process and the Product
Development Protocol (PDP) process, this general information should
be submitted with both submissions. This will allow the reviewers
ready access to this basic information with each submission under
review and avoid possible delays in trying to reference this
information for each submission.
If you are participating in a modular review, FDA suggests, for
simplicity, that the design control information and manufacturing
information be submitted in module(s) that are separate from other
information. (This may be one or two modules). Any manufacturing
process information needed by FDA for ODE’s safety and
effectiveness review should be submitted in those modules to be
reviewed by ODE.
Each copy of a premarket submission should include a separate
volume or volumes that cover QS information. The volume(s) should
have numbered pages, to facilitate our review and any discussions with
you.
When multiple facilities are involved in the design, assembly, or
processing of the device, you should submit applicable QS information
for each facility in separate volumes that clearly identify the facility to
which it applies.

2. Cover Letter

With each submission of QS information, you should include a cover
letter that has the following information to help FDA manage your
premarket application and related documents more efficiently:


Identification elements:
- Full name and street address (no P.O. Box number),
- Telephone number (with area code),
- FDA Facility Establishment Identifier (FEI) or registration
number,
- Relationship of (each) manufacturing facility to applicant.



Contact person (and alternates) and their telephone number(s).



The date the facility site(s) will be ready for inspection.

3

The location and affiliation information will help CDRH/CBER
determine the appropriate facilities to be inspected under the
preapproval process.
3. What to Send

The initial volume for each facility should include the following
information:


A copy of your cover letter, as described above in item 2;



A description of the device, including pictures, and where possible,
the proprietary name, common name, model number(s), product
code, and intended use;



A description of how the device works; and,



The documentation described in subpart B of this guidance
document.

Note: If you are resubmitting information, you should verify that the
information does not include any changes that would require a PMA
amendment. (See 21 CFR §814.37.)

4

B. Content
You can facilitate our review by formatting your submission in the order presented below.
Provide the most up to date information as it applies to the device under review and to each
facility identified in the application. Address all items for each original application. Address
all pertinent items for each supplement.

This is not an exhaustive list of commonly considered design inputs. Your
firm's quality assurance, clinical, and engineering experts should also consider
emerging risks that may not have been fully addressed.
Potential risks, even at the early stages of device development, should be
identified. Managing risks as the device design evolves is important because
changes in design can create new risks.

Individual(s) performing the validation

If validation activities were performed on devices that were not
made using production methods or equipment that you expect to
use during full scale manufacturing, summarize the process or
8

scientific method you used to prove equivalence. We need to
evaluate the equivalence of the manufacturing or devices used to
validate the design to ensure the validation data can be applied to
devices that you plan to make under normal production methods.


You should summarize how the clinical evaluations of the device
ensure the device meets user needs and the intended uses.



If the device is automated with computer software, you should
explain how you have (or will) complete your software validation,
and include any system integration testing.



As stated earlier in the design and development planning section,
risk management issues will be addressed throughout the design
control process. You should describe how and when risk analysis
was or will be performed. Your design validation procedure(s)
should describe how you will document, use, and update your risk
management program. For additional guidance on risk analysis
and risk management activities, see the QS regulation preamble
comment #83. [61 FR 52620-52621; see footnote 2.]

Design Transfer, 820.30(h)
8.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) used to transfer the design output to
manufacturing for the device under review.

Your procedure(s) should describe when you use verification for
certain design changes instead of using validation. You should

9

clearly define and document the reason for choosing verification
rather than validation of a design change.


Your procedure(s) should explain how you ensure that changes are
validated or verified, reviewed, and approved before the design
change is implemented.



Your procedure(s) should describe how changes in the
manufacturing process will be managed.

Design History File, 820.30(j)
10.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) for maintaining the contents of the
Design History File (DHF) for the device under review.
If more than one device shares a common design history file, explain how you
identify each device within the group having common design elements.

II. Manufacturing Information __________________________
Quality System Procedures, 820.20(e)
1.

You should provide a copy of your basic quality system procedure(s).


Your basic quality system procedure(s) should include:
¾ Quality audit or internal audit procedure(s)
¾ Management review procedure(s)
¾ Outline of the structure of the quality system documentation

The development of a quality manual that includes the referenced elements
below would satisfy the requirement in 820.20(e) for an outline of the
documentation used in the quality system:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Title and scope of application
Table of contents
Definitions (if needed)
Outline of the structure of the quality manual or quality system
documentation

3.

You should provide a list of any standard(s) used in the manufacturing process or for
the device itself.

Purchasing Controls, 820.50
4.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) for purchasing controls. This is
especially important if you use a contract design service or contract manufacturer(s)
for the device under review. The controls applicable to these suppliers should be
specified.


Your procedure(s) should describe your supplier evaluation
process and describe how you will determine type of and extent of
control you will exercise over suppliers.



Your procedure(s) should define how you maintain records of
acceptable suppliers and how you address the purchasing data
approval process.



Your procedure(s) should explain how you will balance purchasing
assessment and receiving acceptance to ensure that products and
services are acceptable for their intended use.

For additional guidance on the relationship between purchasing controls and
receiving acceptance activities, see the QS regulation preamble comment #99.
[61 FR 52624; see footnote 2.]
Production and Process Controls, 820.70
5.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) for environmental and contamination
controls, if such conditions could adversely affect your device. (Note: if this involves
a large number of procedures, a sample of the most relevant procedures would be
sufficient.)

Inspection, Measuring, and Test Equipment, 820.72
6.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) that explain how inspection,
measuring, and test equipment is routinely calibrated, inspected, checked, and
11

maintained. (Note: if this involves a large number of procedures, a sample of the
most relevant procedures would be sufficient.)
Process Validation, 820.75
7.

You should provide a copy of your process validation master plan, or a description of
which manufacturing processes you will validate, for the device under review.
Provide a list of processes for the device under review that you do not plan to validate
but will verify by inspection and test.


Your process validation master plan or your description should
also include any validations of software used as part of the
production or quality system. (See 820.70(i))



It would also be very helpful to identify in your process validation
master plan or description which type of processes you have never
validated before. (For example, a different type of sterilization
process.) This would allow us to work with you on validation
issues as early as possible before the preapproval inspection.

The QS regulation requires you to validate processes whenever the results of a
process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test methods. If
you choose to validate a process that can be fully verified by subsequent
inspection and test, these processes are also subject to the validation
requirements of 21 CFR § 820.75. For additional guidance, see the Global
Harmonization Task Force's Process Validation Guidance
http://www.ghtf.org/sg3/inventorysg3/sg3-n99-10.doc. (Note the QS
regulation does not permit option E in Figure 1 of the Global Harmonization
Task Force's Process Validation Guidance.)

Process Validation, 820.75(a)
8.

You should provide a copy of the validation procedure(s) or individual validation
plan(s) for each process that will be validated for the device under review. When
available, you should provide a copy of any completed validation reports.

objective and measurable acceptance criteria.



Your validation procedure(s) or plan(s) should describe how
appropriate statistical methods for data collection and analysis are
used.

12



Your validation procedure(s) or plan(s) should define the criteria
for re-validation.

Your validation plan and procedures(s) should be in place at the time of
submission of the manufacturing information. Process validations do not have
to be completed at the time of submission. However, process validations must
be completed prior to the preapproval inspection and prior to distribution of
any finished devices. [820.75(a)].
Receiving Acceptance Activities, 820.80(b)
9.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) for receiving or incoming acceptance
activities. (Note: if this involves a large number of procedures, a sample of the most
relevant procedures would be sufficient.)


Your procedure(s) should address the extent of acceptance
activities, based in part on the degree to which the supplier has
demonstrated a capability to provide products and services that
meet your specifications. You make this determination based on a
combination of assessment techniques, such as your inspection and
tests, supplier audits, a vendor's quality history with you, and the
risk of the product or service as identified in your risk management
program.

For additional guidance on the relationship between receiving acceptance
activities and other assessment techniques, see the QS regulation preamble
comment #106. [61 FR 52625; see footnote 2.]


Your procedure(s) should define the acceptance/rejection criteria.



Your procedure(s) should outline the disposition of rejected or
nonconforming products, and include how and when
nonconforming product are reworked, accepted, regraded,
scrapped, or returned.

Your procedure(s) should ensure documentation of acceptance
activities, including:
¾
¾
¾
¾

Activity performed, e.g., chemical purity analysis
Dates the acceptance activities were performed
Results
Signature of the individual(s) conducting the acceptance
activities
¾ Equipment used, where appropriate

preamble comment #147. [61 FR 52631; see footnote 2.]
Final Acceptance Activities, 820.80(d)
10.

You should provide a copy of the procedure(s) for final acceptance activities. (Note:
if this involves a large number of procedures, a sample of the most relevant
procedures would be sufficient.)


Your procedure(s) should identify the specific release criteria. For
example, sterilization release criteria could be based on biological
indicator results, validated parametric release protocols, or other
valid scientific methods.



Your procedure(s) should describe the quarantine or other controls
used for finished devices until it is determined that all acceptance
criteria are met and recorded properly.



Your procedure(s) should ensure that finished devices are not
released for distribution until:
¾ Device Master Record requirements for release are met

comment #159. [61 FR 52633-52634; see footnote 2.]


Your procedure(s) should define how your CAPA system will
address nonconforming practices as well as nonconforming
product.

For additional discussion on this topic, see the QS regulation preamble
comment #162. [61 FR 52634; see footnote 2.]


Your procedure(s) should address the analysis of the multiple data
inputs from your quality system. Your procedure(s) should make
it clear what will be included in this analysis as well as the
