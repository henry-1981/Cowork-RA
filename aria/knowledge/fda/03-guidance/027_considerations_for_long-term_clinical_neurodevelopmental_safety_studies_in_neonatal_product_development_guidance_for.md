This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on 
6 
this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public.  You 
7 
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.

I. 
INTRODUCTION  
15 
 
16 
The purpose of this guidance is to provide a framework for considering whether and what type of 
17 
long-term neurologic, sensory and developmental evaluations could be useful to support a 
18 
determination of safety of a “medical product” (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) for use 
19 
in neonates2, and if so, which domains of neurodevelopment may be most applicable. 
20 
 
21 
This guidance will not specifically address effectiveness, safety or benefit/risk assessments for 
22 
products primarily intended to improve neurologic outcomes, e.g., neuroprotective agents. This 
23 
guidance is focused on long-term evaluations of neurodevelopmental safety. Although 
24 
assessments of specific toxicities to other tissues and organs may also be warranted in neonatal 
25 
medical product development, the approach to those assessments is outside the scope of this 
26 
guidance. 
27 
 
28 
Pertinent information on planning clinical pharmacology studies in neonates3 and pediatric 
29 
patients4 can be found in existing guidance documents.5  This guidance does not focus on 
30 
nonclinical safety studies to support clinical studies in neonates, nor does it address clinical study 
 
1  This guidance has been prepared by the Food and Drug Administration: Office of Pediatric Therapeutics in the 
Office of the Commissioner; the Division of Pediatric and Maternal Health, the Division of Antivirals, the Office of 
Surveillance and Epidemiology, and the Office of Neuroscience in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; the 
Office of Vaccines Research and Review in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review; and the Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health.  
2  The neonatal period is defined in the Addendum to ICH E11: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the 
Pediatric Population E11 (R1) (2017) as including term, post-term, and preterm newborn infants. The neonatal 
period for term and post-term infants is the day of birth plus 27 days. For preterm infants, the neonatal period is 
defined as the day of birth through the expected age of delivery plus 27 days. These same definitions will apply for 
purposes of this guidance.

Drugs, Including Biological Products; September 2022. When finalized, this guidance will r epresent t he Agency’s 
current thinking.

design in neonatology. This guidance also does not address neonatal or pediatric safety 
32 
assessments following studies conducted during pregnancy,6 nor gene therapies or similar 
33 
genomic medicine interventions.7 
34 
35 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. 
36 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
37 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of 
38 
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but 
39 
not required.

II. 
BACKGROUND 
43 
44 
In 2012, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity 
45 
Act (PREA) were made permanent under Title V of the Food and Drug Administration Safety 
46 
and Innovation Act (FDASIA).8 FDASIA contained several provisions to encourage medical 
47 
product development in neonates. 
48 
49 
Treatment with medical products during the neonatal period coincides with a time of critical 
50 
growth and physiologic development. Short-term safety evaluations typical for adults or other 
51 
populations may fail to identify important adverse effects in the neonatal population, as latent 
52 
effects may follow early-life exposures. Historically, most medical products used to treat 
53 
neonates and young infants were not approved for use in this population for the relevant 
54 
indications, and thus, long-term effects were rarely systematically evaluated. 
55 
56 
Clinical investigators and sponsors9 of neonatal studies should consider and assess potential 
57 
short-term and long-term effects of an investigational therapy, whether the therapy is novel or 
58 
previously developed for a different indication or population. Short-term clinical improvement, 
59 
such as that observed after high-dose corticosteroids for infants with bronchopulmonary 
60 
dysplasia, may be followed by unexpected long-term harm.10 While adjunctive neurological 
61 
assessments (e.g., neuroimaging, electroencephalography) may provide information on early 
62 
safety concerns, they cannot replace clinical assessments of long-term functional outcomes. 
63 
64 
Although there is no universal definition of “long-term,” for the purpose of this guidance, the 
65 
time frame can be generally thought of as at least 2 years of age or at such time when relevant 
66 
clinical neurodevelopmental parameters can be reasonably assessed (refer to sections IIIB2a and 
6 For additional information, see the FDA Draft Guidance for Industry, Pregnant Women: Scientific and Ethical 
Considerations for Inclusion in Clinical Studies; April 2018. When finalized, this guidance will represent the 
Agency’s current thinking.

IIIC1); the minimum duration of follow-up will depend on different population- and product-
68 
specific factors as discussed in this guidance. Prospectively designed long-term follow-up is 
69 
often important to understand medical product safety in neonates. 
70 
 
71 
Neonates should have access to medical products adequately evaluated for safety, effectiveness, 
72 
and, when appropriate, dosing for that population. There are conditions unique to term or 
73 
preterm neonates, such as necrotizing enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity, that will not 
74 
have analogous development programs in older populations. As new medical products are 
75 
developed for these and other unique neonatal conditions, novel development programs and first-
76 
in-human studies may be initiated in neonates, and these development programs should also 
77 
demonstrate long-term neurologic, sensory, and developmental safety. Neonates should also be 
78 
enrolled in clinical studies for medical products and diagnostic tools initially developed for 
79 
indications in other populations that will be used for neonates. Inclusion of neonates in such 
80 
studies may be useful to establish dosing, safety, and efficacy or effectiveness, and these studies 
81 
may also warrant long-term safety evaluations. 
82 
 
83 
III. 
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL FOLLOW-UP FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
84 
PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NEONATES 
85 
 
86 
Long-term neurodevelopmental safety should be considered as part of neonatal product 
87 
development plans. Sponsors should communicate as early as possible with the relevant FDA 
88 
review division to reach alignment on an appropriate approach for long-term safety evaluations. 
89 
 
90 
A. Determining the Need for Long-term Neurodevelopmental Safety Evaluations 
91 
Sponsors should assess whether a long-term neurodevelopmental safety evaluation 
92 
for neonates enrolled in clinical studies should be conducted. This assessment should 
93 
be initiated early in product development and should be reevaluated as new 
94 
information becomes available. 
95 
 
96 
1. General Considerations 
97 
a. Central Nervous System (CNS) Exposure: Any route of administration may 
98 
result in a systemic exposure. The degree of systemic exposure, which should 
99 
be quantified in early pharmacokinetic or animal studies if possible, may 
100 
inform the need for long-term safety assessment. In general, higher levels of 
101 
systemic exposure may be associated with higher CNS exposure and potential 
102 
risk for long-term sequelae. The degree of CNS exposure may vary 
103 
independently of systemic exposure. 
104 
b. Timing of Exposure: The timing of exposure to a drug, biological product, or 
105 
device relative to a particularly vulnerable stage of organ and tissue 
106 
development may inform the need for and the type of long-term safety 
107 
assessment. 
108 
c. Duration of Exposure: Repeated dosing, prolonged exposure and medical 
109 
products with persistent effects may be associated with higher risk for long-
110 
term sequelae; however, long-term safety assessments may also be required 
3 


 
 
 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
111 
after single doses or short durations of investigational therapies, based on the 
112 
other considerations described in this guidance. 
113 
 
114 
2. Patient and Population-specific Considerations 
115 
a. Neurodevelopmental vulnerability: While neuroplasticity and resilience may 
116 
impact tolerance to toxicity, the anticipated rates of developmental, 
117 
behavioral, and sensory impairments are generally inversely related to 
118 
gestational age and birth weight and differ significantly across various 
119 
congenital or acquired conditions. Sponsors should seek the most current data 
120 
to understand background rates of specific long-term neurodevelopmental 
121 
outcomes in the population of interest. 
122 
b. Disease state characteristics: The disease or pathophysiology of the condition 
123 
under study (e.g., metabolic processes or conditions associated with 
124 
compromised blood-brain barrier integrity or altered cerebral blood flow such 
125 
as meningitis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or perinatal arterial ischemic 
126 
stroke) may increase the risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
127 
Sponsors should address disease-specific vulnerabilities in the proposed 
128 
evaluation of neurodevelopmental safety. 
129 
 
130 
3. Product-specific Considerations 
131 
a. Nonclinical toxicity: Nonclinical studies conducted to specifically evaluate the 
132 
potential adverse effects of an investigational medical product on the 
133 
developing CNS of neonates and young infants should include pre- and 
134 
postnatal development studies, and, if warranted, embryo-fetal development 
135 
and/or dedicated juvenile animal studies testing the investigational medical 
136 
product in very young animals at critical and comparable stages of brain 
137 
development.11   These studies can test both the intended effects of an 
138 
investigational product and also can identify unintended or off-target effects. 
139 
These data can and should be used to inform risk assessments for neonates 
140 
and young infants and can also inform the design of clinical studies (e.g., 
141 
inclusion of specific endpoints, identification of potential windows of 
142 
developmental vulnerability). However, because CNS development and 
143 
maturation are extremely complex, extrapolation of data regarding 
144 
development across species is challenging. Nonclinical studies generally 
145 
cannot test all potential neurological effects of a medical product, and the lack 
146 
of adverse effects in nonclinical studies alone does not necessarily exclude the 
147 
possibility of adverse effects in neonates. To date, the Agency has limited 
148 
experience with alternative assays to characterize neurodevelopmental 
149 
toxicity. However, the Agency fully supports the principles of the 3Rs 
150 
(replace/reduce/refine) for animal use testing when feasible and encourages 
151 
sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering non-animal 
11  See the ICH Guidance for Industry, S11 Nonclinical Safety Testing in Support of Development of Pediatric 
Pharmaceuticals; May 2021.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
152 
testing methods, including methods that attempt to characterize 
153 
neurodevelopmental toxicity. 
154 
b. Clinical pharmacology: The mechanism of action, target organ or tissue, 
155 
disposition and tissue distribution of the product, and/or accumulation of 
156 
metabolites (and ontogeny of these factors) may evoke concerns about long- 
157 
term neurodevelopmental safety. For example, drugs and biological products 
158 
thought to penetrate the CNS of neonates are likely to warrant long-term 
159 
safety assessment. Exposures may also be affected by developmental changes 
160 
in the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and the ontogeny 
161 
of renal function in the neonatal period.12  
162 
c. Clinical experience: Data from use of a medical product in other populations 
163 
may be incorporated into the discussion about potential toxicities and need for 
164 
follow-up after neonatal studies. Neurologic safety signals identified in older 
165 
pediatric and adult patients should be carefully evaluated in neonates. It is 
166 
important to note that the absence of a safety signal in older populations may 
167 
not preclude adverse effects in neonates. Novel medical products developed 
168 
for conditions that occur only in neonates may not have available safety data 
169 
from other populations and a comprehensive neurodevelopmental safety 
170 
evaluation may be useful in these situations (see section IIIC3). 
171 
d. Route of administration: The potential impact of method of product delivery 
172 
should be considered. For example, for products that require repeated 
173 
intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, the impact of pain on 
174 
neurodevelopment should be considered. 
175 
e. Product components: Both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and all 
176 
excipients (e.g., ethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol) and impurities (e.g., heavy 
177 
metals and trace elements) should be considered when assessing the potential 
178 
of a drug to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity. For devices that directly or 
179 
indirectly contact human tissues, a biocompatibility evaluation should be 
180 
conducted to assess for the potential for adverse responses resulting from 
181 
contact of the component materials with the body.13  
182 
 
183 
B. Factors to Consider When Developing a Plan to Evaluate Long-term 
184 
Neurodevelopmental Safety 
185 
If, after conducting the assessment described in section IIIA, a sponsor determines 
186 
that a long-term neurodevelopmental safety evaluation should be conducted, the 
187 
sponsor should justify and design such an evaluation based on sound scientific 
188 
rationale. A controlled study design is recommended, whenever feasible. Although a 
189 
single-arm study may be useful for collecting some types of safety information, the 
190 
absence of a concurrent control arm (placebo or active comparator) will generally 
191 
make clear interpretation of the results difficult, if not impossible. A control group 
192 
allows for easier discrimination of medical product-related patient outcomes from

193 
outcomes caused by other factors, including underlying disease and developmental 
194 
progression, especially if the natural history of the condition in the patient population 
195 
is not well-established. 
196 
 
197 
1. 
General Considerations 
198 
a. Standardization: Sponsors should ensure reliability of administration and 
199 
scoring of evaluations across sites and examiners, including consistency in the 
200 
study instruments used and the age at follow-up. 
201 
b. Community acceptance and inclusivity: Development of a long-term safety 
202 
study plan should include an assessment of family perceptions and early 
203 
identification of barriers to study participation, including potential mistrust. 
204 
Engagement of patient families and community leaders at the protocol 
205 
development stage may help promote participation of historically 
206 
underrepresented communities and improve overall study recruitment and 
207 
retention. 
208 
c. Multidisciplinary input: Sponsors may identify and address challenges and 
209 
opportunities in study development through engagement of key interested 
210 
parties. Interested parties may include, but are not limited to patient survivors, 
211 
parents, caregivers, health care providers, educators, community leaders, and 
212 
developmental specialists. These parties are instrumental in identifying 
213 
clinically meaningful outcomes and assessing the acceptability and feasibility 
214 
of the study design. 
215 
d. Patient recruitment and retention: Ideally, sponsors should obtain consent for 
216 
long-term follow-up evaluation during initial study enrollment. Although this 
217 
will not eliminate the risk of missing data, early recruitment will reinforce the 
218 
importance of the long-term safety evaluation. Loss of patients over time 
219 
threatens the integrity of long-term neurodevelopmental safety studies. There 
220 
should be appropriate plans in place to keep families engaged and to collect 
221 
relevant contact information (e.g., home and mobile phone numbers, email 
222 
addresses, other messaging modalities) as needed to encourage retention of 
223 
study participants and important data. Study participants may relocate during 
224 
the follow-up period and maintaining contact is an important means to reduce 
225 
the risk of missing patient information. 
226 
e. Patient burden: Sponsors developing long-term safety evaluations should 
227 
consider and mitigate barriers to follow-up study enrollment as well as 
228 
minimize the short-term and long-term burdens of study participation to the 
229 
subjects and their family. Sponsors may consider and propose a strategy for 
230 
integrating data from community-level services and providers involved in 
231 
routine neurodevelopmental evaluations and tracking (e.g., early intervention 
232 
and Child Find programs) and pediatric evaluations during usual care (see 
233 
maintaining data quality considerations below, Section B1c). Additional 
234 
strategies may include use of mobile technology for information collection 
235 
and transfer. 
236 
f. Data quality: While some information can be reasonably gathered through 
237 
evaluations in usual clinical practice, general developmental screening 
238 
performed during routine care is rarely a reliable substitute for a formal 
6 


 
 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
 
239 
diagnostic neurodevelopmental evaluation, when such an evaluation is 
240 
warranted. In addition, some neurodevelopmental evaluations require 
241 
specialist evaluation. A sponsor may be able to rely on certain objective 
242 
developmental measures with established reference standards (e.g., growth, 
243 
vision, and hearing screening) captured during routine care where the sponsor 
244 
can ensure they are collected reliably. 
245 
g. Plan for clinical referral as indicated: The protocol should include a plan for 
246 
clinical referral and support services if any developmental problems are 
247 
identified in the course of research-related follow-up. 
248 
 
249 
2. 
Patient/Population-specific Considerations 
250 
a. Timing and duration: For the evaluation of neurodevelopmental safety, 
251 
outcomes should be evaluated up to at least 2 years of age, adjusted for 
252 
prematurity,14  if appropriate. The duration and frequency of follow-up 
253 
assessments should be supported by scientific data and sound rationale. 
254 
Considerations may include the static or dynamic nature of the 
255 
neurodevelopmental outcome(s) being evaluated. The follow-up plan also 
256 
should consider the ages at which the outcomes of interest can be reasonably 
257 
measured. For example, some learning difficulties or neurologic disorders 
258 
may not present or be reasonably discernable with available assessment tools 
259 
until after 2 years adjusted age. 
260 
b. Related factors: Sponsors should consider how other factors that relate to and        
261 
affect neurodevelopmental outcomes may influence the interpretability of 
262 
study results and should collect relevant covariate data accordingly. 
263 
i. Comorbidities (e.g., prematurity, congenital heart disease) 
264 
ii. Socioeconomic factors (e.g., food insecurity, social stressors, parental 
265 
education level) 
266 
iii. Perinatal factors (e.g., substance use during pregnancy, depression) 
267 
iv. Regional differences in health care systems and accepted standards of 
268 
medical practice 
269 
v. Environmental factors (e.g., lead or chemical exposure) 
270 
vi. Intercurrent events (e.g., illness, injury, therapies [such as early 
271 
intervention], and other medications) 
272 
c. Developmental domains: In most cases, a general assessment of all the key 
273 
neurodevelopmental domains is recommended. (See Section C3, below). If 
274 
specific domains of vulnerability are known or suspected in the study 
275 
population based on product characteristics, then sponsors should identify the 
276 
existing validated, age-appropriate tools to carefully measure relevant 
277 
outcomes within those domains. 
278 
d. Feasibility: There may be population or study-specific issues that affect the 
279 
feasibility of planned long-term follow-up studies. Sponsors should assess 
280 
feasibility early in drug or device development and provide study plans for 
 
14  Adjusted age, (also called “corrected age” or “post-menstrual age”) is defined as the chronological age reduced by 
the number of weeks born before 40 weeks of gestation. Refs: AAP Committee on Fetus and Newborn. “Age 
terminology during the perinatal period;” Pediatrics 2004;114(5):1362-4 and E11: Clinical Investigation of 
Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population; International Council for Harmonization, 2000.

283 
 
284 
3. 
Product-specific Considerations 
285 
a. 
Tissue specificity: Sponsors should determine whether the product has 
286 
effects on organ systems that may impact neurodevelopment. Medical 
287 
products may have direct and/or indirect effects on the developing CNS. 
288 
Understanding these effects can help determine not only the extent of 
289 
long- term follow-up but also the type of assessment needed. 
290 
b. 
Ontogeny of therapeutic target: Sponsors should determine whether a 
291 
medical product’s target changes in distribution or function throughout 
292 
maturation. The extent of medical product exposure in relation to known 
293 
target tissue developmental changes should be considered when designing 
294 
the plan for neurodevelopmental safety evaluation. 
295 
 
296 
C. What to Measure, When and For How Long? 
297 
The most useful type of neurodevelopmental safety evaluation will depend upon 
298 
whether it is determined (based on considerations discussed in sections IIIA. and IIIB. 
299 
above) that a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation is appropriate and/or 
300 
whether there are specific developmental domains of concern that warrant targeted 
301 
evaluations (see section IIIC3). As sponsors are planning long-term 
302 
neurodevelopmental evaluations, they should consider what assessment tools to use, 
303 
at what time point(s), and for how long. Neurodevelopmental safety evaluations 
304 
should include validated tools, when available, to ensure rigor and should provide 
305 
broad-ranging assessments of neurologic function, including relevant clinical 
306 
outcome assessment (COA) tools. The protocol should specify whether assessments 
307 
are conducted as part of standard clinical care or for research-related purposes only.  
308 
For research-related interventions, the benefit-risk determination should be performed 
309 
to ensure that the procedure is ethically permissible.15   Note that general 
310 
developmental screening and formalized assessments of neurodevelopment are not 
311 
interchangeable. 
312 
 
313 
1. 
Timing of Safety Evaluations 
314 
In general, outcomes should be evaluated at a minimum of 2 years adjusted age. 
315 
Earlier and/or later evaluations also may be warranted. 
316 
a. Evaluations that can be reliably performed during the first 2 years (adjusted 
317 
age) of life and require longitudinal monitoring, including head growth, 
318 
hearing and vision testing, neurologic exam, and developmental milestones, 
319 
provide important information and may be appropriate. 
320 
b. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental outcomes should be evaluated at a 
321 
minimum at 2 years adjusted age. 
322 
c. Assessment of more subtle, but important cognitive, language, behavioral, and 
323 
other outcomes may require children to be followed until later in childhood.

324 
Problems in these areas may not be clearly discernable or adequately assessed 
325 
in the ﬁrst 4–6 years of life. Depending on the specific domains of concern, 
326 
longer follow-up may be useful even if there are no neurodevelopmental 
327 
concerns observed at the initial 2-year assessment. 
328 
 
329 
2. 
Key Characteristics of Measurement Tools 
330 
Long-term safety evaluations should be based on well-defined and reliable COAs. 
331 
Specifically, COAs should assess clearly defined concepts of interest with 
332 
appropriate justification to support their use in neonatal long-term safety 
333 
evaluations.16   Assessments should include those that measure how a subject is 
334 
functioning in daily life. Key considerations relevant to long-term safety 
335 
assessment after neonatal studies include: 
336 
a. Minimizing participant burden and avoiding duplication can increase pediatric 
337 
patient testing compliance and reduce behavioral interference (e.g., refusal to 
338 
participate in testing). T
 his approach can help avoid the confounding or 
339 
invalidation of test scores, and also can reduce missing data and increase the 
340 
feasibility for administration across large cohort studies. 
341 
b. Identifying and accounting for potential confounding factors that may 
342 
compromise the validity of an assessment and score interpretability is 
343 
important when devising a plan for analyzing test scores. For example, a 
344 
cognitive assessment that depends on patients having typical fine motor 
345 
functioning (e.g., a time-limited block design task) may yield unreliable 
346 
scores for children with fine motor impairments. 
347 
c. Carefully considering the type of score to utilize within neurodevelopmental 
348 
assessments is important, given that some COAs may generate several types 
349 
of scores (e.g., standardized norm-referenced scores, raw scores). S
 electing 
350 
several types of scores from the same COA may be appropriate, especially for 
351 
patient populations that may be at the greatest risk of impairment. For 
352 
example, some scores (e.g., norm-referenced standardized scores) may 
353 
demonstrate floor effects in severely impaired children and ceiling effects in 
354 
children with developmentally advanced skills. 
355 
d. Selecting COAs that are methodologically sound with well-established 
356 
psychometric properties is important, particularly to ensure validity across 
357 
multicenter studies. 
358 
e. Ensuring that selected COAs have demonstrated reliability across the 
359 
demographic groups included in the study, including availability in languages 
360 
appropriate for global sites, is key to support generalizability of study results. 
361 
Consider, for example, that a language assessment developed for U.S. English 
362 
speakers may yield uninterpretable scores when used with patients at non-U.S. 
363 
English speaking sites. Selected COAs should be developed to assess term and 
364 
preterm infants (i.e., based on a large representative population). 
365

Drug Development: Selecting, Developing or Modifying Fit-for-Purpose Clinical Outcome Assessments; June 2022,

thinking.

3. 
Domains of Assessment 
367 
When a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation is needed, it should also 
368 
include evaluation of physical, mental, and social health. The assessment may 
369 
include the following domains: 
370 
a. General 
371 
i. Physical Health—including ongoing health conditions (e.g., seizure 
372 
disorder, pulmonary conditions, renal impairment), feeding problems, 
373 
somatic growth (height, weight, and head circumference)17, sleep 
374 
ii.  Quality of life and global function in daily life 
375 
iii. Receipt of developmental interventions and educational services 
376 
b. Neurodevelopment 
377 
i. Sensory (e.g., hearing, vision) 
378 
ii. Motor 
379 
iii. Cognition18   
380 
iv. Emotional and Behavioral Health 
381 
v. Communication/Language 
382 
vi. Social Functioning 
383 
vii. Adaptive Functioning 
384 
 
385 
4. 
Relevant Covariates 
386 
Relevant covariates such as demographic variables and other factors that may 
387 
change over time should be assessed longitudinally and systematic data collection 
388 
of these factors should be incorporated into the proposed follow-up plan. (See 
389 
Section IIIB2b.) 
390 
 
391 
5. 
Adjunctive Assessments (i.e., Biomarkers of Neurodevelopmental Outcome) 
392 
In general, adjunctive assessments and biomarker measures may not provide as 
393 
meaningful information as long-term functional outcomes assessments and may 
394 
not substitute for the above evaluations. However, adjunctive assessments may 
395 
have clinical utility and may be useful to support the evaluation of 
396 
neurodevelopmental safety, especially when following a known signal of concern 
397 
from nonclinical studies, studies in a different population, or known effects of 
398 
medical products from a similar pharmacological or therapeutic class. Thus, how 
399 
useful an adjunctive assessment could be is typically product-specific and should 
400 
be discussed with the appropriate review division at the time of protocol 
401 
development. 
402 
 
403 
a. Neuroimaging studies may be used to assess anatomical evidence of toxicity 
404 
(e.g., brain MRI to assess disruptions in myelination) but should typically 
405 
have clinical correlation. 
406 
b. Neurophysiologic testing may also be used to evaluate a specific safety signal 
407 
and may include (not a comprehensive list): 
 
17  See the Draft Guidance, Measuring Growth and Evaluating Pubertal Development in Pediatric Clinical Trials: 
Guidance for Industry for information on measuring growth parameters; October 2022. When finalized, this 
guidance will represent the Agency’s current thinking.
