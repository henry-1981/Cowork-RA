This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this guidance is to provide a framework for considering whether and what type of
long-term neurologic, sensory and developmental evaluations could be useful to support a
determination of safety of a “medical product” (i.e., drug, biological product, or device) for use
in neonates 2, and if so, which domains of neurodevelopment may be most applicable.
This guidance will not specifically address effectiveness, safety or benefit/risk assessments for
products primarily intended to improve neurologic outcomes, e.g., neuroprotective agents. This
guidance is focused on long-term evaluations of neurodevelopmental safety. Although
assessments of specific toxicities to other tissues and organs may also be warranted in neonatal
medical product development, the approach to those assessments is outside the scope of this
guidance.
Pertinent information on planning clinical pharmacology studies in neonates 3 and pediatric
patients 4 can be found in existing guidance documents. 5 This guidance does not focus on
nonclinical safety studies to support clinical studies in neonates, nor does it address clinical study

Office of the Commissioner; the Division of Pediatric and Maternal Health, the Division of Antivirals, the Office of
Surveillance and Epidemiology, and the Office of Neuroscience in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; the

The neonatal period is defined in the Addendum to ICH E11: Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the
Pediatric Population E11 (R1) (2017) as including term, post-term, and preterm newborn infants. The neonatal
period for term and post-term infants is the day of birth plus 27 days. For preterm infants, the neonatal period is
defined as the day of birth through the expected age of delivery plus 27 days. These same definitions will apply for
purposes of this guidance.

assessments following studies conducted during pregnancy, 6 nor gene therapies or similar
genomic medicine interventions. 7
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.
II.

BACKGROUND

In 2012, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) and the Pediatric Research Equity
Act (PREA) were made permanent under Title V of the Food and Drug Administration Safety
and Innovation Act (FDASIA). 8 FDASIA contained several provisions to encourage medical
product development in neonates.
Treatment with medical products during the neonatal period coincides with a time of critical
growth and physiologic development. Short-term safety evaluations typical for adults or other
populations may fail to identify important adverse effects in the neonatal population, as latent
effects may follow early-life exposures. Historically, most medical products used to treat
neonates and young infants were not approved for use in this population for the relevant
indications, and thus, long-term effects were rarely systematically evaluated.
Clinical investigators and sponsors 9 of neonatal studies should consider and assess potential
short-term and long-term effects of an investigational therapy, whether the therapy is novel or
previously developed for a different indication or population. Short-term clinical improvement,
such as that observed after high-dose corticosteroids for infants with bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, may be followed by unexpected long-term harm. 10 While adjunctive neurological
assessments (e.g., neuroimaging, electroencephalography) may provide information on early
safety concerns, they cannot replace clinical assessments of long-term functional outcomes.
Although there is no universal definition of “long-term,” for the purpose of this guidance, the
time frame can be generally thought of as at least 2 years of age or at such time when relevant
clinical neurodevelopmental parameters can be reasonably assessed (refer to sections IIIB2a and

Considerations for Inclusion in Clinical Studies; April 2018. When finalized, this guidance will represent the

IIIC1); the minimum duration of follow-up will depend on different population- and productspecific factors as discussed in this guidance. Prospectively designed long-term follow-up is
often important to understand medical product safety in neonates.
Neonates should have access to medical products adequately evaluated for safety, effectiveness,
and, when appropriate, dosing for that population. There are conditions unique to term or
preterm neonates, such as necrotizing enterocolitis and retinopathy of prematurity, that will not
have analogous development programs in older populations. As new medical products are
developed for these and other unique neonatal conditions, novel development programs and firstin-human studies may be initiated in neonates, and these development programs should also
demonstrate long-term neurologic, sensory, and developmental safety. Neonates should also be
enrolled in clinical studies for medical products and diagnostic tools initially developed for
indications in other populations that will be used for neonates. Inclusion of neonates in such
studies may be useful to establish dosing, safety, and efficacy or effectiveness, and these studies
may also warrant long-term safety evaluations.
III.
NEURODEVELOPMENTAL FOLLOW-UP FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE NEONATES
Long-term neurodevelopmental safety should be considered as part of neonatal product
development plans. Sponsors should communicate as early as possible with the relevant FDA
review division to reach alignment on an appropriate approach for long-term safety evaluations.
A. Determining the Need for Long-term Neurodevelopmental Safety Evaluations
Sponsors should assess whether a long-term neurodevelopmental safety evaluation
for neonates enrolled in clinical studies should be conducted. This assessment should
be initiated early in product development and should be reevaluated as new
information becomes available.
1. General Considerations
a. Central Nervous System (CNS) Exposure: Any route of administration may
result in a systemic exposure. The degree of systemic exposure, which should
be quantified in early pharmacokinetic or animal studies if possible, may
inform the need for long-term safety assessment. In general, higher levels of
systemic exposure may be associated with higher CNS exposure and potential
risk for long-term sequelae. The degree of CNS exposure may vary
independently of systemic exposure.
b. Timing of Exposure: The timing of exposure to a drug, biological product, or
device relative to a particularly vulnerable stage of organ and tissue
development may inform the need for and the type of long-term safety
assessment.
c. Duration of Exposure: Repeated dosing, prolonged exposure and medical
products with persistent effects may be associated with higher risk for longterm sequelae; however, long-term safety assessments may also be required

after single doses or short durations of investigational therapies, based on the
other considerations described in this guidance.
2. Patient and Population-specific Considerations
a. Neurodevelopmental vulnerability: While neuroplasticity and resilience may
impact tolerance to toxicity, the anticipated rates of developmental,
behavioral, and sensory impairments are generally inversely related to
gestational age and birth weight and differ significantly across various
congenital or acquired conditions. Sponsors should seek the most current data
to understand background rates of specific long-term neurodevelopmental
outcomes in the population of interest.
b. Disease state characteristics: The disease or pathophysiology of the condition
under study (e.g., metabolic processes or conditions associated with
compromised blood-brain barrier integrity or altered cerebral blood flow such
as meningitis, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy or perinatal arterial ischemic
stroke) may increase the risk for adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Sponsors should address disease-specific vulnerabilities in the proposed
evaluation of neurodevelopmental safety.
3. Product-specific Considerations
a. Nonclinical toxicity: Nonclinical studies conducted to specifically evaluate the
potential adverse effects of an investigational medical product on the
developing CNS of neonates and young infants should include pre- and
postnatal development studies, and, if warranted, embryo-fetal development
and/or dedicated juvenile animal studies testing the investigational medical
product in very young animals at critical and comparable stages of brain
development. 11 These studies can test both the intended effects of an
investigational product and also can identify unintended or off-target effects.
These data can and should be used to inform risk assessments for neonates
and young infants and can also inform the design of clinical studies (e.g.,
inclusion of specific endpoints, identification of potential windows of
developmental vulnerability). However, because CNS development and
maturation are extremely complex, extrapolation of data regarding
development across species is challenging. Nonclinical studies generally
cannot test all potential neurological effects of a medical product, and the lack
of adverse effects in nonclinical studies alone does not necessarily exclude the
possibility of adverse effects in neonates. To date, the Agency has limited
experience with alternative assays to characterize neurodevelopmental
toxicity. However, the Agency fully supports the principles of the 3Rs
(replace/reduce/refine) for animal use testing when feasible and encourages
sponsors to consult with review divisions when considering non-animal

testing methods, including methods that attempt to characterize
neurodevelopmental toxicity.
Clinical pharmacology: The mechanism of action, target organ or tissue,
disposition and tissue distribution of the product, and/or accumulation of
metabolites (and ontogeny of these factors) may evoke concerns about longterm neurodevelopmental safety. For example, drugs and biological products
thought to penetrate the CNS of neonates are likely to warrant long-term
safety assessment. Exposures may also be affected by developmental changes
in the activity of drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and the ontogeny
of renal function in the neonatal period. 12
Clinical experience: Data from use of a medical product in other populations
may be incorporated into the discussion about potential toxicities and need for
follow-up after neonatal studies. Neurologic safety signals identified in older
pediatric and adult patients should be carefully evaluated in neonates. It is
important to note that the absence of a safety signal in older populations may
not preclude adverse effects in neonates. Novel medical products developed
for conditions that occur only in neonates may not have available safety data
from other populations and a comprehensive neurodevelopmental safety
evaluation may be useful in these situations (see section IIIC3).
Route of administration: The potential impact of method of product delivery
should be considered. For example, for products that require repeated
intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, the impact of pain on
neurodevelopment should be considered.
Product components: Both the active pharmaceutical ingredient and all
excipients (e.g., ethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol) and impurities (e.g., heavy
metals and trace elements) should be considered when assessing the potential
of a drug to cause neurodevelopmental toxicity. For devices that directly or
indirectly contact human tissues, a biocompatibility evaluation should be
conducted to assess for the potential for adverse responses resulting from
contact of the component materials with the body. 13

B. Factors to Consider When Developing a Plan to Evaluate Long-term
Neurodevelopmental Safety
If, after conducting the assessment described in section IIIA, a sponsor determines
that a long-term neurodevelopmental safety evaluation should be conducted, the
sponsor should justify and design such an evaluation based on sound scientific
rationale. A controlled study design is recommended, whenever feasible. Although a
single-arm study may be useful for collecting some types of safety information, the
absence of a concurrent control arm (placebo or active comparator) will generally
make clear interpretation of the results difficult, if not impossible. A control group
allows for easier discrimination of medical product-related patient outcomes from

outcomes caused by other factors, including underlying disease and developmental
progression, especially if the natural history of the condition in the patient population
is not well-established.
1.

General Considerations
a. Standardization: Sponsors should ensure reliability of administration and
scoring of evaluations across sites and examiners, including consistency in the
study instruments used and the age at follow-up.
b. Community acceptance and inclusivity: Development of a long-term safety
study plan should include an assessment of family perceptions and early
identification of barriers to study participation, including potential mistrust.
Engagement of patient families and community leaders at the protocol
development stage may help promote participation of historically
underrepresented communities and improve overall study recruitment and
retention.
c. Multidisciplinary input: Sponsors may identify and address challenges and
opportunities in study development through engagement of key interested
parties. Interested parties may include, but are not limited to patient survivors,
parents, caregivers, health care providers, educators, community leaders, and
developmental specialists. These parties are instrumental in identifying
clinically meaningful outcomes and assessing the acceptability and feasibility
of the study design.
d. Patient recruitment and retention: Ideally, sponsors should obtain consent for
long-term follow-up evaluation during initial study enrollment. Although this
will not eliminate the risk of missing data, early recruitment will reinforce the
importance of the long-term safety evaluation. Loss of patients over time
threatens the integrity of long-term neurodevelopmental safety studies. There
should be appropriate plans in place to keep families engaged and to collect
relevant contact information (e.g., home and mobile phone numbers, email
addresses, other messaging modalities) as needed to encourage retention of
study participants and important data. Study participants may relocate during
the follow-up period and maintaining contact is an important means to reduce
the risk of missing patient information.
e. Patient burden: Sponsors developing long-term safety evaluations should
consider and mitigate barriers to follow-up study enrollment as well as
minimize the short-term and long-term burdens of study participation to the
subjects and their family. Sponsors may consider and propose a strategy for
integrating data from community-level services and providers involved in
routine neurodevelopmental evaluations and tracking (e.g., early intervention
and Child Find programs) and pediatric evaluations during usual care (see
maintaining data quality considerations below, Section B1c). Additional
strategies may include use of mobile technology for information collection
and transfer.
f. Data quality: While some information can be reasonably gathered through
evaluations in usual clinical practice, general developmental screening
performed during routine care is rarely a reliable substitute for a formal

diagnostic neurodevelopmental evaluation, when such an evaluation is
warranted. In addition, some neurodevelopmental evaluations require
specialist evaluation. A sponsor may be able to rely on certain objective
developmental measures with established reference standards (e.g., growth,
vision, and hearing screening) captured during routine care where the sponsor
can ensure they are collected reliably.
g. Plan for clinical referral as indicated: The protocol should include a plan for
clinical referral and support services if any developmental problems are
identified in the course of research-related follow-up.
2.

Patient/Population-specific Considerations
a. Timing and duration: For the evaluation of neurodevelopmental safety,
outcomes should be evaluated up to at least 2 years of age, adjusted for
prematurity, 14 if appropriate. The duration and frequency of follow-up
assessments should be supported by scientific data and sound rationale.
Considerations may include the static or dynamic nature of the
neurodevelopmental outcome(s) being evaluated. The follow-up plan also
should consider the ages at which the outcomes of interest can be reasonably
measured. For example, some learning difficulties or neurologic disorders
may not present or be reasonably discernable with available assessment tools
until after 2 years adjusted age.
b. Related factors: Sponsors should consider how other factors that relate to and
affect neurodevelopmental outcomes may influence the interpretability of
study results and should collect relevant covariate data accordingly.
i. Comorbidities (e.g., prematurity, congenital heart disease)
ii. Socioeconomic factors (e.g., food insecurity, social stressors, parental
education level)
iii. Perinatal factors (e.g., substance use during pregnancy, depression)
iv. Regional differences in health care systems and accepted standards of
medical practice
v. Environmental factors (e.g., lead or chemical exposure)
vi. Intercurrent events (e.g., illness, injury, therapies [such as early
intervention], and other medications)
c. Developmental domains: In most cases, a general assessment of all the key
neurodevelopmental domains is recommended. (See Section C3, below). If
specific domains of vulnerability are known or suspected in the study
population based on product characteristics, then sponsors should identify the
existing validated, age-appropriate tools to carefully measure relevant
outcomes within those domains.
d. Feasibility: There may be population or study-specific issues that affect the
feasibility of planned long-term follow-up studies. Sponsors should assess
feasibility early in drug or device development and provide study plans for

Agency review. This may include alternate strategies (e.g., patient registries,
observational studies) if needed.
3.

Product-specific Considerations
a.
Tissue specificity: Sponsors should determine whether the product has
effects on organ systems that may impact neurodevelopment. Medical
products may have direct and/or indirect effects on the developing CNS.
Understanding these effects can help determine not only the extent of
long- term follow-up but also the type of assessment needed.
b.
Ontogeny of therapeutic target: Sponsors should determine whether a
medical product’s target changes in distribution or function throughout
maturation. The extent of medical product exposure in relation to known
target tissue developmental changes should be considered when designing
the plan for neurodevelopmental safety evaluation.

C. What to Measure, When and For How Long?
The most useful type of neurodevelopmental safety evaluation will depend upon
whether it is determined (based on considerations discussed in sections IIIA. and IIIB.
above) that a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation is appropriate and/or
whether there are specific developmental domains of concern that warrant targeted
evaluations (see section IIIC3). As sponsors are planning long-term
neurodevelopmental evaluations, they should consider what assessment tools to use,
at what time point(s), and for how long. Neurodevelopmental safety evaluations
should include validated tools, when available, to ensure rigor and should provide
broad-ranging assessments of neurologic function, including relevant clinical
outcome assessment (COA) tools. The protocol should specify whether assessments
are conducted as part of standard clinical care or for research-related purposes only.
For research-related interventions, the benefit-risk determination should be performed
to ensure that the procedure is ethically permissible. 15 Note that general
developmental screening and formalized assessments of neurodevelopment are not

Timing of Safety Evaluations
In general, outcomes should be evaluated at a minimum of 2 years adjusted age.
Earlier and/or later evaluations also may be warranted.
a. Evaluations that can be reliably performed during the first 2 years (adjusted
age) of life and require longitudinal monitoring, including head growth,
hearing and vision testing, neurologic exam, and developmental milestones,
provide important information and may be appropriate.
b. Comprehensive neurodevelopmental outcomes should be evaluated at a
minimum at 2 years adjusted age.
c. Assessment of more subtle, but important cognitive, language, behavioral, and
other outcomes may require children to be followed until later in childhood.

of Medical Products Involving Children; September 2022. When finalized, this guidance will represent the
Agency’s current thinking.

Problems in these areas may not be clearly discernable or adequately assessed
in the ﬁrst 4–6 years of life. Depending on the specific domains of concern,
longer follow-up may be useful even if there are no neurodevelopmental
concerns observed at the initial 2-year assessment.
2.

Key Characteristics of Measurement Tools
Long-term safety evaluations should be based on well-defined and reliable COAs.
Specifically, COAs should assess clearly defined concepts of interest with
appropriate justification to support their use in neonatal long-term safety
evaluations. 16 Assessments should include those that measure how a subject is
functioning in daily life. Key considerations relevant to long-term safety
assessment after neonatal studies include:
a. Minimizing participant burden and avoiding duplication can increase pediatric
patient testing compliance and reduce behavioral interference (e.g., refusal to
participate in testing). This approach can help avoid the confounding or
invalidation of test scores, and also can reduce missing data and increase the
feasibility for administration across large cohort studies.
b. Identifying and accounting for potential confounding factors that may
compromise the validity of an assessment and score interpretability is
important when devising a plan for analyzing test scores. For example, a
cognitive assessment that depends on patients having typical fine motor
functioning (e.g., a time-limited block design task) may yield unreliable
scores for children with fine motor impairments.
c. Carefully considering the type of score to utilize within neurodevelopmental
assessments is important, given that some COAs may generate several types
of scores (e.g., standardized norm-referenced scores, raw scores). Selecting
several types of scores from the same COA may be appropriate, especially for
patient populations that may be at the greatest risk of impairment. For
example, some scores (e.g., norm-referenced standardized scores) may
demonstrate floor effects in severely impaired children and ceiling effects in
children with developmentally advanced skills.
d. Selecting COAs that are methodologically sound with well-established
psychometric properties is important, particularly to ensure validity across
multicenter studies.
e. Ensuring that selected COAs have demonstrated reliability across the
demographic groups included in the study, including availability in languages
appropriate for global sites, is key to support generalizability of study results.
Consider, for example, that a language assessment developed for U.S. English
speakers may yield uninterpretable scores when used with patients at non-U.S.
English speaking sites. Selected COAs should be developed to assess term and
preterm infants (i.e., based on a large representative population).

See the Draft Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff and Other Stakeholders, Patient-focused
Drug Development: Selecting, Developing or Modifying Fit-for-Purpose Clinical Outcome Assessments; June 2022,
for further discussion of these characteristics. When finalized, this guidance will represent the Agency’s current
thinking.

Domains of Assessment
When a comprehensive neurodevelopmental evaluation is needed, it should also
include evaluation of physical, mental, and social health. The assessment may
include the following domains:
a. General
i. Physical Health—including ongoing health conditions (e.g., seizure
disorder, pulmonary conditions, renal impairment), feeding problems,
somatic growth (height, weight, and head circumference) 17, sleep
ii. Quality of life and global function in daily life
iii. Receipt of developmental interventions and educational services
b. Neurodevelopment
i. Sensory (e.g., hearing, vision)
ii. Motor
iii. Cognition 18
iv. Emotional and Behavioral Health
v. Communication/Language
vi. Social Functioning
vii. Adaptive Functioning

4.

Relevant Covariates
Relevant covariates such as demographic variables and other factors that may
change over time should be assessed longitudinally and systematic data collection
of these factors should be incorporated into the proposed follow-up plan. (See
Section IIIB2b.)

5.

Adjunctive Assessments (i.e., Biomarkers of Neurodevelopmental Outcome)
In general, adjunctive assessments and biomarker measures may not provide as
meaningful information as long-term functional outcomes assessments and may
not substitute for the above evaluations. However, adjunctive assessments may
have clinical utility and may be useful to support the evaluation of
neurodevelopmental safety, especially when following a known signal of concern
from nonclinical studies, studies in a different population, or known effects of
medical products from a similar pharmacological or therapeutic class. Thus, how
useful an adjunctive assessment could be is typically product-specific and should
be discussed with the appropriate review division at the time of protocol
development.
a. Neuroimaging studies may be used to assess anatomical evidence of toxicity
(e.g., brain MRI to assess disruptions in myelination) but should typically
have clinical correlation.
b. Neurophysiologic testing may also be used to evaluate a specific safety signal
and may include (not a comprehensive list):

Guidance for Industry for information on measuring growth parameters; October 2022. When finalized, this
guidance will represent the Agency’s current thinking.

Cognition also includes executive function, attention, working memory, and processing speed.
