FDA and Industry Procedures for
Section 513(g) Requests for
Information under the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration
Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of
the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA
staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The purpose of this guidance is to establish procedures for submitting, reviewing and
responding to requests for information regarding the class in which a device has been
classified or the requirements applicable to a device under the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) that are submitted in accordance with section 513(g) of
the FD&C Act.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II.

Statutory Requirements for Device Classification

Section 513(a) of the FD&C Act establishes three classes of devices based on the regulatory
controls needed to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness: class I
(general controls), class II (special controls in addition to general controls), and class III
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(premarket approval in addition to general controls).
Under section 513(f) of the FD&C Act, post-amendments devices (devices that were not in
commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, the date the Medical Device Amendments were
enacted) are classified in Class III. However, FDA may reclassify a post- amendments device
(as Class I or II) or determine that such a device is "substantially equivalent" (SE)1 to either
another post-amendments device that has been classified into Class I or II or to a preamendments device for which premarket approval is not required.2 Thus, a post-amendments
device may be subject to regulation as a Class I or II device in certain circumstances,
including when:
· the device is within a type of device that has been classified into class I or II and FDA
has found the device to be SE to a device within such type;
· the device is within a type of pre-amendments device which is to be classified under
section 513(b) of the FD&C Act and FDA has found the device to be SE to a device
within such type (an unclassified device type); or
· FDA has classified or reclassified the device type in class I or II in accordance with
sections 513(f)(2) or 513(f)(3) of the FD&C Act.
Pursuant to section 513(d) of the FD&C Act, FDA promulgates classification regulations
classifying devices by generic type. A "generic type of device" is "a grouping of devices that
do not differ significantly in purpose, design, materials, energy source, function, or any other
feature related to safety and effectiveness, and for which similar regulatory controls are
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness." (See 21 CFR 860.3(i)).
FDA has issued regulations classifying the vast majority of pre- amendments devices (devices
that were in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976) by generic type of device. See 21
CFR 860.84. Each classification regulation, located at 21 CFR parts 862-892, indicates in
which class (I, II, or III) FDA has classified the device type. While the great majority of
device classifications codified in 21 CFR parts 862-892 are of pre-amendments devices, some
of these classifications are of post- amendments devices.

1

Substantial equivalence is defined at section 513(i) of the FD&C Act. FDA generally evaluates substantial
equivalence on the basis of a premarket notification submitted pursuant to section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.
Certain devices are subject to a statutory exemption from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement (see
sections 510(l) and (m) of the FD&C Act).
2
A pre-amendments device for which premarket approval is not required could be a pre-amendments device that has
been classified into Class I or Class II, a pre-amendments device that has been classified into Class III but for which
a regulation under section 515(b) of the FD&C Act requiring the submission of an application for premarket
approval (PMA) has not yet been issued, or a pre-amendments device that has not yet been classified.

III. Obtaining Information About a Device
A.

General Information

You can obtain information about device classification and regulatory requirements applicable
to a type of device in several ways. FDA's device regulations may be found at 21 CFR parts
800 - 898; the regulations classifying device types are located at 21 CFR parts 862-892. The
CDRH classification resources on CDRH’s Classify Your Medical Device website can help
you quickly ascertain how your device type may be classified. You can also obtain
information about the regulatory requirements that may apply to a particular type of device on
FDA’s web site (see resources below).

Biologics Evaluation.

B.

Section 513(g) Request for Information

Section 513(g) of the FD&C Act provides a means for obtaining the agency's views about
the classification and the regulatory requirements that may be applicable to your particular
device. This provision states:
“Within sixty days of the receipt of a written request of any person for information
respecting the class in which a device has been classified or the requirements
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
applicable to a device under this Act, the Secretary shall provide such person a written
statement of the classification (if any) of such device and the requirements of this Act
applicable to the device.”
Section 513(g) governs requests "for information respecting the class in which a device has
been classified or the requirements applicable to a device under [the] Act." Submissions that
do not request such information are outside the scope of section 513(g).
If, based solely on the information provided with a 513(g) Request for Information, the
product at issue does not appear to be a "device" within the meaning of section 201(h) of the
FD&C Act, FDA will so inform the requester in our response. If, based solely on the
information provided with the request, the product does appear to be a "device" within section
201(h) of the FD&C Act, FDA will generally provide the following information regarding
device classification and applicable FDA regulatory requirements:
·

the agency's assessment, based on the information submitted in the request, as to the
generic type of device (e.g., classification regulation) that the requester's device appears
to be within (if any);

·

the class of devices within that generic type (and if there is more than one class within
that generic type, the particular class within which the requestor's device appears to fall);

·

whether a PMA, 510(k), or neither is required in order to market devices of the
particular class within that generic type;

·

other requirements applicable to devices of the particular class within that generic type;

·

whether a guidance document has been issued regarding the exercise of enforcement
discretion over the particular class of devices within that generic type;

·

whether additional FDA requirements may apply, such as those applicable to radiationemitting products.

FDA does not review data related to substantial equivalence or safety and effectiveness in a
513(g) Request for Information. FDA's responses to 513(g) Requests for Information are not
device classification decisions and do not constitute FDA clearance or approval for marketing.
Classification decisions and clearance or approval for marketing require submissions under
different sections of the FD&C Act. The most common method of seeking a classification
decision is to submit a premarket notification in accordance with section 510(k) of the FD&C
Act (see 21 CFR part 807, subpart E - Premarket Notification Procedures).
FDA’s response to a 513(g) Request for Information will not address the specific types of
nonclinical, animal, or clinical testing appropriate to support clearance or approval of a
marketing application (when required). You may send a Q-submission to the appropriate
Center for review by the appropriate Review Division to receive more specific information
about your specific testing recommendations (for CDRH, see IDE Approval Process; for
CBER, use contact information supplied on the 513(g) Request for Information response
letter).
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A 513(g) response does not constitute final Agency action, but provides responsive information
based on the information provided by the requestor.

C.

Formal Jurisdictional Determinations within FDA

If it is unclear to you which Center has jurisdiction over your product, including any
combination product for which the lead Center has not yet been determined, it may be
appropriate to contact the Office of Combination Products (OCP) to discuss your product's
jurisdiction and whether to submit a formal Request for Designation (RFD) under section 563
of the FD&C Act rather than submitting a 513(g) Request for Information.3 The RFD process
is used to obtain a formal agency determination concerning the classification of a product as a
drug, device, biological product, or combination product4 subject to section 503(g) of the
FD&C Act, and/or respecting which agency component(s) will regulate the product.5

IV. Submitting a 513(g) Request for Information
A 513(g) Request for Information submission should be identified as a 513(g) Request for
Information. While section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act does not require 513(g)s to meet eCopy
requirements nor require 513(g)s to be submitted solely in electronic format, FDA recommends
that 513(g) submissions be submitted as an eCopy or prepared using the voluntary electronic
Submission Template and Resource (eSTAR) for 513(g)s available on FDA’s website.6
Alternatively, one complete paper copy may be submitted. For more information on eCopy and
the submission process, refer to the eCopy website and FDA guidance entitled “eCopy Program
for Medical Device Submissions.” We recommend that the submission include the CDRH
Premarket Review Submission Cover Sheet7 for eCopy submissions made to CDRH or CBER
to facilitate correct login and timely routing to the appropriate review group.
If submitting to CDRH, we recommend submission packages be submitted electronically via
the CDRH Portal, previously known as the CDRH Customer Collaboration Portal. Once
submitted via the CDRH Portal, the 513(g) submission will be received by the CDRH
Document Control Center (DCC). Alternatively, submission packages may be mailed to the
CDRH DCC. The current mailing address for CDRH’s DCC is provided on the eCopy Program
for Medical Device Submissions webpage.

3

Additional information on how combination products are assigned a lead Center for their premarket review and
their regulation is available on OCP’s webpage.
4
Combination product is defined at 21 CFR 3.2(e).
5
For additional information on RFDs, refer to FDA guidances entitled “How to Write a Request for Designation
(RFD)” and “How to Prepare a Pre-Request for Designation (Pre-RFD)”
6
eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission template, and FDA’s preferred submission method, that is
currently available to facilitate the preparation of 513(g)s as eSubmissions. For simplicity, the electronic
submission created with this electronic submission template is often referred to as an eSTAR. FDA’s eSTAR
program website provides current information regarding the eSTAR program for CDRH and CBER. See also
FDA’s guidance “Providing Regulatory Submissions for Medical Devices in Electronic Format – Submissions
Under Section 745A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.”
7
See Form 3514
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
For products regulated by CBER, we recommend that submission packages be submitted
electronically through the FDA Electronic Submission Gateway. Alternatively, they can be
submitted through the CBER submission email inbox (150MB max) at
CBERDCC_eMailSub@fda.hhs.gov, or via mail to the CBER DCC. Additional information on
the FDA Electronic Submission Gateway and the current mailing address for the CBER DCC
can be found at CBER’s Regulatory Submissions website.
User Fees
Section 738(a)(2)(A)(ix) of the FD&C Act requires FDA to collect user fees for 513(g)
Requests for Information. FDA may not accept your 513(g) for review until you have paid all
fees owed, including all required establishment registration fees. See section 738(f)(1) of the
FD&C Act. When FDA has received all fees owed and the 513(g) submission, our review of
your 513(g) Request for Information will begin as of that date.
As explained above, if the submission does not request information respecting the class in
which a device has been classified and/or the requirements applicable to a device under the
FD&C Act, it is not a Request for Information governed by section 513(g) of the FD&C Act.
Such requests do not require a response from FDA. FDA intends to refund any user fee
submitted with a request that is not governed by section 513(g) of the FD&C Act.
For additional information on user fees for 513(g) requests for information see the guidance
document “User Fees for 513(g) Requests for Information.”

V.

Contents of a 513(g) Request for Information

The 513(g) Request for Information should contain the following:
·

a signed cover letter,

·

a description of the device,8

·

a description of what the device is to be used for, and

·

any proposed labeling or promotional material for the device and, as applicable, any
labeling or promotional material of a similar, legally marketed device, if available.

Cover Letter
Your cover letter should identify your request as a “513(g) Request for Information.” Your
cover letter should include:

8

·

the date of the request,

·

the name of the device,

A 513(g) Request for Information should seek classification information and/or regulatory requirements for a
single product and may include multiple uses of the product. Requests for classification information and regulatory
requirements for multiple products should be divided up so that a separate Request for Information and user fee are
submitted for each product.
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

your specific question(s) concerning the class in which a device has been classified
and/or the regulatory requirements applicable to a device,

and

·

the 513(g) requestor’s signature.

Description of the Device
As applicable, the description of the device should include:
·

a list of materials and components used in/with the device,

·

photographs, engineering drawings, and/or samples of the device, 11

·

a summary of the device’s operational principles (e.g., contains software/firmware),

·

a description of the type and amount of energy to be used or delivered by the device,
and

·

a description of similar devices in commercial distribution in the United States, if

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

any other labeling information related to the patient use of the device.

Labeling
You should provide any proposed labeling, including proposed promotional material for the
device or any labeling or promotional material of a similar, legally marketed device. If no
proposed labeling is available for the described device or for a similar legally marketed
device, this should be noted in the cover letter.
Additions to a 513(g) Request for Information
Once FDA has received your 513(g) Request for Information and user fee, you may not
modify that 513(g) request by subsequently adding a new question, use, or technology. We
would consider the addition of a new question, use, or technology to a pending Request for
Information to be a new 513(g) request subject to an additional user fee, to which we intend to
respond separately.

VI. Responding to a 513(g) Request for Information in
CDRH or CBER
Our response to a 513(g) Request for Information will be responsive to the questions posed in
the request. We intend to issue our response within 60 days of receipt. Our response will
generally fall into one of the following categories indicating that, based solely on the
information provided in the 513(g) Request for Information, it appears that the product you
have identified is:
·

·

·

a device within the meaning of section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, and
o appears to be an unclassified pre-amendments device type and therefore is
subject to the 510(k) requirement;
o appears to be a post-amendments device type that has not yet been
reclassified and therefore is subject to the PMA requirement; or
o appears to be a device that is a classified device type. We will generally
identify the generic type of device (e.g., classification regulation) that
your device appears to be within, the class of device within which your
device appears to fall, and the type of submission, if any, required in order
to market devices of the particular class within that generic type:
§ Class I or II subject to the 510(k) requirement;
§ Class I or II exempt from the 510(k) requirement;
§ Class III subject to the 510(k) or PMA requirements; OR
not a device,
o but may be another type of product regulated by FDA. In this case, we would
provide you with contact information for another component within FDA; or
o and appears not to be a product for which FDA has jurisdiction; OR
a combination product where it is not clear which Center has primary jurisdiction. If
you would like to discuss further the assignment of this product, we recommend you
contact the Office of Combination Products.
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

If your 513(g) Request for Information is incomplete and we are unable to provide information
regarding classification and/or applicable requirements because you have not submitted
sufficient information to us, we intend to contact the submitter and request additional
information. If FDA does not receive a response within 30 days of our request, we may
consider a 513(g) to be withdrawn. In this instance, FDA may issue a notice of withdrawal.

VII. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
This guidance contains information collection provisions that are subject to review by the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44
U.S.C. 3501-3521).
The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 12 hours per
response, including the time to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data
needed, and complete and review the information collection.
Send comments regarding this burden estimate or suggestions for reducing this burden to:
FDA PRA Staff,
Office of Operations, Food and Drug Administration
