1

FEEDS: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES
INTRODUCTION

Recommendations on accidental radioactive contamination of human food and animal feeds
were issued in 1982 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA 1982, Shleien et al
1982). Since then, there have been enough significant advancements related to emergency
planning to warrant updating the recommendations. New scientific information and radiation
protection philosophy are incorporated, experience gained since 1982 is included, and guidance
developed by international organizations is taken into account (Schmidt 1988a, l988b, 1990,
Burnett and Rosenstein 1989).
These recommendations provide guidance applicable to accidents at nuclear power plants and
2

many other types of accidents where a significant radiation dose could be received as a result of
consumption of contaminated food. These recommendations rescind and replace the 1982 FDA
recommendations.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
(a) Applicability.
The recommendations provide guidance to State and local agencies to aid in emergency response
planning and execution of protective actions associated with production, processing, distribution,
and use of human food and animal feeds accidentally contaminated with radionuclides. The
recommendations do not authorize or apply to deliberate releases of radionuclides which are
permitted and limited by general controls and/or terms and conditions stipulated by a regulatory
agency.

1 This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current thinking
on the above. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
2 The term “radiation dose” is used when the intended meaning is general or refers to more
than one specific dose quantity.
3

(b) Scope.
The recommendations advise that health risk to the public be averted by limiting the radiation
dose received as a result of consumption of accidentally contaminated food. This will be
accomplished by: (1) setting limits, called Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) on the
radionuclide activity concentration (concentration) permitted in human food, and (2) taking
protective actions to reduce the amount of contamination.
DILs are limits on the concentrations permitted in human food distributed in commerce. They
are established to prevent consumption of undesirable amounts of radionuclides and have units
of radionuclide activity per kilogram of food, i.e. becquerels per kilogram, Bq/kg (previously
3

used units - picocuries per kilogram, pCi/kg) . Comparable limits were not provided in the 1982
FDA recommendations. DILs apply during the first year after an accident. If there is concern that
food will continue to be significantly contaminated beyond the first year, the long-term
circumstances need to be evaluated to determine whether the DILs should be continued or if
other guidance may be more applicable.
Protective actions would be initiated subject to evaluation of the situation and would continue
until, in the absence of the actions, the concentrations remain below the DILs. Protective actions
can be taken to:
•

avoid or limit, through precautionary measures, the amount of contamination that could

become incorporated in human food and animal feeds, or
•

delay or limit consumption of human food and animal feeds suspected of being contaminated

until the concentration of contamination has been determined, or
•

reduce the amount of contamination in human food and animal feeds.

Limits on concentrations permitted in animal feeds are not given in these recommendations.
However, protective actions for animal feeds are included as measures to reduce or prevent
subsequent contamination of human food.
PROTECTIVE ACTION GUIDES
The 1982 FDA recommendations established two levels of Protective Action Guides (PAGs).
PAGs were defined as “projected dose commitment values to individuals in the general
population that warrant protective action following a release of radioactive material.” The lower
level, called the Preventive PAG, was a projected dose commitment of 5 mSv (0.5 rem) to the
whole body, active bone marrow, or any other organ except the thyroid, or a projected dose
commitment of 15 mSv (1.5 rem) to the thyroid. The Preventive PAG was associated with lowimpact protective actions (e.g. placing dairy cows on stored feed). The upper level, called the
Emergency PAG, was a projected dose commitment of 50 mSv (5 rem) to the whole body, active
bone marrow, or any other organ except the thyroid, or a projected dose commitment of
150 mSv (15 rem) to the thyroid. The Emergency PAG was associated with higher-impact
protective actions (e.g., diversion of fresh milk to cheese or milk powder).
The 1982 FDA recommendations were developed from the prevailing scientific understanding of
the relative risks associated with radiation as described in the 1960 and 1961 reports of the
Federal Radiation Council (FRC 1960, 1961). Since 1982, FDA and the other federal agencies in
the United States have adopted the methodology and terminology for expressing radiation doses
provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) in 1977 (ICRP
1977, ICRP l984a, EPA 1987). The ICRP’s dose quantities for radiation protection purposes
include effective dose equivalent, committed effective dose equivalent, dose equivalent for a
4,5

specific tissue, and committed dose equivalent for a specific tissue .
___________________________________________________________________
4
See Appendix A (Glossary) for explanation of these dose quantities and their use in this
document.
5
The ICRP adopted new recommendations in 1990, which include revisions in its
methodology and terminology for expressing radiation doses and the relative risks associated
with irradiation of specific organs (ICRP l991a). There is not yet consensus among the federal
agencies on the use of these changes.
5

These current recommendations replace the Preventive and Emergency PAGs with one set of
PAGs for the ingestion pathway. The PAGs are 5 mSv (0.5 rem) for committed effective dose
equivalent or 50 mSv (5 rem) committed dose equivalent to an individual tissue or organ,
whichever is more limiting. These correspond to the “intervention levels of dose” consensus
values set by international organizations (see Appendix B). Intervention levels of dose are
radiation doses at which introduction of protective actions should be considered (ICRP 1984b).
The FDA guidance retains use of the term Protection Action Guide (PAG) for consistency with
U.S. federal and state needs.
The current nominal estimate for the general population for lifetime total cancer mortality for
low-LET (linear energy transfer) ionizing radiation, delivered at low doses and low dose rates, is
-3

4.5 x 10 for a reference dose equivalent in the whole body of 100 mSv (10 rem) (CIRRPC
1992). For 5 mSv (0.5 rem) committed effective dose equivalent (the recommended PAG) the
-4

6

associated lifetime total cancer mortality would be 2.25 x l0 or approximately 1 in 4400. For
comparison, the estimate of the normal lifetime total cancer mortality in the United States for the
general population, not associated with additional radiation dose from ingestion of contaminated
food from an accident, is 0.19 or approximately 1 in 5 (CIRRPC 1992). For example, in a
general population of 10,000 individuals, each receiving a committed effective dose equivalent
of 5 mSv (0.5 rem), the number of cancer deaths over the lifetimes of the individuals could
increase in theory by about 2 cancer deaths, that is from the normal number of 1900 to 1902.
The numerical estimate of cancer deaths presented above for the recommended PAG of 5 mSv
(0.5 rem) was obtained by the practice of linear extrapolation from the nominal risk estimate for
lifetime total cancer mortality for the general population at 100 mSv (10 rem) dose equivalent in
the whole body. Other methods of extrapolation to the low-dose region could yield higher or
___________________________________________________________________
6
The alternate PAG of 50 mSv (5 rem) committed dose equivalent to a specific tissue or organ is
always associated with a lifetime cancer mortality for the specific tissue that is as limiting or in
some cases more limiting than the lifetime total cancer mortality associated with the PAG of 5
mSv (0.5 rem) for committed effective dose equivalent.
6

lower numerical estimates of cancer deaths. Studies of human populations exposed at low doses
are inadequate to demonstrate the actual magnitude of risk. There is scientific uncertainty about
cancer risk in the low-dose region below the range of epidemiological observation, and the
possibility of no risk cannot be excluded (CIRRPC 1992).
DERIVED INTERVENTION LEVELS
A DIL corresponds to the concentration in food present throughout the relevant period of time
that, in the absence of any intervention, could lead to an individual receiving a radiation dose
equal to the PAG, or in international terms, the intervention level of dose. The equation given
7

below is the basic formula for computing DILs.

DIL (Bq/kg)

=

PAG (mSv)
________________________________
f x Food Intake (kg) x DC (mSv/Bq)

Where:
DC

= Dose coefficient; the radiation dose received
per unit of activity ingested (mSv/Bq).

f

= Fraction of the food intake assumed to be contaminated.

Food Intake

= Quantity of food consumed in an appropriate period of time (kg).

The FDA DILs provide a large margin of safety for the public because each DIL is set according
to a conservatively safe scenario for the most vulnerable group of individuals (see Appendix D).
In addition, protective action would be taken if radionuclide concentrations were to reach or
exceed a DIL at any point in time, even though such concentrations would need to be sustained
throughout the relevant extended period of time for the radiation dose to actually reach the PAG.
In practice, when FDA DILs are used, radiation doses to the vast majority of the affected public
would be very small fractions of the PAG. As a result, future adjustments in the absolute values
___________________________________________________________________
7
In the previous system of units DIL would be in units of pCi/kg, intervention level of dose in
units of mrem and DCs in units of mrem/pCi.

7

of the PAGs would not necessarily require proportionate modifications in the DILs. Any
modification of the DILs would depend on a review of all aspects of the conservatively safe
scenario and how the DILs are applied.
Food with concentrations below the DILs is permitted to move in commerce without restriction.
Food with concentrations at or above the DILs is not normally permitted into commerce.
However, State and local officials have flexibility in whether or not to apply restrictions in
special circumstances, such as permitting use of food by a population group with a unique
dependency on certain food types.
(a) Use of Derived Intervention Levels for Food Monitoring after the Chernobyl Accident
Developments in the U.S.
Following the Chernobyl accident in 1986, a task group of representatives from FDA and the
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture
established DILs for application to imported foods under their respective regulatory control. The
FDA DILs were called “Levels of Concern” (LOCs) (FDA l986a, 1986b) and the FSIS DILs
were called “Screening Values.” Food containing concentrations below the LOCs and Screening
Values was allowed to be imported into the U.S.
FDA LOCs were derived from the 1982 Preventive PAGs and used the following assumptions:
• the entire intake of food would be contaminated,
• I-131 could be a major source of radiation dose for only 60 days following the accident
• Cs-134 + Cs-l37 could be a major source of radiation dose for up to one year.
The LOCs provided such a large margin of safety that derivation of LOCs for other
radionuclides, judged to be of less health significance, was considered unnecessary.
The FSIS Screening Value for I-131 was the same as the FDA LOC for I-131 in infant foods.
The FSIS Screening Value for Cs-l34 + Cs-137 initially differed from the FDA LOC because the
8

FSIS assumed that only meat and poultry (not 100% of the diet) would be contaminated (USDA
1986a). In November 1986, the FSIS changed the Screening Value for Cs-134 + Cs-137 to be the
same as the FDA LOC (USDA 1986b, Engel et al 1989). The FDA and FSIS DILs for the
Chernobyl accident contamination in imported food after November 1986 are given in Table 1.

The food monitoring results from FDA and others following the Chernobyl accident support the
conclusion that I-131, Cs-134 and Cs-137 are the principal radionuclides that contribute to
radiation dose by ingestion following a nuclear reactor accident, but that Ru-103 and Ru-l06 also
should be included (see Appendix C). Also, use of DILs was shown to be a practical way to
control the radiation dose from ingestion of food that has been contaminated as a result of a
nuclear reactor accident.
International Activities
Efforts by international organizations to develop DILs have been extensive. Derivations have
been based on the consensus value for the intervention level of dose, and have been for
application within individual countries and in international trade. Each of the various
international organizations selected values for the components in the basic formula for
computing DILs, and each introduced additional judgments to arrive at its recommended DILs.
As a result, the DILs recommended by the various organizations differed. The DILs adopted by
the Commission of European Communities (CEC) for use in future accidents and those adopted

9

8

by the Codex Alimentarius (CODEX) for use in international trade are presented in Appendix F.
(b) Recommended Derived Intervention Levels
In these recommendations, FDA uses the term Derived Intervention Level (DIL), which is
consistent with international usage. DIL is equivalent to, and replaces the previous FDA term
Level of Concern (LOC).
The recommended DILs are for radionuclides expected to deliver the major portion of the
radiation dose from ingestion during the first year following an accident. The DILs are for
accidental releases of radionuclides from large nuclear reactors and for other radiological
emergencies where there is a possibility of accidental radioactive contamination of human food.
The approach provides the flexibility necessary to respond to special circumstances that may be
unique to a particular accident. A summary of the considerations in selecting DILs is given in
this section, with a more detailed explanation available in Appendix D.
The types of accidents and the principal radionuclides for which the DILs were developed are:
• nuclear reactors (I-131; Cs-134 + Cs-l37; Ru-l03 + Ru-106),
• nuclear fuel reprocessing plants (Sr-90; Cs-137; Pu-239 + Am-241),
• nuclear waste storage facilities (Sr-90; Cs-137; Pu-239 + Am-241),
• nuclear weapons (i.e., dispersal of nuclear material without nuclear detonation) (Pu-239)
• radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heater units (RHUs)
used in space vehicles (Pu-238)
The radionuclides listed are expected to be the predominant contributors to radiation dose
9

through ingestion. Several radionuclides could be released by an accident at a nuclear
___________________________________________________________________
8
An application of the CODEX DILs can be found in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s
(IAEA) interim edition of its basic safety standards for protection against ionizing radiation
(IAEA 1994). IAEA based its “generic action levels for foodstuffs,” found in Schedule V of
IAEA 1994, on CODEX DILs.

reactor, a nuclear fuel processing plant or a nuclear waste storage facility, while only the specific
radionuclide used in a nuclear weapon or a space vehicle would be released in that type of
accident. When more than one radionuclide is released, the relative contribution that a
radionuclide makes to radiation dose from ingestion of subsequently contaminated food depends
on the specifics of the accident and the mode of release (NRC 1975, DOE 1989, EPA 1977).
In unique circumstances, such as transportation accidents, other radionuclides may contribute
radiation doses through the food ingestion pathway. These situations are not specifically treated
in these recommendations. An evaluation of the radiation dose from ingestion of these other
radionuclides should be performed, however, to determine if the PAGs would be exceeded. FDA
should be notified during such an evaluation.
DILs were calculated for the nine radionuclides noted above. For each radionuclide, DILs were
calculated for six age groups using Protective Action Guides, dose coefficients, and dietary
intakes relevant to each radionuclide and age group. The age groups included 3 months, 1 year, 5
years, 10 years, 15 years and adult (>17 years). The dose coefficients used were from ICRP
Publication 56 (ICRP 1989).
10

The DILs were based on the entire diet for each age group, not for individual foods or food
groups. The calculation presumed that contamination would occur in thirty percent of the dietary
intake. The value of thirty percent was based on the expectation that normally less than ten
percent of the annual dietary intake of most members of the population would consist of
contaminated food. An additional factor of three was applied to account for limited subpopulations that might be more dependent on local food supplies. An exception was made for I131 in the diets of the 3-month and 1-year age groups, where the entire intake over a sixty-day
period was assumed to be contaminated.
___________________________________________________________________
10
The “entire diet” includes tap water used for drinking.

11

The nine radionuclides comprised five radionuclide groups, each having common characteristics.
The five groups are: Sr-90; I-131; Cs-l34 + Cs-137; Ru-103 + Ru-l06; and Pu-238 + Pu-239 +
Am-24l. An accident could involve more than one of the five groups.
Protection of the more vulnerable segments of the population and the practicality of
implementation were major considerations in the selection of the recommendations. These
considerations lead to the single DIL or the single criterion for each radionuclide group that is
presented in Table 2, based on the most limiting Protective Action Guide (PAG) and age group
11

for the radionuclide group.

The recommended DILs may be applied immediately following an accident. Early identification
of other radionuclides that may be present in food is not required. However, the recommended
DILs should be evaluated as soon as possible after an accident to ensure that they are appropriate
for the situation. Appendix E presents a discussion on DILs for a number of other radionuclides
that could be released from the reactor core of a nuclear power plant.
(c) Imported or Exported Food
The LOCs that applied to radioactive contamination from the Chernobyl accident in imported
foods subject to FDA authority were given in an FDA Compliance Policy Guide (FDA 1986b).
This guidance remains in effect and would be reviewed and modified as necessary to respond to
any future accident resulting in radioactive contamination of imported food.
Food exported from the United States is controlled by standards, regulations and guidance in the
importing countries. Two examples of guidance applicable to accidentally contaminated foods
exported from the United States are the guidelines issued by the CODEX Alimentarius
Commission of the Joint FAO/WHO Food Standards Program and the regulations adopted by the

The PAG of 5 mSv (0.5 rem) for committed effective dose equivalent was most limiting for
Cs-l34 + Cs-137 and Ru-l03 + Ru-l06; the PAG of 50 mSv (5 rem) for committed dose
equivalent to a single specific tissue or organ was most limiting for Sr-90, I-131 and Pu-238 + Pu

Notes:
(a) The DIL for each radionuclide group is applied independently (see discussion in Appendix D). Each DIL
applies to the sum of the concentrations of the radionuclides in the group at the time of measurement.
(b) Applicable to foods as prepared for consumption. For dried or concentrated products such as powdered milk
or concentrated juices, adjust by a factor appropriate to reconstitution, and assume the reconstitution water
is not contaminated. For spices, which are consumed in very small quantities, use a dilution factor of 10.
(C) Due to the large difference in DILs for Ru-l03 and Ru-106, the individual concentrations of Ru-103 and Ru106 are divided by their respective DILs and then summed. The sum must be less than one. C3 and C6 are
the concentrations, at the time of measurement, for Ru-103 and Ru-106, respectively (see discussion in
Appendix D).

PROTECTIVE ACTIONS
Protective actions are steps taken to limit the radiation dose from ingestion by avoiding or
reducing the contamination that could occur on the surface of, or be incorporated into, human
food and animal feeds. Such actions can be taken prior to and/or after confirmation of
contamination. The protective actions for a specific accident are determined by the particulars of

13

the situation and once initiated they continue at least until the concentrations are expected to
remain below the DILs.
For contamination events not effectively managed using DILs, protective actions appropriate to
the situation would still be established and applied by the responsible officials. For example, in
1988 FDA developed guidance for use in responding to a contamination event that could have
occurred from an uncontrolled reentry of the Russian satellite Cosmos 1900. FDA issued an
advisory which specified protective actions against contamination in the form of widely but
sparsely distributed discrete radioactive particulates and large pieces of radioactive debris (FDA
1988). The uncontrolled reentry of Cosmos 1900 did not occur.
(a) Protective Actions Prior to Confirmation of Contamination
Protective actions which can be taken within the area likely to be affected and prior to
confirmation of contamination consist of:
• simple precautionary actions to avoid or reduce the potential for contamination of food and
animal feeds, and
• temporary embargoes to prevent the introduction into commerce of food which is likely to
be contaminated.
Protective actions can be taken before the release or arrival of contamination if there is advance
knowledge that radionuclides may accidentally contaminate the environment.
For some types of accidents, determination of when and what protective actions would be taken
may be facilitated by associating them with the accident classifications designated by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or the Department of Energy (DOE). For accidents
involving commercial nuclear power reactors, the NRC has established four emergency classes:
Notification of Unusual Event, Alert, Site Area Emergency, and General Emergency. Criteria for
declaring these classes were published by the NRC (NRC 1980, 1991).

14

For accidents at DOE facilities, the DOE has established three emergency classes: Alert, Site
Area Emergency, and General Emergency. These classes are comparable to those established by
NRC. Incidents considered as Unusual Events by NRC licensees are covered as Unusual
Occurrences by DOE (DOE 1992)
Simple precautionary actions include modest adjustment of normal operations prior to arrival of
contamination. These will not guarantee contamination in food will be below the DILS but the
severity of the forthcoming problem would be significantly reduced. Typical precautionary
actions include covering exposed products, moving animals to shelter, corralling livestock and
providing protected feed and water.
Precautionary actions should be implemented so as to avoid placing in jeopardy persons
implementing the action. For example, in the case of an accident involving a commercial nuclear
power plant, if the predictions of the magnitude of future off-site contamination are persuasive,
precautionary actions that could be taken and completed before a declaration of Site Area
Emergency or General Emergency could be considered. However, precautionary actions that
would involve persons either not seeking shelter or leaving the immediate vicinity of shelter
should not be taken after declaration of a Site Area Emergency or General Emergency. A
temporary embargo on food and agricultural products (including animal feeds) prevents the
consumption of food that is likely to be contaminated. Distribution and use of possibly
contaminated food and animal feeds is halted until the situation can be evaluated and monitoring
and control actions instituted. Temporary embargoes are applied when the concentrations are not
yet known. Because there is potential for negative impact on the community, justification for this
action must be significant. The embargo should remain in effect at least until results are
obtained. For nuclear power plants, a temporary embargo should be issued only upon declaration
of a General Emergency and if predictions of the extent and magnitude of the off-site
contamination are persuasive. The geographical area under control by the embargo would
depend on the accident sequence, the meteorological conditions, and the food affected.
(b) Protective Actions for Foods Confirmed to be Contaminated

15

Protective actions which should be implemented when the contamination in food equals or
exceeds the DILs consist of:
• temporary embargoes to prevent the contaminated food from being introduced into
commerce,
• normal food production and processing actions that reduce the amount of contamination in
or on food to below the DILs.
A temporary embargo to prevent the introduction into commerce of food from a contaminated
area should be considered when the amount of contamination equals or exceeds the DILs or
when the presence of contamination is confirmed, but the concentrations are not yet known. The
temporary embargo would continue until measurements confirm that concentrations are below
the DILs.
Normal food production and processing procedures that could reduce the amount of radioactive
contamination in or on the food could be simple, (such as holding to allow for radioactive decay,
or removal of surface contamination by brushing, washing, or peeling) or could be complex
(Grauby and Luykx 1990, FDA 1982, USDA 1989). The blending of contaminated food with
uncontaminated food is not permitted because this is a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (FDA 1991).
Protective actions focus on the specific foods having the greatest sources of radiation dose to the
population. Factors that determine which foods are most significant include the agricultural
practices in the area of contamination and the stage of the growing or harvest season at the time
of the accident. In general, foods consumed fresh, such as milk, leafy vegetables, and fruit, are
initially most important. Grains, root crops, other produce, and animal-derived food products are
significant later as they come to market.
Specific protective actions to be implemented following an accident are not provided in these
recommendations because there is such a wide variety of actions that could be taken. The
protective actions would be determined by state and local officials with assistance from the
growers, producers, and manufacturers.
16

(c) Protective Actions for Animal Feeds Confirmed as Contaminated
Protective actions to reduce the impact of contamination in or on animal feeds, including pasture
and water, should also be taken on a case-by-case basis. Accurately forecasting the transfer of
radioactive contamination through the agricultural pathway, from animal feed to human food, is
problematic. The forecast is influenced by many factors, such as: the type of feed (e.g., fresh
pasture, grain), other intakes (e.g., other feeds, supplements), the chemical form of the
radionuclide, medications being administered, the animal species, and the type of resulting
human food (e.g., milk, meat, eggs).
Protective actions that could be taken when animal feeds are contaminated include the
substitution of uncontaminated water for contaminated water and the removal of lactating dairy
animals and meat animals from contaminated feeds and pasture with substitution of
uncontaminated feed. Corralling livestock in an uncontaminated area could also be effective. The
protective actions would be determined by State and local officials, with assistance from
growers, producers, and manufacturers.

APPENDIX B - INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON INTERVENTION LEVELS OF
DOSE
In 1984, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended basic
principles for planning intervention in the event of major radiation accidents and provided
general guidance on radiation dose levels for the implementation of countermeasures (ICRP
1984b). The term “intervention level of dose” is used by ICRP for these dose levels. The ICRP
guidance indicated that for any countermeasure there is a lower level of radiation dose below
which the introduction of the countermeasure is unlikely to be warranted, an upper level of
radiation dose above which the countermeasure should almost certainly be implemented, and
when between these levels, the specifics of the situation determine which actions (if any) would
14

be taken. For the control of food, ICRP indicated lower and upper levels of 5 mSv and 50 mSv,
respectively, for committed effective dose equivalent and 50 mSv and 500 mSv, respectively, for
committed dose equivalent to an individual organ or tissue (ICRP l984b, ICRP 1977).
Since 1984, a number of international organizations have provided guidance dealing with the
ingestion of radionuclides that was consistent with the ICRP guidance. These organizations
included the Commission of the European Communities (CEC), the Codex Alimentarius
Commission (CODEX), the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO),
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Nuclear Energy Agency of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (NEA), and the World Health
Organization (WHO). All have adopted 5 mSv committed effective dose equivalent as the
radiation dose level above which intervention was recommended (CODEX 1989, FAO 1987,
IAEA 1986, Luykx 1989, NEA 1989, Waight 1988, WHO 1988). All except CODEX also
adopted 50 mSv committed dose equivalent to an individual tissue or organ when that value is
more limiting.

Glossary, for equivalence to units used in previous FDA guidance.

21

The ICRP has updated its general concepts on intervention in its Publication 60 (ICRP 1991a).
Additional advice for intervention for protection of the public was provided in its Publication 63
(ICRP 1991b). The additional advice included an intervention level of averted dose (10 mSv
15

effective dose in a year) for restriction of a single foodstuff. ICRP considered this level
appropriate for almost all cases, excepting when alternative food supplies are not available or
population groups might suffer serious disruption of their food supply.
The ICRP approach recommended that in application of this intervention level of averted dose,
the net benefit of withdrawing a particular foodstuff be made optimum, based on knowledge of
the local situation and other assumptions about the monetary value assigned to the effective dose.
The ICRP provided an example of how to evaluate the optimum. Such a procedure requires
information that would not be available during the early phases of an accident.
The FDA uses the principles in the general guidance provided by ICRP in 1984 for the
immediate response to a major radiation accident, recognizing that at later stages, after the local
situation is stabilized and more clearly defined, the longer-term intervention for food can be
modified based on more detailed evaluation of local conditions by local authorities. Therefore,
the PAGs for the ingestion pathway at the onset of an accident are 5 mSv committed effective
dose equivalent or 50 mSv committed dose equivalent to an individual tissue or organ,
whichever is more limiting.

Effective dose is the ICRP’s revised formulation of effective dose equivalent, as described in
its 1990 recommendations (ICRP 1991a)

APPENDIX C - RADIONUCLIDES DETECTED IN FOOD FOLLOWING THE
CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENT OF APRIL 1986
(a) Analyses of Imported Food by the United States and Canada
(1) I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-l37
Shortly after the accident at Chernobyl on April 26, 1986, the FDA and FSIS of the USDA began
sampling imported food for analysis to determine radionuclide activity concentrations.
Regulatory actions were based on FDA Levels of Concern (LOCs) and the FSIS Screening
Levels which were developed in 1986 and applied to I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-137.
The regulatory results of FDA and FSIS import monitoring and analyses are summarized in
16

Table C-1 . The radionuclide activity concentrations (concentrations) exceeded the FDA LOCs
(Cunningham et al 1992) in 23 out of 2,600 (0.9%) food samples, and exceeded the FSIS
Screening Values (equal to the LOCs) (Engel et al 1989, Randecker 1990) in 107 out of 6,295
(1.7%) meat and poultry samples. In general, Cs-134 and Cs-137 were the principal
radionuclides detected by FDA and FSIS in the imported foods analyzed. I-131 was significant
for only about two months. Cs-134 and Cs-l37 were also the dominant radionuclides in imported
foods analyzed by Canada (NHW 1987). The European countries of the Nuclear Energy Agency
(NEA) also found that I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-137 contributed most of the radiation dose from
radionuclides ingested with food contaminated by the Chernobyl accident (NEA 1987, NEA
1989).
(2) Radionuclides Other Than I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-l37
In addition to the radionuclides used for regulatory actions (I-131, Cs-134 + Cs-137), a number
of other radionuclides were detected in imported food entering the U. S. and Canada. Of these,
___________________________________________________________________

The International System of Units is used throughout the document. See Appendix A,
Glossary, for equivalence to units used in previous FDA guidance.

23

the most commonly detected radionuclides were Ru-103, Ru-l06, Ba-140, Sr-90, Ce-l44 and Zr95. The results of FDA and Canadian import sampling for the latter radionuclides are
summarized in Table C-2. The data supported the prediction that I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-l37
were the most significant radionuclides for screening of imported foods, and that the other
radionuclides were of significantly less importance.
During 1986, of about 500 imported samples monitored by FDA, Ru-l03 and Ru-106 were above
the detection levels for 18 samples and Ba-140 was above the detection levels in 9 samples
(Cunningham et al 1992). These radionuclides were not detected after 1986. Only selected
samples were analyzed for Sr-90. Two samples, containing relatively high amounts of Cs-134 +
Cs-137 were analyzed for Sr-90 in 1986. In the following years, a total of 40 samples (those
having Cs-134 + Cs-137 in excess of 110 Bq/kg) were analyzed for Sr-90. The Sr-90 was above
the detection levels in all 42 samples.
For Canadian imported foods, Ru-103 was above detection levels in 46 of 840 samples analyzed
during 1986 and 1987, and below detection levels in all samples analyzed later. Ru-l06 was
above detection levels in 130 of 936 samples analyzed from 1986 through 1989 (Marshall 1992).
Samples were analyzed for Ce-144 and Zr-95 from 1987 through 1989. Out of 486 samples, Ce144 was above detection levels in 88 samples and Zr-95 was above detection levels in 3 samples.
Concentrations in FDA and Canadian imported samples were generally below 10% of the
respective Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) given in Appendices D and E. The main
exceptions were for Ru-106 in Canadian samples which ranged up to 42% of the DIL.
The results of analysis for imported samples collected by the U.S. and Canada are representative
of collections distant from the accident site. Therefore, not only was the food variety relatively
limited, but time delays between accident and sample collection, processing effects, and selective
screening that exporters may have applied could have influenced the findings. Consequently,
findings from samples collected at countries close to Chernobyl are most useful for U.S.
decision-makers responding to a domestic release because these findings are more representative
of a local contamination event.

24

(b) Analyses of Foods Collected Locally at Central and Eastern European Countries
In 1986, FDA received a variety of foods collected locally by United States Embassy staff in
Central and Eastern European countries. A total of 48 samples from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
Finland, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Yugoslavia, were analyzed. Results for Ru-103,
Ru-106, and Ba-140 are summarized in Table C-3. The number of samples above detection
levels for each radionuclide is given with the ranges of associated percentages relative to the
DILs. I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-l37 (not shown) were also detected in most of the samples. I-131
concentrations exceeded the DIL for 27 samples; while Cs-134 + Cs-137 exceeded the DIL for 2
samples.
Most of the 48 embassy samples were fresh vegetables. The edible portions were leafy for 28
samples and roots, bulbs, shoots, or seedlings for 12 samples. Ru-103 was above detection levels
in all vegetables, exceeding its DIL for 6 samples. Ru-106 was above detection levels in all
vegetables, exceeding its DIL for 14 samples. Ba-140 was above detection levels in 19, but did
not exceed its DIL in any vegetables (maximum, 6.3% of DIL).
Other samples included 3 fresh fruit and 5 processed foods (cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and 2
milk samples). Ru-106 was above detection levels in all fruit (maximum, 14% of DIL) and in 2
processed foods (maximum, 29% of DIL). Ru-103 and Ba-140 were above detection levels but
did not exceed 2% of their DILs in the fruit or processed food samples.
In September 1986, 28 samples of spices from Turkey and Greece (not offered for import) were
provided by the American Spice Trade Association (ASTA) for testing by FDA. This set of
samples represented deposition at a distance comparable to many of the Eastern European
embassy samples but were analyzed at a later time after the accident. FDA analyzed spices for
gamma-ray emitting radionuclides and Sr-90. Findings are included in Table C-3. Following the
advice of CEC (CEC 1989a) and CODEX (CODEX 1989) for minor foods, a dilution factor of
ten was applied to the concentrations for herbs, spices and flavorings, because they will be
consumed in very small quantities.

25

Cs-l34 + Cs-l37 (not shown in Table C-3), Ru-103, Ru-106, and Sr-90 were above detection
levels in all samples. I-131 and Ba-140 were below detection levels having undergone ten or
more half-lives of radioactive decay.
Ru-103, having decayed for over four half-lives, ranged to a maximum of only 4.5% of its DIL
while Sr-90, though having decayed very little, reached 10% of the DIL in only 8 samples
(maximum, 30% of DIL). Ru-106 exceeded its DIL in 2 samples, was 50% to 100% in 5, and
10% to 50% in another 17.
(c) Conclusions
The results support the expectation that concentrations of I-131 and Cs-134 + Cs-137 would
serve as the main indicators of the need for protective actions for imported and local food.
However, concentrations of Ru-l06 were consistently in excess or at a significant fraction of the
DIL, which suggests that Ru-106 should also serve as an indicator, i.e. be included as a principal
radionuclide for nuclear reactor incidents.
Also, for local samples of fresh vegetables harvested during the first week of the incident, half of
the samples had Ru-103 concentrations a significant fraction of the DIL and another quarter of
the samples had Ru-103 concentrations in excess of the DIL. Consequently, it would be prudent
to consider Ru-103 as a principal radionuclide for local deposition, particularly in the early phase
of a nuclear reactor incident.
Sr-90 did not exceed 11% of the DIL in imported food (Table C-2). For the series of 28 local
(ASTA) spice samples (Table C-3), Sr-90 was less than 30% of its DIL (generally a lower
percent of the DIL than found for Ru-106 or Cs-134 + Cs-137). Also, the analytical method for
determination of Sr-90 in food is lengthy compared to analysis for the gamma-ray emitting
radionuclides, such that protective actions based on the concentration of Sr-90 could not be taken
in a timely manner. Therefore, Sr-90 would not be an effective indicator of the need for
protective actions in the early phase of a nuclear reactor incident.

26

During the first year after an accident, concentrations in local or imported food other than for I131, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ru-l03 and Ru-106 are expected to be significant only when one or more
of these principal radionuclides has exceeded its DIL. Therefore, the food would already have
been subject to protective action.

APPENDIX D - DERIVATION OF RECOMMENDED DERIVED INTERVENTION LEVELS
The Derived Intervention Level (DIL) for a specific radionuclide is calculated as follows:
PAG (mSv)
DIL (Bq/kg) =
f x Food Intake (kg) x DC (mSv/Bq)
Where:

DIL

= Derived Intervention Level

PAG

= Protective Action Guide

DC

= Dose coefficient

Food Intake

= Quantity of food consumed in an appropriate period of time

f

= Fraction of food intake assumed to be contaminated
17

The recommended Protective Action Guides (PAGs) are 5 mSv committed effective dose
equivalent, or 50 mSv committed dose equivalent to individual tissues and organs, whichever is
more limiting. These PAGs are consistent with the consensus of international organizations on
the levels of radiation dose below which ingestion pathway interventions are generally not
appropriate (see Appendix B).
Dose coefficients (DCs) are given in Table D-l and food intakes are given in Tables D-2 and D3. The fraction of food intake assumed to be contaminated (f) equals 0.3, except for I-131 in
infant diets where f equals 1.0.
(a) Radionuclides
Based upon data on radionuclides in human food following the Chernobyl accident, DILs for I131, Cs-134, Cs-137, Ru-103 and Ru-106 would facilitate application of food monitoring
programs following accidents involving nuclear reactors. For accidents at nuclear fuel
___________________________________________________________________
17
The International System of Units is used throughout the document. See Appendix A,
Glossary, for equivalence to units used in previous FDA guidance.

30

reprocessing facilities and nuclear waste storage facilities, DILs for Sr-90, Cs-137, Pu-239, and
Am-241 would be used. For nuclear weapons accidents and accidents involving radioisotope
thermal generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heater units (RHUs) used in space vehicles, DILs
for Pu-239 and Pu-238, respectively, would be used. The selection of these radionuclides as the
major contributors to radiation dose through ingestion is consistent with recommendations on
DILs published by NEA, WHO, CODEX, and CEC (NEA 1989, WHO 1988, CODEX 1989,
CEC 1989b, IAEA 1994).
(b) Age Groups and Dose Coefficients (DCs)
The general population was divided into six age groups ranging from infants to adults and
corresponding to the age groups in ICRP Publication 56 (ICRP 1989) for which ICRP has
published DCs. The age groups are 3 months, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and adult. The
radionuclides, age groups and dose coefficients used in the calculations are presented in Table
D-l.
(C) Food Intake
Food intake included all dietary components including tap water used for drinking, and is the
overall quantity consumed in one year, with exceptions in the period of time for I-131 (T1/2 =
8.04 days) and Ru-103 (T1/2 = 39.3 days). For these, the quantities consumed were for a 60-day
period and a 280-day period, respectively, due to the more rapid decay of these radionuclides.
The intake periods for I-131 and Ru-103 are the nearest whole number of days for decay of these
radionuclides to less than 1% of the initial activities.
Dietary intakes were derived from a 1984 EPA report which presented average daily food intake
by age and sex (EPA 1984a, EPA 1984b). The EPA intakes were based on data from the
1977-1978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey published by the U. S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA 1982, USDA 1983). The age groups and annual dietary intakes for various
food classes and the total, calculated from data in the EPA report, are given in Table D-2.

31

The dietary intakes derived for the ICRP age groups for which DCs are available, using the
results in Table D-2, are presented in Table D-3.
(d) Fractions of Food Intake Assumed to be Contaminated (f)
For food consumed by most members of the general public, ten percent of the dietary intakes
was assumed to be contaminated. This assumption recognizes the ready availability of
uncontaminated food from unaffected areas of the United States or through importation from
other countries, and also that many factors could reduce or eliminate contamination of local food
18

by the time it reaches the market .
Use of ten percent of the dietary intake as the portion contaminated was consistent with
recommendations made by a Group of Experts to the Commission of the European Communities
(CEC 1986a) and by the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (NEA 1989). The NEA noted that modification of this value
would be appropriate if justified by detailed local findings.
FDA applied an additional factor of three to account for the fact that sub-populations might be
more dependent on local food supplies. Therefore, during the immediate period after a nuclear
accident, a value of 0.3 (i.e., thirty percent) is the fraction of food intake that FDA recommends
should be presumed to be contaminated. If, subsequently, there is convincing local information
that the actual fraction of food intake that is contaminated (f) is considerably higher or lower,
there will be adequate time for State and local officials to determine whether to adjust the value
of f (and therefore adjust the values of the DILs) for the affected area.
For infants, (i.e., the 3-month and 1-year age groups) the diet consists of a high percentage of
milk and the entire milk intake of some infants over a short period of time might come from
supplies directly impacted by an accident. Therefore, f was set equal to 1.0 (100%) for the infant
diet.
___________________________________________________________________
18
In most situations, one would expect less than ten percent of the dietary intakes to be
contaminated.

32

(e) Selection of Recommended Derived Intervention Levels
DILs are presented in Table D-4 for Sr-90, I-131, Cs-134, Cs-l37, Ru-103, Ru-106, Pu-238, Pu239, and Am-241 for six population age groups and applicable PAGs. To facilitate the execution
of food monitoring programs, two criteria were used in selecting FDA’s recommended DILs.
First, the most limiting DIL for either of the applicable PAGs was selected for each of the nine
radionuclides. These DILs are presented in Table D-5 for each of the six age groups. In addition,
the average DIL is presented for the radionuclide group Pu + Am, composed of Pu-238, Pu-239,
and Am-241, and the radionuclide group Cs, composed of Cs-134 + Cs-137. The three
radionuclides in the Pu + Am group deposit on the bone surface and are alpha-particle emitters.
The radionuclides in the Cs group are deposited throughout the body and are beta-particle and
gamma-ray emitters. The average values are recommended for these groups because the
calculated DILs for radionuclides in each group are similar.
The radionuclides Ru-103 and Ru-106 are chemically identical, are deposited throughout the
body, and are beta-particle and gamma-ray emitters. However, their widely differing half lives
(i.e., 39.3 days and 373 days, respectively) result in markedly differing individual DILs which do
not permit simple averaging. Instead, the concentrations of Ru-103 (C3) and Ru-106 (C6) are
19

divided by their respective DILs and are then summed . The sum must be less than one.

Therefore,

C3
DIL3

+

C6

< 1.0

(equation D-1)

DIL6

This assures that the sum of the separate radiation dose contributions from the Ru-l03 and Ru-l06
concentrations will be less than that required by the Protective Action Guide during the first year
after an accident.
___________________________________________________________________
19 Laboratories that are not equipped to resolve separately the concentrations for Ru-103 and Ru106 should contact FDA for alternate procedures.

33

Second, there are dietary components which are common to all six age groups. A principal
example is fresh milk, for which the consumer of particular supplies cannot be identified in
advance. Therefore, the most limiting DIL for all age groups in Table D-5, for each radionuclide
or radionuclide group, was selected and is applicable to all components of the diet.
These DILs are presented in Table D-6 and were rounded to two significant figures (one
significant figure for the Pu + Am group). These are the FDA’s recommended DILs.
The DILs in Table D-6 apply independently to each radionuclide or radionuclide group, because
they apply to different types of accidents, or in the case of a nuclear reactor accident, to different
limiting age groups. However, the DILs for Ru-103 and Ru-106 are used in equation D-l to
evaluate that criterion for the radionuclide group Ru-103 + Ru-106.
The FDA recommended DILs in Table D-6 are given in Table 2 in the main text, along with
clarifying notes on application of the DILs.

APPENDIX E - DERIVED INTERVENTION LEVELS FOR OTHER RADIONUCLIDES IN
THE INVENTORY OF THE CORE OF AN OPERATING NUCLEAR REACTOR
After a reactor accident, radionuclides other than the principal radionuclides may also be
detected in the food supply, usually at much lower concentrations (See Appendix C). However,
in the event other radionuclides are present in significant concentrations, this Appendix presents
Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) for a number of other radionuclides commonly found in a
reactor core inventory.
The DILs for fifteen other radionuclides were determined by the same procedure used in
20

Appendix D. The Protective Action Guides were also the same, i.e. 5 mSv committed effective
dose equivalent, or 50 mSv committed dose equivalent to individual tissues and organs.
Age groups and their related food intakes for one year were given previously in Table D-3,
Appendix D. Dietary intakes for seven of the fifteen other radionuclides that have half-lives
much less than one year were computed for the periods of time (i.e. in nearest whole number of
days) required for the radionuclides to decay to less than 1% of the initial activities. Table E-l
and Table E-2 give the relevant data for these seven radionuclides.
Dose coefficients for seven of the fifteen other radionuclides included in this Appendix are
provided in ICRP Publication 56 (ICRP 1989) for all six age groups. For the remaining eight
radionuclides, DCs are available in NRPB Publication GS7 (NRPB 1987), but for only three age
groups, i.e. 1-year, 10-year and adult. The more limited data in NRPB publication GS7 are
supplemented as indicated in the next section.
Fractions of food intake assumed to be contaminated (f) are:
0.3

for all radionuclides except Te-l32, I-133 and Np-239 in infant diets (i.e.,
the 3-month and 1-year age groups);

1.0 for Te-132, I-133 and Np-239 in infant diets.

Glossary, for equivalence to units used in previous FDA guidance.

41

SELECTION OF DERIVED INTERVENTION LEVELS
The dose coefficients in ICRP Publication 56 and NRPB Publication GS7 are for individual
tissues and the effective dose equivalent, as formulated in ICRP Publication 26. ICRP has also
developed dose coefficients for individual tissues and the effective dose, as formulated in ICRP
publication 60. These latter dose coefficients were published in ICRP Publication 67 (ICRP
1993) and ICRP 72 Publication (ICRP 1996) for all six age groups. Review of all these DCs
demonstrated that the trend for relative values of DCs with age for any given radionuclide or for
radionuclides with common biokinetic characteristics and half lives is similar. Therefore, DCs
for the missing 3-month, 5-year, and 15-year age groups were derived for the eight radionuclides
in NRPB Publication GS7, based on the trends observed in the three sets of ICRP tables. Table
E-3 presents the derived DCs for these three age groups and the data from ICRP Publication 67
or 72 used in the derivations. Table E-4 gives the DCs used in computing the DILs for all fifteen
radionuclides presented in Table E-5. DILs have been rounded to two significant figures (except
one significant figure for Np-237 and Cm-244).
In the same manner as for the principal radionuclides in Appendix D, the most limiting Derived
Intervention Level for a radionuclide for either PAG is given in Table E-6 for each age group.
Then, the most limiting DIL for a radionuclide for each age group is presented in Table E-7.
During the immediate period after a nuclear reactor accident, decisions on protective actions for
food may be required and may need to be based on the general status of the facility or the overall
prognosis for worsening conditions. Once food monitoring data is available, the recommended
DILs or criterion for the principal radionuclides I-131, Cs-134 + Cs-l37, and Ru-l03 + Ru-106
recommended in Table 2 of the main text should be used.
The more complex radiochemical or gamma-ray spectrometric analyses for the fifteen other
radionuclides listed in this Appendix would not be generally available. If other radionuclides are
subsequently detected in food, there will be adequate time to review the data on the
concentrations of the other radionuclides to evaluate whether their contributions to radiation dose

42

via ingestion are unexpectedly high, and to determine whether additional radionuclides should be
controlled by their respective DILs in Table E-7. The evaluation takes place with knowledge of
the radiation dose represented by the concentrations of the principal radionuclides, which may
already exceed one or more of their DILs.

(a) The dose coefficients (DCs) derived for age groups not available in NRPB Publication GS7 are indicated in bold font.
(b) The derived DCs were obtained by multiplying the DC for the NRPB age group contiguous to the missing NRPB age group by the following: the ratio of the
DC for the desired age group to the DC of the contiguous age group, from the supporting ICRP data. When there were two contiguous age groups (i.e. for
the 5-year and 15-year age groups), the two resulting DCs for the missing NRPB age groups were averaged.
(c) The dose quantity used is noted for each radionuclide. LLI is lower large intestine, THY is thyroid, BS is bone surface, HE is effective dose equivalent, and
E is effective dose.

available only from NRPB GS7 (NRPB 1987), they were given for only three age groups (i.e. 1 year, 10 years, and adult),and derived for the other three age
groups (see Table E-3). The committed effective dose equivalents or committed dose equivalents are computed to age 70 years.

APPENDIX F - DERIVED INTERVENTION LEVELS ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION
OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES AND THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS
COMMISSION FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE
Foods exported from the U.S. are subject to the criteria used by the importing country, such as
the recommendations of the CODEX Alimentarius Commission (CODEX) or the regulations of
the Commission of the European Communities (CEC). CODEX is operated by the Joint Food
Standards Programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
and World Health Organization (WHO). CODEX develops and recommends standards and other
guidance which are widely used in international trade. CEC regulations govern trade within the
European Economic Community (EEC) and between the EEC and other countries. U.S. food
exporters need to be familiar with the guidance from these organizations.
21

A discussion of CEC and CODEX Derived Intervention Levels (DILs) is given below to
provide insight into their differences.
(a) Commission of The European Communities: DILs for Future Accidents
The CEC adopted regulations in 1987 and 1989, establishing DILs for human food and animal
feeds following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency (CEC 1987,
1989a, 1989b). These were established for use following any future accident and do not apply to
residual contamination from the accident at Chernobyl. DILs addressing radioactive
contamination from the Chernobyl accident were adopted by the CEC in 1986 (CEC 1986b).
The DILs for foods contaminated by future accidents are presented in Table F-l. DILs were given
for four radionuclide groups and four food categories. The radionuclide groups include: isotopes
of strontium, notably Sr-90; isotopes of iodine, notably I-131; alpha-emitting isotopes of
___________________________________________________________________

The International System of Units is used throughout the document. See Appendix A,
Glossary, for equivalence to units used in previous FDA guidance.

49

plutonium and transpiutonium elements, notably Pu-239 and Am-241; and all other radionuclides
of half-life greater than 10 days, notably Cs-134 and Cs-137. For each group, CEC specified
DILs for four food categories: baby foods, dairy produce, other food except minor food, and
liquid foods.
Baby foods were defined as “foodstuffs intended for the feeding of infants during the first four to
six months of life, ... and are put up for sale in packages which are clearly identified and labeled
food preparation for infants”. Dairy produce, liquid food, and minor foods were defined by
reference to specific CEC regulations and nomenclature. Liquid foods included tap water and the
CEC stated the “same values should be applied to drinking water supplies at the discretion of
competent authorities of member states”. Dried products referred to the products as prepared for
consumption. Dilution factors were not specified and the CEC permitted member states to
specify the dilution conditions.
DILs for minor foods such as spices were established, in a separate regulation, at ten times the
DILs specified for “other foods” (CEC 1989a). Each DIL is to be applied independently.
However, for each radionuclide group, the concentrations within the group are to be added when
more than one radionuclide is present. The DILs are to be reviewed within three months
following an accident to determine if they should be continued.
(b) CODEX Alimentarius Commission: DILs for Use in International Trade
CODEX adopted guidance in 1989 establishing DILs for food contaminated with radionuclides.
The CODEX DILs were issued as guideline levels following an accidental nuclear contamination
event (CODEX 1989). The guidance was developed from earlier publications of FAO (FAO
1987, Lupien and Randall 1988) and WHO (Waight 1988, WHO 1988). The DILs are presented
in Table F-2. They were given for several radionuclide groups categorized by the magnitude of
their dose coefficients and two food groups.
The food groups are milk and infant foods and foods destined for general consumption. CODEX
defined infant food as a food prepared specifically for consumption by infants in the first year of

50

life and stated that such foods are packaged and identified as being for this purpose (CODEX
1989). The radionuclides were grouped according to the magnitude of their dose coefficients
(DCs). The specific groupings differed for the two food groups. CODEX listed representative
radionuclides for each DC group. CODEX guidelines were not restricted to these radionuclides;
any radionuclide can be placed into the appropriate DC group.
CODEX DILs apply for one year following a nuclear accident. They are intended to be applied
to food prepared for consumption. Each DIL is to be applied independently. However, for each,
the concentrations within the group are to be added. No guidance is provided for foods which are
consumed in small quantities, although CODEX stated that application of the DILs to products
of this type may be unnecessarily restrictive (CODEX 1989).
