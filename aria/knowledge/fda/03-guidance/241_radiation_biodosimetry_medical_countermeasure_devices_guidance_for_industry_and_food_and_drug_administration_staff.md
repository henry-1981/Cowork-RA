Radiation Biodosimetry Medical
Countermeasure Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance to provide industry and Agency staff with recommendations
for the types of information that should be submitted to support marketing authorization (e.g.,
clearance or approval) for radiation biodosimetry medical countermeasure devices (referred to as
“biodosimetry devices” or “biodosimeters” throughout this document). This guidance applies to
premarket submissions for medical device systems intended to measure biological responses to
unintended (non-therapeutic) radiation absorption. Biodosimetry devices are devices used for
the purpose of reconstructing the ionizing radiation dose received by individuals or populations
using physiological, chemical, or biological markers of exposure found in humans. Biodosimetry
technologies may be used at various stages during triage, including both early mass casualty
triage and subsequent clinical evaluation. Such exposures could be the result of intentional harm
or as a consequence of a disaster. Devices may be designed to give quantitative outputs or
qualitative information around a clinical decision making cut-point. Likewise, devices may be
designed for use in field triage settings, at patient bedsides, or in Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) certified clinical laboratories. FDA considered both
high-throughput and single-use devices in developing this guidance document.
This guidance document does not provide specific study designs; it describes design principles
for studies that may be used to establish a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of
biodosimetry devices. Sponsors should develop a validation plan to establish the analytical, preclinical, and clinical performance characteristics in order to substantiate the claims in the device
intended use statement, and discuss this plan with the FDA prior to beginning studies. Many of
the considerations included in this guidance document assume that the biodosimeter output is
related to a quantitative or qualitative measure of dose. We acknowledge that there may be other
relevant device outputs that manufacturers would like to pursue, such as risk of developing
specific clinical symptoms (e.g., related to acute radiation syndrome). Many of the items
discussed below can be applicable to a diversity of device outputs, if suitably addressed in a
1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
premarket submission. However, device outputs related to, or predicative of, clinical symptoms
or outcome may be challenging to evaluate in the premarket setting because of the paucity of
human data and challenge of translating results from animal studies to human use scenarios. In
this case, we would recommend early engagement with FDA via the pre-submission process.
Additionally, because it may be impossible to validate biodosimetry devices in the intended use
population, sponsors should plan to include in their ultimate pre-market submission a plan or
approach to conduct post-market testing when an emergency arises and their product is utilized
in a real-world setting. Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer
to FDA staff from CDRH. “You” and “your” refers to the applicant or sponsor.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
A radiological event, for instance from use of an improvised nuclear device or radiological
dispersal device or as a consequence of a natural disaster that causes a large-scale industrial
radiological accident, could potentially expose thousands of individuals to high levels of
radiation that would require immediate assessment and medical intervention. A coordinated
medical response including both early mass casualty triage and subsequent clinical evaluation
would be important to mitigate harm resulting from the non-therapeutic exposure of individuals
to ionizing radiation.1 Biodosimetry tools would be a critical component of such a response and
will serve to differentiate the acutely irradiated population from the concerned public. Radiation
biodosimetry estimates the absolute dose of radiation absorbed by an individual. Biodosimetry
devices provide information that allows for the development of appropriate treatment plans for
patients.
The most significant benefit that biodosimetry has over physical dosimetry is that it takes into
account the natural patient biological variability in radiation response, though physical dosimetry
tools may provide a more accurate measurement of the actual radiation dose delivered. For
example, a physical dosimeter such as a thermoluminescent dosimeter detects radiation on a
physical substrate but does not assess the amount of radiation absorbed by the subject or the
subject’s biological response to radiation. Therefore, while a physical dosimeter may provide an
accurate representation of dose, these devices will be unable to differentiate a patient who is
radiation-sensitive (presumably needing a higher level of medical intervention) from a patient

applicable drugs and treatments recommended in such a scenario, see the document entitled “Planning Guidance for
Response to a Nuclear Detonation” (http://www.remm.nlm.gov/PlanningGuidanceNuclearDetonation.pdf). This
document was developed by the National Security Staff Interagency Policy Coordination Subcommittee for
Preparedness and Response to Radiological and Nuclear Threats (last accessed on April 14, 2016). Note this website

who is radiation-resistant. As such, the development of radiation biodosimetry techniques will be
a powerful tool in personalizing therapeutic responses to radiation absorption, representing a
significant benefit to public health.
Most biodosimeters are in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs), as defined in 21 CFR 809.3(a).2 A
wide array of technologies may be employed to assess biological responses to radiation.
Methodologies amenable to incorporation into biodosimetry devices could include nucleic acid
based devices that utilize technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or microarrays,
devices designed to detect changes in protein expression using technology such as enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or flow cytometry, and other methodologies designed to
detect other biological signals induced by absorption of radiation.
Sponsors who intend to market biodosimetry devices must, in addition to other applicable
requirements, conform to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
(FD&C Act), and obtain marketing authorization (e.g., premarket clearance or approval) prior to
marketing their devices. This guidance document represents our current thinking regarding the
recommended information that should be included in a premarket submission of a biodosimetry
device for assessing unintended absorption of radiation. We consider these recommended studies
to be relevant for premarket notifications (e.g., 510(k) submissions or premarket approval
applications (PMAs) that may be required for a particular device). The following documents may
be useful in preparing premarket submissions:

In vitro diagnostic products are those reagents, instruments, and systems intended for use in the diagnosis of
disease or other conditions, including a determination of the state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or
prevent disease or its sequelae. Such products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of
specimens taken from the human body. These products are devices as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), and may also be biological products subject to section 351 of the Public Health
Service Act.

FDA recognizes that biodosimetry device sponsors face unique challenges in attempting to meet
premarket clearance or approval requirements for their devices. For example, ethical
considerations limit the availability of appropriate clinical samples for biodosimetry device
performance studies, leading to the expected use of animal models as surrogates for clinical
validation purposes. As such, study designs that are not typically recommended for other IVD
submissions may be appropriate for biodosimetry devices. The intent of this guidance document
is to provide clarity to both industry and FDA staff on performance data and information that
should be included in submissions to the Agency in order to help sponsors design studies and to
facilitate our review process. Due to the device’s novelty, the pre-submission process is an
encouraged component of any biodosimetry device development. The pre-submission process is
an opportunity for sponsors to get regulatory advice on their product development plan. The presubmission process, in general, leads to better prepared submissions and shorter review times.
Information on the pre-submission process can be found in the guidance document entitled
“Requests for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and
Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM311176.pdf).

III. Scope
This guidance only applies to validation of diagnostic biodosimetry devices intended to be used
to assess radiation absorption that occurs as a result of non-therapeutic or accidental exposures
(e.g., a deliberate attack, such as use of an improvised nuclear device, or a natural disaster), and
does not apply to medical devices intended to be used to measure doses delivered as a result of
radiation therapy nor to devices that measure effects from long-term radiation exposure. In
addition, dosimeters, which are devices that detect radiation exposure on a physical substrate
rather than through a biological response and are worn by people who might be exposed to
radiation during the course of their normal work (such as film badges), are not addressed in this
guidance document. Finally, biological assays that might be used to detect the presence of
ingested radioisotopes in sputum or urine are not considered in this guidance document.

IV. General Considerations for Submission Contents
A.

Benefit-Risk Analysis

A source of significant risk to patient health associated with biodosimetry devices is when failure
of the device to perform as indicated leads to either deficient or inaccurate results or the incorrect
interpretation of these results. Inappropriate or incorrect use of biodosimetry devices may be an
additional risk. These potential risks may then lead to incorrect patient management decisions.
For instance, a false positive result or overestimation of absorption in an emergency scenario
could lead to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment for acute radiation syndrome3 or may result
3

Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS), also referred to as radiation sickness, is an acute set of illnesses caused by
irradiation of the entire body (or most of the body) by a high dose of penetrating radiation in a very short period of
time (usually a matter of minutes). According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), ARS is

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
in the patient being inappropriately placed in an expectant category and given only palliative care
when treatment could be life-saving. However, a false negative result or underestimation of
absorption could lead to failure to provide treatment or incorrect patient management which may
be lethal. Thus it is essential to appropriately balance the benefits of biodosimetry devices with
the risks, including the risk of incorrect results.
Current laboratory methods for determining absorbed radiation doses utilize cell based assays
that are accurate but take several days to complete. Therefore, part of evaluating the benefit-risk
considerations for new biodosimetry devices includes consideration of the overall time to result
or throughput of the system (e.g., decreased accuracy within a reasonable range may be
acceptable for a device that provides a more rapid result in the context of triage). The guidance
document entitled “Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical
Device Premarket Approvals and De Novo Classifications”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm2
67829.htm) provides information on FDA benefit-risk determinations. Premarket submissions
should include a discussion of the potential benefits and risks associated with the device in light
of the biological radiation response pathway that is being assessed. This discussion should
include but not be limited to the analytical strengths and weaknesses of the technology and the
clinical information that is available demonstrating device effectiveness.

B.

Device Description and Specifying the Intended Use

All components of your biodosimetry system necessary to achieve the claimed functionality in
the intended use statement should be listed in the device description.
The intended use statement should specify: 1) the nature of the analyte (e.g., RNA, DNA, or
protein), 2) specimen types in which testing may be performed (e.g., blood, urine, or saliva), 3)
the specific population(s) for which the test is intended (e.g., pediatrics, general population), and
4) the intended use setting(s) (e.g., field triage or professional use only). For the purposes of this
guidance, field triage devices would be intended to be used by trained lay personnel (first
responders) in a setting outside of a professional medical facility.
The intended use statement should also explain whether the test is qualitative or quantitative and
include any specific conditions of use. The intended use statement of most biodosimetry devices
should also explicitly advise that results need to be considered in combination with other
appropriate clinical signs and symptoms as well as radiation dispersal monitoring.
Additional specific elements that should be considered and included as part of the intended use
statement or in the device description for biodosimetry devices include the following:

classified into three classic sub-syndromes: hematopoietic syndrome (H-ARS), gastrointestinal syndrome (GI
syndrome), and cardiovascular/central nervous system syndrome (CV/CNS syndrome)
(http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/arsphysicianfactsheet.asp). Note this website is not controlled by FDA.

1.

Stage of Response

Biodosimetry devices may be designed for early field triage (usually qualitative). For these types
of devices, the intended use should specify the throughput capabilities, time to result of the
device, and the decision making cut-points assessed. Alternatively, biodosimetry devices may be
designed for subsequent clinical evaluation for more definitive medical management, including
dose level confirmation (usually quantitative or semi-quantitative). For these types of devices,
specific clinical indicators of health status should be part of the intended use statement and, for
quantitative devices, should include the assay measuring interval.

2.

Appropriate timeframes for testing

Many common biomarkers of radiation absorption display defined kinetics, during which they
become detectable, remain stable, and then disappear from the matrix being examined.
Therefore, it is important to specify the timeframe in which the device is designed to function,
beginning from time of exposure. This should include both the beginning and end of the
acceptable testing window (e.g., from 30 minutes to 48 hours post-exposure).

3.

Assay limitations

Validation of biodosimetry devices may be incomplete due to a lack of samples from the
intended use population. Therefore, limitation statements may be needed to minimize risk of
over-reliance on biodosimeter results when the real-world situation in which the device is being
used does not mirror the scenarios tested. Limitation statements may be included in the intended
use statement or in the warnings and contraindications section of the labeling, depending upon
the risks associated with using the device in those limited situations. For instance, if validation
testing was only performed on certain populations (e.g., not tested in pediatrics), for specific
radiation types (e.g., gamma source only or limited to effects from low-linear energy transfer
[LET] radiation), or on specimens or subjects exposed to limited doses and dose rates that may
not reflect the final situation of use, these limitations should be captured in the labeling. Other
situations that may cause inaccurate biodosimeter results (e.g., combined injury such as radiation
plus physical trauma) should be taken into account when drafting an appropriate intended use
statement. However, labeling limitations cannot generally be relied upon to justify missing
validation studies for the intended use population. You should make every attempt to establish
assay performance in the intended use population. If you determine that you are unable to
perform validation using the intended use population, you should provide a justification along
with a detailed description of the due diligence activities you performed to support your
validation approach.

C.

Samples
1.

Sample availability

We recognize the difficulty in acquiring appropriate clinical samples for use during device
validation. Typically, the source of clinical samples is patient samples taken in the course of
radiation therapy (partial or total body). However, these specimens may be difficult to obtain in

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
sufficient amounts. Another challenge with these sources is that the therapeutic protocol restricts
the radiation doses available (only low dose fractionated exposures may be readily obtained) and
such specimens may not be sufficient to represent the spectrum of radiation absorption that
occurs as a result of non-therapeutic or accidental exposures. In the absence of sufficient or
appropriate clinical samples, contrived samples may be used for analytical performance testing,
but only as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for clinical samples.
Samples may be contrived by a variety of means including but not limited to:
· ex vivo irradiation of the appropriate matrix,
· spiking the analyte of interest into the appropriate matrix,
· through the use of animal-derived specimens (e.g., specimens obtained from irradiated
animals), as appropriate.
In some instances, control materials (i.e., materials designed to serve as assay positive or
negative controls) or contrived samples (i.e., samples designed to mimic a patient sample) may
be used for the purposes of analytical performance testing. Premarket submissions should
include a scientific justification for contrived sample utilization, a description of how contrived
samples were generated and validated for testing, and a description of how the results obtained
translate to the clinical setting. You are encouraged to discuss the most appropriate sample type
for testing with FDA prior to designing your analytical validation studies. You should make
every effort to obtain and use appropriate clinical samples to demonstrate performance.

2.

Specimen collection and handling

The quality and quantity of an extracted analyte can be affected by multiple factors such as
specimen source, collection method, time of collection after exposure, and handling (e.g.,
transport, storage time, and temperature). Therefore, premarket submissions should include
performance validation data to establish that the specimen collection and transport system
employed by the device provides an adequate and appropriate yield of the analyte being detected
by the assay (e.g., DNA or RNA from blood or tissue). Testing should also demonstrate that the
device maintains acceptable performance under all the various specimen handling conditions
claimed in the product labeling.
Specimen stability should also be addressed in the premarket submission. However, we
recognize there may be different analytical and clinical performance needs depending on whether
the device is intended for early mass casualty triage in a field setting, for radiation absorption
confirmation, or for dose refinement in a clinical laboratory setting.
For example, if the device is intended to be used in an early mass casualty triage environment in
a field setting, CDRH would evaluate whether the device is both sufficiently robust to withstand
environmental impacts and appropriately user friendly for use by the intended user. Therefore,
for biodosimetry devices intended for field triage use, testing should include performance testing
to demonstrate the robustness of the device, and where relevant, performance testing to
demonstrate the device’s specimen collection and transport performance characteristics. By
contrast, performance evaluation of devices intended for dose refinement may focus more on
performance testing to demonstrate the device’s measurement precision performance

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
characteristics. In either case, specimen shipping stability performance testing will be critical if
the testing is intended to take place far from where the patient samples are obtained. The
acceptance criteria for all specimen stability parameters should be clearly indicated and justified
in terms of the intended use environment as indicated in the labeling.

3.

Unirradiated samples

Unirradiated samples may be used both to assess the normal range (reference interval) or
expected values for qualitative or semi-quantitative assays. In addition, these samples may be
used to create contrived samples by spiking the analyte of interest into an appropriate matrix.
Assessment of the reference interval or expected values of analyte expression should include a
suitable number of normal samples to determine if biodosimeter analyte expression depends on
subject age, race, sex, and common disease conditions (e.g., obesity, diabetes, or arthritis, as
appropriate). Normal samples can be obtained prospectively or from appropriate sample banks.
All normal samples should be collected as intended for your device. For instance, if blood will be
collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes for use in your biodosimeter, then
normal samples should be collected in EDTA tubes. As above, basic demographic information
and information on disease conditions should be collected with normal samples.

D.

Analytical Validation Studies

Biological response to a radiation dose as measured by biodosimetry is confounded by patientto-patient variation in radiation response, making simple dose/response correlations difficult. As
such, a well-documented explanation of the relevant biological pathways should be provided to
FDA in order to justify a lack of correlation of the assay output to the radiation dose delivered
attributable to natural biological response. Such information can be obtained through peerreviewed literature as well as bench testing. Well-controlled analytical studies should be
provided to FDA to establish device performance across the entire measuring interval of the
device in a defined sample subset. This analytical performance information will be critical to
substantiate intended use claims of a biodosimetry device.
Additionally, it is beyond the scope of this document to consider the broad range of analytical
characteristics specific to each of the many and varied technologies that may be employed to
develop biodosimeters. Therefore, you are encouraged to examine guidance documents that
might be applicable to the type of technology your device employs to identify the types of
analytical characteristics that might be appropriate to demonstrate for your device. For example,
if a biodosimetry instrument utilizes a genetic test for heritable markers, you might consider
consulting the “Guidance on Pharmacogenetic Tests and Genetic Tests for Heritable Markers”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/ucm071075.pdf) to identify the types of analytical characteristics that might be
appropriate to demonstrate for your device.
Finally, appropriate standards documents drafted by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) are additional helpful resources that might provide details on specific analytical
performance testing appropriate for your device. Specific standards documents which might be
applicable will be referenced throughout this section. A list of FDA recognized standards can be

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
found at the following website:
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.

1.

Accuracy in relation to the dose delivered

In order to demonstrate analytical accuracy, if the device output is radiation dose, then the
device’s measurement of the biological response to radiation will probably be compared to the
physical calculated dose delivered. Therefore, the accuracy of the delivered dose is crucial, and
the protocol for designing proper telemetry should be included in all study protocols. As
discussed above, we expect that because the biodosimetry output will be confounded by the
biological response to radiation, there will be between-individual variations which may
complicate the correlation of the output to the radiation dose delivered.
Statistical analysis plans, including acceptance criteria, should be developed around accuracy
studies and be appropriate for the device output (qualitative or quantitative). Please refer to
Appendix A in section V of this document for more information on statistical considerations for
study designs. All accuracy studies should be designed to demonstrate device performance at the
clinical decision making cut-points relevant to the intended use of your device (i.e., mass
casualty triage or subsequent clinical triage for more definitive medical management) and
contain pre-specified success criteria. The rationale for your acceptance criteria should be
provided and clinically justified.
A manufacturer may consider using a reference method to validate the accuracy of their
biodosimetry device. For example, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) may be an
appropriate reference method in some circumstances. However manufacturers should understand
the limitations of available reference methods. For instance, DCA has several limitations,
including that above 5 Gy the assay is no longer dose-dependent. Because of these limitations,
sponsors may also choose not to assess assay performance compared to a reference method.

2.

Measuring interval or expected values
a)

Measuring interval

If a biodosimetry device reports numerical (quantitative) results, submissions should include
studies establishing the measuring interval of your device. Measuring interval studies should be
designed to substantiate Limit of Detection (LoD), Limit of Blank (LoB), Limit of Quantitation
(LoQ), and the linearity of the assay. The radiation absorption levels that are clinically relevant
span from 2-10 Gy, and we recommend developing test protocols to evaluate the limitations of
your assay outside (both above and below) the clinically relevant dose range. For instance, if
high radiation levels can cause the assay to incorrectly report lower values (i.e., the hook effect),
then the limitations section of the labeling should include this information. Please refer to the
CLSI document EP6-A and EP17-A2 to assist in the design of such studies.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
b)

Category assessments

If a biodosimetry device reports a qualitative or semi-quantitative result, submissions should
include studies validating the decision making cut-point(s) and how outputs will be assigned to
clinical categories. Samples around critical decision making cut-points should be included in
these studies.

3.

Interference

Interfering substances may affect assay outputs. As such, biodosimetry device submissions
should include the results of appropriate interference studies (see CLSI Document EP07-A2) for
quantitative tests. Please include samples near the cut-off(s) for interference testing in qualitative
or semi-quantitative devices. Interference studies may be specific to the matrix being examined.
For example, if the assay uses blood, interference from hemoglobin, bilirubin, and lipids should
be examined to mimic grossly hemolytic, icteric, and lipemic samples.
Likewise common drugs known or expected to interfere, or drugs that are expected to be
administered in a mass radiation exposure scenario, should be tested for assay interference. For
more information on the Federal government response plans for radiation disaster scenarios and
a list of the applicable drugs and treatments that will be recommended in such a scenario, see the
document entitled “Planning Guidance for Response to a Nuclear Detonation.”4
In addition, you should consider how biological responses may interfere with your assay and
develop corresponding risk mitigations necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness (e.g., to limit the interfering effects of the underlying biological response). This
information may be appropriate to include in the warnings and limitations section in the labeling.
Ultimately the decision of what compounds to test for assay interference should be based on
applying scientific reasoning to the technological characteristics of your device and the major
biological pathways being interrogated. For instance, if a biodosimeter incorporates expression
profiles from a pro-inflammatory pathway, interference from anti-inflammatory drugs should be
examined and assay effectiveness should be tested in normal volunteers with possible
confounding diseases such as arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Alternatively, animal
models may be used to evaluate these potential confounders (see section IV.G.2 below).

4.

Other analytical testing protocols

Analytical testing protocols, in addition to those mentioned specifically above, should be

technology. Reproducibility should generally be demonstrated at a minimum of three sites (of
which at least one should be in the United States) and submissions should include an evaluation
of sources of variability including operator-to-operator, instrument-to-instrument, day-to-day,

and kit lot-to-kit lot variability, as applicable. Repeatability should also be evaluated. The LoD
(limit of detection), LoQ (limit of quantification), and LoB (limit of blank), as relevant, may be
demonstrated in a separate study for quantitative devices. The stability of kit reagents, including
controls and calibrators, as applicable should be performed in real-time for product expiry
dating, and should also be examined in shipping simulation studies. As noted above, studies to
support technology-specific validation and special controls may apply, such as for molecular
assays.

Controls and Calibrators

The design of biodosimetry devices should incorporate the use of on-board or external controls
as appropriate. Any recommended Quality Control (QC) procedures and acceptance criteria used
during the analytical and clinical validation of your device should be included in the instructions
for use. A description of the control material and its recommended use should be submitted along
with the assay for premarket clearance or approval. Information that should be provided in the
premarket submission includes control performance, value assignment, and reagent stability as
outlined in guidance entitled “Assayed and Unassayed Quality Control Material”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0
79179.htm). Similarly, if external calibrators are required for the assay system, they should also
be submitted with the assay. You are encouraged to consult the guidance entitled “Abbreviated

Animal Study Considerations

Typically, animal data are not used in IVD submissions. IVD sponsors are expected to obtain
specimens from the intended use population either through prospective collection from a clinical
trial or to use properly archived surplus (excess) specimens to demonstrate test performance
when prospective studies are not feasible. However, in the case of biodosimetry devices, we
acknowledge that appropriate human specimens may not be available. Therefore, under the
following conditions it may be appropriate to use animal model data to supplement human
clinical samples to demonstrate device performance:5
·
·
·

The analyte(s) being detected is not stable in archived specimens;
A diligent search of available specimen banks has failed to yield adequate samples for
testing; or
A prospective study is either unethical, or prospective studies that may be ethically
performed will not yield a sample set adequate to demonstrate assay performance
over the measuring interval of the device.

1.

Defining an appropriate animal model

If animal model data is included in a biodosimetry device premarket submission, the submission
should also include an appropriate justification for the animal model or models chosen. You
should provide evidence that the model is an adequate substitute for human studies. In particular,
establishing that there is high homology in the analyte(s) being assessed and that the animal
model displays similar responses to radiation in the biological pathways being interrogated is
important. We recommend that you provide a justification (e.g. appropriate published literature) that
the radiation dose given in your selected animal model is comparable to the dose in humans.
When choosing your animal model, you should consider transferability of experimental results,
the influences of genetic uniformity of the model, and background knowledge of radiation
response pathways. For example, while rodent models may be appropriate for early proof of
concept studies in biodosimetry, their biological divergence from humans presents challenges for
demonstrating biodosimetry effectiveness in humans. Large-animal models (non-human primate,
canine, or porcine), in which radiation response more closely resemble those of humans, may be
better options for effectiveness studies. You should ensure that an equal distribution of sexes is
included in pre-clinical testing and consider including animals at various age ranges so age and
sex-related differences in radiation response can be assessed for the analytes included in the
biodosimeter. You should carefully determine the number of animals that are required for your

studies so that meaningful data are collected. Consider consulting a biostatistician for assistance
with determining the required animal numbers for use in these studies.
Multiple animal models generally would not be required to demonstrate effectiveness. However,
multiple animal models may be necessary when a single appropriate animal model cannot be
identified for all the analytes being assessed by the device. Developers can perform a literature
search in order to determine the most appropriate animal models to be used in biodosimetry
device effectiveness studies.
Please note that all device studies using animal models that are intended to support premarket
submissions to the Agency must comply with all applicable laws and regulations including:

by differences in diet or housing conditions of laboratory animals as opposed to that of the
general human population. You should standardize husbandry of animals used in these studies,
offering the same care, diet, and standardized enrichment to animals included in the study in
order to help minimize experimental inconsistencies. Additionally, to avoid variability caused by
changes in radiation response due to circadian rhythm patterns, we recommend you deliver
radiation at the same time of day (e.g., a.m. vs. p.m.) to all animal models.
You also may want to consider providing animal models with the same supportive care that is
expected to be provided to people in a radiation mass exposure scenario. For example, you could
consider providing supplemental care such as parenteral and/or oral physiologic fluids, as well as
soft, nutrient-rich palatable foods that encourage eating. You may also consider providing
supplemental heat, as well as antibiotics when indicated to determine if these types of medical
interventions alter the biological responses being assessed by biodosimetry.1 For example, if
neutrophil numbers are part of a biodosimetry algorithm, it should be understood how G-CSF
(granulocyte-colony stimulating factor) treatments affect resulting radiation level estimations.
This information may be critical to ensuring appropriate labeling is provided for the assay.

3.

Bridging animal data to human data

When animal model data are necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of a biodosimeter at a
clinically relevant dose or dose range, two types of studies should be provided. First, a set of
experiments should be designed to bridge between the animal results and the available human
clinical information. For instance, if available human studies were derived from whole body
exposure delivered in 2 Gy fractions over the course of a week, then an animal study should be
performed to mirror this exposure pattern to demonstrate how animal results and human data are
reflective of each other. There are several complex statistical considerations in determining the
species comparison that will be appropriate depending on device output (e.g., quantitative,
qualitative, or semi-quantitative) and technology type. These statistical methodologies should be
discussed with the Agency on a case-by-case basis. Once an appropriate demonstration has
shown that animal results can be bridged to human clinical experience, then studies in animals
may be performed to address device performance at radiation doses, dose rates, time courses, and
sources that cannot be examined in human clinical studies.
Animal studies may also be used to address situations that may not be easily addressed using
human clinical studies. Depending on the mechanism of action or biological pathways assessed
by the device, you could consider testing animal models or providing literature support for the
impact that commonly used drugs such as anti-cholesterol, anti-hypertension, diabetic drugs, and
other common drugs may have on the analyte (e.g., a particular metabolic pathway, CYP450, or
growth factors) being evaluated. Other situations that may confound assay results such as
combined injury can also be examined in animal models.
Animal studies should be designed to use the fewest possible animals to demonstrate statistical
significance in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
guidelines.12 Because these studies will be critical to demonstrate the performance of a
12

biodosimeter and because alternative study designs will be needed to minimize animal numbers,
it is encouraged that study protocols be submitted to us prior to the onset of testing in order to
gain Agency concurrence on study parameters and statistical analysis plans. Please refer to the
appendix in section V of this document for more information on statistical considerations for
biodosimetry study designs.

H. Establishing Performance Characteristics – Clinical
Validation Studies with Human Samples
FDA expects that biodosimeter safety and effectiveness will be established in an appropriately
designed clinical study that captures the device performance in human subjects. However as
discussed above, non-clinical models may be used to supplement human clinical data by
providing information on doses, dose rates, time-courses and radiation sources that cannot be
ethically obtained in a human clinical study. These pivotal studies should be designed with an
appropriate statistical analysis plan in place with pre-defined acceptance criteria. You are
encouraged to refer to Appendix A in section V of this document and the guidance entitled
“Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0
71148.htm) for more information.

1.

Prospective clinical studies

Studies may be performed to prospectively assess biodosimeter performance in the context of
radiation delivered for therapeutic purposes. Because patient numbers may be limited, you
should consider a study design that collects multiple samples from each patient over the course
of their therapy. Additionally, whenever possible you should collect specimens prior to radiation
and/or other therapy as a clinical baseline. Ideally, you should design studies to assess
biodosimeter performance beyond the range of times post-exposure that you intend to claim in
labeling. For example, if you intend your device to have labeling claims from 24 hours to 7 days
post-exposure, your studies should include a minimum of 8 days post-exposure. However, we
acknowledge that therapies administered pre-, post-, or concurrently with radiation in some
patient populations may confound biodosimetry test results. As such, lack of human clinical data
across the intended times post-exposure may be acceptable with an appropriate scientific
justification and accompanying supplemental animal data.
For all prospective clinical studies, information should be captured on the dose, dose rate, timecourse and radiation source for all patients. In addition, basic demographic information should
be collected, including patient age, sex, and race. Information on the patient’s clinical condition
(e.g., body mass index and medications) should also be collected whenever possible.
Prospective IVD clinical studies that do not require an invasive sampling procedure and for
which the test results are not used to support patient management are generally considered to
meet the requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3) to be exempt from the Investigational Device
Exemption requirements in part 812 with the exception of 21 CFR section 812.119. If, however,
you have concerns about the risk classification of your prospective clinical study, you should
submit a risk-determination pre-submission as outlined in the “Requests for Feedback on

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with Food and Drug
Administration Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM311176.pdf).
We acknowledge that there are a number of challenges associated with prospectively collecting
adequate clinical samples for device effectiveness testing. Therefore, it is recommended that you
use the pre-submission process to discuss clinical study design and implementation prior to the
onset of testing. Pre-submissions should ideally include the clinical validation study protocol,
statistical analysis plan, and a description of sample acquisition strategies.

2.

Clinical studies using banked samples

If the analyte or analytes being assessed by a biodosimetry device are suitably stable in the
relevant test matrix, then you are encouraged to utilize appropriately banked samples (collected
for other purposes) to demonstrate the clinical performance of your biodosimetry device. For
more information, please refer to the guidance entitled “Informed Consent for In Vitro
Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually
Identifiable”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0
78384.htm). Appropriate retrospective samples should have documentation on basic patient
demographics (but not personally identifiable information) and basic information on the
radiation exposure profile.

3.

Limitations of clinical studies

We acknowledge that there may be significant limitations in the interpretation of clinical studies
for biodosimetry submissions. For instance, therapeutic dose rates will not be reflective of the
expected dose rates that would be experienced by someone in a radiological disaster.
Additionally, clinical studies may not be reflective of all possible types of radiological disasters
for which the biodosimeter is intended. Thus, in addition to the animal studies and analytical
studies discussed above, biodosimetry submissions should include a discussion of the limitations
of the clinical study, and how analytical studies, animal studies, or a combination of analytical
and animal studies have been used to mitigate these limitations in order to demonstrate a
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.

I.

Labeling

The labeling of a biodosimetry device includes the instructions for use, package inserts, and any
outer box or container labels for the device itself, reagents, and control materials, as applicable.
The following references will be useful in developing clear and complete labeling for your
device.

In Vitro Diagnostic Device Labeling Requirements
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/DeviceL
abeling/InVitroDiagnosticDeviceLabelingRequirements/default.htm)

In addition to the references above and the information already provided in this guidance
document, the following should be considered when developing labeling for biodosimetry
devices that complies with the labeling requirements outlined in 21 CFR Parts 801 (for general
labeling requirements) and 809 (for additional IVD labeling requirements), as applicable.

1.

Instructions for use

For biodosimeters intended for use by lay persons, information required by 21 CFR 809.10(b)
should be described in a manner that lay users can understand. Detailed technical information
(e.g., scientific principles of test procedure or statistical analysis of data) may be presented in a
separate section followed by clarifying statements appropriate for lay users. The following
should also be taken into account when drafting appropriate instructions for use for radiation
biodosimetry devices.
·

·

·

The labeling must provide instructions for specimen collection and preparation (see 21
CFR 809.10(b)(7)). Instructions should be drafted with the intended end user in mind. For
example, consider whether a trained healthcare provider will be collecting the sample or
if the patient will be instructed to do so.
The labeling must provide a step-by-step outline of recommended procedures and
operating instructions for the instrument (see 21 CFR 809.10(b)(8) and 21 CFR
809.10(b)(6)(v)). Ideally, numbering rather than bullet points should be used for clarity.
Labeling must describe details of calibration and of quality control procedures (see 21
CFR 809.10(b)(8)(v) and 21 CFR 809.10(b)(8)(vi)). These instructions are to help ensure
optimal performance of the system. This section should include recommendations for
how and when to perform quality control checks and instructions for what to do if the
control material values are not within the allowable ranges.

2.

Limitations

Labeling must include a statement of limitations of the procedure, including known extrinsic
factors or interfering substances affecting results (see 21 CFR 809.10(b)(10)). You should also
include testing conditions that may cause clinically significant errors due to bias or imprecision
(e.g., combined injury, high dose rates, or alternative sources of radiation). You should also note
all known contraindications. This section should thoroughly describe the situations of use that
were not examined in performance testing of the device. For instance, if device performance was
not assessed using neutron radiation sources, then this information should be included in the
labeling.

17

3.

Interpretation of results

Labeling must include a description of the expected values for your device (qualitative) or
measuring interval (quantitative) (see 21 CFR 809.10(b)(11)). In the case of a qualitative device,
we recommend that the expected values be portrayed in terms of expected values for nonirradiated subjects, and around the clinical decision making cut-points that were evaluated for
your device (e.g., 2 Gy and/or 10 Gy). If the results are qualitative, you should explain how to
interpret positive and negative results, including their clinical significance. Alternatively, if the
device is quantitative, you should explain the clinical significance of the outputs along the
measuring interval. A statement should be included to interpret results in the context of other
clinical signs and symptoms as well as any known dosimetric or radiation dispersal data
associated with the patient’s location.
You should also provide directions for the interpretation of the results of controls (performance
monitors) and provide a statement that if controls do not perform as expected, assay results are
invalid. Instructions should also be provided for any situation in which the end user should repeat
a test.

4.

Performance characteristics

Labeling must include specific performance characteristics of the device (see 21 CFR
809.10(b)(12)). All studies, including bench testing, animal testing, and clinical studies should be
summarized in the package insert of the assay. Performance data should be presented clearly and
accurately, ideally in both graphical and text formats. Clinical information that was obtained
through animal studies alone (with no human clinical supporting data) should be specifically
highlighted with a disclaimer that the performance of the assay has not been evaluated in clinical
samples under these specific conditions.

J.

CLIA Categorization

The CLIA (42 U.S.C. 263a) regulates laboratory testing and requires that clinical laboratories
obtain a certificate before accepting materials derived from the human body for the purpose of
providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or the
impairment of, or assessment of the health of human beings. The type of CLIA certificate a
laboratory obtains depends upon the complexity of the tests it performs. CLIA regulations
describe the following three levels of test complexity: waived tests, moderate complexity tests,
and high complexity tests, 42 CFR 493.5(a).

CDRH determines the CLIA categorization of IVD tests at the time of review of a premarket
notification submission (510(k)) or a premarket approval application (PMA). Biodosimeters
intended for field triage that are cleared for home use for the purposes of CLIA are CLIA waived
(42 CFR 493.15). In addition, a biodosimeter meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver if the
sponsor demonstrates in studies conducted at the intended use site that the biodosimeter employs
methodologies that are so simple and accurate as to render the likelihood of erroneous results
negligible or that the biodosimeter poses no reasonable risk of harm to the patient if the test is
performed incorrectly. If a sponsor of a test categorized as moderate complexity believes their

18

test meets the statutory criteria for CLIA waiver, they may submit a CLIA Waiver by
Application to request categorization of the test system as waived. A Dual 510(k) and CLIA
Waiver by Application pathway is also available. For additional information regarding CLIA
Categorizations and CLIA Waivers by Application including the Dual 510(k) and CLIA Waiver
by Application pathway, refer to the guidance entitled “Administrative Procedures for CLIA

V. Appendix A: Statistical Considerations for
Biodosimetry Devices
This appendix includes some statistical considerations for biodosimetry devices. Further
statistical considerations for diagnostic devices that may be applicable to biodosimetry devices
are comprehensively discussed in the guidance entitled “Statistical Guidance on Reporting
Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm0
71148.htm) and further concepts and principles related to designing medical device studies are
discussed in the guidance entitled “Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for
Medical Devices”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM373766.pdf). In addition, as discussed above, it is recommended that you use the
pre-submission process to discuss statistical analysis plans and methods before initiating any data
collection for your clinical, pre-clinical, and analytical studies.

A.

Study Blinding (Masking)

To avoid bias in the device result, the user of the biodosimetry device should be unaware of (i.e.,
blinded to) the actual level of radiation absorption (e.g., the administered dose). Likewise, to
avoid bias in the reference method measurement, the user of the comparative method should be
unaware of the device result. In general, the user should be unaware of any results from other
diagnostic evaluations, and vice versa.

B.

Confidence Intervals for Estimates of Performance

Confidence intervals for performance estimates are also referred to as precision of estimation in
clinical study literature. Performance variability is controlled by the sample size of the study and
is another key consideration when evaluating a study design and study results. With a larger
sample size, an estimate of performance is subject to less sampling variability. Uncertainty of the
estimation is thus reduced. The estimate becomes less imprecise, leading to a narrower
confidence interval of likely values for the true performance. If you have more than one study,
the precision of estimation might be increased by a careful pre-planned analysis of combined
studies, if appropriate.

C.

Study Analysis

The protocol for a biodosimeter study should include a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP
is used to interpret the study data in support of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its
intended use. The SAP should be pre-specified and provided in enough detail to permit FDA
review. The analysis plan should define the performance measures (e.g., specificity, sensitivity)
to be evaluated. Any success criteria on the performance measures should be clearly pre-defined
using descriptive and mathematical statements (e.g., the null and alternative hypotheses for a
significance test, the estimator for a performance measure, the method for deriving a confidence
interval, etc.). Unplanned post-hoc analyses are discouraged as primary evidence of safety and
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendation
effectiveness. Post-hoc analyses can inflate the study-wise type I error rate (probability of false
statistical significance) and therefore are generally considered exploratory rather than
confirmatory evidence of safety and effectiveness.
In particular, the SAP should describe how sample size for the study was determined. Sample
size determination should be consistent with the pre-planned statistical analyses of the study,
especially the primary analyses. Assumptions underlying the statistical power of the study to
demonstrate a performance claim should be provided in detail.
In clinical studies of IVDs, laboratories often produce results that are not described by a defined
category or numerical value. The terms used to describe these results include “uninterpretable,”
“invalid,” and “indeterminate.” Your test results may also be called equivocal. For various
reasons including inability to obtain new samples after assay failure, results may be missing.
The SAP should include a plan for dealing with all these possible device results and samples or
specimens that are unavailable or unevaluable. For example, the plan may include reporting the
number and proportion of subjects without a valid device result by the reason a valid result was
not obtained. If repeated application (after the first reading) of the device on a subject or
specimen is not intended, is not possible, or would not be helpful (e.g., the device result will
always be uninterpretable), then uninterpretable device results, for example, could be treated as a
separate category for the purpose of analysis. If repeat measurement of subjects or specimens is
possible and appropriate, then imputation of missing device results can sometimes aid the
statistical analysis and interpretation of study data. Further comments with respect to missing
data are in section V.C.4 below.
If the design of your study is adaptive, its adaptive features should be pre-planned (i.e., the study
should be adaptive by design). Before conducting an adaptively designed study, its operating
characteristics (e.g., type 1 error rate, power) and its potential for introducing operational bias
into the study (due to the adaptive features) should be evaluated. Some examples of adaptations
based on interim analysis include stopping the study early (e.g., for futility, re-estimating sample
size, and changing a hypothesis). Monitoring a study until it has a pre-defined number of
subjects with or without a condition is an adaptive design feature which does not ordinarily
require special consideration. The literature on adaptive design for diagnostic studies is
unfortunately scant, but some references are available.13
Corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals should be provided. The method used to
estimate these measures and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals should be clearly prespecified. If multiple measurements are obtained per subject, the statistical analysis (e.g., 95%
confidence interval) should account for the correlation structure of the within-subject
measurements using a valid statistical method.

1.

Quantitative, continuous, or semi-quantitative output

Statistical analyses and methods depend on the type of results provided by the biodosimetry
device. For devices providing a quantitative measurement, the bias and imprecision of the
measurement should be evaluated along with other performance characteristics. For example,
difference plot methodology can be used to compare the level of radiation absorption predicted
by the device with the actual level delivered (actual dose or reference level) over the measuring
interval.14 Comparison of device output and delivered radiation dose results near clinical
decision making cut-points is essential. The systematic difference (bias) of the device result
should be estimated near these decision points. Please refer to the CLSI document EP09-A3,
“Measurement Procedure Comparison and Bias Estimation Using Patient Samples; Approved
Guideline--Third Edition,” and EP05-A3, “Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative Measurement
Procedures; Approved Guideline--Third Edition.”
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis might also be useful to evaluate the diagnostic
accuracy of a biodosimetry device reporting a quantitative, continuous, or semi-quantitative
result, or reporting a qualitative result derived from an underlying value that is quantitative,
continuous, or semi-quantitative. ROC analysis evaluates the overall ability of the device to
discriminate between subjects with and without a condition of interest. On an ROC plot, the false
positive and true positive fractions (1 – specificity, sensitivity) are plotted for each possible cutoff in the value as it is varied across the entire range of observed values, resulting in an ROC
“curve.” An advantage of ROC analysis can be that the plot will display the estimated sensitivity
and specificity of the device throughout a range of clinical decision making cut-points. The area
under the ROC curve (AUC) is a global measure of device discrimination performance, with
AUC values of 0.5 and 1.0 indicating random and perfect discrimination, respectively. Please
refer to the CLSI document EP24-A2, “Assessment of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Laboratory
Tests Using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves; Approved Guideline--Second Edition,” as
well as the following references.15 If the condition of interest is not binary (e.g., dose or level of
radiation absorption), generalizations of AUC exist for evaluating the discrimination ability of
medical tests.16

Qualitative output

For devices that are designed to provide a qualitative output around a clinical decision making
cut-point, device evaluation should include its performance metrics using measures such as

sensitivity, specificity, and the negative and positive diagnostic likelihood ratios (NLR, PLR).
PLR is defined as sensitivity / (1 – specificity), the ratio of the true positive fraction to the false
positive fraction. NLR is defined as (1 – sensitivity) / specificity, the ratio of the false negative
fraction to the true negative fraction. Larger values of PLR and smaller values of NLR indicate
better classification of the condition status. PLR and NLR are proportional to the odds that test
positive and negative subjects have a condition, respectively.

Analytical imprecision

Imprecision describes the extent of disagreement or variability of a set of replicate
measurements. For biodosimetry devices providing a quantitative or continuous value (e.g.,
radiation dose or level), the standard deviation and coefficient of variation are common measures
of imprecision. Repeatability is the imprecision when repeated measurements are taken under the
same conditions of measurement. Intermediate imprecision is the imprecision when the repeated
measurements are taken with some conditions intentionally varied (e.g., run, day, operator,
instrument, reagent lot). See CLSI document EP05-A3, “Evaluation of Precision of Quantitative
Measurement Procedures—Third Edition.”
For biodosimetry devices intended to report qualitative results, the percent agreement of the
replicate device results with the qualitative result that is expected for the subject or specimen
may be reported.

Missing data

The SAP should describe how missing data will be handled and documented. Reported results
can be misleading if subjects with missing measurement results are excluded from the analysis,
the report, or both the analysis and the report. All subjects for whom a measurement was
attempted need to be accounted for when reporting results. It is important to analyze the impact
of missing data on the conclusions obtained from the study. In some cases it may be necessary to
assess if study conclusions are robust given the missing data, and in such cases an intent-todiagnose or ITD analysis can be performed. An ITD analysis includes every subject or specimen,
regardless of whether the subject or specimen is missing the radiation biodosimetry device result,
the actual dose, the clinical reference diagnosis, or other results from comparators.

Feature Selection During Algorithm Development

If your biodosimetry device incorporates multiple pieces of information into an algorithm in
order to produce a single output, validation of this algorithm will be important to understand the
performance capabilities of the assay. During algorithm development, it is generally important to
obtain a trustworthy estimate of the algorithm’s performance before the pivotal performance
validation study.
Cross-validation is a procedure for estimating the performance of an algorithm on the same
dataset on which it was developed. The developmental dataset is split repeatedly into training
and test datasets, with the algorithm developed on the training set and evaluated on the test set.
The performance estimates obtained for the many splits are then averaged. In bootstrap cross-

validation, a training set of the same size as the original dataset is obtained by sampling the
subjects or specimens with replacement and evaluated on the remaining unselected subjects or
specimens.17
Cross-validation requires that algorithm development be automated so may not be possible if the
algorithm development process has subjective aspects. All steps of the algorithm construction
process, including and especially the step of selecting the features (analytes, measurands, etc.) to
be used by the algorithm, should be cross-validated, otherwise the performance estimate will
likely be biased.18 Please note that internal cross-validation is not a substitute for pivotal
validation in a dataset that is independent of (external to) the datasets used for development.
Further, for the pivotal validation, the final version of the test should be used.
