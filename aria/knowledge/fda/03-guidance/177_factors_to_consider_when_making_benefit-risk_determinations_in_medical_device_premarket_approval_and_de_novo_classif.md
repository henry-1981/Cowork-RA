On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Factors to Consider When Making
Benefit-Risk Determinations in
Medical Device Premarket
Approval and De Novo
Classifications
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not
binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to provide greater clarity for FDA reviewers
and industry regarding the principal factors FDA considers when making benefit-risk
determinations during the premarket review process for certain medical devices. FDA
believes that the uniform application of the factors listed in this guidance document will
improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the premarket review process.
FDA's guidance documents, including this one, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a
topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or
statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance
documents means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II.

Scope

This guidance document explains the principal factors that FDA considers when making
benefit-risk determinations in the premarket review of certain medical devices. The
processes discussed in this guidance are applicable to devices subject to premarket

approval (PMA) applications or De Novo classification requests. This guidance applies to
both diagnostic and therapeutic devices. The concepts discussed in this guidance are
applicable to the medical device development process from design to market. As such, the
benefit-risk factors set out herein should be considered during the design, non-clinical
testing, Pre-Submission, and Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) phases as well as in
assembling and assessing PMA applications or De Novo requests. Although guidance is
not binding, the concepts and factors described herein generally explain how benefit-risk
determinations are made by FDA during the premarket review process. The intersection of
this Guidance with ISO 14971 is discussed in Appendix A.

III.

Background
A.

The Statutory Standard for Safety and Effectiveness

Under section 513(a) of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”), FDA
determines whether PMA applications provide a “reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness” by “weighing any probable benefit to health from the use of the device
against any probable risk of injury or illness from such use,” among other relevant
factors. 1 To aid in this process, PMA sponsors submit valid scientific evidence,
including one or more clinical investigations where appropriate, which FDA reviews to
determine whether “the device will have the effect it purports or is represented to have
under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling of the
device.” 2 FDA staff review the data submitted as part of the PMA application and
determine – based on a number of factors – if the data support the claims made by the
sponsor concerning clinically significant results from the device, i.e., intended use and
indications for use, and if the data analysis demonstrates that the probable 3 benefits of the
1

In addition to section 513(a), the criteria for establishing safety and effectiveness of a device are set forth in
21 CFR 860.7. Subsection (b)(1) notes, “In determining the safety and effectiveness of a device … the
Commissioner and the classification panels will consider the following, among other relevant factors …The
probable benefit to health from the use of the device weighed against any probable injury or illness from such
use.” (21 CFR 860.7(b)). To make this determination, “the agency relies upon only valid scientific evidence.”
(21 CFR 860.7(c)(1)). Valid scientific evidence is defined as “evidence from well-controlled investigations,
partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case
histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device,
from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance
of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use.” (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)). A reasonable
assurance of safety occurs when “it can be determined, based upon valid scientific evidence, that the probable
benefits … outweigh any probable risks,” and can be demonstrated by establishing “the absence of
unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device for its intended uses and conditions
of use.” (21 CFR 860.7(d)(1)). Similarly, a reasonable assurance of effectiveness occurs when “it can be
determined, based upon valid scientific evidence … the use of the device for its intended uses … will provide
clinically significant results.” (21 CFR 860.7(e)(1)). The evidence of which is demonstrated principally
through “well-controlled investigations” (see 21 CFR 860.7(e)(2)), as defined in 21 CFR 860.7(f).
2
Section 513(a)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act.
3
In general, “probable” and “probability” in this guidance have the same connotation as in 21 CFR
860.7(b)(3), i.e. they refer to the likelihood of the patient experiencing a benefit or risk. Hypothesis testing,
formal concepts of probability and predictive probability, likelihood, etc., typically are critical elements in the
assessment of “probable” benefit and risk. FDA does not intend for the use of the term “probable benefit” in
this guidance to refer to the regulatory context for Humanitarian Device Exemptions (HDE) under section
520(m) of the FD&C Act, and FDA’s implementing HDE regulations.
6

device outweigh its probable risks. A balanced consideration of probable benefits and
probable risks is an essential part of FDA’s determination that there are reasonable
assurances of safety and effectiveness.4 Other considerations include that the device is
being manufactured in accordance with FDA’s quality system requirements. 5
Similarly, in accordance with section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, sponsors of devices that
have been determined to be not substantially equivalent (NSE) through the 510(k)
program or if a person believes their device is appropriate for classification into Class I or
Class II and determines, based on currently available information, there is no legally
marketed predicate device, may be eligible to submit a De Novo request requesting FDA
to make a risk-based classification determination for the device under section 513(a)(1) of
the FD&C Act. 6 Because devices classified under this pathway (De Novo devices) are
low to moderate risk devices, they may not need to confer as substantial a benefit to
patients 7 in order to have a favorable benefit-risk profile. Devices granted marketing
authority under De Novo requests should be sufficiently understood to explain all the risks
and benefits of the device such that all risks can be appropriately mitigated through the
application of general and/or special controls to provide reasonable assurance of safety
and effectiveness. Further, devices classified under De Novo requests may serve as
predicates for future devices which can be appropriately regulated through the 510(k)
program; therefore, FDA carefully considers the benefit-risk profile of these devices in the
determination that there is reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

B.

Types of Scientific Evidence

Medical devices can be evaluated using clinical and non-clinical testing methods. Clinical
testing methods for medical devices can include, when appropriate, randomized clinical
trials in the appropriate target population, well-controlled investigations, partially
controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well- documented
case histories conducted by qualified experts, reports of significant human experience, and
testing on clinically derived human specimens (DNA, tissue, organ and cadaver studies).8
Non-clinical testing methods can encompass an array of methods including performance
testing for product safety/reliability/characterization, human factors and usability
engineering testing under simulated conditions of use, animal and cell-based studies, and
computer simulations. These tests characterize mechanical, electrical and chemical
properties of the devices including but not limited to wear, tensile strength, compression,
flow rate, burst pressure, biocompatibility, toxicity, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC),
sterility, stability/shelf life data, software validation, and testing of synthetic samples,
including cell lines. The information obtained from any clinical and/or non-clinical testing
is taken into account during the premarket review process and FDA’s benefit-risk
determination.

under medical care or treatment and is not a subject, and the use of the term “subject” refers to an individual
who participates in a clinical investigation.

Although a great deal of emphasis is placed on the importance of clinical data in
demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, non-clinical data also can
be critical to understanding a device’s safety and effectiveness. Medical devices often have
attributes that cannot be tested using clinical methods alone and that play a major role in
the safety or effectiveness of the device.
Both clinical and non-clinical testing methods may be used to assess the probability or
severity of a given risk, and/or the success of risk mitigation. For example, in the case of
some implants, the most robust long-term evidence comes from engineering tests that are
able to challenge the device under worst-case conditions, test the device to failure, and
simulate many years of use. In contrast, clinical studies are usually limited in duration of
follow-up, and, as a result, may be less informative with respect to the long-term
performance of the device. In this case, the results of engineering testing may
significantly influence FDA's benefit-risk determination independent of the clinical
findings.
Both clinical and non-clinical data can play a role in FDA’s benefit-risk determinations,
and the factors discussed in this guidance are informed by both types of data.
FDA relies on valid scientific evidence in making risk and benefit determinations,
including the critical issue of identifying ‘probable risks’ and ‘probable benefits’ in the
first place. In general, a ‘probable risk’ and a ‘probable benefit’ do not include theoretical
risks and benefits, and instead are ones whose existence and characteristics are supported
by valid scientific evidence. Generally, isolated case reports, random experience, reports
lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, and unsubstantiated opinions are
not regarded as valid scientific evidence to show safety or effectiveness. However, such
information may be considered in identifying a device that has questionable safety and
effectiveness. 9

Benefit-Risk Determinations

The factors FDA considers as part of the benefit-risk determination are explained in detail
below. We also give examples of how the factors interrelate and how they may affect
FDA’s decisions. By providing greater clarity about FDA’s decision-making process, we
hope to improve the predictability, consistency, and transparency of the review process for
applicable devices.
We have also included a worksheet that reviewers will use in making benefit-risk
determinations as part of the premarket review process. The worksheet is attached as
Appendix B in this guidance, and examples of how reviewers might use the worksheet are
attached as Appendix C. By documenting reviewers’ thought processes as part of the
administrative record and, in certain cases, the publicly available summary of our
decision, 10 sponsors will have a better idea of the basis for FDA’s favorable decisions and

gain a greater understanding of what factors were considered as part of an approval or a
down-classification decision through the De Novo process. However, because the
weighting of the factors for a type of device may change over time – such as a device no
longer being a first-of-a-kind or the only available treatment as new therapies are approved
– the benefit-risk determination for a specific device at one point in time may no longer
represent the proper weighting of the factors for the same or similar type of device in the
future.

IV.

Factors FDA Considers in Making Benefit-Risk
Determinations

The factors described below are considered within the intended use of the device,
including the target population. These sections are not intended to provide devicespecific data requirements for the assessment of the factors or methods by which
inferences will be drawn from the data.

A. Assessment of the Benefits of Devices
Extent of the probable benefit(s): FDA assesses information provided in a PMA
application or De Novo request concerning the extent of the probable benefit(s) by taking
into account the following factors individually and in the aggregate:
-

The type of benefit(s) – examples include but are not limited to the device’s impact
on clinical management, patient health, and patient satisfaction in the target
population, such as significantly improving patient management and quality of life,
reducing the probability of death, aiding improvement of patient function, reducing
the probability of loss of function, and providing relief from symptoms. These
endpoints denoting clinical benefit are usually measured directly, but in some cases
may be demonstrated by use of validated surrogate endpoints. For diagnostics, a
benefit may be assessed according to the public health impact of a particular device,
due to its ability to identify a specific disease and therefore prevent its spread,
predict future disease onset, provide earlier diagnosis of diseases, or identify
patients more likely to respond to a given therapy.

-

The magnitude of the benefit(s) – we often assess benefit along a scale or
according to specific endpoints or criteria (types of benefits), or by evaluating
whether a pre-identified health threshold was achieved. The change in participants’
condition or clinical management as measured on that scale, or as determined by an
improvement or worsening of the endpoint, is what allows us to determine the
magnitude of the benefit in participants. Variation in the magnitude of the benefit
across a population may also be considered.

-

The probability of the patient experiencing one or more benefit(s) – based on
the data provided, it is sometimes possible to predict which patients may experience
a benefit, whereas other times this cannot be well predicted. The data may show
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
that a benefit may be experienced only by a small portion of patients in the target
population, or, on the other hand, that a benefit may occur frequently in patients
throughout the target population. It is also possible that the data will show that
different patient subgroups are likely to experience different benefits or different
levels of the same benefit. If the subgroups can be identified, the device may be
indicated for those subgroups. In some cases, however, the subgroups may not be
identifiable. In addition, we consider magnitude and probability together when
weighing benefits against risks. That is, a large benefit experienced by a small
proportion of participants may raise different considerations than does a small
benefit experienced by a large proportion of participants. For example, a large
benefit, even if experienced by a small population, may be significant enough to
outweigh risks, whereas a small benefit may not, unless experienced by a large
population of participants.
-

The duration of effect(s) (i.e., how long the benefit can be expected to last for the
patient) – some treatments are curative, whereas, some may need to be repeated
frequently over the patient’s lifetime. To the extent that it is known, the duration of
a treatment’s effect may directly influence how its benefit is defined. Treatments
that must be repeated over time may introduce greater risk, or the benefit
experienced may diminish each time the treatment is repeated.

B.

Assessment of the Risks of Devices

Extent of the probable risk(s)/harm(s): FDA assesses the extent of the probable
risk(s)/harm(s) by taking into account the following factors individually and in the aggregate:
-

Severity, types, number and rates 11 of harmful events associated with the use
of the device:12
o Device-related serious adverse events – those events that may have been
or were attributed to the use of the device and produce an injury or illness
that is life-threatening, results in permanent impairment or damage to the
body, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent
harm to the body. 13
o Device-related non-serious adverse events – those events that may have
been or were attributed to the use of the device and that do not meet the
criteria for classification as a device-related serious adverse event.
o Procedure-related complications – harms to the patient that would not be
included under serious or non-serious adverse events, and that do not

11

For purposes of this guidance, “rates” means the number of harmful events per patient or number of harmful
events per unit of time.
12
We have listed each type of harm individually for the purpose of clarifying which of the more commonly
recognized harms FDA would consider in benefit-risk assessments. In making benefit-risk assessments, FDA
does not consider each type of harm individually, but rather looks at the totality of the harmful events
associated with the device.
13
See 21 CFR 803.3.
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
directly result from use of the device. For example, anesthetic-related
complications associated with the implantation of a device. Similarly,
FDA would factor risks associated with the collection of human biological
materials into the benefit-risk determination. 14
-

Probability of a harmful event – the proportion of the intended population that
would be expected to experience a harmful event. FDA would factor whether an
event occurs once or repeatedly into the measurement of probability.

-

Duration of harmful events (i.e., how long the adverse consequences last) – some
devices can cause temporary, minor harm; some devices can cause repeated but
reversible harm; and other devices can cause permanent, debilitating injury. FDA
would consider the severity of the harm along with its duration.

-

Risk from false-positive or false-negative results for diagnostics – if a diagnostic
device gives a false-positive result, the patient might, for example, receive an
unnecessary treatment and incur all the risks that accompany that treatment, or
might be incorrectly diagnosed with a serious disease. If a diagnostic device gives a
false-negative result, the patient might not receive an effective treatment (thereby
missing out on the benefits that treatment would confer), or might not be diagnosed
with the correct disease or condition. The risks associated with false-positives and
false-negatives can be multifold, but are considered by FDA in light of probable
risks.

We also consider the number of different types of harmful events that may result from
using the device and the severity of their aggregate effect. When multiple harmful events
occur at once, they have a greater aggregate effect. For example, there may be a harmful
event that is considered minor when it occurs on its own, but, when it occurs along with
other harmful events, the aggregate effect on the patient can be substantial.

C. Additional Factors in the Assessment of the Probable
Benefits and Risks of Devices
Uncertainty – there is never 100% certainty when determining reasonable assurance of
safety and effectiveness of a device. However, the degree of certainty of the benefits and
risks of a device is a factor we consider when making benefit-risk determinations. 15
Factors such as poor design or poor conduct of clinical trials, or inadequate analysis of data,
can render the outcomes of the study unreliable. Additionally, for certain device types, it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish between a real effect and a placebo effect in the absence
of a trial design that is capable of masking investigators and participants. Furthermore, the
14
These considerations affect the risk profile of in vitro diagnostic devices when the biological material is
collected via an invasive procedure for the purpose of performing the diagnostic test.
15
See FDA guidance “Consideration of Uncertainty in Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in Medical
Device Premarket Approvals, De Novo Classifications, and Humanitarian Device Exemptions” available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/consideration-uncertaintymaking-benefit-risk-determinations-medical-device-premarket-approvals-de.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
repeatability of the study results, the validation of the analytical approach, and the results of
other similar studies and whether the study is the first of its kind or a standalone
investigation can all influence the level of certainty. In addition, the generalizability of the
trial results to the intended treatment and user population is important. For example, if the
device requires in-depth user training or specialization, the results of the clinical study may
not be generalizable to a wider physician population. Likewise, if the device is intended to
diagnose a disease in a subpopulation, it may not be useful in the general population. In
general, it is important to consider the degree to which a clinical trial population is
representative of the intended marketing or target population.
Patient-centric assessments and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) – We recognize
that patient-centric metrics such as validated health-related quality of life measures and
other Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) (e.g., scales or scores indicating patient’s
experience of pain or function) can be helpful for patients and health care practitioners
when discussing treatment options and decisions, and may be used to demonstrate benefit
for purposes of product approval. These types of metrics allow the physician to better
quantify the impact of the device on the patient’s well-being and help the patient make a
more informed decision.
Characterization of the disease – the treated or diagnosed condition, its clinical
manifestation, how it affects the patients who have it, how and whether a diagnosed
condition is treated, and the condition’s natural history and progression (i.e., does it get
progressively better or worse for the patient and at what expected rate) are all important
factors that FDA considers when characterizing disease and determining benefits and risks.
Patient perspectives – if the risks are identifiable and definable, risk tolerance will vary
among patients, and this will affect individual patient decisions as to whether the risks are
acceptable in exchange for a probable benefit. When making a benefit-risk determination at
the time of approval or De Novo classification, FDA recognizes that patient perspectives
on benefits and risks may reveal reasonable patients who are willing to tolerate a very high
level of risk to achieve a probable benefit, especially if that benefit results in an
improvement in quality of life. Rather than one-sided evaluations, patient preference
assessments should take into account both the patient’s willingness and unwillingness to
use a device or tolerate risk in exchange for probable benefit, and/or evaluate how patients
view trade-offs between benefits and risks of various treatment options.
Patient preference studies can provide insight on how patients value benefits in comparison
to risk. Patient preference information is defined as “the qualitative or quantitative
assessment of the relative desirability or acceptability to patients of specified alternatives
or choices among outcomes or other attributes that differ among alternative health
interventions.” 16 FDA may also consider the preferences of care-partners (e.g., parents)
and healthcare professionals to the extent they are relevant in the benefit-risk assessments
for a particular device subject to review in a PMA, HDE application, or De Novo request.

Preference Information – Voluntary Submission, Review in PMAs, HDE Applications, and
De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision Summaries and Device Labeling. 17
How data concerning patient risk tolerance and other patient-centered metrics are
developed will vary depending on a number of factors, including the nature of the disease
or condition and the availability of existing treatments, as well as the risks and benefits they
present. FDA encourages any sponsor that is considering developing such data to have
early interaction with the appropriate FDA review division. 18
When assessing such data in a PMA application or De Novo request, FDA realizes that
some patients are willing to take on a very high risk to achieve a small benefit, whereas
others are more risk averse. Therefore, FDA would consider evidence relating to patients’
perspective of what constitutes a meaningful benefit when determining if the device is
effective, as some set of patients may value a benefit more than others. It should also be
noted that if, for a certain device, the probable risks outweigh the probable benefits for all
reasonable patients, FDA would consider use of such a device to be inherently
unreasonable. 19
Patient preference information may demonstrate that most, if not all, of the patient
population with a specific disease or condition consider the benefit-risk tradeoffs
acceptable. Different factors can influence patient perspective on benefits and risks,
including:
-

Severity of disease or condition – patients suffering from very severe diseases
(i.e., those that are life-threatening) may tolerate more risk for devices used in
treatment. For diagnostic devices, individuals might be more averse to the risk of a
false negative result concerning a severe disease.

-

Disease chronicity – some patients with chronic diseases who have adapted to their
illness and minimized its interference with their daily lives may tolerate less risk
and require risky devices to deliver a greater treatment benefit, whereas other
patients who have suffered from a debilitating chronic illness over a long period of
time may tolerate higher risk to gain less benefit.

-

Availability of alternative treatment/diagnostic options (also see below) – if there
are no other treatment/diagnostic options available, patients may tolerate more risk
for even a small amount of benefit.

Availability of alternative treatments or diagnostics – when making benefit-risk
determinations, FDA considers whether other treatments or diagnostics, including non17

For the purposes of this guidance “unreasonable risk” refers to a risk that no set of reasonable patients
would be willing to endure to achieve a probable benefit.
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
device therapies, have been approved or cleared for the intended condition and patient
population. When considering other therapies, FDA takes into account how effective they
are; what known risks they pose; how they are used in current medical practice; their
benefit-risk profiles; and how well available alternatives address the needs of patients and
providers. For a device with a known benefit and a probability of high risk that treats a
condition for which no alternative treatments are available, FDA would consider the risk to
the patient of having no treatment if a device were not approved. For example, if a new
device has a very small significant benefit and there is significant uncertainty about that
benefit, we may still approve the product if there are no available alternative treatments and
the probable benefits outweigh the probable risks.
Risk mitigation – the use of mitigations, when appropriate, can minimize the probability
of a harmful event occurring and improve the benefit-risk profile. The most common form
of risk mitigation is to include appropriate information within labeling (e.g., warnings,
precautions, etc.), or to restrict the indication to a more limited use. Some harms can be
mitigated through other forms of risk communication, including training and patient
labeling. For in vitro diagnostics, risks may be mitigated by the use of complementary
diagnostic tests.
Postmarket data – the use of devices in a real world setting can provide a greater
understanding of their risks and benefits. FDA may consider the collection of postmarket
data as a way to clarify the magnitude and effect of mitigations or as a way to develop
additional information regarding benefits or risks for certain device types or in specific
patient populations when making a benefit-risk determination. FDA has the authority to
require post-approval studies for PMA devices and postmarket surveillance for PMA and
De Novo devices. 20 In addition, pursuant to section 513(a)(3)(C) of the FD&C Act, in
certain cases, such as if a device is likely to be denied approval due to uncertainty about its
effectiveness, FDA will consider whether postmarket data collection or other conditions
might be structured so as to permit approval subject to those conditions.21
These types of studies or other data that come to light after the device is used in the realworld setting may alter the benefit-risk profiles of certain devices, especially if new risks
are identified, or if the information can be used to confirm that certain risks have been
mitigated, to identify which patients are most likely to suffer adverse events, or to identify
more specifically how different groups of patients will respond.
Novel technology addressing unmet medical need – in assessing benefit and risk, FDA
considers whether a device represents or incorporates breakthrough technologies and
addresses an unmet medical need. A device may address unmet medical need by providing
a clinically meaningful advantage over existing technologies, providing a greater clinically
20

21 CFR 814.82 states that “FDA may impose postapproval requirements in a PMA approval order or by
regulation at the time of approval of the PMA or by regulation subsequent to approval.” In addition, under
section 522 of the FD&C Act, and FDA’s implementing regulations at 21 CFR Part 822, FDA may order
postmarket surveillance for certain Class II or Class III devices.

meaningful benefit than existing therapy, posing less risk than existing therapy, or
providing a treatment or means of diagnosis where no alternative is available.
It is not unusual for novel devices that address an unmet medical need to have relatively
small probable benefits, and FDA may determine the novel device to be reasonably safe
and effective even though the sponsor demonstrates a relatively small probable benefit. In
addition, the development of innovative technology may provide additional future benefits
to patients. With subsequent iterations of the device its benefit-risk profile may change
(e.g., the benefits may increase or the risks may be reduced), the expected level of safety
and effectiveness may change, and later versions may offer significant advantages over the
initial device. In these circumstances, in order to facilitate patient access to new devices
important for public health and to encourage innovation, we may tolerate greater
uncertainty in an assessment of benefit or risk than for most established technologies,
particularly when providers and patients have limited alternatives available.

Examples of Benefit-Risk Determinations

The examples below are hypothetical or simplified and are only offered for illustrative
purposes. The decisions described in these examples are not predictive of future FDA
decisions, rather they are hypothetical outcomes and are only intended to demonstrate how
FDA considers the factors described in this guidance when making benefit-risk
determinations. Similar scenarios or devices may result in different approval outcomes
depending on the individual performance characteristics of a particular device and the
population for which it is indicated.
A description of how FDA would consider these examples in the context of the reviewer
worksheet is included in Appendix C.

A. Hypothetical Examples
Example 1
An implantable device is developed to treat a severe, chronic condition for patients who
have failed all other treatment options.
The device is studied in a pivotal clinical trial with a design where all participants are
implanted with the device, but the device is only turned on in half of them. After
completion of the trial, inactive devices can be turned on. The primary endpoint for the trial
is the magnitude of the benefit, i.e., the trial is designed to measure how well the device
reduces the subject’s symptoms as compared to the current standard of care.
The results of the pivotal clinical trial revealed the following:
Benefits: Based on the clinical study, it is inferred that the probability that a patient will
experience a substantial benefit when the device is implanted is 75%. The trial was
considered to have met its primary endpoint. As a general matter, patients with this disease
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
who are able to maintain good mobility tend to have a longer life expectancy.
However, the duration of the benefit cannot be determined because the subjects in the study
were only followed for one year.
Risks: The study showed that there is a very low probability of occurrence (less than
3%) of harmful events after device implantation. However, all implanted devices that
require a surgical procedure carry with them their own set of risks. In this case it is known
from the literature that the implantation of this device is not routine and there is a
1% chance of death from surgery. In addition, permanent implants pose additional risks,
namely, they typically remain with the patient for life and may be difficult to remove. Even
in cases where the device is deactivated, it remains implanted and a risk of device fracture,
mechanical failure, or an adverse biological response to the device remains (the probability
is less than 3%).
Additional Factors:
Uncertainty: It is difficult to discern the mechanism of action by which subjects’
symptoms improved and whether the surgery may have contributed to such improvement.
Because the trial ended after one year, it is difficult to determine the duration of the benefit
beyond one year. There is only a 75% chance that a patient will experience total success
when implanted with the device.
Patient Perspectives: The sponsor provided data showing that most patients are willing to
take the risk of having the device implanted even for a 75% probability of benefit because
the alternative treatment options do not work for them and their symptoms are severe.
Risk Mitigation: The surgery to implant and explant (if necessary) the device is risky, but
the risks can be mitigated by requiring the device to be implanted by a specially trained
surgeon.
Approval/Non-Approval Considerations: The probability that a patient will experience
a benefit is relatively high (approximately 75%, if the clinical trial results hold for the
intended use population). In this particular case, FDA does not have the option to limit
the use of the device to only those patients who are most likely to experience a benefit
because the covariates that determine the subgroup of patients who would definitely
experience the benefit are unknown. In addition, this type of permanently implantable
device poses significant risks and there is some remaining uncertainty associated with the
trial results. However, for those patients in the target population who will experience a
benefit, symptom relief and improvement in quality of life is impressive and some patients
have expressed a willingness to tolerate the risks as a trade-off for obtaining such benefits.
In addition, the risks, although substantial, could be somewhat mitigated through limiting
the device use to clinicians with specialized training. Finally, the device treats a severe and
chronic disease for which there are few, if any, alternative treatments. Therefore, FDA is
likely to approve the device.
Example 2

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A novel device that replaces a patient’s memory is developed to treat Alzheimer’s disease,
dementia, and other memory disorders. The device is designed to be
permanently implanted and the patient must undergo a brain resection for the device to
work properly. The device functions by downloading all of a patient’s memories onto a
computer chip. Once the device is implanted, any residual memory the patient retained is
no longer accessible to the patient.
Benefits: A clinical trial of the device showed significant improvement in subjects who
were in the early stages of dementia and minimal improvement in subjects who were in
more advanced stages. Subjects who received implanted devices when the majority of their
memory was intact experienced the greatest benefit and their overall quality of life was
enhanced. Since the trial design accounted for two subgroups, subjects at the early stage of
the disease and subjects at advanced stages of the disease, it can be inferred that, if the
device is marketed, the patient population in early stages of the disease is likely to
experience significant improvement, whereas the patient population in advanced stages is
likely to experience only minimal improvement.
Risks: The surgery to implant the device is highly risky and is usually only performed by
specially trained neurosurgeons. Even with these procedural restrictions, it is known
from previous studies and literature that there is an 8% risk of serious adverse events from
the surgery alone. In addition, the clinical study showed that adverse events include partial
paralysis, loss of vision, loss of motor skills, vertigo, and insomnia (predictive probability
of 1%). Non-serious adverse events include temporary personality shifts, mood swings, and
slurred speech (predictive probability shown in the study was 5%).
Additional Factors:
Uncertainty: The number of subjects eligible and willing to enroll in the trial was small,
but the data were robust, and the trial was well-designed and conducted. The results of the
trial are generalizable. The study showed that the subjects likely to experience the best
results are the ones at early stages of memory loss.
Patient Perspectives: Because of the serious effect on patients’ quality of life from
diseases like Alzheimer’s, other forms of dementia, and other conditions that are associated
with severe memory loss, as well as the progressive nature of Alzheimer’s, some patients
with these conditions, and their care-partners, often have a very high tolerance for risk,
even a risk of serious adverse events, in exchange for a probable improvement of the
disease symptoms, and for alleviating the burden that they anticipate they will place on
family members during the later stages of the disease. Other patients, such as those at older
ages, may be less willing to tolerate such risks.
Patients who are at more advanced stages of their illness and experiencing more severe
symptoms are less likely to benefit from the device. Furthermore, their tolerance for risk is
difficult to assess due to their advanced disease.
Availability of Alternative Treatments or Diagnostics: There are currently no alternative
treatments available.

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Risk Mitigation: The risks associated with this device are great. The risks associated with
implantation and explantation (if necessary) can be somewhat mitigated by limiting use to
surgeons who have undergone special training, but the risks associated with personality
changes cannot be mitigated or predicted. The risks can also be mitigated by indicating the
device for patients at earlier stages of the disease who are more likely to benefit, and
explaining in the labeling using data from the clinical trial that individuals experiencing
more severe symptoms are less likely to benefit from the device.
Novel Technology Addressing Unmet Medical Need: There is no other similar technology
available. It is possible that future improvements of the device may allow treatment of
many other conditions that affect cognitive function. Moreover, there are no other
treatments that provide the level of benefit that this device confers on the target population.
Approval/Non-Approval Considerations: The device will confer a substantial benefit
for a defined and predictable subgroup of patients and a minimal benefit for another
defined and predictable subgroup. Even though the clinical trial was small, the quality of
the data was good and the resulting confidence intervals are narrow. The uncertainty about
results is the usual uncertainty resulting from drawing inferences from a sample in the
study to the population in the market. The risks associated with the device are great and
can be partially mitigated by training the physicians who implant/explant (if necessary) the
device. And, because patients experience the greatest benefit when the device is implanted
earlier, they must expose themselves to the risks for a longer period of time in order to reap
the greatest benefit; therefore, the patients who stand to benefit most also take on the
greatest amount of risk. The sponsor provided data showing that many patients who suffer
from memory disorders are willing to try novel approaches that have significant risk, in
order to preserve their memories and quality of life. The fact that there are no alternative
treatments for this condition is another important consideration. Even though the devicerelated risks are high, they are tolerable to some patients because of the probable benefits
they offer, and the progressive nature of the untreated condition. Furthermore, the risks are
known and quantifiable. Therefore, this device, although it poses substantial risk, may be
approvable based on all of these considerations taken in sum. The decision as to whether
or not to implant the device in a particular patient is a matter of patient preference (perhaps
with the involvement of a legally authorized representative) and medical judgment. After
full consideration of the likelihood of, and timeframe for, progression of disease and the
predictability of future impairment without intervention, FDA is likely to approve the
device as long as the labeling prominently addresses the 8% serious adverse event rate and
would provide through conditions of approval that only highly trained physicians will be
able to implant the device.
Example 3
A sponsor claims that its new in vitro diagnostic device (IVD), a serum-based test, can
differentiate patients with BI-RADS 4 mammography results into two groups, namely
patients with a low probability of having cancer for whom the physician may recommend
waiting a few months for additional testing, thus avoiding the morbidity associated with a
biopsy, and all other BI-RADS 4 patients for whom a biopsy would be recommended as
currently occurs under standard of care. The proposed intended use is:
18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

The in vitro diagnostic test measures 10 peptide analytes and yields a single qualitative
result. The test is intended for females 40 years or older following mammography of a
breast lesion with a BI-RADS of 4 result to aid physicians in the decision to recommend a
breast biopsy.
Negative test result (Low Risk): immediate biopsy is not recommended, wait a few months
for further tests.
Positive test result (High Risk): immediate biopsy is recommended.
Results from a clinical study in the intended use population (with biopsy results for all
subjects) are:

NPV=98.7% (225/228) PPV=56.4% (97/172)
Benefits: The main benefit from use of the device is avoiding morbidity associated with
an immediate biopsy for the 57% (228/400) of subjects whose test results indicate a low
probability of having breast cancer.
Risks: Among test-negative subjects, the observed (from immediate biopsy) prevalence of
cancer is 1.3% (3/228 = 1-NPV). The main risk from use of the device is in failing to
biopsy some BI-RADS 4 patients who have biopsy-detectible breast cancer, thus delaying
their diagnosis and treatment. Concerning this risk, the sponsor asserts that a clinically
acceptable prevalence for cancer among non-biopsied BI-RADS 4 subjects is 2% or
lower, because: a) BI-RADS 3 patients are usually counseled not to have an immediate
biopsy (waiting a few months, instead, for further evaluation), and b) the expected
prevalence of breast cancer among BI-RADS 3 patients is 2%. The benefit-risk odds
measurable from the clinical study is 75 (225/3), and the observed risk for non-biopsied
BI-RADS 4 subjects is lower than the expected risk in BI-RADS 3 patients.
Additional Factors:
Uncertainty: There are the usual uncertainties tied to statistical confidence intervals
surrounding observed study results.
The benefit-risk odds are not weighted for the clinical impact of avoiding biopsy morbidity
compared to the clinical impact of missing a biopsy-detectible cancer. That is, the type of
benefit is not necessarily commensurate with the type of risk.
19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
There is no assurance that the clinical impact of breast cancers missed among patients with
BI-RADS 4 mammography results is equivalent to the clinical impact of breast cancers
among patients who have BI-RADS 3 results. Hence, there is uncertainty about the extent
of the probable risk(s)/harm(s).
Test-negative BI-RADS 4 patients, who do not undergo biopsy, will receive no
histopathological assessment of benign disease that is present.
Patient Perspectives: Patients’ tolerance for delayed diagnosis and treatment of breast
cancer typically is low. This needs to be weighed against the value that patients place on
avoiding biopsy-related morbidity.
Availability of alternative treatments or diagnostics: There are no other in vitro diagnostic
devices cleared or approved for the new test’s intended use.
Risk mitigation: All women with negative test results will have follow-up visits for further
evaluation and testing.
Approval/Non-Approval Considerations: The kinds and probabilities of benefits and
risks are reasonably defined. A clinical practice reference for acceptable risk is put forth, to
which the test’s performance characteristics are aligned. Weighting of the different kinds
of benefits versus risks is not directly addressed, and additional information is needed to
establish whether the trade-offs are acceptable. Given that the benefits are uncertain and
the risk (for a very small number of patients) could be substantial, FDA might determine
that this device is not approvable, but would likely take it to an advisory panel prior to
making a decision.
Example 4 – De Novo
A new standalone therapeutic device is developed to provide enhanced stability for more
invasive, higher-risk implanted devices, which could otherwise affix themselves without
support. The device can be used to support a primary device at the time of implantation, or
can be added to an already-implanted device that is malfunctioning.
The device is studied in a prospective, multi-center, single-arm clinical study of over 200
subjects. The primary endpoint for the trial is the magnitude of the benefit, i.e., the trial is
designed to measure how well the device prevents movement and malfunction of the
primary device as compared to when it is implanted without the benefit of enhanced
stability.
The results of the pivotal clinical trial revealed the following:
Benefits: Through one year of follow-up, no subject experienced device movement and
only two subjects experienced complications related to the device malfunctioning. This is
a significant improvement over primary device performance when implanted alone and
gives a very high predictive probability that a patient receiving the device will not
experience device movement.
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Risks: Through one year of follow-up, there were no fractures of any primary device and
only a handful of malfunctions of the support system, none of which lead to serious
adverse events. The risks of failure of the support system are not high because even if the
support system fails, it is unlikely to lead to an overall failure of the primary device.
Even though all implanted devices that require a surgical procedure carry with them their
own set of risks (e.g., 1% chance of death from surgery), this device is implanted along
with the primary device and consequently does not require an additional surgery to
implant. Or, if it is placed to enhance the performance of a malfunctioning primary device,
it is put in during a surgery that would have otherwise been performed to fix the
malfunctioning primary device. Therefore, the data suggest that adding the support device
during surgery does not appear to increase the risk to the patient.
FDA determined that the support device poses low-to-moderate risk, the risks associated
with its use are well-defined and understood, and the risks can be mitigated by general and
special controls, which would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness
of the device. As a consequence, the support device is appropriate for the De Novo
pathway.
Additional Factors:
Uncertainty: The results of the pivotal clinical trial are limited to one-year of follow-up.
For a permanent, implantable device, longer follow-up times can reduce uncertainty
regarding the long-term safety and effectiveness of the device.
Patient Perspectives: Patients who receive the support device either are already
undergoing a surgery and implantation of the primary device or have had complications
with an existing device that the support device can be used to correct non-surgically. The
results of the pivotal clinical trial indicate that future patients stand to benefit from greater
stability of the primary device as a result of the use of the support device; therefore, most
patients stated they would accept the probable benefits of the device given the probable
risks.
Risk Mitigation: For this De Novo, FDA established special controls to mitigate the risks
associated with the device and make it appropriate to be classified under Class II. For this
device, FDA required demonstration of biocompatibility, sterility, safety and effectiveness
data (including clinical performance data, durability, compatibility, migration, resistance,
corrosion resistance, and delivery and deployment); evaluation of the MR-compatibility of
the device; validation of electromagnetic compatibility of device; limiting of the device to
prescription use; and clear instructions in the labeling regarding the safe and effective use
of the device. Since this device does not require an additional surgery to be implanted, the
surgical risk is not an issue.
Novel Technology Addressing Unmet Medical Need: This device is the first system that
can access and repair a failed or problematic primary device, providing surgeons with a
minimally-invasive option for re-affixing devices that are not properly positioned or that
have migrated, or those that are at risk of such complications.
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Approval/Non-Approval Considerations: The clinical trial results provide assurance of
at least one year of clinical effectiveness of the device. Furthermore, it is important to
consider that the device merely supports and supplements the effectiveness of another
device and its failure would not significantly affect the performance of the primary
device. The device does not pose risks that would rise to the level of a Class III device.
Any safety concerns regarding device failure can be readily addressed through special
controls related to appropriate testing and labeling. Given the device benefits, the ability
to mitigate risks through special controls, and the fact that this device is not lifesupporting or life-sustaining, FDA would be likely to grant a De Novo request to classify
this device into Class II.

B. Examples Based on Actual FDA Benefit-Risk
Determinations
o A device to treat a very rare cancer was tested in a clinical trial that demonstrated
with some uncertainty that the device performed as well as standard treatment, but
not better. However, use of the device did not have harmful effects as severe as
those associated with the standard anti- cancer treatment, and neither treatment was
curative. The cancer was rapidly progressive and terminal, so the participants had
very little time to live after they were diagnosed. FDA approved this device
because it gave patients access to a treatment that appeared to be equivalent to the
standard of care (with some uncertainty remaining), but that did not cause the same
severity of side effects.
o A permanently implanted cardiovascular monitoring device is intended to diagnose
heart failure. The device is studied, and the study shows that its use reduces the
number of days the subject is hospitalized for heart failure by about three.
However, the implantation procedure for the device requires that the patient be
hospitalized for two days. There are similar devices on the market that provide a
similar level of benefit as this device that do not require an implantation procedure.
FDA determined that the benefit of saving one day of hospitalization does not
outweigh the risk of complication from the surgery needed to implant the device
and found the device to be not approvable.
o A permanent birth control device can be placed in a woman’s reproductive system
through the vagina using a specialized delivery catheter. This device is a permanent
implant and is not intended to be removed. Explantation of the device would require
surgery. Clinical data show that the device is effective in preventing pregnancy over
a two-year period in women and the safety data show a low incidence of adverse
clinical events. However, study results also show that there are several cases where
the physician had difficulty correctly placing the device. In addition, the device was
noted to be fractured on a follow-up x-ray in a few study subjects. Given the
uncertainty of the long-term impact of the device, the possibility of device fracture
(which was not predicted in any of the bench and animal testing), and the safety and
effectiveness of alternative therapies, FDA deemed the device to be not approvable
for the intended patient population.
o An implanted device offers a unique design feature in comparison to the standard of
22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
care used to treat similar conditions. While the current standard of care works very
well, it has limitations associated with hindering the mobility of the patient; in
contrast, the novel implanted device does not affect patient mobility. Based upon the
effectiveness data from the clinical study, the device demonstrates that it has
significantly improved functional outcomes in comparison to the current standard of
care. However, from a safety perspective, the device did present different adverse
events that were different from those of the current standard of care. The risks can
be appropriately mitigated with training of surgical professionals as well as through
proper labeling. In the event the implant was to fail over time, the clinician could
also resort to the current standard of care. In this situation, despite the different
adverse events, the probable benefits outweighed the risks and FDA approved the
device.

Appendix A
Intersection of this Guidance with ISO 14971
ISO 14971 provides medical device manufacturers with a framework to systematically
manage the risks to people, property and the environment associated with the use of
medical devices. Specifically, the standard describes a process through which the medical
device manufacturer can identify hazards associated with a medical device, estimate and
evaluate the risks associated with these hazards, control these risks, and monitor the
effectiveness of those controls throughout the product’s lifecycle. 22 Implementing this
standard requires the user to make decisions on the acceptability of individual risks, and
overall residual risk for a medical device throughout its lifecycle.
ISO 14971 is an FDA-recognized standard, and assuring conformity with this standard may
help device manufacturers meet the design validation requirements specified in the Design
Controls section of Part 820 of FDA’s regulations governing quality systems. 23 Part of the
premarket review process is an evaluation (direct and/or indirect) of a medical device
manufacturer’s risk management decisions as they pertain to the requirements to market a
device in the United States. 24 The medical device manufacturer’s risk management
decisions that are directly and/or indirectly evaluated include those pertaining to risk
estimation, risk evaluation, risk acceptability, risk control measures, and overall residual
risk. Good documentation of risk management decisions by manufacturers helps to
streamline the premarket review process for both FDA and manufacturers. At some point,
after the manufacturer has completed its risk management activities associated with the
design phase of product development, the premarket submission process with FDA is
initiated, and the benefit-risk assessment takes on a different shape, which is the primary
focus of this guidance. This guidance discusses the considerations FDA makes when
assessing the benefit-risk profile of a device that has been designed to deliver the most
benefit for the least amount of risk and to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness.

Additionally, the manufacturer can engage FDA during the pre-submission stage regarding their proposed
risk management decisions related to clinical study design, biocompatibility testing, non-clinical animal
testing, bench testing, etc., and receive preliminary feedback on the adequacy of the decisions probability for
generating information that will establish whether the device meets the requirements to be marketed in the
United States.

Appendix B
Worksheet for Benefit-Risk Assessment
Instructions for FDA Staff: You should make your recommendation regarding the benefit-risk assessment
based on the totality of the evidence. The benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision whether to
approve the application, but it does not include an assessment of all applicable requirements for approval.
An indication from these tools that the benefits outweigh the risks does not mean that the application
satisfies other applicable requirements for a PMA application or a De Novo request.
The following questions are intended as a sequential method to help weigh various factors as part of the
benefit-risk assessment. As such, the questions are intended to help identify and explain which factors and
considerations are critical in making a benefit-risk assessment for a particular device. However, the
questions are not intended to suggest that considerations other than those listed in the completed
worksheet are irrelevant. This checklist should be used when non-clinical and/or clinical evidence has
been submitted in the form of valid scientific evidence.
Consider questions 1-8 for the proposed Indications for Use, until you reach a recommendation either that
the benefits outweigh the risks or to move to question 9, which prompts you to consider a modified
Indications for Use. When considering an acceptable, modified Indications for Use, interact with the
sponsor to reach agreement on a modified Indications for Use. However, as reflected under question 1, if
the evidence does not support a finding of benefit under the proposed Indications for Use (or narrowed
Indications for Use), or evidence does not support a finding of benefit for the proposed Indications for
Use and agreement on a modified Indications for Use is not achievable or applicable, the application
would not be approvable or grantable.

Assessment of Benefit
1. Is there any evidence of clinical benefit?
Is a clinical benefit demonstrated for the device for this indication (e.g., from any one or more
of the primary and/or secondary datasets or from associated real-world evidence)? Benefit
may be considered in terms of how a patient feels, functions, survives, or an acceptable
surrogate outcome. This information may be collected using validated tools such as quality
of life questionnaires. Benefit may also be considered in terms of convenience in managing
or diagnosing a disease or condition. Benefit should be considered based on the assessment
of the data, whether or not the results are statistically significant. Select any of the following
that demonstrate benefit, and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than seen
in the control group
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets a predetermined
performance goal

Assessment of Benefit-Risk
Instructions for FDA staff: Provide a recommendation based on the totality of the evidence. As noted
above, the benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision regarding whether to approve a PMA application
or grant a De Novo request but is not an assessment of all applicable requirements.
To approve a PMA application or grant a De Novo request, FDA must find, among other things, that there
is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device. FDA determines whether there is a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness by weighing any benefit to health from the use of the
device against any risk of injury or illness for such use, among other relevant factors. To grant a De Novo
request, FDA must find that general controls or general and special controls provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device.
If you answer “yes” for any Q5-8, explain your rationale for how the benefits outweigh the risks. You
should also consider and recommend actions that would enhance the benefit-risk profile of the device,
such as modifications to the proposed labeling, which may include additional appropriate warnings and
precautions, instructions for use, or presentation of data, to help ensure the product labeling is transparent
with respect to the benefits and risks.
If you answer “unable to conclude” for Q5-8, please provide the information that you believe would be
needed to support a determination that the benefits outweigh the risks for the Indications for Use under
consideration in the summary text boxes and also proceed to Q9.

Worksheet for Hypothetical Example 1
Instructions for FDA staff: You should make your recommendation regarding the benefit-risk assessment
based on the totality of the evidence. The benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision whether to
approve the application, but it does not include an assessment of all applicable requirements for approval.
An indication from these tools that the benefits outweigh the probable risks does not mean that the
application satisfies other applicable requirements for a PMA application or a De Novo request.
The following questions are intended as a sequential method to help weigh various factors as part of the
benefit-risk assessment. As such, the questions are intended to help identify and explain which factors and
considerations are critical in making a benefit-risk assessment for a particular device. However, the
questions are not intended to suggest that considerations other than those listed in the completed
worksheet are irrelevant. This checklist should be used when non-clinical and/or clinical evidence has
been submitted in the form of valid scientific evidence.
Consider questions 1-8 for the proposed Indications for Use, until you reach a recommendation either that
the benefits outweigh the risks or to move to question 9, which prompts you to consider a modified
Indications for Use. When considering an acceptable, modified Indications for Use, interact with the
sponsor to reach agreement on a modified Indications for Use. However, as reflected under question 1, if
the evidence does not support a finding of benefit under the proposed Indications for Use (or narrowed
Indications for Use), or evidence does not support a finding of benefit for the proposed Indications for
Use and agreement on a modified Indications for Use is not achievable or applicable, the application
would not be approvable or grantable.

Assessment of Benefit
1. Is there any evidence of clinical benefit?
Is a clinical benefit demonstrated for the device for this indication (e.g., from any one or more
of the primary and/or secondary datasets or from associated real-world evidence)? Benefit
may be considered in terms of how a patient feels, functions, survives, or an acceptable
surrogate outcome. This information may be collected using validated tools such as quality
of life questionnaires. Benefit may also be considered in terms of convenience in managing
or diagnosing a disease or condition. Benefit should be considered based on the assessment
of the data, whether or not the results are statistically significant. Select any of the following
that demonstrate benefit, and then answer the question in the box below.
☒ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than seen
in the control group
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets a predetermined
performance goal
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets or surpasses a
minimally important clinical difference
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than
changes seen with other available modalities for the disease or condition
☒ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that would be meaningful to
patients considering the severity, chronicity, etc., of the condition, taking into
consideration patient-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life
Other:
☐ A favorable change in non-clinical data or modeling that is deemed to be predictive of
clinical outcomes
☐ A favorable clinical performance characteristic (e.g., sensitivity/PPA, 27
specificity/NPA 28, etc.) for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring or
treatment selection
☐ Acceptable performance characteristics for analytical validation of the device
☒ Other(s): Improved mobility. Longer life expectancy.
☐ None

2. What is the extent of uncertainty for the benefits?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty,
if applicable, in the data that affect your assessment of the clinical benefit. Consider sources
of uncertainty related to clinical and/or analytical performance characteristics (e.g.,
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, reproducibility, as applicable). Select any of the
following that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the benefits, and then answer the
question in the box below.
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Wide confidence intervals surrounding the point estimate(s) and/or odds ratio(s))
☐ A significantly underpowered study with statistical insignificance in outcome
measure(s)
☐ High subject or specimen loss-to-follow-up at critical assessment point(s)
☒ Large amount of missing data at critical assessment time(s) +/- imputation
☐ Significant number of major protocol deviations
☐ Impact of confounding interventions or physiological factors
☐ Inconsistent user experience or user experience not representative of likely real-world
user
☐ Unclear correlation between non-clinical data, pre-selected enriched data, or computer
modeling and clinical performance
☐ Surrogate endpoint has not yet been demonstrated to correlate with a clinical outcome
☐ Real-World Evidence (RWE) is not relevant or reliable for the purposes of the
proposed analysis
☐ Inspectional findings
☐ Study design or results lead to lack of generalizability for the intended use population
or specific clinical subpopulations.
☐ Physiological or clinically meaningful range of the diagnostic output is unknown, or
generalizability of proposed clinical cut-off is unknown
☐ Imperfect comparator method used to calculate performance characteristics
☒ Other(s): The duration of benefit is unclear.
☐ None
Q2: What is the extent of uncertainty for the benefits?
☐ Low  Continue to Question 3
☒ Med  Continue to Question 3
☐ High  Continue to Question 3

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The probability that a patient will experience a substantial benefit in terms of reduction in symptoms
when the device is implanted is 75%. The data also support improved mobility, which is anticipated to

38

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
lead to longer life expectancy. The patients who experience the benefit value it substantially. Patients
also value the opportunity to achieve the benefit. The study was well designed and conducted. Follow-up
was only 1 year and there was missing data, but sensitivity analyses were conducted, and the results are
relatively robust.

Assessment of Risk
3. Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
Select any of the following elements that demonstrate sources of known/probable risks that are
more than minimal, then answer the question in the box below.
☒ Adverse events (AEs) or outcomes related to the device itself
☐ AEs or outcomes related to the use of the device or procedure to use the device
☐ AEs or outcomes related to anesthesia or sedation to use the device
☐ AEs or outcomes due to subsequent tests/treatments needed (e.g., radiation from CT scans)
☐ AEs or outcomes, not seen in the study/data, but probable based on “class effect” or events
known to occur with similar technologies
☐ False positive/false negative/failed to provide a result for diagnostics
☐ Treatment or diagnostic intended to be used as a standalone rather than an adjunctive use
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q3: Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
☒ YES  Continue to Question 4
☐ NO  Continue to Question 4
4. What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty, if
applicable, in the data regarding the adverse events/outcomes or risks. Select any of the following
that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the risks, and then answer the question in the box
below.
☐ Insufficient patient numbers to detect serious events or false positives/false negatives
☐ Insufficient duration of follow-up to detect delayed/late events
☐ Lack of data on repeated exposure to the device/use
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Proper evaluations not performed as part of the study protocol to adequately detect certain AEs
☐ Poor or inconsistent adverse event definitions and documentation
☐ Events likely confounded by, and attributed to, other comorbidities or treatment modalities
☐ High subject loss-to-follow-up at critical assessment point(s)
☐ Large amount of missing data at critical assessment time(s) +/- imputation

☐ Significant number of major protocol deviations
☐ Inconsistent user experience or user experience not representative of likely real-world user
☐ Concerns related to performance characteristics (e.g., sensitivity/PPA, specificity/NPA)
☐ Imperfect comparator method used to calculate performance characteristics
☒ Other(s): No information is provided regarding removal of the permanent implant. If
necessary, removal would be difficult.
☐ None
Q4: What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
☐ Low  Continue to Question 5
☒ Med  Continue to Question 5
☐ High  Continue to Question 5
Summary of the Assessment of Risk
If you answered “No” to Question 3 but “High” to Question 4, please explain here.
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Known risks are those typically associated with permanent, implantable devices and include device
fracture, mechanical failure or adverse biological response (less than 3% chance). However, all implanted
devices that require a surgical procedure carry with them their own set of risks. In this case it is known
from the literature that the implantation of this device is not routine and there is a 1% chance of death
from surgery. The device-related adverse events last as long as the device remains implanted but are
expected to be reversed by removing the device. However, no information about device removal is
provided, and if necessary, removal is expected to be difficult.

Assessment of Benefit-Risk
Instructions for FDA staff: Provide a recommendation based on the totality of the evidence. As noted
above, the benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision regarding whether to approve a PMA application
or grant a De Novo request but is not an assessment of all applicable requirements.
To approve a PMA application or grant a De Novo request, FDA must find, among other things, that there
is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device. FDA determines whether there is a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness by weighing any benefit to health from the use of the
device against any risk of injury or illness for such use, among other relevant factors. To grant a De Novo
request, FDA must find that general controls or general and special controls provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device.
If you answer “yes” for any Q5-8, explain your rationale for how the benefits outweigh the risks. You
should also consider and recommend actions that would enhance the benefit-risk profile of the device,
such as modifications to the proposed labeling, which may include additional appropriate warnings and
precautions, instructions for use, or presentation of data, to help ensure the product labeling is transparent
with respect to the benefits and risks.
If you answer “unable to conclude” for Q5-8, please provide the information that you believe would be
needed to support a determination that the benefits outweigh the risks for the Indications for Use under
consideration in the summary text boxes and also proceed to Q9.
Q5: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, considering the assessment of Benefit
and Risk and the extent of uncertainty identified above?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☐ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of relevant factors is appropriate – Continue to Q6

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The probability that a patient will experience a benefit is relatively high (approximately 75%, if the
clinical trial results hold for the intended use population). In this particular case, FDA does not have the
option to limit the use of the device to only those patients who are most likely to experience a benefit
because the covariates that determine the subgroup of patients who would definitely experience the
benefit are unknown. In addition, this type of permanently implantable device poses significant risks and
there is a fair amount of remaining uncertainty associated with the trial results, especially around the lack
of information regarding device removal.

Worksheet for Hypothetical Example 2
Instructions for FDA staff: You should make your recommendation regarding the benefit-risk assessment
based on the totality of the evidence. The benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision whether to
approve the application, but it does not include an assessment of all applicable requirements for approval.
An indication from these tools that the benefits outweigh the risks does not mean that the application
satisfies other applicable requirements for a PMA application or a De Novo request.
The following questions are intended as a sequential method to help weigh various factors as part of the
benefit-risk assessment. As such, the questions are intended to help identify and explain which factors and
considerations are critical in making a benefit-risk assessment for a particular device. However, the
questions are not intended to suggest that considerations other than those listed in the completed
worksheet are irrelevant. This checklist should be used when non-clinical and/or clinical evidence has
been submitted in the form of valid scientific evidence.
Consider questions 1-8 for the proposed Indications for Use, until you reach a recommendation either that
the benefits outweigh the risks or to move to question 9, which prompts you to consider a modified
Indications for Use. When considering an acceptable, modified Indications for Use, interact with the
sponsor to reach agreement on a modified Indications for Use. However, as reflected under question 1, if
the evidence does not support a finding of benefit under the proposed Indications for Use (or narrowed
Indications for Use), or evidence does not support a finding of benefit for the proposed Indications for
Use and agreement on a modified Indications for Use is not achievable or applicable, the application
would not be approvable or grantable.

Assessment of Benefit
1. Is there any evidence of clinical benefit?
Is a clinical benefit demonstrated for the device for this indication (e.g., from any one or more
of the primary and/or secondary datasets or from associated real-world evidence)? Benefit
may be considered in terms of how a patient feels, functions, survives, or an acceptable
surrogate outcome. This information may be collected using validated tools such as quality
of life questionnaires. Benefit may also be considered in terms of convenience in managing
or diagnosing a disease or condition. Benefit should be considered based on the assessment
of the data, whether or not the results are statistically significant. Select any of the following
that demonstrate benefit, and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than seen
in the control group
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets a predetermined
performance goal
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets or surpasses a
minimally important clinical difference
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than
changes seen with other available modalities for the disease or condition
☒ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that would be meaningful to
patients considering the severity, chronicity, etc., of the condition, taking into
consideration patient-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life
Other:

2. What is the extent of uncertainty for the benefits?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty,
if applicable, in the data that affect your assessment of the clinical benefit. Consider sources
of uncertainty related to clinical and/or analytical performance characteristics (e.g.,
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, reproducibility, as applicable). Select any of the
following that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the benefits, and then answer the
question in the box below.
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Wide confidence intervals surrounding the point estimate(s) and/or odds ratio(s)
☐ A significantly underpowered study with statistical insignificance in outcome
measure(s)
☐ High subject or specimen loss-to-follow-up at critical assessment point(s)
☐ Large amount of missing data at critical assessment time(s) +/- imputation
☐ Significant number of major protocol deviations
☐ Impact of confounding interventions or physiological factors
☐ Inconsistent user experience or user experience not representative of likely real-world
user
☐ Unclear correlation between non-clinical data, pre-selected enriched data, or computer
modeling and clinical performance
☐ Surrogate endpoint has not yet been demonstrated to correlate with a clinical outcome
☐ Real World Evidence (RWE) is not relevant or reliable for the purposes of the
proposed analysis
☐ Inspectional findings
☐ Study design or results lead to lack of generalizability for the intended use population
or specific clinical subpopulations.
☐ Physiological or clinically meaningful range of the diagnostic output is unknown, or
generalizability of proposed clinical cut-off is unknown
☐ Imperfect comparator method used to calculate performance characteristics
☒ Other(s): small sample size
☐ None
Q2: What is the degree of uncertainty for the benefits?
☐ Low  Continue to Question 3
☒ Med  Continue to Question 3
☐ High  Continue to Question 3

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Patients place an enormous value on the benefit, which include memory preservation and improvement of
quality of life. The magnitude of benefit is large for patients in early stages of the disease; smaller for

48

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
patients in later stages of the disease.
The trial was designed to study two subgroups, subjects at early stages of the disease and subjects at late
stages of the disease. It can be inferred that benefits will be higher for patients in early stages of the
disease and lower for patients in later stages of the disease. While the number of subjects eligible and
willing to enroll in the trial was small, the data were robust, and the trial was well-designed and
conducted. The results of the trial are generalizable.

Assessment of Risk
3. Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
Select any of the following elements that demonstrate sources of known/probable risks that are
more than minimal, then answer the question in the box below.
☒ Adverse events (AEs) or outcomes related to the device itself
☒ AEs or outcomes related to the use of the device or procedure to use the device
☒ AEs or outcomes related to anesthesia or sedation to use the device
☐ AEs or outcomes due to subsequent tests/treatments needed (e.g., radiation from CT scans)
☒ AEs or outcomes, not seen in the study/data, but probable based on “class effect” or events
known to occur with similar technologies
☐ False positive/false negative/failed to provide a result for diagnostics
☐ Treatment or diagnostic intended to be used as a standalone rather than an adjunctive use
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q3: Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
☒ YES  Continue to Question 4
☐ NO  Continue to Question 4
4. What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty, if
applicable, in the data regarding the adverse events/outcomes or risks. Select any of the following
that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the risks, and then answer the question in the box
below.
☐ Insufficient patient numbers to detect serious events or false positives/false negatives
☐ Insufficient duration of follow-up to detect delayed/late events
☐ Lack of data on repeated exposure to the device/use
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Proper evaluations not performed as part of the study protocol to adequately detect certain AEs
☐ Poor or inconsistent adverse event definitions and documentation
☐ Events likely confounded by, and attributed to, other comorbidities or treatment modalities

49

Q4: What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
☐ Low  Continue to Question 5
☒ Med  Continue to Question 5
☐ High  Continue to Question 5
Summary of the Assessment of Risk
If you answered “No” to Question 3 but “High” to Question 4, please explain here.
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The risks associated with this device are great. The surgery to implant the device is highly risky. Serious
adverse events include partial paralysis, loss of vision, loss of motor skills, vertigo, and insomnia. Nonserious adverse events include temporary personality shifts, mood swings, and slurred speech. It is
known from previous studies and literature that there is an 8% risk of serious adverse events from the
surgery alone. 8% risk of death from surgery; 1% chance of a serious adverse event; and 5% chance of a
non-serious adverse event. When considered together, these present a high risk. Patients in the early
stages of the disease will have higher risks due to longer exposure to the device.

Assessment of Benefit-Risk
Instructions for FDA staff: Provide a recommendation based on the totality of the evidence. As noted
above, the benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision regarding whether to approve a PMA application
or grant a De Novo request but is not an assessment of all applicable requirements.
To approve a PMA application or grant a De Novo request, FDA must find, among other things, that there
is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device. FDA determines whether there is a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness by weighing any benefit to health from the use of the
device against any risk of injury or illness for such use, among other relevant factors. To grant a De Novo
request, FDA must find that general controls or general and special controls provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device.
If you answer “yes” for any Q5-8, explain your rationale for how the benefits outweigh the risks. You
should also consider and recommend actions that would enhance the benefit-risk profile of the device,
such as modifications to the proposed labeling, which may include additional appropriate warnings and
precautions, instructions for use, or presentation of data, to help ensure the product labeling is transparent
with respect to the benefits and risks.
If you answer “unable to conclude” for Q5-8, please provide the information that you believe would be
needed to support a determination that the benefits outweigh the risks for the Indications for Use under
consideration in the summary text boxes and also proceed to Q9.
Q5: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, considering the assessment of Benefit
and Risk and the extent of uncertainty identified above?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☐ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of relevant factors is appropriate – Continue to Q6

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The device will confer a substantial benefit for a defined and predictable subgroup of patients and a
minimal benefit for another defined and predictable subgroup. Even though the clinical trial was small,
the quality of the data was good and the resulting confidence intervals are reasonably narrow. The
uncertainty about results is based on the small sample size and the usual uncertainty resulting from
drawing inferences from a sample in the study to the population in the market. The risks associated with
the device are great. Based solely on the benefits, risks and degree of uncertainty, it cannot be concluded
that the benefits outweigh the risks.

6. Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, when taking into account the following additional
considerations? Select relevant considerations, and then answer the question in the box below.

51

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
☒ Understanding of patient willingness or unwillingness to accept a large extent of uncertainty in
the benefits and/or risks
☐ Available patient preference information (PPI) showing patient willingness or unwillingness to
accept the risks in exchange for the benefits. In circumstances where it is not feasible to
obtain PPI (e.g., some pediatric or impaired patient populations), care-partner perspectives
may be considered.
☒ Understanding of care-partner perspectives on the benefits and risks for a device intended to
provide benefit to the care-partner (e.g., ease of care)
☐ Understanding of healthcare professional perspectives on the benefits and risks for a device
intended to provide benefit to the healthcare professional (e.g., reduction of radiation
exposure)
☐ Available qualitative or quantitative PPI on the relative desirability or acceptability to patients
of outcomes or other attributes that differ among alternative health interventions
☐ Understanding how the size of the patient population impacts feasibility of conducting large
trials and affects public health need for both rare and common diseases or conditions
☒ Understanding that the device represents novel technology for which the current device
technology is different
☒ Ability to manage or diagnose the condition and consideration of natural history of disease
progression in the absence of the intervention or diagnostic information with the device
under review
☒ No legally marketed alternative medical product or medical intervention exists, or the device
offers advantages over existing alternatives
☒ The device fills an unmet medical need or niche for more effective treatment or diagnosis of
life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease/conditions
☐ The device avoids serious harm associated with available therapies for the disease or condition
☐ The adverse events associated with use of the device are reversible
☐ Type of intervention required to address the harmful event (e.g., medication, surgery)
☐ The study is a first of a kind (robustness of the analysis)
☐ Tipping point and/or worst-case sensitivity analysis continuing to show clinical benefit
☐ Understanding of mechanistic plausibility and/or “class effect” (e.g., familiarity with similar
technology)
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q6: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, when taking into account additional
relevant considerations?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☒ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of risk mitigation measures is appropriate – Continue to Q7
Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, taking into account additional relevant considerations
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The sponsor provided data showing that many patients who suffer from memory disorders are willing to
try novel approaches that have significant risk, in order to preserve their memories and quality of life. The

52

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
fact that there are no alternative treatments for this condition is another important consideration. Even
though the device-related risks are high, they are tolerable to some patients because of the probable
benefits the device offers, and the progressive nature of the untreated condition. However, given the
small sample size and the high-risk nature of the device, including the fact that this is a permanent
implant, the benefits do not outweigh the risks without additional labeling limitations and postmarket data
collection.
7. Can the risks be mitigated, so that Benefits outweigh the Risks? Consider if the Benefits
outweigh the Risks if risk mitigation strategies are incorporated to lower the probability of
a harmful event occurring and improve the benefit-risk profile of the device. Select relevant
considerations, and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ Additional descriptions of known and probable benefits and risks in physician and patient
labeling including appropriate Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions and
description of the clinical events
☐ Additional warnings noting limitations of safety information (e.g., “The safety of the use of
this device in [situation] has not been evaluated.”)
☐ Labeling the device “Prescription Only”
Training:
☒ Limitation to caregivers with certain qualifications or clinical training
☐ Limit to users with a minimum set of qualifications and/or training
☒ Physician/user training program
Other:
☐ Device tracking
☒ Other(s): requiring the labeling to prominently address the 8% serious adverse event rate
☐ None
Q7: Can the risks be mitigated, so that Benefits outweigh the Risks?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☒ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of postmarket actions is appropriate – Continue to Q8
Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, considering risk mitigation strategies
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
While the risks associated with the device are great, they can be partially mitigated by prominently
explaining the 8% serious adverse event rate in the labeling, limiting device to use to physicians with
appropriate expertise and by training the physicians who implant/explant (if necessary) the device.
However, without postmarket data collection, the probable benefits do not outweigh the probable risks.

8. Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks considering the use of postmarket actions? Select
appropriate postmarket action(s), and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ Collection of additional and/or confirmatory non-clinical performance data in the postmarket

☒ Collection of additional and/or confirmatory clinical data in the postmarket space (e.g., postapproval study, postmarket surveillance)
If either non-clinical or clinical performance data collections in the postmarket space are
checked, consider:
☒ The feasibility of postmarket data collection and likelihood that postmarket data

appropriate for labeling to include description of postmarket data collection and its
purpose

Q8: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks considering the use of postmarket actions?
☒ Yes – The benefits outweigh the risks
☐ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – Continue to Q9
Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, considering postmarket actions
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
After full consideration of the probable benefits and risks provided by the device, the likelihood of, and
timeframe for, progression of disease and the predictability of future impairment without intervention,
FDA is likely to approve the device as long as the labeling and training requirements described above are
addressed and post-approval study is conducted to evaluate longer term performance, including
maintenance of effectiveness, long term adverse events, and device duration.

Summary of the Assessment of Risk
If you answered “No” to Question 3 but “High” to Question 4, please explain here.
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The main risk from use of the device is in failing to biopsy some BI-RADS 4 patients who have biopsydetectable breast cancer, thus delaying their diagnosis and treatment. Concerning this risk, the sponsor
asserts that a clinically acceptable negative predictive value for cancer among non-biopsied BI-RADS 4
subjects is 98% or higher. This cut-off was based on the clinical acceptability of a 2% prevalence for
cancer in BI-RADS 3 patients who are usually counseled not to have an immediate biopsy (waiting a few
months, instead, for further evaluation, such as follow-up diagnostic imaging in 6 months). There is no
assurance that the clinical impact of breast cancers missed among patients with BI-RADS 4
mammography results is equivalent to the clinical impact of breast cancers among patients who have BIRADS 3 results. Hence, there is high uncertainty about the extent of the probable risk(s)/harm(s).

Instructions for FDA staff: Provide a recommendation based on the totality of the evidence. As noted
above, the benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision regarding whether to approve a PMA application
or grant a De Novo request but is not an assessment of all applicable requirements.
To approve a PMA application or grant a De Novo request, FDA must find, among other things, that there

assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device.
If you answer “yes” for any Q5-8, explain your rationale for how the benefits outweigh the risks. You
should also consider and recommend actions that would enhance the benefit-risk profile of the device,
such as modifications to the proposed labeling, which may include additional appropriate warnings and
precautions, instructions for use, or presentation of data, to help ensure the product labeling is transparent

If you answer “unable to conclude” for Q5-8, please provide the information that you believe would be
needed to support a determination that the benefits outweigh the risks for the Indications for Use under
consideration in the summary text boxes and also proceed to Q9.
Q5: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, considering the assessment of Benefit
and Risk and the extent of uncertainty identified above?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☐ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of relevant factors is appropriate – Continue to Q6

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Based solely on the benefits and risks as demonstrated by the performance data and its associated
uncertainties, the benefits associated with avoiding a biopsy-related morbidity do not outweigh the risks
associated with missing a biopsy detectable cancer. Based on the available information, FDA cannot
establish that there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the proposed benefit to health
and additional information is needed to establish that the overall benefits outweigh the risks.

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, taking into account additional relevant considerations
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Detailed patient preference information (PPI) showing patient willingness to accept the probable risks in
exchange for the proposed benefits was not obtained for this in vitro diagnostic. Care-partner and/or
healthcare professional perspectives were also not obtained. However, patients’ tolerance for delayed
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer typically is low. This needs to be weighed against the value that

62

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
patients place on avoiding biopsy-related morbidity. Delayed diagnosis of breast cancer may result in a
more advanced stage of cancer requiring serious medical intervention, such as aggressive chemotherapy,
surgery or radiation, and may be associated with increased mortality. There are no legally marketed
alternative in vitro diagnostics, it is not apparent that the device offers advantages over existing
alternatives. It is unknown if patients with missed breast cancer diagnoses and BI-RADS 4
mammography results will have similar clinical outcomes to patients with BI-RADS 3 mammography
results. Therefore, the additional relevant considerations do not clearly demonstrate that the benefits
outweigh the risks for the proposed assay.

7. Can the risks be mitigated, so that Benefits outweigh the Risks? Consider if the Benefits
outweigh the Risks if risk mitigation strategies are incorporated to lower the probability of
a harmful event occurring and improve the benefit-risk profile of the device. Select relevant
considerations, and then answer the question in the box below.
☒ Additional descriptions of known and probable benefits and risks in physician and patient
labeling including appropriate Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions and
description of the clinical events
☐ Additional warnings noting limitations of safety information (e.g., “The safety of the use of
this device in [situation] has not been evaluated.”)
☐ Labeling the device “Prescription Only”
Training:
☐ Limitation to caregivers with certain qualifications or clinical training
☐ Limit to users with a minimum set of qualifications and/or training
☒ Physician/user training program
Other:
☐ Device tracking
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q7: Can the risks be mitigated, so that Benefits outweigh the Risks?
☐ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☒ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of postmarket actions is appropriate – Continue to Q8
Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, considering risk mitigation strategies
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Additional risk mitigation strategies are not sufficient for the proposed assay, due to the underlying
uncertainty regarding clinical outcomes in patients with a missed breast cancer diagnosis and a BI-RADS
4 mammography result. Additional descriptions of the benefits and risks cannot be added to the device
labeling due to limited knowledge of the clinical outcomes associated with a missed cancer diagnosis.
Similarly, there is insufficient information to establish an effective physician/user training program to

63

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
mitigate the risks.

8. Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks considering the use of postmarket actions? Select
appropriate postmarket action(s), and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ Collection of additional and/or confirmatory non-clinical performance data in the postmarket
space
☐ Collection of additional and/or confirmatory clinical data in the postmarket space (e.g., postapproval study, postmarket surveillance)
If either non-clinical or clinical performance data collections in the postmarket space are
checked, consider:
☐ The feasibility of postmarket data collection and likelihood that postmarket data
collection will be completed within a reasonable timeframe
☐ Whether it would be appropriate for labeling to include description of postmarket data
collection and its purpose
☐ Other(s):
☒ None
Q8: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks considering the use of postmarket actions?
☐ Yes – The benefits outweigh the risks
☒ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – Continue to Q9
Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk, considering postmarket actions
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
We are unable to conclude that benefits outweigh risks based on the available data, and due to the high
degree of uncertainty and the clinical impact of a missed cancer diagnosis, postmarket actions are not
sufficient to address these issues.

Q9: Is there any evidence of clinical benefit for a modified Indications for Use?
☐ Yes  Return to Q1 and proceed with modified Indications for Use
☒ No  Do not approve/grant
At this time, FDA is unable to approve the PMA because we are unable to conclude that the benefits
outweigh the risks. Given that the benefits are uncertain and the risk for a small number of patients could
be substantial, FDA cannot conclude that there is reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness to
support approval of the premarket application at this time, however an advisory panel may be considered
to further evaluate the benefit-risk profile of the assay for the proposed or a modified Indications for Use.

Worksheet for Hypothetical Example 4
Instructions for FDA staff: You should make your recommendation regarding the benefit-risk assessment
based on the totality of the evidence. The benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision whether to
approve the application, but it does not include an assessment of all applicable requirements for approval.
An indication from these tools that the benefits outweigh the risks does not mean that the application
satisfies other applicable requirements for a PMA application or a De Novo request.
The following questions are intended as a sequential method to help weigh various factors as part of the
benefit-risk assessment. As such, the questions are intended to help identify and explain which factors and
considerations are critical in making a benefit-risk assessment for a particular device. However, the
questions are not intended to suggest that considerations other than those listed in the completed
worksheet are irrelevant. This checklist should be used when non-clinical and/or clinical evidence has
been submitted in the form of valid scientific evidence.
Consider questions 1-8 for the proposed Indications for Use, until you reach a recommendation either that
the benefits outweigh the risks or to move to question 9, which prompts you to consider a modified
Indications for Use. When considering an acceptable, modified Indications for Use, interact with the
sponsor to reach agreement on a modified Indications for Use. However, as reflected under question 1, if
the evidence does not support a finding of benefit under the proposed Indications for Use (or narrowed
Indications for Use), or evidence does not support a finding of benefit for the proposed Indications for
Use and agreement on a modified Indications for Use is not achievable or applicable, the application
would not be approvable or grantable.

Assessment of Benefit
1. Is there any evidence of clinical benefit?
Is a clinical benefit demonstrated for the device for this indication (e.g., from any one or more
of the primary and/or secondary datasets or from associated real-world evidence)? Benefit
may be considered in terms of how a patient feels, functions, survives, or an acceptable
surrogate outcome. This information may be collected using validated tools such as quality
of life questionnaires. Benefit may also be considered in terms of convenience in managing
or diagnosing a disease or condition. Benefit should be considered based on the assessment
of the data, whether or not the results are statistically significant. Select any of the following
that demonstrate benefit, and then answer the question in the box below.
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than seen
in the control group
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets a predetermined
performance goal
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that meets or surpasses a
minimally important clinical difference
☒ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that is equal to or greater than
changes seen with other available modalities for the disease or condition
☐ A favorable change in at least 1 clinical assessment that would be meaningful to
patients considering the severity, chronicity, etc., of the condition, taking into
consideration patient-reported outcomes and health-related quality of life
Other:
☐ A favorable change in non-clinical data or modeling that is deemed to be predictive of
clinical outcomes
☐ A favorable clinical performance characteristic (e.g., sensitivity/PPA, 33
specificity/NPA 34, etc.) for screening, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring or
treatment selection
☐ Acceptable performance characteristics for analytical validation of the device
☐ Other(s):
☐ None

2. What is the extent of uncertainty for the benefits?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty,
if applicable, in the data that affect your assessment of the clinical benefit. Consider sources
of uncertainty related to clinical and/or analytical performance characteristics (e.g.,
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, reproducibility, as applicable). Select any of the
following that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the benefits, and then answer the
question in the box below.
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Wide confidence intervals surrounding the point estimate(s) and/or odds ratio(s))
☐ A significantly underpowered study with statistical insignificance in outcome
measure(s)
☐ High subject or specimen loss-to-follow-up at critical assessment point(s)
☐ Large amount of missing data at critical assessment time(s) +/- imputation
☐ Significant number of major protocol deviations
☐ Impact of confounding interventions or physiological factors
☐ Inconsistent user experience or user experience not representative of likely real-world
user
☐ Unclear correlation between non-clinical data, pre-selected enriched data, or computer
modeling and clinical performance
☐ Surrogate endpoint has not yet been demonstrated to correlate with a clinical outcome
☐ Real World Evidence (RWE) is not relevant or reliable for the purposes of the
proposed analysis
☐ Inspectional findings
☐ Study design or results lead to lack of generalizability for the intended use population
or specific clinical subpopulations.
☐ Physiological or clinically meaningful range of the diagnostic output is unknown, or
generalizability of proposed clinical cut-off is unknown
☐ Imperfect comparator method used to calculate performance characteristics
☒ Other(s): limited duration of follow-up
☐ None
Q2: What is the degree of uncertainty for the benefits?
☒ Low  Continue to Question 3
☐ Med  Continue to Question 3
☐ High  Continue to Question 3

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Through one year of follow-up, no subject experienced device movement; therefore, there is a very high
probability (almost 100%) of reduction of primary device migration. This is a significant improvement

68

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
over primary device performance when implanted alone and gives a very high predictive probability that
a patient receiving the device will not experience device movement.
While the data only demonstrates benefit for up to one year, the benefit is expected to last for as long as
the device remains implanted.

Assessment of Risk
3. Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
Select any of the following elements that demonstrate sources of known/probable risks that are
more than minimal, then answer the question in the box below.
☒ Adverse events (AEs) or outcomes related to the device itself
☐ AEs or outcomes related to the use of the device or procedure to use the device
☐ AEs or outcomes related to anesthesia or sedation to use the device
☐ AEs or outcomes due to subsequent tests/treatments needed (e.g., radiation from CT scans)
☐ AEs or outcomes, not seen in the study/data, but probable based on “class effect” or events
known to occur with similar technologies
☐ False positive/false negative/failed to provide a result for diagnostics
☐ Treatment or diagnostic intended to be used as a standalone rather than an adjunctive use
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q3: Are known/probable risks more than minimal?
☒ YES  Continue to Question 4
☐ NO  Continue to Question 4
4. What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
Recognizing that some extent of uncertainty always exists, select the sources of uncertainty, if
applicable, in the data regarding the adverse events/outcomes or risks. Select any of the following
that demonstrate sources of uncertainty for the risks, and then answer the question in the box
below.
☐ Insufficient patient numbers to detect serious events or false positives/false negatives
☒ Insufficient duration of follow-up to detect delayed/late events
☐ Lack of data on repeated exposure to the device/use
☐ Inconsistent or conflicting results between studies
☐ Proper evaluations not performed as part of the study protocol to adequately detect certain AEs
☐ Poor or inconsistent adverse event definitions and documentation
☐ Events likely confounded by, and attributed to, other comorbidities or treatment modalities
☐ High subject loss-to-follow-up at critical assessment point(s)

69

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
☐ Large amount of missing data at critical assessment time(s) +/- imputation
☐ Significant number of major protocol deviations
☐ Inconsistent user experience or user experience not representative of likely real-world user

☐ Imperfect comparator method used to calculate performance characteristics
☐ Other(s):
☐ None
Q4: What is the extent of uncertainty for the risks?
☒ Low  Continue to Question 5
☐ Med  Continue to Question 5
☐ High  Continue to Question 5
Summary of the Assessment of Risk
If you answered “No” to Question 3 but “High” to Question 4, please explain here.
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
Through one year of follow-up, there were no device-related serious adverse events (no fractures of any
primary device) and only a handful of malfunctions of the support system, none of which lead to serious
adverse events. Despite the insufficient duration of follow-up to detect delayed events, the risks of failure
of the support system are not high because even if the support system fails, it is unlikely to lead to an
overall failure of the primary device. Two subjects experienced complications related to the device
malfunctioning (device movement). Even though all implanted devices that require a surgical procedure
carry with them their own set of risks (e.g., 1% chance of death from surgery), this device is implanted
along with the primary device and consequently does not require an additional surgery to implant. Or, if it
is placed to enhance the performance of a malfunctioning primary device, it is put in during a surgery that
would have otherwise been performed to fix the malfunctioning primary device. Therefore, the data
suggest that adding the support device during surgery does not appear to substantially increase the risk to
the patient.

Assessment of Benefit-Risk
Instructions for FDA staff: Provide a recommendation based on the totality of the evidence. As noted
above, the benefit-risk assessment is part of the decision regarding whether to approve a PMA application
or grant a De Novo request but is not an assessment of all applicable requirements.
To approve a PMA application or grant a De Novo request, FDA must find, among other things, that there
is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device. FDA determines whether there is a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness by weighing any benefit to health from the use of the
device against any risk of injury or illness for such use, among other relevant factors. To grant a De Novo
request, FDA must find that general controls or general and special controls provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for the device.
If you answer “yes” for any Q5-8, explain your rationale for how the benefits outweigh the risks. You
should also consider and recommend actions that would enhance the benefit-risk profile of the device,
such as modifications to the proposed labeling, which may include additional appropriate warnings and
precautions, instructions for use, or presentation of data, to help ensure the product labeling is transparent
with respect to the benefits and risks.
If you answer “unable to conclude” for Q5-8, please provide the information that you believe would be
needed to support a determination that the benefits outweigh the risks for the Indications for Use under
consideration in the summary text boxes and also proceed to Q9.
Q5: Do the Benefits outweigh the Risks, considering the assessment of Benefit
and Risk and the extent of uncertainty identified above?
☒ Yes – the benefits outweigh the risks such that, for this device, additional
consideration of relevant factors would not change that determination
☐ Unable to conclude that benefits outweigh the risks – further discussion and
consideration of relevant factors is appropriate – Continue to Q6

Summary of the Assessment of Benefit-Risk
For the Proposed Indications for Use:
The clinical trial was well-designed and conducted, and the results are robust. The clinical trial results
provide assurance of at least one year of clinical effectiveness of the device, with a high probability of
reduction of primary device migration. Furthermore, it is important to consider that the device merely
supports and supplements the effectiveness of another device and its failure would not significantly affect
the performance of the primary device. The device does not pose risks that would rise to the level of a
Class III device. Any safety concerns regarding device failure can be readily addressed through special
controls related to appropriate testing and labeling.
