Pediatric Information for X-ray
Imaging Device Premarket
Notifications
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

This guidance document outlines the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA or the Agency) regarding information that should be provided in premarket notification
submissions (510(k)s) and device labeling for x-ray imaging devices that are indicated for
pediatric populations or general use x-ray imaging devices for which considerable pediatric
application is anticipated. General use x-ray imaging devices typically neither include nor
exclude specific populations in the indications for use and may be expected to be used in any
population Because a large percentage of the hundreds of millions of x-ray examinations
performed annually in the US are exams of pediatric patients1, FDA expects that most
general use x-ray imaging devices will be used for a considerable quantity of pediatric
examinations unless a device’s design precludes use in smaller sized patients. This guidance
is intended to enhance clarity regarding the premarket review process of 510(k)s for x-ray
imaging devices, to encourage the inclusion of pediatric indications for use for x-ray imaging
device premarket notifications, and to provide recommendations regarding labeling,
including the instructions for use.
X-ray imaging devices are subject not only to the medical device requirements in the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), but are also electronic products under section
1

Analysis by the National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurements in NCRP Report No. 160,
“Ionizing Radiation Exposure of the Population of the United States,” estimates that pediatric populations make
up approximately 8% of total CT examinations and 15% of radiographic fluoroscopy examinations, for
example.

531(2) of Subchapter C (Electronic Product Radiation Control (EPRC)) of the FD&C Act.
As such, X-ray imaging devices are subject to the radiological health requirements in Title
21, Subchapter J, Parts 1000 through 1050 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR),
including applicability of general and specific performance standards (21 CFR Parts 10101050) and other general requirements for reporting and recordkeeping (21 CFR Part 1002),
notification and corrective actions for defective or non-compliant electronic products (21
CFR Parts 1003 and 1004), and importation (21 CFR Part 1005). For additional information,
see in particular 21 CFR 1020.30-1020.33 (“Diagnostic x-ray systems and their major
components;” “Radiographic equipment;” “Fluoroscopic equipment;” and “Computed
tomography (CT) equipment”) as applicable.

FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
A.

Public Health Motivation

Like all other medical procedures, x-ray imaging exams present both benefits and risks.
These imaging procedures have led to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of
numerous medical conditions. At the same time, these types of exams expose patients to
ionizing radiation, which may elevate a person’s lifetime risk of developing cancer. Exposure
to ionizing radiation is of particular concern in pediatric patients for three reasons: 1)
younger patients are more radiosensitive than adults (i.e., the cancer risk per unit dose of
ionizing radiation is higher for younger patients);2 2) younger patients have a longer expected
lifetime for the effects of radiation exposure to manifest as cancer; and 3) use of equipment
and exposure settings designed for adult use can result in excessive radiation exposure to the
smaller patient. The third point is of special concern because many pediatric imaging exams
are performed in facilities where pediatric imaging is not a majority of the workload.3

FDA strives to promote increased patient safety in medical imaging through two principles of
radiation protection developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection4:



Justification: Examinations using ionizing radiation should be performed only when
necessary to answer a medical question, help treat a disease, or guide a procedure.
Dose Optimization: Examinations should use techniques that are adjusted to administer
the lowest radiation dose that yields an image quality adequate for diagnosis or
intervention (i.e., radiation doses should be "As Low as Reasonably Achievable").

Manufacturers of x-ray imaging devices are encouraged to promote dose optimization by
designing their devices for optimal safe use and including dose-optimization information to
end users in the labeling. This guidance focuses on recommendations to manufacturers for
device features and instructions that would help medical professionals optimize radiation
dose in x-ray imaging exams for pediatric patients.
Currently, many x-ray imaging devices are marketed with a general indications for use
(IFU)5 statement6, and the use of the device is not limited to a specific population. The
majority of these devices are expected to be used in a considerable number of pediatric
patient imaging applications. However, experts have commented that many general use x-ray
imaging devices are sold without features or labeling information that would help users to
optimize clinically usable image quality in comparison to radiation exposure for use in
pediatric imaging.7
Imaging professionals can safely use existing x-ray equipment without specific features or
instructions for pediatric use by consulting recommendations provided by the Alliance for
Radiation Safety in Pediatric Imaging (Image Gently Alliance)8 and other organizations.
FDA has reviewed the recommendations from the Image Gently Alliance and believes they
are appropriate. However, FDA has received public comments that it can be challenging for
imaging professionals to apply these recommendations without additional information from
the manufacturer because x-ray imaging systems can be complex with a broad range of
available settings. Accordingly, FDA believes that safety can be further improved if x-ray
The principles of radiation protection in medicine, including "optimization" and the “ALARA” principle are

imaging devices include additional design features and information for users that facilitate
choosing optimized equipment settings for pediatric patients. Because of the heightened
concerns about excessive exposure to radiation in children, FDA believes that new x-ray
imaging devices should include clear information for the end user on the design features and
instructions available for imaging patients outside the typical adult size range. FDA
recommends that in order to minimize the risk of excessive exposure of radiation to children,
manufacturers of x-ray imaging devices should, as part of their device design, peform a risk
assessment that considers specific risks and mitigations arising from the use of their device in
pediatric populations. With appropriate instructions, safety information, and a description of
available pediatric-specific features, the end user can then make more informed decisions
about use of the device on pediatric patients.

Past FDA Actions, Guidance and Public Meetings

In 2007, Congress passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007
(FDAAA) (Pub. L. 110-85) that included Title III, the Pediatric Medical Device Safety and
Improvement Act (PMDSIA). PMDSIA requires submission of information on pediatric
subpopulations that suffer from the disease or condition that the device is intended to treat,
diagnose, or cure for certain types of device applications and supplements
In February 2010, the FDA launched an "Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation
Exposure from Medical Imaging"9 and on March 30-31, 2010, the Agency held a public
meeting entitled “Device Improvements to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from
Medical Imaging.”10 At the meeting, the FDA sought advice on "steps that manufacturers of
CT and fluoroscopic devices could take to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure through
improved product design, enhanced labeling, or improved instructions and training for
equipment use and quality assurance at medical imaging facilities."11 The Agency asked
whether manufacturers should incorporate special provisions for pediatric patients,
particularly with regard to hardware and software features.12 Recommendations received by
FDA, which apply to all general-use x-ray imaging modalities, included making available
pediatric protocols and control settings, targeted instructions and educational materials
emphasizing pediatric dose reduction, quality assurance tools for facilities emphasizing
radiation dose management, and dose information applicable to pediatric patients. Many of
the recommendations from pediatric experts focused on expanding the flexibility or range of
features already available on x-ray imaging devices, which may also improve adult imaging
for non-standard applications.

On July 16, 2012, the Agency held a public meeting entitled "Device Improvements for
Pediatric X-ray Imaging."13 At the meeting, FDA solicited public feedback on the draft of
this guidance and requested help in identifying issues relevant to radiation safety in pediatric
x-ray imaging that might benefit from standards development or further research. FDA
requested specific comments on technical device design and pediatric safety questions. Since
the 2012 meeting, many recommended device design improvements have been incorporated
into FDA-recognized consensus standards and others are under consideration for future
revisions of such standards. See Appendix B for a discussion of some relevant international
consensus standards.
In 2014, the Agency issued a revised general pediatric guidance entitled “Premarket
Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices14.” The guidance, which applies to all devices,
defines pediatric subpopulations and the general information that should be provided for
different types of premarket submissions for devices intended for use in pediatric
populations.

C.

The Approach of this Guidance

This guidance provides recommendations on the information that should be included in
premarket notifications for x-ray imaging devices that are indicated for pediatric populations
or general use x-ray imaging devices for which considerable pediatric application is
anticipated. Manufacturers seeking marketing clearance for a new x-ray imaging device that
could be used in pediatric populations should address pediatric use in their risk assessment
and provide mitigations where approriate, regardless of whether the device has a specific
pediatric indication. While including pediatric use is an important part of the risk assessment
for all general use x-ray imaging devices15, other parts of this guidance may only be
applicable to certain devices. This guidance offers a framework for how manufacturers may
address pediatric x-ray safety concerns in design, testing, and labeling of their device, but
any specific device design issues discussed are provided only as a reference. FDA believes
that development of, and conformance to, device-specific voluntary consensus standards,
such as those discussed in Appendix B, can help to ensure implementation of x-ray devicespecific pediatric safety design features industry-wide.

This guidance document is generally applicable to all x-ray imaging devices that are
specifically indicated for pediatric use or general use x-ray imaging devices for which
considerable pediatric application is anticipated. Both new devices and modifications of
existing x-ray imaging devices which require submission of a new premarket notification16
are included within the scope of this guidance document, regardless of whether the device is
a complete x-ray imaging system, a component part of an x-ray imaging device or an
accessory (e.g., detectors and software).
This guidance provides a broad framework regarding the information which should be
submitted to support premarket submissions for x-ray imaging devices indicated for pediatric
populations and general use x-ray imaging devices for which considerable pediatric
application is anticipated. While Section V (Indications for Use), Section VI (Risk
Assessment), and Section XI (Labeling) are generally applicable to all x-ray imaging devices,
other portions of the guidance document may only be applicable to certain devices. In
particular, Section VII (Pediatric Device Features) contains specific information about
device features that are only applicable to certain devices. For feedback about which
information may be applicable to a particular x-ray imaging device, FDA recommends that
manufacturers submit a Pre-submission.17
This guidance should be used in conjunction with device-specific guidance documents
addressing premarket notification requirements and serves as a supplement to the general
guidance document on the content and format of a 510(k) submission.18,19

See FDA’s guidance entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices”

(2-12 yrs.), adolescent (12-21 yrs.). The subgroups suggested in this guidance are consistent with these age
ranges.

on age21, patient size (i.e., height, weight, body part thickness) is a more important factor
than age for optimizing image quality and radiation dose for x-ray imaging exams.22
Because the focus of this guidance is on device design, labeling, and evaluation of x-ray
imaging devices, this guidance recommends division of the pediatric population into
subgroups based on patient size rather than age.
Pediatric patients can range in weight from less than 500 grams (1 lb) to more than 120 kg
(265 lb). As a result, a device designed for pediatric use (across all pediatric population
subgroups) will also be adequate for the entire size range of the general adult population;
conversely, devices designed only for adults may not be optimized for use on many smaller
patients. For example, the 5th percentile U.S. adult female [51 kg (112 lb.); 151 cm (59 in)
standing height] is similar in size to an average 12 year old.23 A well-designed adult device
that takes account of a broad individual size variation should be able to competently image
average pediatric patients 12 years old and above, but would not necessarily address the
needs of younger pediatric patients. Due to this size overlap between smaller adults and
older pediatric patients, many of the recommendations in the following sections are expected
to also improve imaging of smaller adults.
In the design of x-ray imaging devices, we recommend that manufacturers consider
subgroups that are appropriate to the intended use of their device. Depending on the body
part imaged, the appropriate subgroups will be different. While body part thickness is the
most relevant metric for x-ray imaging of individual patients,24,25 age and size may be more
readily available metrics for describing “average” patients. It may therefore be appropriate to
consider the applicable body part thickness corresponding to the following pediatric
subgroups, defined according to age and approximate average height and weight
measurements, which may be appropriate for body imaging: neonate/birth-1 month [1-2 kg
21

Based on reports of the lifetime incidence of cancer vs. age of exposure data, the pediatric subgroups defined
by the Agency in the guidance entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices” cover the region
where the largest age dependence is expected for cancer risk. Risk decreases much less steeply as a function of
age for individuals over 21 years of age. [See NAS National Research Council Committee to Assess Health
Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation. 2006. Health risks from exposure to low levels of

patient age, should include the following: 0-1 year, 1-2 years, 2-6 years, 6-16 years, and 16+
years.27
The above subgroups are listed as a general guide. Different subgroups that still cover the
broad size range expected for pediatric patients may be appropriate depending on the
intended use of the x-ray imaging device.28

V.

Indications for Use

The 510(k) submission should clearly define the indication(s) for use (IFU), including all
populations for whom the device is intended. When the needs of pediatric patients are
specifically considered in the design and features of a device, the indications for use should
specify the pediatric populations in which the device is intended to be used. When a device
does not include specialized design features for pediatric populations and is intended to be
used across a broad population range, the Indications for Use should state that the device is
intended for general populations. For devices intended only for adult use, we recommend
that you clearly state this as part of your IFU statement. For example, although most x-ray
imaging devices for general use may be safely used in pediatric populations, some
circumstances exist where restrictions on pediatric populations may be appropriate. One
example may be extremity-only cone beam CT scanners designed for adult patients, if safety
features do not exist to prevent radiation exposure outside the anatomy of interest when the
patient falls outside the typical adult size range.

VI. Risk Assessment

26

Size measurements are based on approximate mean values (averaged across males and females) from:
McDowell, M.A., C.D. Fryar, C.L. Ogden, and K. M. Flegal. 2008. Anthropomorphic Reference Data for
Children and Adults, United States, 2003-2006. National Health Statistics Reports, 10, 1-48. The weight given
for the neonate subgroup is lower than the average to ensure that a broad range of sizes is adequately covered.
27
These age ranges differ from those suggested for body imaging due to the difference in the growth rate of the
head; the age ranges cited are those that appear in the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM)
sample head protocols for pediatric patients: Pediatric Routine Head CT Protocols Version 1.1, AAPM Alliance
for Quality Computed Tomography.
28
For example, the following weight groups are used both in the European Guidelines on Diagnostic Reference
Levels for Pediatric Imaging and approximate equivalent ages (European Commission. European Guidelines on
Diagnostic Reference Levels for Paediatric Imaging, Radiation Protection 185. 2016. (European Union:
Luxembourg) and in the ICRP “Diagnostic Reference Levels in Medical Imaging (ICRP Ref 4836-8337-6684,
Draft published January 11, 2016) [Grouping Name (weight, age)]: Neonate (< 5 kg, < 1 m); Infant, toddler and
early childhood (5 - < 15 kg, 1 m - < 4 y); Middle childhood (15 - < 30 kg, 4 - < 10 y); early adolescence (30 - <
50 kg, 10 - < 14 y); late adolescence (50 - < 80 kg, 14 - < 18 y).

A good risk assessment should include an examination of all foreseeable risks associated
with a device. Even if a general use x-ray imaging device is not specifically indicated for
pediatric use, it may be foreseeable that the device will be used on pediatric patients.
Because the risk posed by the device may vary depending on the particular population
(including different pediatric subgroups across a range of patient sizes), the risk assessment
for x-ray imaging devices indicated for pediatric patients (and general use devices for which
considerable pediatric use is anticipated) should include the additional hazards and means of
mitigation associated with all patient populations on whom the device may be used. Your
risk assessment should include a consideration of applicable critical factors outlined in
FDA’s guidance document entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices:
Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.”29 If the results of the risk
assessment demonstrate special features or labeling are not necessary to address pediatric
use, then the premarket 510(k) submission should include that justification.
When developing features or user instructions aimed at reducing radiation exposure to
pediatric patients, the balance of radiation exposure and image quality for the desired clinical
task should be considered. While the clinician has the responsibility to determine the final
settings of the device to meet image quality requirements, manufacturers have a
responsibility to provide appropriate guidance.
An exam with poor image quality could result in a missed diagnosis or in a repeated exam
(involving additional radiation exposure to the patient). An exam with a higher than
necessary radiation exposure provides a level of image quality that is not needed for the
clinical task as it does not contribute to the clinical purpose of the exam. Examples of
hazardous situations that could result in unnecessary radiation exposure or poor image
quality specific to pediatric patients include the following:





Use of adult settings or protocols instead of appropriate pediatric settings or
protocols;
Design features that do not allow proper positioning of pediatric patients (e.g., a deep
patient cradle interfering with lateral x-rays of a small patient);
Automatic controls that are not calibrated for pediatric patients; and
Absence of safety features to prevent radiation exposure outside the anatomy of
interest when the patient falls outside the typical adult size range.

The above examples are not a comprehensive list. Consultation during the design phase with
professionals who are knowledgeable regarding pediatric imaging may help identify other
risks and situations specific to pediatric use of your x-ray imaging device.

Based on the results of the risk assessment for the x-ray imaging device, manufacturers
should include in the 510(k) any particular design features to address pediatric use as risk
mitigations. The device description should describe those features specifically included to
allow for imaging of smaller-size and pediatric patients, and these features should also be
summarized in the Pediatric Summary section of the labeling (see Section XI.A). The Agency
recommends consultation with knowledgeable pediatric imaging specialists (physicians,
physicists, and technologists) and human factors specialists30 during the design phase to
ensure that the device is suitable for pediatric use.
Examples of pediatric use features to consider for x-ray imaging devices are:






Automatic exposure control (AEC) designed and tested or evaluated, as appropriate,
for a broad range of patient sizes, including pediatric;
Pediatric protocols or pre-set control settings (which clearly specify the intended size
range) and labeling that consider the balance of radiation exposure and image
quality;31
Display and recording of patient dose or dose index and ability to record other patient
information, e.g., age, height, weight and patient body part thickness (either manual
entry or automatic calculation);32 while this recommendation also applies to adult
imaging, it is especially important to include for pediatric imaging so estimates of
patient-specific dose can be made reliably without assuming a "typical" or "standard"
patient size, which are often based on adults; and
Software interface features that guide the end user to important pediatric use issues
(e.g., interactive software pop-ups that remind users of special pediatric issues when
setting up the image acquisition).

All of the features listed above may not be appropriate for every device. For example, a CT
scanner will likely have a more sophisticated software interface and capabilities for preprogrammed protocols than a general radiography or dental imaging device. Other design
considerations may be specific to the type of x-ray imaging equipment; for an example of
device-specific considerations, see the white paper by the Medical Imaging Technology
Alliance (MITA) and Image Gently which discusses design considerations relevant to
interventional x-ray equipment.33 Relevant pediatric imaging design features may also be
See the FDA guidance entitled “Applying Human Factors and Usability Engineering to Medical Devices”

and the standards AAMI /ANSI HE75:2009 (R2013), Human factors engineering - Design of medical
Devices and ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62366:2007 (R2013), Medical devices – Application of usability engineering to
medical devices.
31
While full protocols with technique factors (e.g., tube current, tube voltage, etc.) may be appropriate for full
x-ray systems, it may be challenging for a component part or accessory device to provide this information.
However, alternative information may be appropriate. For example, information about IEC exposure index
ranges may be appropriate for a detector-only device.

addressed in device-specific FDA guidance and device-specific FDA-recognized consensus
standards.34

VIII.

Protocols

Pediatric-appropriate protocols for common procedures appropriately adjusted for the
patient's size and weight should be available for all complete x-ray imaging systems for
which considerable pediatric application is anticipated. Ideally, special hardware and
software design issues that affect safety and effectiveness of the device for pediatric use
should be addressed in the design phase. For example, if use of automatic exposure control is
recommended on pediatric patients, this feature should be designed for pediatric patients and
calibrated using methods appropriate for the pediatric population.
The term "protocol" as used in this guidance includes, but is not limited to, a full set of any
programmed technical factors, control functions and settings, including image processing
settings, designed to optimize the image acquisition and display. In some cases (e.g., general
radiography, dental radiography), these protocols may simply consist of instructions (e.g.,
exposure chart) on how to appropriately configure the equipment and adjust parameters for
the patient weight or thickness, body habitus, and clinical anatomy. In other cases (e.g., CT),
it may be appropriate to pre-program the protocols into software.
A list summarizing the available pre-configured, default pediatric protocols should be made
available to the end user, either as part of the labeling or in downloadable electronic format
(see Section XI of this guidance). This list should include the protocol name, brief description
of exam purpose, anatomical region, intended size of patient, and the acquisition parameters
used as starting points. As discussed in the following section, representative dose information
(applicable to pediatrics) associated with each protocol should also be provided.
Component parts and accessories to x-ray imaging devices (e.g., detector-only devices) are
unlikely to fully control all parameters that make up a complete imaging protocol for
pediatric or adult patients. For these device types, providing some protocol-related
information may still be appropriate. For example, for a detector-only system, recommended
detector exposure indices for different types of exams and patient subgroups may be
adequate instead of technique factors and dosimetric information.
For previously 510(k) cleared x-ray imaging devices, optimization of imaging parameters
and provision of pediatric-specific protocols by manufacturers solely at the request of end
users generally does not by itself necessitate submission of a new 510(k) submission.

34

See Appendix B. For example, the current editions of device-specific International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) performance standards, such as IEC 60601-2-43 and IEC 60601-2-54 contain requirements
for equipment specified for pediatric applications, such as removable anti-scatter grids. Since the FDA public
meetings in 2010 and 2012, the international standards community has continued to add to the pediatric design
features included in the device-specific performance standards for x-ray imaging devices.
11

IX. Laboratory Image Quality and Dose Assessment
Performance of the x-ray imaging device should be assessed over the entire range of patient
sizes for which the device is indicated. Because many x-ray imaging devices with general
indications will experience significant use in pediatric populations, the entire range of patient
sizes should include neonates through adults. The range of settings and conditions used for
testing should represent the routine clinical use of the system (e.g., clinically-relevant
radiation doses should be used). Appendix B provides relevant tests and applicable standards
commonly used to evaluate the performance of x-ray imaging devices. While Appendix B is
intended to be as inclusive as possible; not every test listed maybe appropriate for your
device. If a device-specific FDA guidance document exists, please consult that guidance
document for the recommended testing.
The image quality and radiation dose depends on the x-ray path length, so testing should
address a range of representative path lengths and should be included in the 510(k)
submission. The appropriate choice of patient sizes will depend on the indications for use of
your device or device feature and the imaging physics of the specific device functions being
evaluated. A device’s 510(k) submission should include the rationale for selecting the
patient sizes used in your testing. For example, for an abdominal CT protocol that employs
AEC, it may be appropriate to assess image quality and radiation dose for each sized protocol
provided; for an interventional x-ray imaging device, measuring air kerma with 10cm and
20cm PMMA phantoms may be sufficient for pediatric use. When selecting phantoms
representative of the intended patient population, FDA recommends that manufacturers
choose phantoms that are capable of replicating the range of representative of the intended
range of patient size/diameter, rather than selecting phantom distribution based on age.
In cases where the performance of a device or device feature based on patient size is well
understood (e.g., slice sensitivity profile (SSP), modulation transfer function (MTF),
uniformity, CT number accuracy), the performance for the largest and the smallest patient
sizes may be sufficient to demonstrate performance of the device across all patient sizes. In
these instances, data on intermediate size patients may be extrapolated35. However, when the
effect of patient size on the performance of a particular device is less well understood, or the
device is known to behave non-linearly based on patient size (e.g., iterative reconstruction
algorithms, AEC, automatic brightness control, tests of temporal resolution), it is more
appropriate to demonstrate the performance of your device across a larger number of patient
sizes.
The 510(k) submission should include:

35

For an extended discussion of cases where data obtained for adult and adult-sized patients may be
extrapolated to obtain information applicable to pediatric populations, refer to FDA’s guidance “Leveraging
Existing Clinical Data for Extrapolation to Pediatric Uses of Medical Devices: Guidance for Industry and Food
and Drug Administration Staff”
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm444591
.pdf). While the scope of that guidance is specific to clinical study data extrapolation, some of the concepts may
be applicable to non-clinical bench testing or sample clinical image data.

A summary of the tests conducted, the methods used, and the test results. The
description of the test method should include the system settings (e.g., exposure
settings such as tube voltage, tube current, and use of AEC) as well as a description of
the phantoms used and the appropriateness of the phantoms. When reporting dose in
CT, for example, you may indicate the corresponding phantom with which the
measurement was acquired (e.g., CTDIvol (32 cm). FDA encourages the standardized
development, manufacturer implementation, and physician use of Size Specific Dose
Estimation (SSDE) for estimates of patient dose which more accurately represent the
dose received by patients of varying sizes (including pediatric populations). If a test
method has been described fully in the literature and was followed completely, a
reference may be sufficient.
The test conditions used for the assessment and why the selected test conditions are
sufficient to demonstrate the performance of your device over the entire range of
patient sizes for which your device is indicated.
The measurement uncertainty, the trade name, characteristics, and accuracy of the
measuring instruments used for performing quantitative tests, if applicable.

In some cases, a manufacturer may have previously demonstrated device performance for
adult-sized patients. In order to demonstrate the performance of the device for the full range
of indicated patient sizes in a subsequent premarket submission, it would typically be
appropriate to amend this data with a new examination of device performance for smaller
sized patients.

X.

Clinical Image Quality Assessment

FDA encourages the use of laboratory testing methods to ensure the device is appropriately
designed for imaging children due to the Agency’s concerns with imaging pediatric patients
with devices and the potential risks of exposing this population to medically unnecessary
radiation exposure. Clinical images of pediatric patients will only be requested when
laboratory testing is insufficient to demonstrate substantial equivalence and when
extrapolation of the necessary data from adult images is not sufficient. If any images are
provided to the Agency, they should be accompanied by corresponding dose information,
exposure settings, and clinical information if available (e.g., type of exam, age, size, and sex
of patient, and clinical indications).
For more information on the appropriate protections for pediatric populations, see FDA’s
guidance entitled “Premarket Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices”.36 For questions
regarding the need for images of pediatric patients, sponsors are encouraged to request a presubmission meeting prior to 510(k) submission. For information on how to submit a presubmission, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device

XI. Labeling
In addition to information describing the general operation of the device, the user manual
should contain the following information specific to pediatric use. These labeling
recommendations to address pediatric use of x-ray imaging devices are intended to be
supplemental to other labeling recommendations and requirements and not intended to be all
inclusive of the labeling information expected to be found on an x-ray imaging device. For a
more detailed discussion of how the basic elements of labeling may be addressed for
pediatric populations, please also refer to Section IX of FDA’s guidance entitled “Premarket
Assessment of Pediatric Medical Devices.”38.

A.

Pediatric Summary Section

The labeling for end users should include a summary section (see Appendix A) addressing the
specific features and labeling information (B though F below) for pediatric use of the x-ray
imaging device. This information is recommended both for devices indicated for pediatric
use and for general use devices that may be used on pediatric patients.
In order to emphasize the importance of safe device operation when imaging pediatric
patients, the following caution statement should be included in the pediatric summary
section: “Use special care when imaging patients outside the typical adult size range.39”
FDA believes that this statement and general references for pediatric imaging are appropriate
to include in the labeling of all devices that may be used on pediatric populations, including
devices with general indications or devices with specific pediatric indications and design
features. (See Section VI Risk Assessment for more information.)

B.

Contraindications, Warnings, and Precautions

Contraindications, warnings, and precautions for devices indicated for pediatric populations,
or general use devices for which considerable pediatric appliacation is anticipated, should
clearly address the potential risks and their association with the age, size, and condition of
the pediatric subject and alert the user to specific hazards associated with the use of the
device in the target population.40 The contraindications, warnings, and precautions should

address the risks specific to pediatric use that were identified during the risk assessment. If
warnings and contraindications apply to some but not all pediatric subpopulations, the
specific applicable subpopulations should be specified.
For devices where the risk of use in pediatric patients or certain pediatric subpopulations
clearly outweighs possible benefits based on known hazards, we recommend that you include
a contraindication for use in pediatric patients or pediatric subpopulations.

C.

Device Description

The device description should include a list of the hardware and software features designed
specifically for pediatric use. When different options are available for purchase, the labeling
should describe the various options recommended for use in pediatric subgroups and, when
feasible, present these options in tabular form by age, weight, or other appropriate criteria.

D.

Instructions for Use

Instructions for how to properly configure the device for pediatric use (and how this may
differ from adult use) should be provided.
The instructions for use should address radiation dose reduction strategies for pediatric
patients. All user-configurable imaging parameters should be clearly explained, including
their impact on patient dose. Combinations of certain parameters that can provide for optimal
image quality/minimal dose under unusual circumstances (i.e., a difficult or obese patient)
may be suggested but should be clearly indicated as such. Screenshots of the user interface
software controls should be provided in the labeling, explaining how different parameters
affect dose and image quality, particularly for pediatric patients. To mitigate the risk of user
error, the following should be considered:



User's manuals in downloadable electronic form with easily searchable interfaces, in
addition to paper copies; and
Leave-behinds/just-in-time educational material such as checklists that include any
special pediatric issues during pre-acquisition, acquisition, and post-acquisition
steps41.

Instructions should consider the likely educational background of the end-user; for example,
equipment likely to be used by professionals other than radiologists or radiologic
technologists (e.g., dental x-ray or devices designed for cardiac imaging) should include
information targeted at the appropriate professional groups (e.g., dentists, cardiologists).

An example is the Image Gently/FDA “Digital Radiography Safety Checklist”
(http://www.imagegently.org/Portals/6/Procedures/Attachment%20D.CR.DR%20%20checklist.pdf). FDA
strongly encourages the inclusion of or reference to educational materials related to radiation protection for
children in x-ray imaging procedures.

E.

Quality Control Testing Recommendations

Quality control testing recommendations should include any tests (acceptance testing, annual
and continuous testing) that ensure the device functions properly across the entire range of
patient sizes in which the device may be used.

F.

Additional Information

The end-user documentation should include a means to obtain additional information
regarding the unique operating principles of the device pertaining to pediatric use.
A summary of the physical laboratory tests (See Section IX of this guidance) characterizing
the performance of the device for pediatric use should be provided. Users can then employ
this information in their evaluation of the importance of any tradeoffs between different
characteristics of imaging performance.
A summary of pediatric protocols (brief description of purpose, acquisition parameters, and
intended size of patient) should be provided in a separate section of the manual or in a
downloadable electronic format. Dose information for each protocol should be included with
the protocol and displayed by the software, where appropriate. Appendix B, Table 1 entry
"dose measurement, display, and documentation" includes relevant dose metrics and FDArecognized standards for different modalities.
If literature is used in support of particular pediatric design features and protocols, a
summary should be available to users (e.g., table with references and pediatric use topics or
applications and equipment settings covered in each).

XII. Training and Testing Materials for Users and
Manufacturers' Personnel
A training program emphasizing production of acceptable quality images at an optimized
radiation dose for the device’s entire patient population should be made available to the
clinical end user.42 The user's manual may be considered part of this training program.
This training program should emphasize equipment-specific training and the optimal use of
all built-in dose reduction and image quality improvement features.43 It should explain
clearly how to use the specific features of the equipment in all populations for which the
device may be used. Training should be accessible, practical, and targeted at all different

types of end users. If testing questions accompany training sessions, they should address an
understanding of pediatric use issues (e.g., dose saving features for children). In order to
facilitate continuous learning, a DVD that includes the content of any in-person training
sessions could be provided to the facility or made available in another format (e.g., as online
modules).
The 510(k) submission should include a summary-level description of the training materials
for the device. The description should point out any pediatric-specific topics covered.

Appendix A: Pediatric Summary Section for Instructions
for Use
The following is an example of a pediatric summary section for inclusion in the instructions
for use for any x-ray imaging device for which considerable pediatric appliacation is
anticipated (both devices indicated for pediatric populations and general use x-ray devices
not contraindicated for pediatric populations). For x-ray imaging devices without specific
design features or labeling information, FDA recommends including the Introduction and
Section A of the below summary in the instructions for use. For x-ray imaging devices with
specific design features and labeling information to address pediatric use, the entire example
is applicable (i.e., Introduction, Section A, and Section B).
Manufacturers should adapt the language below as appropriate for their device. For general
information on radiation safety, FDA encourages device manufacturers to use available
resources developed by national and international organizations rather than creating new
material; literature developed by imaging and radiation protection experts is available for all
of the different modalities covered by this guidance. FDA also encourages manufacturers to
consider how their device can be better configured for pediatric use, and to provide that more
specific information to the end user.
Example follows

Pediatric Use: Summary
Introduction: Special care should be exercised when imaging patients outside the typical
adult size range, especially smaller pediatric patients whose size does not overlap the
adult size range (e.g., patients less than 50 kg (110 lb) in weight and 150 cm (59 in) in
height,measurements, which approximately correspond to that of an average 12 year old
or a 5th percentile U.S. adult female.44)
Exposure to ionizing radiation is of particular concern in pediatric patients because: 1) for
certain organs and tumor types, younger patients are more radiosensitive than adults (i.e.,
the cancer risk per unit dose of ionizing radiation is higher for younger patients); 2) use
of equipment and exposure settings designed for adults of average size can result in
excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure of smaller patients; and 3) younger patients
have a longer expected lifetime over which the effects of radiation exposure may
manifest as cancer.
To help reduce the risk of excessive radiation exposure, you should follow the ALARA
(As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle and seek to reduce radiation dose to only
the amount necessary to obtain images that are adequate clinically.

Appendix B: General Laboratory Image Quality and Dose
Assessment, Tests and Standards
This Appendix lists common laboratory tests and the applicable standard for each modality.
This list is included for reference and is not intended to be exhaustive. The tests listed in this
Appendix focus on ensuring the imaging device is capable of producing acceptable quality
images at a reasonable dose. The information may also be included in device-specific
guidance, which should also be consulted. Inclusion of this list does not imply that all of
these standards must be followed for every device or that every applicable test and associated
standard has been listed. For additional standards applicable to specific devices, please refer
to FDA’s Recognized Consensus Standards Database.48
The guidance entitled “Recognition and Use of Consensus Standards”49 describes how the
agency will use information on conformance with recognized standards to satisfy premarket
review requirements. In the case of 510(k)s, information on conformance with recognized
standards may help establish the substantial equivalence of a new device to a legally
marketed predicate in the areas covered by the standards. If a 510(k) contains declarations of
conformity (and the standard to which conformance is claimed includes performance limits
or acceptance criteria), this will, in most cases, eliminate the need for FDA to review the
actual test data for those aspects of the device addressed by the standards. Instead of
following a recognized standard, a firm may choose to submit alternative equivalent
information demonstrating safety and effectiveness.
The list below focuses on test methods, but the Appendix also includes the performance and
safety standards for each modality: computed tomography (International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) 60601-2-4450); radiography and fluoroscopy (IEC 60601-2-5451);
interventional fluoroscopy (IEC 60601-2-4352); dental extra-oral X-ray equipment (IEC
60601-2-6353); and dental intra-oral X-ray equipment (IEC 60601-2-6554). Some of these
standards include features and labeling requirements which are specifically relevant to
pediatric imaging, while others have feature and labeling requirements which are relevant to
all sizes of patients (including smaller-sized adult and pediatric patients). For example, IEC
62985 (Methods for calculating Size Specific Dose Estimate (SSDE) on Computed
Tomography) describes a method of determining patient dose, scaled from CTDIvol, which
provides a more accurate representation of the dose to patients across a wide range of sizes
