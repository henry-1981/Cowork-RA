Medical Device Classification
Product Codes
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

Introduction
Since the passage of the May 28, 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Classification Regulation Panels (21 CFR Parts 862-892) have
been the basis for the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH’s) Classification
Product Code structure and organization. In order to respond to the evolution of device
technology, classification product codes were created to assist in accurate identification and
tracking of current medical devices and to allow for tracking of and easy reference to predicate
device types. Classification product codes are used by FDA to obtain quality and reliable data,
and perform analyses that are often reported to Congress, the Government Accountability Office
(GAO), the general public, the media, and industry. Classification product codes are also used
throughout the total product life cycle (TPLC) as they connect all medical device databases.
This document describes how device product codes are used in a variety of FDA program areas
to regulate and track medical devices regulated by the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (CDRH) and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). This document
is limited to medical devices as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic
(FD&C) Act and does not discuss classification product codes used to regulate non-medical
electronic radiation emitting products.
The scope of this document includes devices described in the existing classifications under
21 CFR Parts 862-892. It also describes how the product code builder developed by FDA’s
Office of Regulatory Affairs is used for devices that are licensed under the Public Health Service
Act (PHS Act), and currently do not have product codes generated under classification regulation

panels. It also covers unclassified devices and devices not yet classified. 1
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

Definition
Classification product codes are a method of internally classifying and tracking medical
devices. CDRH and a subset of CBER regulated medical device product codes consist of a 3
letter combination which associates a device’s type with a product classification designated
for the application. Classification product codes and information associated with these
devices, such as names and attributes, are assigned by CDRH to support their regulation.

Use of Classification Product Codes in Premarket Review
1. General Uses of Classification Product Codes for Premarket
Submissions
A. Classification product codes help to delineate technology and indication subgroups
within a regulation. They can also serve to categorize unclassified or Class III
(PMA) devices. Some of these subgroups may require different levels of evidence to
support marketing clearance or approval, or specific warnings in the labeling.
Classification product codes are also useful to identify devices for subsequent
changes such as reclassification. If a device is reclassified (e.g., from Class III to
Class II) the classification product code may stay the same or a new classification
product code may be created.
B. Classification product codes are used for internal tracking purposes, such as adverse
event monitoring or compliance actions. Product codes may be created and assigned
for these purposes.
C. Classification product codes are assigned and maintained by the Agency. The
submitter of the premarket submission selects a product code based on the identified
predicate device(s). The proposed product code is reviewed by FDA staff for
accuracy. If the proposed product code is incorrect, or a more appropriate product
code should be used, the reviewer will change the product code and notify the
1

An unclassified device is a pre-amendments device for which a classification regulation has not been promulgated.
Unclassified devices require submission of a 510(k) premarket notification to CDRH. A not-classified device is a
post-amendments device for which the Agency has not yet reviewed a marketing application or for which the
Agency has not made a final decision on such a marketing application. A pre-amendments device is a device that
was on the market prior to the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments to the FD&C Act on May 28, 1976.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
applicant. In the case of adverse event reporting, when an incorrect product code is
used or a new tracking product code is created, the Agency will assign the most
accurate product code to the adverse event report.
D. Proposed classification product codes cited in premarket submissions are used in
the initial assignment to the appropriate review branch/division. They are also used
to determine the review panel for the device.
E. As new classification product codes are created, a device may be re-assigned into a
new product code. If this occurs, FDA will send a corrected substantially equivalent
or approval letter to the manufacturer of the marketed device to notify them of the
new classification product code.
F. Guidance documents often define their scope by referencing the classification
product codes to which they apply.

2. Premarket Notification [510(k)] Devices
A. Classification – Product codes are assigned within established classification
regulations as described in 21 CFR Part 860. They are also assigned to unclassified
devices and not-classified devices. An unclassified device is a pre-amendments
device for which a classification regulation has not been promulgated. Until the
unclassified device type has been formally classified and a regulation established,
marketing of new devices within this type will require submission of a 510(k)
premarket notification to CDRH or CBER. Once classified, these devices may
require submission of a PMA, a 510(k), or be exempt from any premarket
submission. A not-classified device is a post-amendments device for which the
Agency has not yet reviewed a marketing application or for which the Agency has
not made a final decision on such a marketing application.
B. Predicate Devices –To demonstrate substantial equivalence and therefore obtain
clearance of a 510(k) submission, a comparison to a predicate device is provided.
Selecting a predicate device with the same classification product code as the
proposed device is usually most appropriate.
C. Assignment – The reviewer will assign a classification product code based on the
regulation (if relevant) or the device intended use, indications for use or technology.
The most common method of assignment is to use an existing product code from the
product code database. A device will be assigned an existing classification product
code when it has the same intended use, indications for use, and relies on
technology that does not raise new safety and effectiveness questions. However, if
the proposed device differs significantly from the predicate device with respect to
technology, intended use or indications for use or is found not substantially
equivalent (NSE), a new product code should be assigned. The 510(k) summary will
include all classification product codes considered relevant. The 510(k) clearance
letter will specify one primary product code for the device and may include

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
subsequent product codes that address additional features or functions of the device.
The primary classification product code should correspond with the regulation and
class applicable to the device and should be used in all postmarket correspondence
as needed. The accurate use of this product code in all actions including premarket
submissions, adverse event reporting and compliance actions is important to ensure
accurate communication with the Agency and to avoid potential negative impacts
such as delays in delivery or shipment. Multiple subsequent product codes can be
used even if they fall under a different regulation and class. If multiple product
codes are assigned to a device, the product code that corresponds with the highest
regulatory class or, if the regulatory class is the same, the product code
corresponding to the most relevant technology will be used as the primary product
code.
D. Evolution – As technology changes and 510(k) review practice evolves, some
classification product codes may become obsolete. In some cases, product code
definitions may be updated to accommodate new technology. Obsolete product
codes will still be maintained in the public database for tracking purposes.
Predicates with obsolete product codes will remain under the same regulation
and may still be used as valid predicates. A corrected clearance letter should be
issued when a device with an obsolete product code is assigned a new product
code. New classification product codes should be created for a 510(k) when a
device has a new intended use or when a device incorporates technology that
raises new questions of safety and effectiveness. In the case where a device is
found not substantially equivalent (NSE) to a predicate device; the classification
product code describing the device will be placed in the product code database
for future reference. Additionally, new product codes may be created for
tracking purposes for a specific technology or device area. Please see the FAQ
section of the guidance for instruction on where to seek clarification on an
assigned product code.
E. Other – Classification Product codes can be used to help classify other premarket
submission variations.

2

i.

Third party eligible 510(k) submissions – The classification database can be
searched by product code to determine which devices may be eligible for
third party review. For more information on the classification database,
please see the “Resources” section of this guidance document.

ii.

Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation (De Novo) (513(f)) requests)
– When a De Novo petition is granted and the device is reclassified, the
product code assigned when the 510(k) was submitted and determined to be
NSE will be used. 2 Note that Section 607 of the Food and Drug
Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) amended Section

See Guidance for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation:
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080195.htm

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act to allow submission of a De Novo petition
without submission of a 510(k) and subsequent NSE if there is no legally
marketed device upon which to base an SE determination. In such cases, a
new product code will be assigned at the time that the De Novo petition is
granted.
iii.

Kits – Product codes have been assigned to established convenience kits that
are outlined in FDA’s Convenience Kits Interim Regulatory Guidance
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidan
ceDocuments/ucm080216.htm). The list of established convenience kits can
be found in the guidance.

3. Premarket Approval (PMA) Devices and Humanitarian Device
Exemption (HDE) Devices
A. The use of product codes for PMA and HDE devices is similar to their use for
510(k) devices. A product code is assigned to the device upon approval and is
included in the subject of the approval letter of a PMA or HDE.
B. Class III devices are not always classified under a specific regulation, but may have
a product code assigned. When a regulation for the device type exists, Class III
devices are assigned under a specific regulation, like Class I and II devices. When
Class III devices are reclassified to Class II devices, a regulation is created and the
product code may remain the same or a new product code may be created.
C. Modifications to an existing Class III device that result in the submission of a PMA
supplement, such as a change in indications for use, which would be submitted
through a panel track PMA supplement, may require creation and assignment of a
new product code for the modified device.
D. The appropriate product code should be cited in submissions of annual reports.
E. For HDE submissions, the eligibility for humanitarian exemption is not based on the
product code of the proposed device. The proposed device, along with the
indications for use, must be designated as a Humanitarian Use Device by the Office
of Orphan Products before an HDE can be submitted to CDRH or CBER. 3

4. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
A. A classification product code may be assigned to a device that is the subject of an
IDE submission and included in the approval letter for an IDE if the device falls in
a known device area with established technology or will be tracked internally for a
3

http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DevelopingProductsforRareDiseasesConditions/DesignatingHumanitarianUse
DevicesHUDS/default.htm.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
specific technology, patient population or device area.
B. The classification product code assigned to a device that is the subject of an IDE
application is primarily used for internal tracking purposes and may differ from
that of the final PMA approval or 510(k) clearance. In many instances, a product
code will not be assigned to an IDE submission.
C. For devices where an established classification product code is known, the
proposed product code should be specified in the submission. For novel devices, a
new classification product code will generally be assigned by FDA at the time of
PMA approval/510(k) clearance.

5. Request for Classification (513(g)) Applications
Section 513(g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(g)) provides a means to obtain the
Agency's views about the classification and the regulatory requirements that may be
applicable to a particular device. FDA’s response to a 513(g) request will include, in
part, the Agency's assessment, based on the information submitted in the request, as to
the generic type of device (e.g., classification regulation) that the requester's device
appears to be within (if any); the class of devices within that generic type; and whether a
PMA, 510(k), or neither is required in order to market devices of the particular class
within that generic type. However, a classification product code is not generally
specified in a 513(g) classification for devices that will require a premarket submission.
The recommendation in response to the 513(g) submission only lists proposed devices
within a given regulation. Devices that are Class I exempt or Class II exempt may
receive a classification product code as part of this recommendation.

Use of Classification Product Codes in Post Market
Review
1. Adverse Events
Classification product codes are a key element in the reporting of adverse events and
product problems in medical device reports (MDRs). Though not clearly requested in the
3500A mandatory reporting form (MedWatch Form), it is common practice for
the reporter to indicate the product code along with the common name of the device in
section D2 of the 3500A form. The addition of the product code by mandatory reporters
supports 21 CFR 803.52(c)(2) by describing the type of product. The classification
product code used by reporters should be the primary product code associated with the
device for which the report is being made. To improve the quality of MDRs, we
recommend that reporters include the premarket submission number (if applicable) in
section G5 of the 3500A form to further link the device to its original classification.
In cases where the classification product code is not known by the reporter and an MDR
is submitted without one, CDRH assigns the appropriate product code to the MDR based

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
on the brand name (section D1), common device name (section D2), or premarket
submission number (section D5). However, it is preferred that the reporter of the MDR
provide the product code with which CDRH classified the device (in the case of Class II
and III devices).

2. Import/Export
A. Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Product Code Builder
In order to ensure that a medical device is in compliance with FDA regulatory
requirements, importers/brokers/filers are required to submit certain import
information. One data element that is required to be provided is the product code. If
the product code is unknown, importers/brokers/filers can use the Office of
Regulatory Affairs’ (ORA) Product Code Builder
(http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ImportProgram/ProductCodeBuilderforFoods/defa
ult.htm) to formulate a product code for the product they are importing. In addition,
the CDRH Product Classification Database
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm) can be
used to look up a device's definition and regulatory requirements, neither of which is
provided in the ORA Product Code Builder. As new product codes are created by
CDRH and old ones modified, ORA’s Division of Compliance Systems (DCS) is
notified, and the Product Code Builder is updated. The product code used for the
FDA import admissibility review process is formatted differently than the
classification product code used by CDRH. There is no definitive meaning for the
three digit classification product codes in CDRH’s Product Classification Database.
However, ORA’s Product Code Builder uses a seven digit product code, rather than
the three letter combination found in the product code database. The seven digit
product codes encompass devices, foods, drugs, biologics, and cosmetics and each
digit signifies a particular description. For example, FRN is the product code
assigned to Pump, Infusion in CDRH’s Product Classification Database. The same
product code translates to 80F--RN in ORA’s Product Code Builder. The two
numbers at the beginning of the seven-digit product code represent the medical
specialty panel classified for the device.
B. Import Entry Process
The classification product code helps the FDA import entry reviewer determine
what information he/she should verify to ensure the medical device meets all FDA
regulatory requirements (e.g., registration, listing, clearance/approval numbers).
Classification product codes are also used by FDA to designate products for Import
Alerts. Import Alerts identify problem commodities, shippers and importers, and
provide guidance for import coverage.

3. Recalls

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Classification product codes are an important aspect in reporting recalls, corrections and
removals. They are used to ensure correct device identification to determine which
group of the FDA will be responsible for review and classification of the recall,
correction or removal. Though not clearly required in 21 CFR 806.10, the addition of the
product code by device manufacturers and importers supports the requirement in 21
CFR 806.10(c)(4) to provide the device’s marketing status, since the product code is
assigned during pre-market review or approval (510(k), PMA, HDE or EUA
(Emergency Use Authorization)) and indicates the regulatory classification of the
device. The device manufacturers and importers should provide the primary product
code associated with the recalled device, unless the secondary product code is more
specific. In cases where the product code is not known by the device manufacturer or
importer, the product code assigned to the device during device listing (Establishment
Registration and Device Listing) should be used.

4. Establishment Registration and Device Listing
A. Determining How FDA Will Classify Your Device
If your product is considered a medical device, you must determine how your
device is classified by FDA for the purposes of registration and listing. 4 Step- bystep instructions on determining how FDA will classify your device can be found on
the FDA website. 5 Here you will identify the correct device name, regulation
number, and classification product code for your device. You will use this
information to list your device in the FDA Unified Registration and Listing System
(FURLS)/Device Registration and Listing Module (DRLM). If you need assistance
with determining if your product is a device or the appropriate classification for the
device, please contact the Division of Small Manufacturers, International, and
Consumer Assistance (DSMICA) by email at dsmica@fda.hhs.gov to receive
assistance.
B. Listing Your Device
Instructions for listing your device are posted on our website 6 under the “Initial
Registration” heading.
i. Exempt Devices
Devices that are not subject to premarket notification (510(k)), premarket
approval (PMA) or HDE requirements are considered exempt devices. You
will need to determine the classification product code for your exempt device

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
before you can list the device in FURLS/DRLM. You can identify the
product code by searching the Product Classification database
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm
). Once you know the classification product code, you can list the device.
ii. Non-Exempt Devices
Devices that are subject to premarket notification or premarket approval
requirements [510(k), PMA] are considered non-exempt devices. If your
device requires premarket notification clearance or approval
(510(k) or PMA), please remember the following:
•

You cannot list the device until the 510(k) or PMA has been cleared or
approved.

•

You need your premarket submission number to list your device in
FURLS/DRLM.

•

You should list your device with the Premarket Submission Number
(510(k), PMA). The classification product code that was assigned on
your clearance/approval letter will appear on your listing.

•

If you believe the classification product code in the CDRH Corporate
database is not correct, then you will need to contact the Program
Operations Staff (POS) in ODE for assistance with correcting this
information. Contact information is listed in the Resource Section of
this guidance document.

iii. Devices Licensed as Biological Products under the PHS Act
Manufacturers of devices regulated by CBER under the PHS Act, i.e.,
manufacturers of licensed in vitro diagnostics including donor screening tests,
should follow the registration and listing requirements in 21 CFR
607.20 and refer to the section “Product Codes for Licensed Devices in
CBER” later in this guidance.
C. Enforcement Discretion
Devices for which FDA applies enforcement discretion and therefore pre-market review
is not necessary, require additional instructions before they can be listed in
FURLS/DRLM. You should contact the Registration and Listing Staff by email at
reglist@cdrh.fda.gov to obtain the additional instructions prior to attempting to list such
a device. A few devices for which FDA applies enforcement direction are certain kits
and export only devices.
i. Convenience Kits

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

You should consider the questions in the following flowchart before listing
a convenience kit:

Does the convenience kit meet the requirements listed in the
“Convenience Kit Interim Regulatory Guidance Document”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuida
nce/GuidanceDocuments/ucm080216.htm?
YES

Is the convenience kit of a type matching
one of those included on the list attached to
the guidance document?

NO

YES

Search the Product Classification database
(http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdr
h/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm) to
determine the product code for your kit.

NO

You may not list the
classification product
code using a kit code.
Each item in the kit will
have to be listed
separately using a 510(k)
or exempt classification
product code.

Did you find a product code that matches
the description of your convenience kit?
YES

Once you determine the product code,
please contact the Registration and
Listing Staff by email at
reglist@cdrh.fda.gov for assistance with
listing your kit.

NO

If you are unable to find a product code
for your kit, please contact the Program
Operation Staff in the Office of Device
Evaluation (ODE) at (301) 796-5640 to
obtain a product code for your kit.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
ii. US Manufacturers of Export Only Devices
US manufacturers of Export Only Devices are required to list the devices
that they export to a foreign country. 7 However, 510(k) clearance or
PMA/HDE approval is not needed for the device to be exported to the
foreign country. Some manufacturers of export only devices may market
the same device in the United States. In this case, the manufacturer uses the
classification product code assigned to the cleared/approved device to list
their device in FURLS/DRLM. If the manufacturer is not marketing the
same device in the United States, they should contact the Program
Operations Staff and obtain a new classification product code for “export
only”. Once a new classification product code is assigned, please contact
the Registration and Listing Staff by email at reglist@cdrh.fda.gov for
assistance with listing devices that are being exported to a foreign country.

Product Codes for Licensed Devices in CBER
CBER regulates a range of devices, most of which are subject to the FD&C Act only. However,
some CBER devices are licensed under the PHS Act (e.g., in vitro diagnostic tests required for
blood donor screening and related blood banking practices). Consequently, licensed devices are
subject to the regulations outlined in 21 CFR Part 600 in addition to those in 21 CFR Part 800.
The different regulatory requirements impact classification product codes as well.
In contrast, product codes for licensed devices are generated using the principles which apply to
most other FDA regulated products (please refer to the Import section). As is the case with other
biologics, licensed devices are classified under industry code 57. For example, a licensed blood
donor screening assay for Hepatitis B surface antigen has a six character product code of the
following structure: 57 V H-05. Of note, the letter in the subclass element can either be an H, I or
L, depending whether this is a final product, intended for further manufacture or product sample
for testing/lot release.
