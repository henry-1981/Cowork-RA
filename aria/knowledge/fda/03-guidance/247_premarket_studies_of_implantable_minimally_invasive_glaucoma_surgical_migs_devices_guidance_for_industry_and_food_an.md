Premarket Studies of Implantable
Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgical
(MIGS) Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document recommends non-clinical and clinical studies to support a premarket
approval (PMA) for implantable minimally-invasive glaucoma surgical (MIGS) devices.
Glaucoma is a progressive condition that damages the optic nerve of the eye, is commonly
associated with elevated intraocular pressure, and leads to irreversible vision loss. It is the second
leading cause of visual disability and blindness in the world. One in 40 adults over 40 years of
age has glaucoma severe enough to cause loss of visual function.1,2 Current treatments for
glaucoma are designed to reduce the intraocular pressure (IOP). Many options are available to
lower the IOP including medications, laser treatments, and surgical interventions. Current
surgical treatments for glaucoma are aimed at reducing intraocular pressure through the
reduction of aqueous inflow or the enhancement of aqueous outflow. While trabeculectomy is
the standard surgical intervention for glaucoma, it is often reserved for moderate to severe
disease. During the past decade, novel medical devices, called MIGS devices, have emerged.
These devices are designed to treat less severe glaucoma by enhancing physiological aqueous
outflow with an approach that causes minimal tissue disruption.
This guidance represents the Agency’s initial thinking and our recommendations may change as
more information becomes available. The Agency strongly encourages manufacturers to engage
with CDRH through the Pre-Submission process to obtain more detailed feedback for
implantable MIGS devices. For more information on Pre-Submissions, please see “Requests for
Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with
Food and Drug Administration Staff”

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocu
ments/UCM311176.pdf).
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database website at
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
The recommendations made in this guidance are applicable to implantable MIGS devices, a type
of Intraocular Pressure Lowering Implant (associated with product code OGO) used to lower
intraocular pressure using an outflow mechanism with either an ab interno or ab externo
approach and associated with little or no scleral dissection and minimal or no conjunctival
manipulation. Intraocular Pressure Lowering Implants are Class III devices and are defined as
devices intended to reduce intraocular pressure when implanted in eyes which have not failed
conventional medical and surgical treatment. This guidance provides additional details on nonclinical and clinical study recommendations not described in the currently FDA-recognized
version of ANSI Z80.27: American National Standard for Ophthalmics – Implantable Glaucoma
Devices.
The recommendations in this guidance document do not apply to implants used to reduce IOP in
the anterior chamber of the eye in patients with neovascular glaucoma or with glaucoma when
medical or conventional surgical treatments have failed, associated with product code (KYF) and
regulated as class II devices under 21 CFR 886.3920, Aqueous Shunt.

III. Definitions
For purposes of this guidance document, the following definitions apply:

Glaucoma: An ophthalmic disease usually characterized by increased intraocular
pressure (IOP) resulting in damage to the optic nerve and documented by typical visual
field defects.

Humphrey Visual Field (HVF): Automated test method to measure retinal
sensitivity During this test, lights of varying intensities are presented in different parts of
the visual field while the subject focuses on one spot. The perception of these lights is
charted in decibel (dB) units of light sensitivity.

Hypotony: An intraocular pressure (IOP) less than 6mm Hg.
5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Intraocular Pressure (IOP): Assessment of pressure in the eye with a tonometer.
It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

IOP Lowering Implant: A device intended to reduce IOP when implanted in eyes
that have not failed conventional medical and surgical treatment.

Hypotony Maculopathy: Abnormality of the macula in the setting of hypotony
characterized by optic nerve head swelling, and chorioretinal folds.

Glaucoma Hemifield Test: A particular analysis of the HVF that compares points
in the upper field to corresponding points in the lower field and then interprets the results
as (a) “outside normal limits” indicating the upper and lower fields are different and may
signify glaucoma, (b) borderline, and (c) within normal limits.

Mean Deviation (MD): Average difference between the subject’s overall sensitivity
for each point on the visual field when compared with that of the reference population.

Minimally-Invasive Glaucoma Surgical (MIGS) Device: A type of IOP
lowering device used to lower IOP using an outflow mechanism with either an ab interno
or ab externo approach, associated with little or no scleral dissection and minimal or no
conjunctival manipulation.

Ocular Hypertension: A condition with elevated IOP but no signs of visual field
loss or optic nerve damage associated with glaucoma. These subjects may also be called
“glaucoma suspects.”

Pattern Deviation (PD) Plot: This measure from the automated visual field
provides information about localized defects by adjusting for generalized visual field
depression due to non-glaucomatous factors such as media opacity (e.g., cataract or a
vitreous hemorrhage).

Washout: Part of a clinical trial when a subject is asked to stop taking all medications.
This can occur prior to initiating the investigational treatment as well as before assessing
clinical endpoints.

IV. Non-Clinical Testing Recommendations
All non-clinical testing should be performed on the finished sterilized product that is intended to
be marketed.

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A.

Biocompatibility Testing

If the actual device cannot be used in testing (e.g., due to the small area of the device),
test samples (e.g., coupons) that are representative of the final device may be employed
for biocompatibility testing.

1.

Recommended Biocompatibility Tests

The following tests should be performed as recommended by Bluebook
Memorandum G95-1 Use of International Standard ISO-10993, “Biological
Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing.”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceD
ocuments/ucm080735.htm).
a.
Cytotoxicity
b.
Sensitization
c.
Ocular irritation
d.
Systemic toxicity (acute toxicity)
e.
Sub-chronic toxicity (subacute toxicity)
f.
Genotoxicity
g.
Carcinogenicity
h.
Pyrogens Testing. If the device contacts blood then materialmediated pyrogenicity testing is also recommended.
In addition, ocular implantation testing should be conducted as outlined in Annex
B of the currently FDA-recognized version of ANSI Z80.27: American National
Standard for Ophthalmics – Implantable Glaucoma Devices. There might be
cases (e.g., inflammation) in which the 6-month implantation study recommended
in ANSI Z80.27 is not sufficient and longer implantation studies may be needed.
For recommended implant test periods for various animal models, please refer to
FDA-recognized sections of ISO 10993-6: Biological evaluation of medical
devices — Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation.

2.

Recommended Physico-Chemical Tests
a.

b.
c.
d.

Test of Extractables and Hydrolytic Stability: Testing should be
conducted as outlined in Annex C of the currently FDA-recognized
version of ISO 11979-5: Ophthalmic Implants – Intraocular
Lenses – Part 5: Biocompatibility.
Test of Extractables by Exhaustive Extraction (Annex C of ISO
11979-5)
Leachables (Annex D of ISO 11979-5)
Insoluble Inorganics (ISO 11979-5)

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

3.

Bioabsorbable Materials

This testing should be performed if the material is in situ polymerizing and
bioabsorbable.
Toxicity should be assessed for the finished product as well as at various time
points over the course of polymerization and/or degradation to ensure that
starting, intermediate and final degradation products are evaluated. Assessments
should continue until the polymer is no longer present in the tissue, or until the
biological tissue response is demonstrated to be stable. For additional guidance,
please refer to the currently FDA-recognized sections of ISO 10993-6 and the
currently FDA-recognized version of ANSI Z80.27.

4.

Biological Response from Device Mechanical Failure

For devices incorporating a coating or multiple material components, it is possible
that mechanical failure could alter the biological response to the device. For
devices with the potential for biological hazard due to mechanical failure, the
biocompatibility testing should include testing to address this concern. We
encourage manufacturers to propose a minimum limit for device failure as
determined with scientific justification. This should be based on considerations
such as the device material and design, risk analysis, anatomical location, and
insertion method.

5.

Sample Preparation

For biocompatibility testing using extracts of samples, the extraction should be
conducted using both polar (water, physiological saline) and non-polar (sesame
oil, cotton oil) extraction vehicles under conditions as described in the currently
FDA-recognized version of ISO 10993-12: Biological evaluation of medical
devices -- Part 12: Sample preparation and reference materials. For permanently
implanted devices, extraction at 37°C for 72 hours may not be sufficient to obtain
an extract that represents the chemicals that may leach out over the use life of the
device. However, in some cases, temperatures over 37°C may result in degradants
and toxicities that are not representative of the device. Therefore, a justification
for the selected extraction conditions should be provided.
Extraction should be performed based on surface area of the device. If the area
cannot be determined than a mass/volume should be used. The test extract should
not be processed (e.g., filtered or centrifuged) and should be used immediately
after preparation.
Extraction in tissue culture media supplemented with serum is acceptable for
cytotoxicity testing and should be performed according to the currently FDArecognized version of ISO 10993-5: Biological evaluation of medical devices -Part 5: Tests for in vitro cytotoxicity.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A scientifically-based rationale for omission of any recommended test should be
included with the submission. We recommend that sponsors who do not intend to
conduct biocompatibility testing submit a pre-submission to obtain feedback from
the Division of Ophthalmic and Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices on the their
rationale. For more information on Pre-Submissions, please see FDA’s guidance
“Medical Devices: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with FDA Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf).

B.

Physical and Mechanical Testing

Device properties should be determined at in situ conditions with the temperature
tolerance of ± 2 °C. The precise composition of the solution used should be reported in
all cases. FDA recommends that testing be conducted as outlined in Physical and
Mechanical Testing of Section 5 of ANSI Z80.27 with the following additions and
exceptions.

1.

Validation of Dimensional Tolerances

(Section 5.4 of ANSI Z80.27) Dimensions for which tolerances are given should
be specified in the manufacturer’s design documentation. The sponsor should
validate that their production meets their tolerances to appropriate statistical
levels.

2.

Surface and Edge Quality

(Sections 5.2 and 5.3 of ANSI Z80.27) The device should be essentially free from
surface defects and all edges should appear smooth when viewed at 10x
magnification with a stereo microscope using optimal lighting conditions. Any
questionable or critical areas should be viewed at higher magnification.

3.

Structural Integrity

(Section 5.7 of ANSI Z80.27) The manufacturer should provide evidence that the
device can withstand surgical manipulations without failure. An appropriate test
method and specification should be established by the manufacturer to ensure that
the device does not fail at typical deformations.

4.

Insertion Testing

The purpose of this testing is to evaluate the integrity of the delivery system and
of the delivered device, if the MIGS device is designed to be delivered from an
injector system. The injector system should be evaluated following the
instructions supplied by the manufacturer and using recommended lubricants and
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
instrumentation. There should be no change in the physical properties of the
MIGS device and no damage to the injector system as a result of the delivery. The
results should be reported and are acceptable if the physical properties of the
MIGS device remain within manufacturing specifications of the product.

5.

Coated Devices

MIGS devices with surface coatings should conduct testing per Section 9.2 of
ANSI Z80.27.

6.

Metallic Devices

MIGS devices manufactured with metallic materials should be evaluated for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) safety according to “FDA Guidance for
Industry and FDA Staff: Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive
Implants in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/UCM107708.pdf) and for corrosion resistance according to
the currently FDA-recognized version of ASTM F2129: Standard Test Method for
Conducting Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization Measurements to Determine the
Corrosion Susceptibility of Small Implant Devices.

C.

Sterility and Package Integrity
1.

Sterilization Method

The sterilization method should be validated according to one of the following
standards:
a.

b.

c.

For moist heat (steam), use the currently FDA-recognized version
of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 17665-1: “Sterilization of Health Care
Products – Moist Heat – Part 1: Requirements for the
Development, Validation, and Routine Control of a Sterilization
Process for Medical Devices.
For ethylene oxide, use the currently FDA-recognized version of
ISO 11135: Sterilization of Health Care Products – Ethylene
Oxide – Requirements for the Development, Validation, and
Routine Control of a Sterilization Process for Medical Devices.
For gamma radiation, use the currently FDA-recognized version of
ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11137-1: Sterilization of Health Care Products
– Radiation – Part 1: Requirements for the Development,
Validation, and Routine Control of a Sterilization Process for
Medical Devices.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

2.

Ethylene Oxide Sterilant Residues

If the MIGS device is sterilized via ethylene oxide, then the maximum level of
ethylene oxide residuals that remain on the device should be quantified and
assessed according to the currently FDA-recognized version of ISO 10993-7:
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 7: Ethylene oxide sterilization
residuals. An exhaustive solvent or head space extraction method should be
chosen and the amount of residue should conform to those for intraocular lenses.
If the extraction is not exhaustive, release criteria should be lowered in proportion
to the relative efficiency of the method.
The residue of ethylene chlorohydrin should not exceed a release of more than 2.0
μg per device per day and not exceed 5.0 μg in total per device.

3.

Bacterial Endotoxins

The recommended endotoxin limit for MIGS devices is ≤0.2 EU/device as stated
in the FDA’s guidance “Endotoxin Testing Recommendations for Single-Use
Intraocular Ophthalmic Devices”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/gui
dancedocuments/ucm393376.pdf). This limit applies to the segment of the device
placed in the anterior chamber and the segment(s) contacting the aqueous humor
even though the main portion of the device may reside outside the eye. For
devices that have a segment that contacts the aqueous humor and the vitreous or
posterior segment, please contact the Division.

4.

Package Integrity Testing

Package integrity testing should be performed regardless of the sterilization
method and may consist of a validated whole package physical integrity test in
combination with a validated seal integrity test. Examples of whole package
physical integrity testing can be found in FDA’s guidance “Container and Closure
System Integrity Testing in Lieu of Sterility Testing as a Component of the
Stability Protocol for Sterile Products”
(http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm146074.htm) or the
currently FDA-recognized version of ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11607-1: Packaging for
Terminally Sterilized Medical Devices – Part 1: Requirements for Materials,
Sterile Barrier Systems and Packaging Systems.

D.

Shelf Life and Shipping Testing
1.

Development of Shelf Life Protocol

The protocol for the shelf life study should be developed prior to initiation of the
study. If, during the course of the study, a parameter no longer conforms to the
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
manufacturing specifications at two or more time intervals, the maximum shelflife of the MIGS device under study has been reached at the last conforming
measurement point. If a manufacturer wishes to maintain the possibility to resterilize finished device lots, the finished device lot(s) used in the stability study
should undergo the maximum number of sterilization cycles allowed under the
manufacturer’s procedures. References to suggested test methods can be found in
the currently FDA-recognized version of ISO 11979-6: Ophthalmic Implants –
Intraocular Lenses – Part 6: Shelf-life and Transport Stability.

2.

Real-time Shelf-Life Study

FDA recommends conducting the following stability and integrity studies:

3.

a.

Product Stability Studies
(1)
Dimensions
(2)
Surface and Edge Quality
(3)
Structural Integrity
(4)
Pressure/Flow Characterization
(5)
Insertion Testing
(6)
Coating Stability, if applicable

b.

Package Integrity Studies
(1)
Whole Package Physical Integrity
(2)
Seal/Closure Integrity

Accelerated Shelf-Life Studies

These studies are the same as those performed for real-time shelf life studies with
the exception of the conditions in which they are performed. It is important that
devices to be measured be allowed to equilibrate to the same conditions as at the
initial measurements before being tested. The corresponding real-time shelf-life is
calculated by multiplying the studied time period by 2(Ta - To)/10, where Ta is the
accelerated temperature and To is the typical storage temperature (usually room
temperature). The maximum acceptable storage temperature is 45°C. While an
initial shelf-life can be established with accelerated testing, a confirmatory realtime shelf-life study should be performed.

4.

Transport Stability

The complete, filled device packages (in their normal transport package) should
be able to withstand extremes of the temperature and humidity (as expected in
shipping), vibration and being dropped. Both the packaging and the product
should be inspected following completion of the pre-test conditioning. The device
should be considered to have satisfactorily passed the test if the device is free
from physical damage when visually inspected under magnification. The
packaging should also continue to provide functional protection to the device.
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA recommends that the following tests be performed, at a minimum:
a.
Legibility of Labeling (empty packages can be used);
b.
Surface and Edge Quality (sealed packages should be used);
c.
Seal/Closure Integrity (empty packages can be used);
d.
Whole Package Physical Integrity (empty packages can be used).

V.

Clinical Studies
A.

Study Design
1.

Patient Follow-up

It is strongly recommended that all subjects be followed for a minimum of 12
months prior to submission of any premarket application, as discussed at the
FDA/AGS Workshop on Supporting Innovation for Safe and Effective Minimally
Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, February 26, 2014. For additional information, refer
to the workshop materials and transcript available on FDA’s website at
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/NewsEvents/WorkshopsConferences/ucm38
2508.htm. For follow-up of less than 24 months, you should provide justification
based upon the benefit-risk analysis. For further information on the principal
factors FDA considers when making benefit-risk determinations during the
premarket review process, please see “Factors to Consider When Making BenefitRisk Determinations in Medical Device Premarket Approvals and De Novo
Classifications”
(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocu
ments/ucm267829.htm). If the benefit-risk analysis raises concerns beyond 24
months after implantation, longer follow-up may be appropriate. The
investigational plan should include the possibility that long-term follow-up (e.g.,
up to five years) may be necessary. It is recommended that informed consent for
up to five years of follow-up is obtained.

2.

Washout Period

All eligible subjects should undergo a washout prior to surgery and at the key
timepoints of interest for the study.

B.

Subject Selection Factors

Subjects included in clinical trials for MIGS devices should have evidence of early or
moderate open angle (confirmed by gonioscopy) glaucoma.* For the purpose of this
*

Based on discussion at the FDA/ AGS Workshop on Supporting Innovation for Safe and Effective Minimally
Invasive Glaucoma Surgery, February 26, 2014, we do not believe that pre-perimetric glaucoma (i.e., optical
coherence tomography (OCT) changes and optic nerve changes without any field abnormalities) should be included
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
guidance, glaucoma is defined as characteristic visual field and optic nerve changes as
outlined below.

1.

Inclusion Criteria
a.

Humphrey Visual Field (HVF)

The HVF should be reliable, which is defined as fixation losses, false
positives, and false negatives all less than 33%.3 The following
characteristics should also be noted on the HVF:

Visual field defects consistent with glaucomatous optic
nerve damage;4 and
(2)
Mean deviation not worse than -12 dB; and at least one of
the following two findings:
(a)
A cluster of 3 or more points in an expected
location of the visual field depressed below the 5%
level, at least 1 of which is depressed below the 1%
level on the pattern deviation (PD) plot
(b)
Glaucoma hemi-field test “outside normal limits.”
While these recommendations are based on HVF, equivalent perimetric
criteria using a different device could be considered for trial enrollment.
b.

Glaucomatous Optic Nerve Damage

Glaucomatous optic nerve damage as evidenced by any of the following
optic disc or retinal nerve fiber layer structural abnormalities:
(1)

(2)

disc rim, especially at the inferior or superior poles with or
without disc hemorrhage;
Localized abnormalities of the peripapillary retinal nerve
fiber layer, especially at the inferior or superior poles; or
Optic disc neural rim asymmetry of the two eyes consistent
with loss of neural tissue

Exclusion Criteria

Subjects that should be excluded from clinical trials for MIGS devices include but
are not limited to the following:
in these interventional studies because there are differing opinions amongst experts about whether this condition
warrants surgical treatment. Because this guidance focuses on an emerging topic, it represents the Agency’s initial
thinking and our recommendations may change as more information becomes available. The current
recommendations are designed to provide a conservative approach to protection of human subjects.

14

For details of other subject inclusion and exclusion characteristics (e.g., minimal
endothelial cell density), please refer to the non-refractory section of the currently
FDA recognized version of ANSI Z80.27: American National Standard for
Ophthalmics – Implantable Glaucoma Devices.

C.

Effectiveness Endpoints
1.

Washout

All subjects should undergo a washout period of all IOP-lowering medications
prior to surgery to establish a baseline IOP. In addition, if IOP-lowering
medications are re-instituted postoperatively, all subjects should undergo a
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
washout period prior to the time point(s) for data collection used in the
effectiveness analyses.

2.

Primary effectiveness

The recommended primary effectiveness endpoint is the percentage of subjects
with reduction of at least 20% (i.e., ≥20%) in mean diurnal IOP from baseline. 5-9
The proposed hypothesis test for the primary effectiveness endpoint should be
described in the statistical analysis plan.

3.

Secondary effectiveness

The recommended secondary effectiveness endpoint is the mean diurnal IOP
change from baseline.

4.

Recommended Analyses

In addition to the analyses described in ANSI Z80.27: American National
Standard for Ophthalmics – Implantable Glaucoma Devices, FDA recommends
the following:
a.

Scatter Plots of Postoperative IOP as a function of
Preoperative IOP

Scatter plots should be provided for the mean diurnal IOP measurements.
Reference lines should be added to the scatter plots at various
postoperative IOP levels of interest (e.g., 18 mmHg), and the percentage
of subjects falling on either side of each of the reference lines should be
presented (e.g., the percent of subjects achieving postoperative IOP of less
than 18 mmHg and the percent with postoperative IOP of greater than or
equal to 18 mmHg). Appropriate reference lines should be selected based
upon such considerations as the specific enrollment criteria for the study,
such as the IOP and severity of disease criteria.
b.

Percent Reduction in Mean Diurnal IOP

The number and percent (e.g., n/N & %) of subjects achieving percent
reduction (or increase) in mean diurnal IOP at each annual visit from
baseline across the entire distribution should be presented. This analysis
should be presented with and without further stratification by baseline
mean diurnal IOP.
c.

Changes in the Mean, Range, and Maximum of the Diurnal
IOP Measurements, and Box-plots of Mean, Range, and
Maximum of Diurnal IOP Measurements

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In addition to analyses of the changes in the mean diurnal IOP
measurements from baseline described in ANSI Z80.27, , analyses of the
changes in the range of the diurnal IOP measurements and maximum of
the diurnal IOP measurements from baseline should be conducted.
Descriptive statistics should be performed as described in ANSI Z80.27
with additional stratification by baseline mean diurnal IOP. In addition to
the box plots of mean diurnal IOP measurements outlined in the standard,
box plots of the range of diurnal IOP measurements and of the maximum
diurnal IOP measurements should be presented. An example of a box-plot
representation of IOP data can be found in the World Glaucoma
Association’s (WGA) Guidelines on Design and Reporting of Glaucoma
Surgical Trials, Consensus on definitions of success, Section II, General
Data Presentation Requirements.10
d.

Fluctuation of IOP Measurements Over Time

For each subject, we recommend plotting the diurnal IOP measurements
(y-axis) versus time of measurements (x-axis) for baseline and each of the
postoperative diurnal IOP visits on the same graph using a different

Change in Number of Medications

At each postoperative visit, a graphical representation of the number preoperative (before washout, when applicable) on the x-axis versus postoperative IOP-lowering medications (counting combination drops as
separate medications) on the y-axis should be made. An example of such a
graphical representation is presented below in Figure 3. The size of each
bubble represents the number of subjects.

Assessment of Balance in Baseline Variables

In addition to the analyses recommended in ANSI Z80.27 and above, we
recommend checking for imbalances in baseline variables that may affect
the outcome (e.g., baseline IOP, age, race, sex, number of medications at
screening) among the arms of the trial.

Adverse Events and Device Malfunctions

The adverse events and device malfunctions for MIGS devices are listed in ANSI
Z80.27. The definition of each adverse event should specify the grade or severity,
the degree of involvement of the anatomical structure, the timing, and the duration
of the event, as applicable, in order to distinguish findings that should be reported
as “adverse events” from those observations that should be routinely recorded.
Case report forms should include a forced-choice method of recording listed
adverse events as well as a method of recording other adverse events not listed.
a.

Hypotony should be classified as an early (i.e., at 2 weeks or less
following surgery) or late (i.e., more than 2 weeks after surgery)
adverse event if it occurs with at least one of the following
conditions:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
(6)

b.

2.

Flat anterior chamber requiring anterior chamber
reformation
Corneal folds
Choroidal effusions requiring or undergoing surgical
drainage
Suprachoroidal hemorrhage
Maculopathy
Corneal astigmatism

Chronic anterior uveitis should be defined as inflammation of
grade 1+ or worse persisting for more than 3 months postoperatively or that recurs less than three months after discontinuing
treatment.11 Two line or greater decrease in best corrected visual
acuity (BCVA)

Device Removal

Reasons for device removal should be recorded in the case report forms.
