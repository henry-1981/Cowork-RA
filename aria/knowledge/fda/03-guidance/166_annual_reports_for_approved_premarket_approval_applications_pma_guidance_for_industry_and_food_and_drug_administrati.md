On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Annual Reports for Approved
Premarket Approval
Applications (PMA)
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA
or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff or
Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
Devices subject to premarket approval (PMA) under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the Act) are subject to periodic reporting requirements set forth in the PMA
approval order (21 CFR 814.82(a), 21 CFR 814.84(b)). This guidance document describes the
information required to be submitted in annual reports under 21 CFR 814.84(b), additional
information requirements that may be imposed by approval order under 21 CFR 814.82(a), and
FDA’s recommendations for the level of detail the applicant should provide in the annual report.
It also identifies the steps FDA staff generally take when reviewing annual reports, the resources
available to assist staff in their reviews, and the actions they may recommend after reviewing
annual reports. This guidance document is intended to help ensure that annual reports are
complete and that the actions of CDRH and CBER staff are consistent.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word “should” in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
A. General Background
FDA needs to be able to rely on a variety of postmarket controls to assure the continuing
safety and effectiveness of a medical device after it is distributed. FDA believes that data and
information gathered in the postmarket setting are critical to our continued confidence in the
safety and effectiveness of the marketed device. Annual reports are one of the important tools
that FDA relies on to gather information about the device in its post-approval setting.
Annual reports contain a variety of information, including information about manufacturing
changes, design changes, and labeling changes that were made during the preceding year for
the PMA product. This guidance recommends that this and other information be analyzed and
presented in annual reports in a way that will be most useful to both the applicant and FDA.
For example, the guidance recommends that the applicant describe in detail the rationale for
changes made to the device, including, for example, whether the changes were the result of
device improvement/enhancement, product complaints, or adverse events. This explanation
will give FDA a more complete picture of the post-market safety profile of the device. The
guidance also recommends that the applicant include a summary of all changes that were
made to the device during the reporting period, including listing all supplements submitted
during the reporting period and, if approved, their approval date. Having the information
submitted in this way will help ensure that limited Agency resources are devoted to assessing
meaningful information rather than requiring FDA to sift through vast amounts of data that
have not been systematically reviewed by the firm.
Annual reports that contain clear descriptions and meaningful information are an important
tool for the Agency and the industry to assure postmarket safety and protect the public.
When applicants prepare and provide to FDA in annual reports the type of analysis this
guidance describes, industry and FDA are better positioned to recognize and address possible
safety issues.

B. Regulatory Background
In PMA approval orders, FDA requires that PMA applicants submit post-approval periodic
reports (e.g., annual reports at intervals of 1 year (unless otherwise specified) from the date
of approval of the original PMA) to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7) and
814.84(b). Section 814.84(b) describes the information required to be included in periodic
reports.
Unless FDA specifies otherwise, a periodic report must:
1. Identify changes described in 21 CFR 814.39(a) and changes required to be
reported to FDA under 21 CFR 814.39(b); and
2. Contain a summary and bibliography of the following information not previously
submitted as part of the PMA:
2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

i. Unpublished reports of data from any clinical investigations or nonclinical
laboratory studies involving the device or related devices and known to or that
reasonably should be known to the applicant.
ii. Reports in the scientific literature concerning the device and known to or that
reasonably should be known to the applicant.
If, after reviewing the summary and bibliography, FDA concludes that the Agency
needs a copy of the unpublished or published reports, FDA will notify the applicant
that copies of such reports shall be submitted.
The PMA applicant is primarily responsible for determining whether changes to the device
design, labeling, or manufacturing processes impact safety or effectiveness and, thus, require a
PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice. This guidance is not intended to define when a PMA
applicant should submit a new original PMA or any type of PMA Supplement. For that type
of guidance, please refer to the FDA guidance, “Modifications to Devices Subject to
Premarket Approval (PMA) – The PMA Supplement Decision-Making Process.” 1
PMA applicants are also subject to other reporting requirements. In accordance with 21 CFR
814.84(a), the applicant must comply with Medical Device Reporting (MDR) requirements,
21 CFR Part 803, and any applicable requirements in other regulations or by order approving
the device, including Post-Approval Study Reports if FDA has imposed continuing evaluation
(post-approval study) requirements on the device in the PMA approval order, 21 CFR
814.82(a)(2).
FDA believes that the types of information described in this guidance and the types of review,
summary, and analyses we are recommending should be readily available to applicants
because they currently collect this information and conduct these analyses as part of their
compliance with the quality system regulations (21 CFR Part 820). For example, design
controls already require the type of look back and assessment that we are suggesting be part
of the annual report (21 CFR 820.30).

III. Scope
In the PMA approval orders, we typically specify that PMA applicants submit a report one (1)
year from the date of approval of the original PMA and annually thereafter. Therefore, the
periodic report is usually referred to as an “annual report.” There may be circumstances,
however, where FDA specifies more frequent periodic reports that provide all of the same
information that is reported annually. This guidance addresses FDA’s expectations concerning
annual and other periodic reports. This guidance addresses but does not describe in detail PostApproval Study reports (see Section VI).

IV. Contents of an Annual Report
2

A complete annual report (in an acceptable eCopy format) should include all of the
information described below. The eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your
signed cover letter.

Cover Letter for an Annual Report
FDA recommends that the applicant include a cover letter for the PMA annual report. The
cover letter should include:
•
•
•
•
•

PMA Number
Device Name (including device family name or model names and numbers)
Company Name
Date of Report
Reporting Period (i.e., the dates the reporting period begins and ends)

Identification of the Changes Made During the Reporting Period
For changes that are the subject of an approved or pending PMA Supplement or 30-Day
Notice submitted in the reporting year, we recommend that the applicant identify the
document number assigned by FDA and status of the document (e.g., approved with approval
date, or pending).
Certain changes related to the device documentation or manufacturing process documentation,
such as rewording for clarification, translating from one language to another, correcting
typographical errors, and moving component characteristics from a notation in an engineering
drawing to a different document, such as an Standard Operating Procedure, generally do not
need to be reported in the annual report (21 CFR 814.39(b)). In general, such changes do not
affect the design, performance, labeling, or processing of the device, and affect only how the
characteristics are documented. These types of changes have been commonly referred to as
“document to file” by industry and should be kept in your design history file.
For each change that was identified as an annual reportable change that did not require a PMA
Supplement or 30-Day Notice under 21 CFR 814.39(b), we recommend you identify the
following, as applicable:
•

description of the change made, including a comparison to the previously approved
version;

•

rationale for making the change, including identification of event(s) related to the
rationale/reason for the change (e.g., MDR number(s), recall number);

•

listing/grouping of associated changes that were made to address the same issue; and

2

•

scientific and/or regulatory basis for concluding that the change had no impact on safety
or effectiveness in order to allow FDA to understand how the applicant determined the
change did not require a PMA Supplement or 30-Day Notice.

FDA recommends that the applicant provide separate tables for manufacturing changes, design
changes, and labeling changes, and that the applicant identify changes that are associated with
each other so it is clear which changes are linked. For example, certain changes might be
linked to each other because they are intended to improve or correct the same aspect of the
device. See below for the recommended format for the Changes Tables.

* Verification and Validation data should not be submitted by an applicant in an
annual report (or reviewed by FDA in a report).
Below are examples of rationales for device changes. FDA recommends the applicant specify
all of the relevant reasons that apply to the change, including but not limited to those we have
listed here, as this list is not exhaustive of all possible reasons for making device changes:
•

made as a result of a device improvement or enhancement;

•

made as a result of an adverse event, device defect, or failure reported to the applicant or
identified in the literature (if the event resulted in an MDR, FDA recommends that the
applicant provide the applicable MDR number(s));

•

made in response to a customer complaint, request, or suggestion;

•

made in association with any recall or corrective action, see also 21 CFR 820.100 (FDA
recommends that the applicant list the recall number or identify if considered a class III
recall);

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

related to an FDA Safety Alert, Public Health Notification, or warning letter;

•

related to any public disclosure or communication on the applicant’s part (e.g., “Dear
Doctor” or “Dear Patient” letters, Technical Bulletins, or other written communication to
practitioners, patients, or sales staff). FDA recommends that the applicant include a copy
of the communication in the annual report.

Summary and Bibliography of Reports of Scientific Investigations and
Literature
The applicant is required to provide a summary and bibliography of reports in the scientific
literature concerning the device that are known, or that reasonably should be known to the
applicant, and that were not previously submitted as part of the PMA application (21 CFR
814.84(b)(2)(ii)). The summary must also include unpublished reports of data from any
clinical investigations or nonclinical laboratory studies involving the device or related devices
that are known or that reasonably should be known to the applicant (21 CFR 814.84(b)(2)(i)).
The summary should include a discussion of how the results and conclusions in the reports
and literature could impact the known safety and effectiveness profile of the device as well as
a description of your plans for assessing the potential impact. If after reviewing the literature,
no issues are identified regarding safety and effectiveness, please clearly state this in the
annual report.
If, after reviewing your annual report, FDA concludes that we need an actual copy of a
published or unpublished report, FDA will notify the applicant, who must submit a copy in
response, as required by 21 CFR 814.84(b)(2)(ii). However, if the applicant anticipates that
FDA will need a copy of any of these reports, applicants may provide a copy in the annual
report on their own initiative.

Information on Devices Shipped or Sold
To help FDA assess the public health impact of the previously requested information, FDA has
required in approval orders issued after August 1, 2009 that the applicant provide FDA with
data about the number of devices shipped or sold during the reporting period. 3 For device
implants, data regarding the number of devices actually implanted should be provided, if it is
available.

V. FDA’s Review of Annual Reports
FDA’s review of annual reports allows the Agency to assess several important issues related
to postmarket safety and effectiveness of approved devices. These issues include the nature
and adequacy of reported modifications and the adequacy of report documentation. If, after
reviewing the annual report, FDA needs additional information, or if we believe the device
modifications that the applicant has reported require a PMA Supplement or a 30-Day Notice,

3

As provided in 21 CFR 814.82(a)(9), FDA may find this information to be necessary to provide a continued
reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA will notify the applicant via letter or email. 4
FDA reviews most annual reports within 90 days of receipt. In general, our review
memoranda follow the format described below.

Reported Changes and Rationale for the Changes
FDA’s review memorandum will summarize the changes described in the annual report and
our evaluation of those changes. The review memorandum will also describe FDA’s
understanding of the applicant’s rationale for the changes and our assessment of the rationale.
The memorandum will clearly indicate whether FDA believes the changes described by the
applicant are appropriate for an annual report or should have been described in a PMA
Supplement or a 30-Day Notice.

Device Change and Bibliography Information
FDA will evaluate your summary of the changes made to the device. As appropriate, FDA
also plans to search the MAUDE database and review certain other FDA records to assess the
post-market safety profile of your device.
FDA will evaluate the information on the changes made to the device and the rationale for
the changes, as well as the information the applicant submits from published and
unpublished reports, and literature to determine if any of this information demonstrates that
the safety and effectiveness profile of the device has changed. FDA can then determine
whether any action (e.g., a labeling change) is necessary to ensure the continued safety and
effectiveness of the device.

VI. FDA’s Recommendations
Generally, FDA’s review will result in one of the following recommendations:

Acknowledgement of Review of Annual Report
When FDA reviews the annual report and has no further questions, we will issue a letter or
send an e-mail to inform the applicant of this status and indicate that no additional
information is needed.

Request Additional Information
If the applicant has not provided all the information required for an annual report, or FDA
finds that the information provided is not sufficient to allow a complete review, we will
request additional information by letter or email. If FDA needs only clarification of an issue,
we will work interactively with the applicant via telephone or e-mail, whichever FDA
believes will be the most efficient.

Changes Not Appropriate for an Annual Report
If FDA determines that a change made to the device required a PMA Supplement or 30- Day

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Notice under 21 CFR 814.39, and one was not submitted, we will notify the applicant by
letter or email.4 In general, FDA will issue a letter notifying the applicant that a PMA
Supplement or 30-Day Notice is required for the change and request that the appropriate
submission be provided within a specified timeframe. However, there may also be instances
when OC review is necessary to determine if any additional regulatory actions are warranted.

VII.Other Reports - Post-Approval Study Reports
As described in 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2), FDA may require continuing evaluation (postapproval studies) and periodic reporting on the safety, effectiveness, and reliability of the
device for its intended use (post-approval study reports). If your approval order identifies
post-approval studies you must conduct, the order will describe the purpose of the studies
and how frequently you must submit post-approval study reports.
Please submit your annual report and post-approval study report separately, even if they are
due at the same time, and identify the date that you submitted your post-approval study
report in your annual report. This will facilitate FDA’s review because the post-approval
study report and the annual report are typically reviewed for different purposes. 5
