Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

This guidance document provides premarket notification (510(k)) submission recommendations
for animal studies that may assist manufacturers in complying with some special controls 1 for
dental bone grafting material devices. The device is a material that is intended to fill, augment, or
reconstruct periodontal or bony defects of the oral and maxillofacial region. 2 The special controls
for dental bone grafting material devices have been set forth in FDA’s guidance document,
“Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Dental Bone Grafting Material Devices”
(hereafter referred to as the “Dental Bone Grafting Guidance). 3 The recommendations in this
guidance are intended to augment those provided in the Dental Bone Grafting Guidance. The
recommendations reflect current review practices and are intended to promote consistency and
facilitate efficient review of these submissions.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, refer to FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards
in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only

as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
Under sections 513 and 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, FDA
published a rule reclassifying tricalcium phosphate granules for dental bone repair from class III
(premarket approval) to class II (special controls). Concurrently, the final rule also classified all
other bone grafting material devices for dental indications, except those that contained a drug or
biologic component, into class II, and revised the classification name and identification of the
device type. 4 The classification identification includes bone grafting materials such as
hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, polylactic and polyglycolic acids, or collagen. Along with
this reclassification action, FDA also issued the special controls guidance document Dental Bone
Grafting Guidance, which was finalized April 28, 2005.
For manufacturers that conduct animal testing, this guidance provides animal study
recommendations that may help manufacturers satisfy the special control to assess “performance
in vivo,” as identified under the mitigation measure of “material characterization” in the Dental
Bone Grafting Guidance. Animal studies are generally recommended and provided in premarket
submissions for these devices to address the safety and performance in vivo, independent of how
similar the material and performance characteristics are compared to those of the predicate
device(s). Providing an explanation of the history of the safe use of similar devices alone is
generally insufficient due to the potential impact of differences in proprietary manufacturing
and technological characteristics (e.g., graft shapes and sizes, surface topography, porosity) on
the in vivo behavior of the bone grafting material devices. As a result, FDA does not
recommend extrapolating the in vivo behavior of a proposed bone grafting material device from
the known in vivo behavior of a predicate bone grafting material device. Also, in vivo behavior
of the bone grafting material typically cannot be adequately evaluated by bench testing methods
alone, such as chemical and physical characterizations, because of specific challenges and
anatomical differences in replicating the intraoral environment that include, but are not limited
to, salivary flow, masticatory forces, food particles, pH and temperature changes, environment
containing unique micro-biota, oral mucosal epithelium, and oral musculature. In light of these
reasons, FDA is providing additional, detailed animal study recommendations for these devices
to assist manufacturers in providing adequate animal study data, when an animal study is
conducted to support a 510(k) submission for dental bone grafting material devices.
The animal study recommendations in this guidance are intended to supplement, and not
supersede, the recommendations provided in the FDA guidance “General Considerations for
Animal Studies Intended to Evaluate Medical Devices.” This guidance document supplements
other FDA documents regarding certain content requirements and recommendations of a
premarket notification (510(k)) submission. 5

III. Scope
The scope of this guidance is limited to animal study recommendations for certain dental bone
grafting material devices, which may help manufacturers comply with some of the special
controls for these devices. This guidance also includes recommendations to help manufacturers
comply with special controls related to biocompatibility assessment of these devices, should the
manufacturer choose to combine an animal study to evaluate in vivo safety and performance with
the biocompatibility evaluation of the implantation endpoint (or the local effects after
implantation). The remaining special controls identified in the Dental Bone Grafting Guidance
are outside the scope of this guidance.
The devices included within the scope of this guidance are limited to the class II bone grafting
material devices regulated under 21 CFR 872.3930 with the product codes listed in the table

IV. 510(k) Submission Recommendations
The sections below provide recommendations on animal study information and data to include in
a 510(k) submission for dental bone grafting material devices. FDA believes that the animal
study recommendations in this guidance provide at least the same level of protection of the
public health and safety as the animal testing details contained in the Dental Bone Grafting
Guidance. To the extent the recommendations in the following sections depart from previously
issued recommendations in the above guidance document, this section supersedes those previous
recommendations.

A. Animal Studies
An animal study conducted for dental bone grafting materials should address factors that cannot
be evaluated through bench tests or in a clinical study. The study design and endpoints should be
based upon the mechanism of action of the device and mitigation of identified risks to health. We
recommend that your animal study includes the relevant information described in the FDA
guidance document “General Considerations for Animal Studies Intended to Evaluate Medical
Devices.” Furthermore, the animal study should evaluate each dental bone grafting material in a
testing environment that simulates (to the extent possible) a clinical setting reflecting the
intended use and proposed labeling of the device (e.g., instructions for use, surgical procedure,
use of any auxiliary support material such as a barrier membrane).
FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to replace, reduce, and/or refine animal use in testing
when feasible. We encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing
method they believe is suitable, adequate, validated, and feasible. If you are proposing to use a
non-animal testing method in lieu of an animal study, we recommend that you discuss the
proposal using the Q-Submission Program. 8 We will consider if such an alternative method
could be assessed for equivalency to an animal study.
We also encourage manufacturers to take advantage of the Q-Submission Program to help
ensure that the animal study protocol addresses safety and performance concerns and contains
elements that are sufficient to support a 510(k) submission.

Animal Model
Your choice of animal model should be justified. We recommend the use of skeletally mature
canine or porcine models, over rodent models, for studying the in vivo performance of dental
bone grafting material devices. Canine and porcine models are recommended since the dental
anatomy of dogs and pigs more closely resemble human dentoalveolar architecture than that of

Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program”

smaller animals. 9,10,11,12 Moreover, rodents experience continuous bone growth throughout their
lifetime, 13,14 which FDA believes would hamper proper assessment of devices intended to form
bone over time. Also, rodents are too small to allow for placement of a sufficient amount of graft
material in an intraoral defect site, particularly for resorbable bone grafting material devices that
contain granular components. In contrast, periodontal tissues and the size of the teeth in dogs or
pigs are, in general, similar to those in humans.
An animal model should be representative of the full scope of the proposed indications for use by
performing studies using anatomical sites consistent with the intended location of use or worstcase defect that covers the scope of indications sought, e.g., intraoral mandibular or maxillofacial
models. When a device is intended to be used in an intraoral environment, there are specific
challenges and anatomical differences, such as salivary flow, masticatory forces, food particles,
pH and temperature changes, environment containing unique micro-biota, oral mucosal
epithelium, and oral musculature. 15,16,17 These challenges are significantly different from other
bone-associated environments within the human anatomy, e.g., cranial/calvarial or orthopedic
applications. As such, cranial/calvarial or orthopedic animal studies are not generally sufficient
to support the in vivo performance of dental bone grafting material devices.

Study Design Considerations
a. Sample Size and Animal Characteristics: To demonstrate substantial equivalence, the
animal study should include a sufficient number of animals to establish trends and to
account for potential loss of animals during the course of the study. We recommend a
minimum of 3 animals per treatment and control group per evaluation time point. The
animal study should be conducted on a minimum of 3 samples for each treatment and
control group per time point. To help minimize bias and help ensure the quality of the
data collected during the animal study, we recommend randomizing the treatment and
control groups (i.e., test article, comparator control, negative control) evaluated in each

animal per evaluation time point, especially if combining multiple sample evaluations
within the same animal. The test article should be the device in its final finished form. 18
The animal study final report should include animal model information describing the
age, sex, breed, and weight of the animals. Additionally, information describing how you
have ensured the study animals have reached skeletal maturity and applicable supporting
information (i.e., X-ray confirmation of growth plate closure or sourcing certificate from
purchasing facility) should be included in the submission.
b. Control Test Articles: We recommend that you select a primary predicate device,
reference device, 19 or autogenous bone graft as a comparator control that is similar with
respect to intended use and technological characteristics (e.g., composition, configuration
[block, granule, putty]) to the subject device. For example, a bone grafting material
device that contains collagen should be compared to another bone grafting material
device that contains collagen with a similar intended use. An empty critical size defect
(sham) should also be used to incorporate a negative control (see Sections c and d below
for more details).
c. Worst-Case Scenario: The animal model selected should be representative of the
proposed indications for use under clinically relevant worst-case conditions to
demonstrate the in vivo performance of the subject device. For example, for many
grafting materials intended for use in guided bone regeneration that include indications
for “ridge augmentation” or “filling of bone defect after cystectomy” where the defect
size may be critically sized, a 1- or 2-wall critical size defect would be most appropriate
to cover the full range of indications. 20,21,22,23 However, if the proposed indications for
use will be for use “only in extraction sockets,” a critical size defect model may not be
necessary.
The design of the animal study should also consider the worst-case scenario of the device
configuration being used, such as shape, volume, density, largest model size, porosity, or
granular size range, if the device is offered in several variations. If one “worst-case” test
For purposes of this guidance, a device in its final finished form includes all manufacturing processes including
packaging and sterilization, if applicable.

article cannot be justified as representative of the full family of devices included in the
510(k) submission, more than one test article should be evaluated in the animal study. A
justification for the selection of worst-case test article(s) should be included in the 510(k)
submission.
d. Critical Size Defect: If the proposed indications for use do not specify a defect size, the
defect model for the animal study should be a critical size defect to ensure the full scope
of the intended use is assessed by the in vivo performance testing conducted. A critical
size defect is defined as the smallest size intraosseous wound in a particular bone and
species of animal that will not heal spontaneously (defined as >30% of the defect volume
filled with regenerated tissue) when without intervention for a healing period in excess of
approximately six months. 24 With a wide variety of animal models (e.g., canine, porcine)
and defect types (e.g., 1-wall, 2-wall) available, the discrete size ranges of a critical size
defect may vary. The critical size defect should be validated using an empty sham defect
demonstrating that the defect cannot be healed on its own.
e. Periosteum: Since the periosteum can influence healing within the bone defect,
manufacturers should state whether or not the periosteum has been removed in the animal
study final report. The presence or absence of the periosteum within all bone defect sites
evaluated in each animal study should be the same to allow for consistent comparison
across all evaluation groups (i.e., bone grafting device treatment samples, control test
articles, sham defects).
f. Healing Period: For defect models that involve extraction of teeth, such as the intraoral
mandibular defect model, we recommend an adequate healing period following tooth
extraction (e.g., 3-6 months) before creating the defect. The allowance for a sufficient
healing period prior to defect creation ensures that the host bone remodeling has reached
a steady/stable state, 25 which creates a consistent and homogenous defect model across
test sites.
g. Study Duration: Bone grafting material devices resorb and remodel at different rates in
vivo. Therefore, we recommend that each animal study includes a minimum of 3
evaluation time points (e.g., 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation). Inclusion of several
time points allows for an assessment in trends for graft resorption and new bone
formation over time, as well as any inflammatory reactions. The earliest time point (e.g.,
4 weeks) allows for an assessment of the initial biologic responses to the device. The
intermediate time point (e.g., 8 weeks) should establish interim device behavior between
earlier and later time points, as well as demonstrate a reduction of any initial
For the purposes of this guidance, the definition for “critical size defect” is found in the FDA recognized
standards of ANSI/ADA Standard No. 206 Implantable Materials for Bone Filling and Augmentation in Oral and
Maxillofacial Surgery - Contents of a Technical File and ASTM F2721 Standard Guide for Pre-clinical In Vivo
Evaluation in Critical Size Segmental Bone Defects. Note, the ASTM F2721 standard contains information relevant
to the design of critical size defect models for the evaluation of bone grafting materials, but the differences between
critical size defect for segmental bone and non-segmental bone should be considered for the specific dental
applications.

inflammatory response. The final time point (e.g., 12 weeks) should be of sufficient
duration to demonstrate bone healing and the effects of any residual device material. For
most bone grafting material devices, FDA understands that the final time point may not
allow for complete device resorption, but instead, the final time point should demonstrate
a trend towards complete device resorption.
We recommend that bone grafting material devices that contain components that resorb
faster than native bone growth and/or are intended to elicit an early healing response
should be evaluated at an earlier time point (e.g., 2 weeks). Furthermore, devices that
contain slow resorbing materials (e.g., hydroxyapatite) should be evaluated at a later time
point (e.g., 26 weeks). The inclusion of such time points for the evaluation of early and/or
later device responses (e.g., 2 weeks and/or 26 weeks) is often either incorporated into
the 3 evaluation time points recommended above (e.g., 4, 12, and 26 weeks) or added as
additional evaluation time points (e.g., 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks or 4, 8, 12, and 26 weeks) in
the animal study. The selected time points and study duration should be justified based on
the expected healing response and resorption profile of the bone grafting material devices
to allow for a comprehensive assessment of the biological and performance
characterizations of the device at relevant time points.
h. Radiography, Histology, and Histomorphometry: The animal study final report should
include the radiographic, histologic, and histomorphometric data to assess bone
formation, device resorption, presence of residual material, and generation of degradation
particulates or byproducts, if present, at relevant intervals over the duration of healing.
Furthermore, the data from radiography, histology, and histomorphometry assessments
can demonstrate the quality of the newly formed bone in its ability to support
biomechanical loading for the intended use of the device under physiologically-relevant
conditions. 26,27 Therefore, FDA believes that radiography, histology, and
histomorphometry data is generally sufficient to demonstrate adequate biomechanical
properties of the newly formed bone, without direct biomechanical testing on explanted
tissue samples from the defect sites over the evaluation time points.
For radiography, histology, and histomorphometry assessments, representative images
should be provided for each evaluation time point to fully characterize each entire defect
in an appropriate format, i.e., histologic and histomorphometric images in color with
appropriate labels that identify the magnification power, defect area, new bone formation,
surrounding bone, test and control articles, and all cell types present. Images from several
magnifications should be included (low and high magnification at a minimum). We
recommend that manufacturers also consider the following recommendations for how to
conduct assessments for radiography, histology, and histomorphometry:

i.

Radiographic image analysis techniques should be used to provide an overall,
high level, non-destructive assessment of bone formation, graft resorption,
device/graft location, and device/graft migration. To provide useful information
concerning the behavior of bone grafting materials in defect sites, radiographic
images should be of sufficient quality to allow for discrimination between bone
(native, autograft, and newly-formed) and radiopaque bone grafting materials
devices. Additionally, these images should be identified by anatomic orientation
and focus on the implantation site.
Although plain X-ray alone could be sufficient, we recommend you consider the
addition of micro-computed tomography (microCT) for each animal at each
evaluation time point within the study because the microCT analysis technique
can provide additional three-dimensional (3D) detail and quantitative information
on device microarchitecture and tissue ingrowth. If other modalities other than
plain film radiographs are used, such as microCT, a validation study should be
conducted, or leveraged from existing historical information or literature
references, to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the modality prior to use.
If including microCT evaluations within the animal study, you should carefully
consider how such microCT imaging may be affected by the sample (e.g., device
constituent material(s), sample preparation), system hardware/software (e.g.,
image acquisition parameters, image processing procedures), and methods used
for microCT image analysis. The segmentation process is a critical step that can
affect the interpretability and validity of microCT results, and we recommend that
you justify your segmentation technique in the animal study final report.
To ensure that microCT results are consistent and comparable across each animal
and across evaluation time points, the same scanning protocol should be used for
all evaluated samples. We also recommend providing the following additional
details in your animal study final report for microCT evaluations conducted
during the animal study:
a) Description of the microCT instrument (system model and any
calibration performed) and image acquisition procedures, including
sample preparation (sample positioning and use of contrast agents, if
any), scanning medium (if scanning samples ex vivo), and scan
parameters (energy, beam filtration, integration time, isotropic voxel
size or in-plane voxel size, and slice thickness for non-isotropic
images).
b) Description of the image processing procedures, including selection of
a region of interest (ROI) (size, shape, and location, including any
anatomical landmarks, offsets, or other criteria used), image filtration
(description of any filter applied and key filter parameters), image
segmentation (method/algorithm/threshold applied for discriminating

between bone and device), 28 and correction or reduction of image
artifacts (e.g., beam-hardening artifacts, ring artifacts, partial volume
effects).
c) For any quantitative analyses, a description of the image analysis
procedures, including the metrics assessed (e.g., bone volume fraction,
bone microstructural organization, bone mineral density, tissue
mineral density) and the algorithms used.
d) The method for selecting the locations of the image slices used for
analysis within the samples should be justified and should demonstrate
consistency across samples. To facilitate visualization of the results,
symbols or markers should be used, as appropriate, to highlight key
features (e.g., bone growth, device material).
ii.

Histologic analysis is used to provide a qualitative analysis of the types of tissues
present and confirm the presence of bone and residual implant throughout the
defect over time. We recommend your animal study final report contains a
description of the methods used to prepare the tissues for analysis, including
fixation, sectioning, staining, and examination protocols (e.g., manual quantitative
methods or automated software). The number of sections per animal and their
location within the defect should be explicitly identified. Multiple stains (e.g.,
Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson’s Trichrome) can be used to ensure that you
capture and identify all tissue types present in the samples. High quality color,
digital macro- and micro-photographs should accompany the board-certified
veterinary pathologist’s report. The purpose of the images is to provide supporting
photo documentation of the veterinary pathologist’s observations and narratives.
We recommend that you include relevant representative sample images from all
study animals, which includes photos of the examined device in situ and a
description of any findings, and an explanation of how bias was avoided in the
pathological evaluation of the animal study (e.g., use of blinded procedures, peer
review, pre-defined acceptance criteria) with rationale for any modifications
stated in the final report when evaluating the tissue reaction to each material and
each sample.
We recommend including in your 510(k) submission the following in the animal
study final report for histological evaluation:
a) The comparator and negative (sham) control images. The comparator
control article should elicit a known/acceptable tissue response. The
sham defect (negative control) should demonstrate that the defect has
not healed naturally on its own.
b) The analysis should be representative of an average of multiple slices
obtained at different levels throughout the sample. We recommend a

Additional information on segmentation techniques used in various imaging modalities can be found in the
following FDA-recognized consensus standards: (1) ASTM F2603 Standard Guide for Interpreting Images of
Polymeric Tissue Scaffolds and (2) ASTM F3259 Standard Guide for Micro-computed Tomography of Tissue
Engineered Scaffolds.

minimum of 3 sections per defect, which are representative of the
entire defect area. Each representative photomicrograph image should
include defined symbols (e.g., arrows, asterisks) that clearly highlight
critical structures and areas of interest. The margins of the samples
should be marked and described in the histological sections examined.
The animal study final report should include a description
characterizing histopathological changes, such as (but not limited to)
fibrosis, inflammation, neovascularization, new bone formation, and
presence of device material.
c) There are advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of
decalcified versus non-decalcified histological techniques. A
justification for the decalcified technique selected should be included
in the animal study final report. We recommend the animal study final
report and/or 510(k) submission include a justification for the sample
preparation technique selected and an explanation for how the
technique allows for the identification of both newly formed and preexisting bone.
d) In addition to the visual assessment of new bone formation or device
resorption by histological evaluation, and as a complementary method
to other performance evaluations (e.g., X-ray, microCT), a
comprehensive quantitative method is also recommended, such as a
histomorphometry evaluation technique. See additional
histomorphometry recommendations in Section IV.A.(2).h.iv. below.
The number of histological sections taken per animal and their
locations within each defect should be identified.
iii.

If microCT imaging is utilized, histologic sections should generally correspond to
microCT images sliced at approximately the same plane. Comparison of microCT
and histologic analyses allows for a more complete representation of the tissues
and materials present within the sample.

iv.

Histomorphometry is used to provide a quantitative assessment of the extent of
bone formation and measurement of the amount of graft material remaining over
time. The histomorphometric analysis should be representative of an average of
multiple slices obtained at different levels throughout the sample and include an
assessment of the presence of inflammatory cells. The quantitative method or
process used to distinguish new bone, pre-existing host bone, soft or fibrous
tissue, residual implant, and void space on representative histomorphometry
images should be described and justified. The region of interest should be clearly
defined and exclude any area of host bone. The histomorphometric analysis
should clearly measure the soft tissue formation (fibrous %) in addition to bone
formation (bone %) and present the data in the context of the original defect
volume/area.

v.

We recommend that the evaluations of resorption assessed in the animal study
incorporate the use of baseline measurements taken at Day 0 post-implantation for
11

all modalities, so that the reported results for the planned evaluation time points
throughout the study duration (e.g., 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-implantation) can be
compared to the initial measurements of area (for radiography and histology) and
volume (for microCT) for the bone grafting materials placed in the defects. We
recommend that you account for any differences when comparing measurements
over the evaluation time points to the initial baseline measurements as part of
interpreting the results in the final study report (e.g., differences from loss of ridge
height due to physiological bone remodeling, differences in precision of
measurements with each modality).

B. Other Considerations
For manufacturers that choose to combine an animal study that evaluates in vivo safety and
performance of the dental bone grafting material with a biocompatibility evaluation of
implantation (or the local effects after implantation) to help reduce the total number of animals
used to support the 510(k) submission, this combined evaluation in the same animal study could
be used to partially address the special control for biocompatibility assessment. Specifically, the
biocompatibility endpoint of implantation, which is typically conducted per ISO 10993-6
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 6: Tests for local effects after implantation could
be combined with the animal study that evaluates in vivo performance. Note that manufacturers
should separately address the other biocompatibility endpoints listed under ISO 10993-1
Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process (e.g., cytotoxicity, sensitization, irritation, genotoxicity) to fully address the
biocompatibility of their dental bone grafting material devices.
If combining the biocompatibility evaluation for the local effects after implantation with the
animal study for device performance under one single in vivo study, we recommend that you use
the methods described in ISO 10993-6 and follow the recommendations in FDA’s guidance “Use
of International Standard ISO 10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1:
Evaluation and testing within a risk management process’.” Note that including the
biocompatibility assessment for the local effects after implantation within the same intraoral
defect animal study intended to evaluate device performance (e.g., assess bone formation, device
resorption, presence of residual material, and generation of degradation particulates or
byproducts) may necessitate the use of different preparation methods, assessments, and
procedures than described in ISO 10993-6 and FDA’s guidance “Use of International Standard
ISO 10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a
risk management process’.” We recommend that you provide justifications for the use of any
different preparation methods, assessments, and procedures that are modified from ISO 10993-6.
We recommend submitting a Pre-Submission to discuss any different preparation methods,
assessments, and procedures adapted for biocompatibility evaluation of the local effects after
implantations within your intraoral defect animal study prior to study initiation. For details
regarding Pre-Submissions, refer to the guidance “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for
Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.”

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
For combining an animal study for evaluating device performance and biocompatibility
(implantation) endpoints within a single in vivo study, we recommend the animal study final
report clearly presents each of the assessments for device performance and biocompatibility
(implantation) endpoints as separate sections within the animal study final report for clarity. For
example, a histological evaluation could be conducted that includes an endpoint defined for
animal performance (e.g., bone formation over time, histomorphometry of pre-defined ROI’s,
lineage-specific stains), as well as the biocompatibility endpoint for the local effects after
implantation (i.e., as described in ISO 10993-6). We recommend the animal study final report
submitted in the 510(k) submission includes the device performance data and conclusions from
the animal study as a separate section from the evaluation of biocompatibility (implantation) data
and conclusions. See also Section IV.A.(2).h above for recommendations pertaining to
histological and histomorphometry analyses that could be applied to the biocompatibility
(implantation) assessment.
