Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Writing Dear Doctor Letters for
Recalls of Implantable
Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This guidance provides best practices for manufacturers when drafting and issuing Dear
Doctor letters to disseminate information about significant health hazards to users of
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). This guidance may also be used by FDA in
reviewing manufacturers’ Dear Doctor letters prior to their issuance. This guidance includes
recommendations for technical content, formatting, and use of risk communication
principles. These letters may also be titled Dear Health Care Professional when they are
disseminated beyond the direct physician community.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal
requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those
requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less

burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your
written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH
Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to
contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

Background
ICDs provide survival protection to patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest. These devices
significantly reduce the increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to sustained ventricular
tachycardia or fibrillation, a leading cause of death in the U.S. However, like any medical
device, ICDs can fail to operate as intended. These failures can be related to the design,
manufacturing, and/or labeling of the device.
When these failures involve ICDs in distribution, a recall (correction or removal) should be
initiated by the manufacturer with oversight by FDA. Manufacturers involved in a recall
should notify all consignees, including physicians, of the reason for recall and the suggested
actions to be taken to correct or minimize the risk to patients (21 CFR 7.49). Ideally, a wellwritten Dear Doctor letter will be the first line of communication to physicians in the event
of a recall, accurately and rapidly conveying information in a way that helps physicians to
make appropriate health care decisions with their patients.
The wording, formatting, and content of Dear Doctor letters are recognized as critical factors
in helping physicians to comprehend and appropriately address potential ICD failures with
patients in their practice. When Dear Doctor letters are poorly written, they may contribute
to unnecessary device removal or replacement. Furthermore, Dear Doctor letters that are
reissued with corrections or revisions may cause additional confusion.
The communication of ICD failures requires a specialized approach because of several
unique characteristics. First, ICDs are life-saving devices. Patients rely on these devices to
provide life-saving shocks in the event of an arrhythmia, and some rely on them for roundthe-clock cardiac pacing. Therefore, certain types of ICD failures can directly result in
patient death. Second, while recalls often require the return of products to the firm, ICDs are
long-term implants with risks associated with explantation. These risks may be higher than
the risk of continued use of the device. Therefore, specific information is needed so that
physicians and patients can carefully consider whether or not the device should be removed
and replaced in any individual patient. Finally, ICDs are programmable, so that some types
of problems can be fixed non-invasively through reprogramming. The goal of
communication in the event of an ICD recall is to help physicians, other health care
professionals, and patients make the appropriate decision for each patient about explanting
the device, reprogramming it, or taking a “watch and wait” approach.

Scope
This guidance provides FDA’s recommendations for maximizing the effectiveness of Dear
Doctor letters through completeness, clarity, and readability, and for enhancing utility in
providing doctors with recommendations related specifically to implantable cardioverter
defibrillators.
This guidance should be used by industry when information related to ICD failures and
corrections or removals are being communicated to physicians. The recommendations in this
guidance may also be useful in communicating risk when no recall action is being taken but
new information is available about ICDs. These situations include communication about
certain product updates, technical notes about product performance, recommended
implantation techniques, or important labeling changes. These types of communications
should also follow these recommendations for consistency and to minimize the need for
subsequent revisions.
The recommendations contained in this guidance draw from FDA’s own research, risk
communication principles, and other efforts to standardize the information in Dear Doctor
letters, including recommendations issued by the Heart Rhythm Society, Health Canada, and
the United Kingdom’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. They
represent content elements demonstrated to be effective in conveying the most critical
information sought by physicians in the event of a potential ICD failure. This guidance is
limited to implantable defibrillators; however, some of the concepts may be appropriately
applied to other implanted devices including pacemakers, and external defibrillators.

Research
FDA has conducted several qualitative research studies to better understand the content,
format, and sources that health care professionals find effective for conveying risk
information on medical devices and which convey the need for appropriate action. These
studies identified “best practices” for communicating with health care professionals about
device failures as summarized below:
a. Present safety information in a consistent order. Letters should lead with
the name of the device and a plain-language description of the problem,
including a clear description of deaths and serious adverse events.
Recommended actions should be prominent and clearly identified.
b. Format letters about safety concerns for easy readability. Use large font
sizes, bold type to highlight critical information, high contrast, subheadings,
bullets or a table format, and short, specific paragraphs.
c. Notify health care professionals about safety issues through multiple
channels. Use email, fax, express mail, and the Web.

d. Make information about device failures available to health care
professionals before patients hear about it in the media. This helps them
to be better equipped to address patients’ concerns and mitigate undue alarm.
e. Focus communications on the problem with the device and recommended
actions for physicians. Health care professionals perceive letters from
manufacturers as less credible when they appear to focus on minimizing
company liability rather than on safety concerns.
f. Avoid promotional statements about the company. Health professionals
want safety communications that are limited to information about patient care.

Recommendations
Dear Doctor letters should be issued in a timely manner so that physicians have the proper
information to respond to patient inquiries generated by other public warnings, including
recall letters, media reports, and trade publications. Dear Doctor letters should be concise
(less than two pages, when possible). The letters should be formatted for easy readability,
using large font sizes, bold type to highlight critical information, high contrast, subheadings,
bullets or a table format, and short, specific paragraphs. FDA recommends that companies
avoid lengthy background information at the beginning of Dear Doctor letters. Rather, they
should provide only succinct descriptions of the problems and refer physicians to
attachments containing full or more complex discussions, if necessary. Immediately
following the brief description of the problem, letters should contain a bulleted list or table
addressing each of the following areas of concern to physicians in order as they appear
below:


What is the nature of the device malfunction or failure?
This should include, whenever available:
o A detailed description of the failure mode and its root cause.
o An explanation of how the failure would manifest clinically.
o A description of the features of the ICD that are compromised by the device
failure. It is important to convey whether life-saving or life-sustaining
therapies are affected, versus secondary therapies or diagnostics.



What is the scope or likelihood of the problem?
This should include, whenever available:
o The number of active implants in the U.S.
o The number of devices that are already known to have exhibited the failure.
o The number of remaining devices that could be subject to the failure.
o Specific patient populations at higher risk for device failure.



What is the severity of the problem?
This should include, whenever available:
o The number of deaths that have already occurred due to the device failure.
o The number of deaths that have occurred that are associated with the device
failure, even if a direct causal link has not been established.

4

o The number and type of injuries that have occurred that are associated with
the device failure, even if a direct causal link has not been established.


Can the failure mode be observed or predicted in clinical follow-up?
This should include, whenever available:
o An interrogation step or clinical test that can be used to identify devices that
have already exhibited the failure mode.
o An interrogation step or clinical test that can be used to identify devices that
have the potential to fail.
o A self-test that can be used by patients to determine whether their device has
already exhibited the failure mode.



Can the failure mode be corrected in situ by reprogramming or upgrading the
software?
This should include, whenever available:
o A recommended follow-up schedule for patients whose devices are subject to
the recall. For example, should patients wait for their next scheduled visit to
have the correction performed, or should they be directed to come in sooner?
o A clear explanation of whether the reprogramming step or software upgrade
addresses the root cause of the problem, or whether it is an interim fix.
o A description of the adequacy of any interim fix in minimizing risks to the
patient.



What is the recommended treatment for patients?
This should include:
o A reminder that most devices will not fail (if that is supported by the facts).
o The percentage or number of devices that are expected (or not expected) to
fail.
o A reminder that the term “recall” does not necessitate device removal.
o A reminder of the risks associated with device explantation and replacement.
o A recommended follow-up schedule for patients whose devices are subject to
the recall.
o A recommendation to consider explantation if:
 the failure mode is catastrophic (affecting life-saving or life-sustaining
therapies),
 the failure mode cannot be predicted by clinical tests or interrogation,
 the failure mode cannot be fixed through reprogramming or other
minimally-invasive procedures, and
 the individual patient is dependent on the device.
o A recommendation to reprogram the device if the failure mode has a root
cause that can be corrected through reprogramming.
o A recommendation to watch-and-wait if explantation or reprogramming is not
warranted, for example, if the risks of explant outweigh the likelihood of
failure.
o Any actions physicians may take to minimize risks to their patients.



What advice can physicians give to patients with affected devices?
This should include:
o Company-recommended actions patients and health care providers can take to
identify affected devices and/or recognize indications of device failure (i.e.,
audible sounds, physical reactions, etc.).
o A reminder that patients should keep routine follow-up appointments with
their physicians.
o A list of symptoms that would warrant going immediately to the emergency
room.
o Company contact information for consumers/patients (e.g., toll-free telephone
number, email address, Web address).



What should be done with explanted devices?
This should include:
o Instructions for returning any explanted devices to the manufacturer for
analysis.



Where can health care professionals get additional information and updates?
This should include:
o Phone number and email address for company point-of-contact.
o Company Web address. Dear Doctor letters should be posted and easy to find
on the company Web site, along with updated information as it becomes
available.

In addition to these recommendations, the authors and editors of Dear Doctor letters for ICD
recalls should also follow 21 CFR 7.49 Recall Communications and FDA’s Guidance for
Industry on Product Recalls, Including Removals and Corrections (11/3/03).
