Clarification of Radiation Control 
Regulations 
For Manufacturers of Diagnostic 
X-Ray Equipment 
Guidance for Industry and 
Food and Drug Administration Staff 
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or 
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on 
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the 
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff 
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page. 
I. Introduction 
This guidance provides clarification to industry and FDA staff of the Federal regulations that relate 
to diagnostic x-ray equipment. For purposes of this guidance, diagnostic x-ray systems and their 
major components are referred to as diagnostic x-ray equipment. This guidance supersedes FDA’s 
guidance entitled “Clarification of Radiation Control Regulations for Diagnostic X-Ray 
Equipment” (HHS Publication FDA 89-8221 issued in March 1989). For the current edition of the 
FDA-recognized standards referenced in this document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only 
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of 
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but 
not required. 
II. Background 
CDRH is charged with the responsibility of enforcing regulations created under the Electronic 
Product Radiation Control (EPRC) provisions (sections 531-542) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 360hh through § 360ss). (Such provisions were 
originally adopted in the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 (Public Law 90­
602), but were incorporated into the FD&C Act with the passage of the Safe Medical Devices 
Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-629).) FDA’s EPRC regulations are covered in 21 CFR Chapter I, 
Subchapter J-Radiological Health (“Radiological Health Regulations,” as used in this document). 
These regulations pertain to the recordkeeping, reporting, manufacturing, importing, and 
installation of an “electronic product” as defined under 21 CFR 1000.3(j). General performance 
standards for electronic products are covered in 21 CFR Part 1010, while specific performance 
standards for diagnostic x-ray systems and equipment are covered in “Diagnostic x-ray systems 
and their major components” (21 CFR 1020.30), “Radiographic equipment” (21 CFR 1020.31), 
“Fluoroscopic equipment” (21 CFR 1020.32), and “Computed tomography (CT) equipment” (21 
CFR 1020.33), which cover aspects of the performance of each listed type of equipment and 
place specific requirements on the manufacturers, importers, dealers, distributors, and assemblers 
of the covered equipment. The term “Performance Standards” as used in this document refers to 
21 CFR Part 1010 and 21 CFR 1020.30, 1020.31, 1020.32, and 1020.33. The term “Specific 
Performance Standards” as used in this document refers to 21 CFR 1020.30, 1020.31, 1020.32, 
and 1020.33. 
III. Scope 
Pursuant to sections 201(h) (21 U.S.C. §321(h)) and 531 (21 U.S.C. §360hh) of the FD&C Act, 
diagnostic x-ray systems are considered to be both medical devices and electronic products. As 
such, they are subject to the provisions of the FD&C Act that apply to medical devices (e.g., 
sections 510 and 520 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. §§ 360 and 360j)) and their implementing 
regulations, as well as the provisions of the FD&C Act that apply to electronic products, known 
as the EPRC provisions2 and their implementing regulations.

The substantive portion of this guidance document consists of two sections. The first is the 
general section (section IV), which contains information of a general nature relating to diagnostic 
x-ray equipment. The second is the specific section (section V), which contains information 
specific to particular sections of the Performance Standards for diagnostic x-ray systems and 
equipment, which can be found in 21 CFR 1020.30 through 1020.33.  
This guidance document addresses only the requirements that apply to diagnostic x-ray 
equipment under the EPRC provisions of the FD&C Act and the regulations implementing those 
provisions.3 This guidance document does not address requirements that may apply to such 
equipment as medical devices under provisions of the FD&C Act and its implementing 
regulations. For more information on the regulation of diagnostic x-ray equipment as a medical 
device, see FDA’s website.4 
FDA acknowledges the importance of simplifying compliance for global manufacturers of 
diagnostic x-ray equipment. Similar to the approach taken in the guidance entitled “Medical X-
Ray Imaging Devices Conformance with International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 
Standards,” in this guidance, FDA is seeking to harmonize many of its requirements for 
diagnostic x-ray equipment with IEC standards, where appropriate, to help to ensure more 
efficient and consistent regulatory review of submissions for these products. Manufacturers are 
encouraged to review the following guidance documents and regularly check the FDA website5 
for new developments on radiation-emitting products: 
• Medical X-Ray Imaging Devices Conformance with IEC Standards6 
• Policy Clarification for Certain Fluoroscopic Equipment Requirements7 
3 In many instances, the statute and regulations governing electronic products are applicable based in part on the date 
the component or system was manufactured (e.g., 21 CFR 1020.30(a), 21 CFR 1020.31). This guidance is intended 
to provide clarification of the regulations that relate to diagnostic x-ray equipment. If there is a question as to 
whether a statutory provision or regulation applies to a particular component or system, manufacturers and others 
are encouraged to review information on FDA’s EPRC website (https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting­
products/electronic-product-radiation-control-program/laws-and-regulations-radiation-emitting-products) or contact

IV. General Information for Manufacturers of Diagnostic 
X-Ray Equipment 
Section 531 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360hh) and its implementing regulations in 21 CFR 
1000.3(d) define “commerce” for the purposes of EPRC as: commerce between any place in any 
State and any place outside thereof; and commerce wholly within the District of Columbia. 
Section 538(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(1)) prohibits manufacturers from 
introducing, or delivering for introduction, into commerce, or importing into the United States, 
any electronic product which does not comply with an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to 
section 534 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360kk). For more information on the introduction of 
an electronic product “into commerce” within the meaning of section 538(a)(1) of the FD&C Act 
(21 U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(1)), see the guidance entitled Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 390.100 
Definition of “Commerce” - 21 CFR 1000.3(d).8 
The Performance Standards in the Radiological Health Regulations do not apply to any 
electronic product which is intended solely for export if: (a) such product and the outside of any 
shipping container used in the export of such product are labeled or tagged to show that such 
product is intended for export, and (b) such product meets all the applicable requirements of the 
country to which such product is intended for export (21 CFR 1010.20). 
Under the Radiological Health Regulations, the manufacturer (any person engaged in the 
business of manufacturing, assembling, or importing electronic products (21 CFR 1000.3(n))) of 
diagnostic x-ray equipment must comply with applicable requirements, potentially including, but 
not limited to: 
• 21 CFR 1002.20: Reporting of accidental radiation occurrences 
• 21 CFR 1002.30: Records to be maintained by manufacturers 
• 21 CFR Part 1003: Notification of defects or failure to comply 
• 21 CFR Part 1004: Repurchase, repairs, or replacement of electronic products 
Manufacturers of an electronic product for which an applicable standard is in effect under the 
Radiological Health Regulations must furnish to the dealer or distributor, at the time of delivery 
of such product, the certification that such product conforms to all applicable standards under the 
Radiological Health Regulations (21 CFR 1010.2(a)). Such manufacturers must also set forth the 
full name and address of the manufacturer and the place and month and year of manufacture (21 
CFR 1010.3(a)). Such certification and identification shall generally be in the form of a label or 
tag permanently affixed to or inscribed on such product (21 CFR 1010.2(b), 1010.3(a)). Many

diagnostic x-ray systems (as defined in 21 CFR 1020.30(b)) consist of components from 
different manufacturers; other systems use components from a single manufacturer. In either 
case, compliance with the Performance Standards is dependent upon proper installation and final 
testing of the complete system at the user location.  
To allow for faster review, all required information, reports, and other submitted documentation 
to FDA should be written in the English language or accompanied by a complete English 
translation. 
Additional information in question and answer format regarding assembler responsibilities is 
provided in FDA’s guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration 
Staff - Assembler’s Guide to Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment.”9 
In general, under the Performance Standards, manufacturers of diagnostic x-ray equipment must: 
• Certify that each component meets all applicable requirements, including applicable 
Performance Standards, when installed into a diagnostic x-ray system according to 
instructions (21 CFR 1020.30(c)).10 
• Permanently affix to or inscribe on the component or system (as applicable) a 
certification label or tag and an identification label or tag (21 CFR 1010.2, 1010.3). 
The identification label or tag must include the name and address of the manufacturer, 
the place and month and year of manufacture (21 CFR 1010.3(a)), and, except for 
high-voltage generators contained within tube housings and beam-limiting devices 
that are integral parts of tube housings, the model number and serial number of the 
product (21 CFR 1020.30(e)). 
• Provide to assemblers and, upon request, to others at a cost not to exceed the cost of 
publication and distribution, instructions for assembly, installation, adjustment, and 
testing of such components adequate to assure that the products will comply with 
applicable provisions of the Specific Performance Standards when assembled, 
installed, adjusted, and tested as directed. Such instructions must include 
specifications of other components compatible with that to be installed when 
compliance of the system or subsystem depends on their compatibility. Such 
specifications may describe pertinent physical characteristics of the components 
and/or may list by manufacturer model number the components which are 
compatible. (21 CFR 1020.30(g).)

• Provide to purchasers and, upon request, to others at a cost not to exceed the cost of 
publication and distribution, manuals or instruction sheets which shall include 
adequate instructions concerning any radiological safety procedures and precautions 
which may be necessary because of unique features of the equipment and a schedule 
of the maintenance necessary to keep the equipment in compliance with the Specific 
Performance Standards (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)). 
V. Specific Topics of Importance to Manufacturers of 
Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment 
A. 
Introduction into Commerce and Certification (See also 
questions 38, 39, 91, 95, 96, 99, 100, and 101) 
The certification process for diagnostic x-ray equipment is generally a component-by-component 
process where individually certified components are assembled into a complete diagnostic x-ray 
system. Alternatively, a manufacturer of a complete x-ray system may choose to certify the 
system as a whole (21 CFR 1002.1 Table 1, footnote 4), or a combination of two or more 
components if they obtain prior authorization in writing from the Director, Center for Devices 
and Radiological Health (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i) identifies the 
components of diagnostic x-ray systems to which the provisions of 21 CFR 1020.30 apply and 
that are therefore subject to the certification requirement of 21 CFR 1010.2 (hereinafter, 
“certifiable” means a component or system subject to this certification requirement). These x-ray 
components may also qualify as medical devices under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act (21 
U.S.C. 321(h)) and therefore be subject to the provisions of the FD&C Act that apply to medical 
devices. The component by itself may not be able to produce diagnostic x-rays (for purposes of 
this guidance, x-rays intended for irradiation of any part of the human body for the purpose of 
diagnosis or visualization) but is intended to be installed or assembled with other compatible 
components into a complete diagnostic x-ray system at the user location. 
1. 
QUESTION: When must a diagnostic x-ray system or certifiable x-ray component be 
certified? 
ANSWER: Section 538(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(1)) provides that it 
shall be unlawful for any manufacturer to introduce, or to deliver for introduction, into 
commerce any electronic product which does not comply with an applicable standard 
prescribed pursuant to section 534 (21 U.S.C. § 360kk). Additionally, section 538(a)(5) (21 
U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(5)) provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to fail to issue a 
certification as required by section 534(h) (21 U.S.C. § 360kk(h)). Section 534(h) (21 
U.S.C. § 360kk(h)) provides that every manufacturer of an electronic product to which is 
applicable a standard in effect under section 534 (21 U.S.C. § 360kk) shall furnish to the 
10 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
distributor or dealer at the time of delivery of such product a certification that such product 
conforms to all applicable standards under section 534 (21 U.S.C. § 360kk). And 21 CFR 
1010.2(a), which was prescribed pursuant to section 534 of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 
360kk), among other provisions, provides that every manufacturer of an electronic product 
for which an applicable standard is in effect under the Radiological Health Regulations 
shall furnish to the dealer or distributor, at the time of delivery of such product, the 
certification that such product conforms to all applicable standards under the Radiological 
Health Regulations. 
Consequently, at the time of delivery to the distributor or dealer, any diagnostic x-ray 
system or certifiable component must have been certified to conform to all applicable 
Performance Standards under section 534 (21 U.S.C. § 360kk). 
2. 
QUESTION: Can I import certifiable diagnostic x-ray components that have not been 
certified? 
ANSWER: Section 538(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(1)) states that a 
manufacturer may not import into the United States any electronic product which does not 
comply with an applicable standard prescribed pursuant to section 534 (21 U.S.C. § 
360kk), including the certification requirement of section 534(h) (21 U.S.C. § 360kk(h)). 
But, under section 538(b) (21 U.S.C. § 360oo(b)), FDA may exempt any electronic 
product, or class thereof, from this requirement, upon such conditions as it may find 
necessary to protect the public health or welfare, for the purpose of research, investigations, 
studies, demonstrations, or training, or for reasons of national security. Accordingly, in 
Form FDA 2877 - Declaration for Imported Electronic Products Subject to Radiation 
Control Standards, FDA allows, under limited circumstances, for the importation of 
certifiable components that are not certified. If such components are being imported only 
for research, investigations/studies, demonstration or training, the filer would choose 
Declaration C (“DO NOT COMPLY WITH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; ARE 
BEING HELD UNDER A TEMPORARY IMPORT BOND; WILL NOT BE 
INTRODUCED INTO COMMERCE; WILL BE USED UNDER A RADIATION 
PROTECTION PLAN; AND WILL BE DESTROYED OR EXPORTED UNDER U.S. 
CUSTOMS SUPERVISION WHEN THE FOLLOWING MISSION IS COMPLETE: . . 
.”), and would have to export or destroy such product when the purpose of the importation 
has been achieved or the length of time stated has expired. If certifiable components that 
are not certified being imported are to be brought into compliance with applicable 
standards through reconditioning, the filer would choose Declaration D (“DO NOT 
COMPLY WITH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS; ARE HELD AND WILL 
REMAIN UNDER BOND; AND WILL NOT BE INTRODUCED INTO COMMERCE 
UNTIL NOTIFICATION IS RECEIVED FROM FDA THAT PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN

QUESTION: If a certifiable diagnostic x-ray component or system has been installed for use 
on humans under an investigational device exemption (IDE), must it be certified? 
ANSWER: Yes. If a certifiable diagnostic x-ray component or system has been installed 
for use on humans under an IDE (see section 520(g) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(g)) 
and 21 CFR part 812), it must comply with all applicable standards prescribed pursuant to 
section 534 of the FD&C Act (21 U.SC. § 360kk) and be certified (sections 538(a)(1) and 
(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 360oo(a)(1) and (5))). 
4. 
QUESTION: After a diagnostic x-ray system or component has been sold and installed, who 
is responsible for ensuring continued equipment compliance with the Performance Standards? 
ANSWER: The certifying manufacturer is responsible for designing systems and 
components to guarantee compliance with the Performance Standards for the life of the 
equipment when the equipment is properly maintained (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). A certified 
product that is maintained according to the maintenance schedule provided by the 
certifying manufacturer is expected to conform to the regulations and Performance 
Standards in effect on the date of manufacture (21 CFR 1020.30(c) and 1020.30(h)). For 
example, a product manufactured in 2004 is expected to be in compliance with the 
regulations in effect in 2004.  
Because diagnostic x-ray equipment usually will remain in use for many years, the 
certifying manufacturer is required to provide a maintenance schedule that, if properly 
implemented by the user, will keep the equipment in compliance with the Performance 
Standards (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)(ii)). If the assembler installs the equipment following the 
instructions provided by the certifying manufacturer (21 CFR 1020.30(g)), and the user 
maintains the equipment according to the maintenance schedule provided by the certifying 
manufacturer (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)(ii)), the certifying manufacturer may be held 
responsible for manufacturer-related compliance issues until the equipment is permanently 
removed from service. However, the certifying manufacturer will not be held responsible 
for noncompliance of their products if that noncompliance is due solely to the improper 
installation, assembly, or maintenance of that product by another person. (21 CFR 
1020.30(c) and 1020.30(h)). (See also question 58).

QUESTION: A firm manufactures x-ray equipment for use in veterinary offices, for 
microscopic examination of materials in pathology laboratories, and for training radiologic 
technologists when no living human subjects are imaged. Must this x-ray equipment be 
certified? Is the firm required to file a Form FDA 2579 (“Report of Assembly of a Diagnostic 
X-Ray System”)?

ANSWER: A “diagnostic x-ray system” is defined, for the purposes of the Performance 
Standards, as “an x-ray system designed for irradiation of any part of the human body for 
the purpose of diagnosis or visualization.” (21 CFR 1020.30(b)). Because the electronic 
products in this question are not intended for use on humans, they are not diagnostic x-ray 
systems, and do not need to be certified as such. However, these systems are considered 
electronic products under the Radiological Health Regulations, and the firm must comply 
with all of the EPRC requirements for equipment without a specific performance standard 
(21 CFR 1002.1). This includes any reporting requirements in Table 1 of 21 CFR 1002.1 
and reporting Accidental Radiation Occurrences (AROs) to the FDA. 
The firm is not required to file Form FDA 2579. Form FDA 2579 is filed to report 
assembly of certified diagnostic equipment intended for irradiation of any part of the 
human body for the purpose of diagnosis or visualization. The completion and filing of the 
form is not required for any non-human application. Even though certified equipment is 
often installed in veterinary facilities, when such equipment will be used as dedicated 
veterinary equipment, it does not require certification to the Performance Standards. 
NOTE: Some state and local agencies may have more stringent reporting requirements, and 
the firm should check with relevant state and local agencies regarding those state and local 
agency requirements. 
6. 
QUESTION: Are there specific requirements for diagnostic x-ray systems installed in mobile 
vehicles? 
ANSWER: No. There are no specific requirements in 21 CFR 1020.30 for diagnostic x-ray 
systems installed in mobile vehicles. Diagnostic x-ray systems installed in mobile vehicles 
may be subjected to adverse environmental conditions. Manufacturers should provide 
specific instructions for installation, assembly, testing, and maintenance of diagnostic x-ray 
systems that are designed for, or routinely installed in, mobile vehicles in order to take into 
account potential adverse environmental conditions.  
NOTE: Diagnostic x-ray systems installed in mobile vehicles are subject to the general 
requirements for diagnostic x-ray systems provided in the Performance Standards. 
7. 
QUESTION: If a component or system is designed or modified so that it performs a function 
that is characteristic of a certifiable component or system, does it need to be certified with 
respect to that function? 
ANSWER: Yes. Any component or system that serves substantially the same function as a 
certified component or system (see 21 CFR 1002.1 and 21 CFR 1020.30(a)) meets the 
definition of that component or system, and therefore must be certified (21 CFR 
1020.30(c)).

For example, if software included with a digital detector controls the technique factors 
(e.g., duration of an exposure), then the software performs the same function as an x-ray 
control and therefore is itself an x-ray control. Because an x-ray control is a certifiable 
component (see 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i)(A)), the software is subject to the requirements of 
the Performance Standards relevant to x-ray controls. These requirements include a 
statement of compatibility with other components in the system (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). 
As another example, if a digital detector is marketed with a front panel (e.g., dust cover) 
that is not necessary for the digital detector’s operation, then the front panel performs the 
same function as a cassette holder with front panel and therefore is itself considered a 
cassette holder with front panel under the EPRC regulations. Because a cassette holder with 
front panel is a certifiable component (see 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i)(A)), the front panel is 
subject to the requirements of the Performance Standards relevant to cassette holders with 
front panels. These requirements include maximum aluminum equivalence requirements 
under 21 CFR 1020.30(n) and the front panel must be certified as a cassette holder with 
front panel (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). 
These are two examples and not an exhaustive discussion. For questions related to other 
design features, please contact the FDA program at RadHealth@fda.hhs.gov. 
Note that adding functionality to a product may affect labeling applied to a component or 
system. See also section V.B.(i), “General Labeling,” for more information on labeling 
requirements for various components and systems. 
8. 
QUESTION: Must a manufacturer of certifiable components provide information regarding 
the compatibility of their components with other components? 
ANSWER: Manufacturers of certified components must provide to assemblers, and others 
who request it, at a cost not to exceed the cost of publication and distribution, instructions 
for assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). When compliance 
of the component(s) or system depends on component compatibility, the information 
provided must include specifications of compatible components (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). 
Such specifications may describe pertinent physical characteristics of the components 
and/or may list by manufacturer model number the components which are compatible. 
While it is permissible to list manufacturer model numbers to specify compatible 
components, that is not the only acceptable means for identifying compatible components. 
A manufacturer may also describe pertinent physical characteristics of the components to 
identify those which are compatible. While manufacturers are generally not required to 
disclose trade secrets or confidential information, all instructions for the assembly, 
installation, adjustment, and testing of certified components must be adequate to assure that 
the products will comply with applicable provisions of the Specific Performance Standards 
when assembled, installed, adjusted, and tested as directed. See also section V.F., 
“Assembly.”

QUESTION: Do the Specific Performance Standards apply to x-ray based image-guidance 
used with radiation therapy devices? 
ANSWER: If the x-ray based image-guidance used with radiation therapy devices is only 
intended to assist with radiation therapy administration and not for diagnostic imaging or 
visualization, then 21 CFR 1020.30 is not applicable. Other EPRC requirements are still 
applicable to image guided radiation therapy systems. 
FDA recommends that manufacturers of x-ray based image-guidance used with radiation 
therapy devices evaluate safety and performance using applicable FDA-recognized 
standards, which include IEC 60601-2-68: Medical electrical equipment - Part 2-68: 
Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of X-ray-based 
image-guided radiotherapy equipment for use with electron accelerators, light ion beam 
therapy equipment and radionuclide beam therapy equipment. 
10. QUESTION: Are cone-beam computed tomography x-ray systems with applications such as 
dental, ENT, or extremity use required to conform to the Computed Tomography (CT) 
performance standard (21 CFR 1020.33) even though certain sections do not seem appropriate 
for cone-beam technology? 
ANSWER: Cone-beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) devices are considered CT 
systems because they depict the x-ray attenuation properties of a section through the body 
by the acquisition and computer processing of x-ray transmission data. They are therefore 
subject to the CT performance standard under 21 CFR 1020.33, including but not limited to 
the quality assurance requirements provided in 21 CFR 1020.33(d). If one or more 
provisions of the CT performance standard under 21 CFR 1020.33 do not appear 
appropriate for a CBCT device, the manufacturer should apply for a variance from such 
provision(s) as described in 21 CFR 1010.4. For dental CBCT systems which are primarily 
intended to produce three-dimensional CT images, 21 CFR 1020.33 applies. For 
fluoroscopy systems that include CBCT functions where the device is primarily intended 
for fluoroscopic imaging or for recording images from the fluoroscopic image receptor, 21 
CFR 1020.33 does not apply (in this circumstance 21 CFR 1020.32 applies). For CBCT 
intended only to assist with radiation therapy administration, see question 9.

12. QUESTION: A firm sells diagnostic x-ray systems, all of which consist of the same 
combination of components. May the firm place the identification and certification 
information for the system, with specific component information (e.g., model number, serial 
number, and date of manufacture), in the user’s manual rather than on the individual 
components? 
ANSWER: No. The required labeling must be placed on each component subject to 
certification (21 CFR 1010.2, 1010.3, and 1020.30(c)). 
13. QUESTION: May a combination of certifiable components be identified with a single 
identification label and a single certification label? 
ANSWER: A combination of two or more certifiable components may bear a single 
certification label if prior authorization is obtained in writing from the Director, Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health, to single label such a specific combination of 
components (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). In the case of products for which it is not feasible to 
affix identification labeling to each component, upon application by the manufacturer, the 
Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health may approve an alternate means by 
which such identification may be provided through single labeling of that combination of 
components (21 CFR 1010.3(b)). In the absence of prior authorization under 21 CFR 
1010.3(b) or 1020.30(c), FDA does not intend to object to the use of a single identification 
label and/or a single certification label under the following circumstances: 
• High-voltage generators contained inseparably within tube housing assemblies. 
• Beam-limiting devices that are integral, inseparable parts of tube housing assemblies. 
• High-voltage generators and x-ray controls when inseparable, combined in a single 
housing, and marketed under a single model designation. 
• Combination of x-ray control panels and air kerma displays when inseparable, combined 
in a single housing, and marketed under a single model designation. 
14. QUESTION: How should a manufacturer apply for FDA authorization to single label 
combinations of certifiable components not identified in question 13? 
ANSWER: A written request must be submitted to FDA as required by 21 CFR 1020.30(c). 
The written request should specify the components to be single labeled and include the 
reasons why the manufacturer believes the labeling request should be authorized.

Manufacturers interested in requesting permission to single label a combination of 
components should send their request to the attention of the Director, Center for Devices

Bldg. 66, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002. Requests may also be sent via email to the 
following inbox: RadHealthCustomerService@fda.hhs.gov. 
15. QUESTION: How does FDA evaluate a request submitted pursuant to 21 CFR 1020.30(c) to 
certify single label combinations of certifiable components? 
ANSWER: The manufacturer must demonstrate that the combination of certifiable 
components is compliant with the applicable Performance Standards under a testing 
program (see 21 CFR 1010.2(c)) for the single label to denote product certification. Each 
request will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but the certifiable components should be 
contained in a single housing and marketed as a single certified entity, except for repair 
parts. For some products, for example, portable x-ray equipment (x-ray equipment 
designed to be hand-carried, see 21 CFR 1020.30(b)), this single label combination may 
encompass the entire system. 
16. QUESTION: Items such as phototimers, automatic exposure controls, and positive beam 
limiting systems (including collimator, sensing tray, and electrical chassis), are made up of 
subassemblies located in various parts of the system, including in or on other certifiable 
components. Must each of these subassemblies be labeled with manufacturer identification, 
model, and certification information as specified in 21 CFR 1010.3 and 1020.30(e), or may 
one model number be assigned to the multiple parts? 
ANSWER: Assignment of more than one model number and nameplate to the scattered 
parts of certifiable components is permissible. FDA does not intend to object if only one 
model number is assigned to multiple parts if they belong to the same system as a whole 
and each part contains appropriate labeling. In the example of a distributed set of 
subassemblies (including client-server software architectures), FDA does not intend to 
object if only the essential part(s) of a certifiable component are labeled as specified under 
21 CFR 1010.3 and 1020.30(e). These required labels should be placed on the portion of 
the subassembly which would appear to the user to be performing the function of the 
certified component. 
17. QUESTION: Laptop or desktop computers that use software to control diagnostic x-ray 
systems have become widespread. Are both the original and replacement computers required 
to be labeled with identification, certification, and warning labels? 
ANSWER: Yes. FDA considers a laptop computer or desktop computer with an off-the­
shelf monitor that uses software to control diagnostic x-ray systems to serve the same 
function as an x-ray control. Therefore, they are subject to the same labeling requirements 
as any other diagnostic x-ray control as described in 21 CFR 1020.30(b).

The manufacturer of such diagnostic x-ray system control software may state that a laptop 
computer or desktop computer with an off-the-shelf monitor meets their compatibility 
criteria. However, once a user installs a laptop computer or desktop computer with an off-
the-shelf monitor which meets the x-ray system control software manufacturer’s statement 
of compatibility into a completed diagnostic x-ray system, the diagnostic x-ray system 
control software manufacturer continues to be responsible for compliance with the 
applicable requirements and management of the risks of the x-ray control aspects of the 
diagnostic x-ray system. 
The replacement of a diagnostic x-ray system control’s monitor by a user may affect the 
component’s compliance with applicable labeling requirements. The certification and 
identification labels (or the display of their contents) must be readily accessible by the user 
(see 21 CFR 1010.2 and 1010.3) and the required warning statement must be displayed on 
each laptop computer or desktop computer with an off-the-shelf monitor used as a control 
panel (21 CFR 1020.30(j)). 
The labeling for a laptop computer or desktop computer with an off-the-shelf monitor used 
as x-ray controls may have been approached in several ways. Below are two examples of 
labeling methods: 
• Physical labels consistent with 21 CFR 1010.2 (Certification), 1010.3 (Identification), 
and 1020.30(j) (Warning label), accompanied by adequate instructions for placement and 
verification of the labels. 
• Electronically: FDA does not intend to object if (1) each time the system is started, the 
screen displays the identification label and the certification label, requiring user action 
before removing these labels and resuming the start-up sequence; and (2) during use, the 
required warning label is continuously displayed on the screen. If the screen is used as 
both an acquisition and review work station, the warning label need not be displayed 
when in the review mode, but the warning label should be continuously displayed when 
in the acquisition mode. 
18. QUESTION: Device labeling regulations under 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809 generally permit 
the use of symbols in device labeling without adjacent explanatory text if certain requirements 
are met.11 Is the use of a symbol found in standards such as ISO 7000 permitted in the 
mandatory labeling for certified x-ray components?

ANSWER: FDA does not intend to object to the use of a symbol in certain labeling 
 
required by 21 CFR 1020.30 where the use of such a symbol is consistent with the device 
 
labeling regulations under 21 CFR Parts 801 and 809. 
 
 
For example, certain FDA-recognized standards such as ISO 7000: 
Graphical symbols for 
 
 
use on equipment
 and IEC 60417: 
Graphical symbols for use on equipment
 include 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
symbols to which FDA does not intend to object when used on labels required by the 
 
 
 
 
 
Performance Standards. Some examples of such symbols from ISO 7000:2019 include 
 
 
 
 
catalogue number, serial number, and date of manufacture.  However, this policy does not 
apply to other required labels, including the certification label (21 CFR 1010.2) and 
 
warning label (21 CFR 1020.30(j)), that require complete phrases written in English and 
 
which cannot be adequately represented by symbols.

19. QUESTION: Items such as phototimers, automatic exposure controls, and positive beam 
 
 
 
limiting systems (including collimator, sensing tray, and electrical chassis), are made up of 
 
 
subassemblies located in various parts of the system including in or on other certifiable 
 
 
components. May a manufacturer label only the essential part(s) of a major component?  If 
 
 
 
 
yes, where should such labels be located? 
 
ANSWER: As noted in the answer to question 16, in the example of a distributed set of 
 
 
subassemblies (including client-server software architectures), FDA does not intend to 
 
object if only the essential part(s) of a certifiable component are labeled as specified under 
 
 
 
 
 
21 CFR 1010.3 and 1020.30(e). These required labels should be placed on the portion of 
 
the subassembly which would appear to the user to be performing the function of the 
 
 
certified component. 
 
Table 1 lists several major components and suggested label locations for each major 
 
 
 
 
component. If you have received written authorization from FDA (21 CFR 1020.30(c)) to 
 
 
 
certify a combination of two or more major components (i.e., one catalog item that is not 
 
 
 
intended to be subdivided for use with other components), only one label is required. 
 
 
NOTE: All tube housing assemblies must be labeled with the name of the manufacturer, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
model number, and serial number of the x-ray tube which the tube housing assembly 
 
 
incorporates, since they are subject to frequent replacement (21 CFR 1020.30(e)(1)).

20. QUESTION: What is FDA’s policy concerning the location of the certification and 
 
 
identification labels and the warning label for diagnostic x-ray systems? 
 
 
 
 
ANSWER: Certification and identification labels must be legible and readily accessible to 
view when the product is fully assembled for use (21 CFR 1010.2(b) and 1010.3(a)). For 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the purposes of this guidance, “legible and readily accessible to view” for diagnostic x-ray 
 
 
systems means a location where a person can read the label without having to relocate the 
x-ray system or use a tool to remove or open panels, doors, etc. The certification and 
 
 
 
 
 
 
identification labels should be accessible to view once installed and not on a side that is 
normally placed against a wall. For some components, such as a tube housing assembly 
mounted under a table, the certification and identification labels might not be visible from 
 
outside the completed system. In such a case, the certification and identification labels 
 
 
 
 
 
should be mounted on the component, although the component itself is not visible. If this 
 
 
 
 
location is behind a door, panel, under a table, etc., or otherwise in a location that is not

certification and identification labels (see 21 CFR 1010.2 and 1010.3 regarding general 
label requirements). 
The warning label serves to alert users to the hazards associated with the use of the 
diagnostic x-ray equipment and should be conspicuous to the user. It should be situated so 
that a user of an x-ray machine can see the warning when the user is preparing to initiate an 
exposure (21 CFR 1020.30(j)). There should be a warning label visible at each location 
where technique factors may be set and where x-ray exposure may be initiated. 
21. QUESTION: For aesthetic reasons, some manufacturers place certified components behind 
cosmetic covers and then place duplicate certification and identification labels on the covers. 
Is this acceptable? 
ANSWER: Yes, but only when the components themselves are also appropriately labeled. 
This duplicate label placement satisfies the “readily accessible to view” requirements of the 
Performance Standards (21 CFR 1010.2(b) and 1010.3(a)) so long as the manufacturer 
provides adequate assembly instructions to verify that the component label and the 
duplicate label on the outside casing are identical. The placement of the duplicate label 
should be on the covering over the certified component or immediately adjacent to the 
component. The assembly instructions provided with replacement components should 
address replacement labeling when component replacement is necessary. 
22. QUESTION: A firm manufactures fluoroscopic systems used for angiography and 
interventional procedures. The diagnostic source assembly is covered by a plastic shield. The 
shield makes cleaning of the diagnostic source assembly easier. The certification and 
identification labels on the tube housing assembly and beam limiting device are covered by 
the shield. There is a panel on the shield that can be removed with a screwdriver that would 
allow access to the certification and identification labels. Is this acceptable? 
ANSWER: No. Because the panel requires a screwdriver to open, the certification and 
identification labels are not considered accessible to view. Since the certification and 
identification labels are not accessible to view under normal use (see 21 CFR 1010.2(b), 
1010.3(a), and 1020.30(e)), this is not acceptable under the regulations. Acceptable 
solutions may include designing the panel to be removable without the use of tools, placing 
the labels behind a clear shield so that they remain accessible to view, or designing labels 
such that they remain legible despite cleaning practices and placing them without the 
protective shield. 
23. QUESTION: A firm has been asked to install a diagnostic x-ray system in a facility where a 
wall will prevent anyone from seeing the certification and identification labels on the x-ray 
table. Is this acceptable?

ANSWER: No. Even if the x-ray table was otherwise properly labeled, the proposed 
placement would render the assembly noncompliant (see 21 CFR 1010.2(b), 1010.3(a), 
and1020.30(e)) because the labels will not be accessible to view. 
24. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(e) requires that the model number and serial number be 
accessible to view. Since the installation of equipment is frequently performed by personnel 
other than the manufacturer, how can a manufacturer assure visibility after installation? 
ANSWER: A manufacturer must provide instructions to the assembler so that the products 
will comply with applicable provisions of the Specific Performance Standards, including 
the requirement that the model number and serial number be accessible to view, when 
assembled, installed, adjusted, and tested as directed (21 CFR 1020.30(g)).  
(3) 
Certification Labels 
21 CFR 1010.2(a) requires every manufacturer of an electronic product for which an applicable 
standard is in effect to furnish to the dealer or distributor, at the time of delivery, the certification 
that such product conforms to all applicable Performance Standards, unless FDA has approved 
an alternate means to provide certification (21 CFR 1010.2(d)). Such certification must be in the 
form of a label or tag permanently affixed to or inscribed on such product so as to be legible and 
readily accessible to view when the product is fully assembled for use (21 CFR 1010.2(b)). Each 
certifiable component of a diagnostic x-ray system must have its own certification label unless 
the system falls under the provisions for single labeling (21 CFR 1020.30(e)). Single labeling 
questions and answers are provided in section V.B.(i), “General Labeling.” 
25. QUESTION: Is there specific wording required to meet the certification labeling requirement 
in 21 CFR 1010.2(a)? 
ANSWER: No. The regulation concerning certification (21 CFR 1010.2(a)) does not 
specify the wording of the certification label; it states that “Every manufacturer of an 
electronic product for which an applicable standard is in effect under this subchapter shall 
furnish to the dealer or distributor, at the time of delivery of such product, the certification 
that such product conforms to all applicable standards under this subchapter.” 
Two examples of acceptable wording are: 
• “Complies with DHHS radiation performance standards, 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter 
J.” 
• “Product complies with applicable DHHS standards under Subchapter C - Electronic 
Product Radiation Control of Chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.”

26. QUESTION: May a manufacturer use the words “at the time of manufacture” in the 
certification label to indicate that the certification statement applies to the regulations in effect 
at the time of manufacture? 
ANSWER: Yes, if the phrase is qualified appropriately. Some manufacturers use the term 
“at the time of manufacture” in their certification statement because the regulations are 
amended from time to time. However, the addition of this phrase can cause confusion as to 
what information is being conveyed. 
If the phrase “at the time of manufacture” is placed on the certification label, then the 
words “in effect” should be included with the phrase to clearly indicate that the 
certification statement means that the component complies with the regulations in effect at 
the time of manufacture. Two examples of acceptable wording are: 
• “Complies with applicable DHHS radiation performance standards, 21 CFR Chapter I, 
Subchapter J, in effect at time of manufacture.” 
• “Product complies with applicable DHHS standards in effect at time of manufacture 
under Subchapter C - Electronic Product Radiation Control of Chapter V of the Federal 
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.” 
27. QUESTION: Since shipping containers of diagnostic x-ray components being imported into 
the U.S. are typically not opened at the time of customs inspection, is any certification 
labeling required on the outside of the shipping container? 
ANSWER: No. However, the importer must file a declaration (Form FDA 2877) upon 
entry of the product into the U.S. (19 CFR 12.91(b)). 
(4) 
Identification Labels 
28. QUESTION: How should the manufacturer be identified on diagnostic x-ray component 
identification labels? 
ANSWER: 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) requires that the full name and address (in English) of the 
certifying manufacturer be stated on each certifiable component, in the form of a label or 
tag permanently affixed to or inscribed on the product. Under the EPRC provisions of the 
FD&C Act, the certifying firm (whether manufacturer, importer, or assembler) is the 
responsible manufacturer for compliance of the certified component. 
If the product is sold under a name other than that of the certifying manufacturer, the full 
name and address of the individual or company selling the product may be placed on the 
label as long as prior to introduction of the product into commerce, the Director, Center for 
Devices and Radiological Health, has been provided sufficient information to identify the

manufacturer of the product (21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1)). This label must also contain the place 
and month and year of manufacture of the component (21 CFR 1010.3(a)(2)). Where a 
medical device is not manufactured by the person whose name appears on the label 
required under 21 CFR Part 801, the name shall be qualified by a phrase that reveals the 
connection such person has with such device, such as, “Manufactured for ___”, or 
“Distributed by ___” or other wording that expresses the facts (21 CFR 801.1(c)). 
29. QUESTION: Under 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(2)(ii), the format for the date of manufacture is 
“Manufactured: (Insert Month and Year of Manufacture).” May a manufacturer use other 
formats instead, such as 12/2/2009, 2-Dec-09, or 2009-12-02? May a manufacturer use “Date 
of Manufacture:” instead of “Manufactured:”? 
ANSWER: 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(2)(ii) requires that the month and year of manufacture be 
provided clearly and legibly, without abbreviation, and with the year shown as a four-digit 
number as follows: “Manufactured: (Insert Month and Year of Manufacture.)” (21 CFR 
1010.3(a)(2)(ii)).  
Federal regulations provide that, alternatively, a manufacturer may utilize a manufacturing 
symbol and date format that conforms with an applicable FDA recognized consensus 
standard. (See also question 18). 
30. QUESTION: What is the “place of manufacture” as used in 21 CFR 1010.3? 
ANSWER: The place of manufacture is the location where the certifiable component or 
system is produced. This should include, at a minimum, the country and city. A code may 
be used to identify the place of manufacture if the Director, Center for Devices and 
Radiological Health, has previously been provided the key to such code (see 21 CFR 
1010.3(a)(2)(i)). 
31. QUESTION: A firm manufactures certifiable x-ray components and systems at several 
locations. The firm would like to include its corporate office name and address on the 
identification label. Is the firm required to also identify the place of manufacture? May it use a 
code on the label to identify the place of manufacture? 
ANSWER: Yes, to both questions. The firm is required to identify the place of manufacture 
(21 CFR 1010.3(a)(2)). A code may be used to identify the place of manufacture if the 
Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, has previously been provided the 
key to such code (21 CFR 1010.3(a)(2)(i)). (See also questions 28 and 30). 
32. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) and (2) require that manufacturers include their full name, 
address, and place of manufacture on their electronic product identification tags or labels. 
May a manufacturer place its Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on its electronic product 
labels instead?

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
ANSWER: No. The Performance Standards do not permit manufacturers to place the URL 
information on a label instead of the required information. The product label must include 
the information required in the regulations (see 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) and (2)). 
However, as discussed in FDA’s guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff ­
Addition of URLs to Electronic Product Labeling,”12 FDA recommends, when feasible, 
that manufacturers add their URL to their electronic product tag or label, in addition to the 
identification information required under 21 CFR 1010.3(a)(1) and (2). 
33. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(e) requires manufacturers of diagnostic x-ray components that 
are subject to the Performance Standards to permanently inscribe or affix to each component 
the model number and serial number (identification labels) of the component. How does the 
FDA interpret this requirement? 
ANSWER: 21 CFR 1020.30(e) specifies that a model number and serial number shall be 
inscribed or affixed to a component, and that the word “model” or “type” shall appear as 
part of the manufacturer’s required identification of certified x-ray components. A model 
designation should describe only one certified component, and it should not be used to 
describe an assemblage of components except as specified in 21 CFR 1020.30(e) or as 
specifically authorized by the FDA. (See also questions 12, 13, 14, 15 16, and 18). High-
voltage generators contained within tube housings and beam-limiting devices that are 
integral parts of tube housings are excepted from the requirement of 21 CFR 1020.30(e) 
that manufacturers of components subject to the Specific Performance Standards 
permanently inscribe or affix thereon the model number and serial number of the product 
so that they are legible and accessible to view. 
34. QUESTION: Is specific wording required to meet the labeling requirement for specific 
component identification? 
ANSWER: Yes, in addition to the identification requirements of 21 CFR 1010.3, 21 CFR 
1020.30(e) describes additional identification labeling requirements for components of a 
diagnostic x-ray system by specifying the listing of model and serial numbers. The 
specified format calls for the word “model” or “type” to appear on the label. Tube housing 
assemblies require additional information on their identification label. The name of the 
manufacturer, the model number, and the serial number of the x-ray tube insert must also 
appear on the identification label (21 CFR 1020.30(e)(1)). The replacement of the x-ray 
tube insert in a previously certified tube housing assembly constitutes manufacture of a 
new tube housing assembly; this requires the manufacturer to remove, cover, or deface any

Warning Labels 
The control panel is the means used by the operator to set technique factors (21 CFR 
1020.30(b)). The prescribed warning statement must be present on the control panel, and this 
label must be legible and accessible to view and should be viewable by the operator during 
adjustment of technique factors (21 CFR 1020.30(j)) (see also questions 20, 36, and 83). The 
control panel may be physically co-located with the control (i.e., mounted directly to the cabinet) 
or separated from the control (i.e., a satellite or remote panel). The control panel may consist of a 
single operator interface or multiple operator interfaces. 
35. QUESTION: Has the wording for the warning label (21 CFR 1020.30(j)) on the control panel 
changed as a result of the June 10, 2006 amendments to the performance standard? 
ANSWER: Yes. The change adds “maintenance schedules” to the required wording of the 
warning label as prescribed in 21 CFR 1020.30(j), as follows: 
a. New controls manufactured on or after June 10, 2006: 
“Warning: This x-ray unit may be dangerous to patient and operator unless safe 
exposure factors, operating instructions and maintenance schedules are observed.” 
b. Old controls manufactured prior to June 10, 2006: 
“Warning: This x-ray unit may be dangerous to patient and operator unless safe 
exposure factors and operating instructions are observed.” 
NOTE: FDA does not intend to object to a warning that differs slightly from the standard if 
it is more forceful and restrictive in content and each aspect of the warning label (i.e., safe 
exposure factors, operating instructions, and maintenance schedules) is addressed in the 
warning. 
36. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(j) requires a warning label on the control panel. Modern 
control panels may incorporate or be wholly replaced by a computer that serves as a user 
interface for purposes of adjusting technique factors and for the initiation of x-ray exposure. 
Can a manufacturer propose to display the required warning statement on the computer 
monitor screen? 
ANSWER: Yes. 21 CFR 1020.30(j) does not specifically address computerized control of 
x-ray production. A control panel may include controls and control panels utilizing a 
computer as a user interface.

Software may incorporate certification and identification statements within the code that 
are reflective of labels affixed to the x-ray control (e.g., on the electronics cabinet or 
operator console). Software performing x-ray control functions should also incorporate a 
means to electronically display the required warning statement on each computer/terminal 
used as a control panel unless a permanent warning label is present. (See also question 20).  
C. 
Date of Manufacture (See also question 29) 
37. QUESTION: Several of the applicable Performance Standards differ based on whether the 
equipment was manufactured before June 10, 2006. How does a manufacturer determine if its 
system is required to comply with the updated Performance Standards? 
ANSWER: An x-ray system must comply with the updated Performance Standards that are 
in effect for equipment manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, when: 
1) The complete system is certified (21 CFR 1002.1, Table 1, Footnote 4) and the system’s 
date of manufacture falls on or after June 10, 2006; or 
2) All of the certified components in the system were manufactured on or after June 10, 
2006, as provided by each of their identification labels. 
If a system’s date of manufacture is before June 10, 2006, and a certified component with a 
date of manufacture on or after June 10, 2006 is used to replace an existing component in 
this system, the new component must comply with the applicable updated Performance 
Standards; however, the system is not required to comply with all of the updated 
Performance Standards as a result of installing the single new certified component. 
If a certified component with a date of manufacture before June 10, 2006 is installed into a 
certified system manufactured on or after June 10, 2006, then the system is still required to 
conform to all of the updated Performance Standards. Repair of a certified component does 
not change the date of manufacture of either the component or system used to determine 
which Performance Standards are applicable. 
Example 1: An air kerma display manufactured in 2007 could be used to replace an air 
kerma display on a fluoroscopic x-ray system manufactured in 2005. This new air kerma 
display must be certified to conform to the Performance Standards applicable on its date of 
manufacture (e.g., 21 CFR 1020.32(k)). However, the fluoroscopic x-ray system would not 
be required to conform to other updated Performance Standards applicable on or after June 
10, 2006 as a result of installing the single new certified air kerma display. 
Example 2: A fluoroscopic x-ray system was manufactured in 2007 and certified as a 
system using a certified air kerma display which was manufactured in 2005. Because the x-
ray system was certified as a system and the system’s date of manufacture is in 2007, the

system is still required to conform to all of the updated Performance Standards applicable 
on or after June 10, 2006, even though the updated Performance Standards did not apply to 
the air kerma display as of its own date of manufacture. 
For CT systems manufactured on or after September 3, 1985, the date of manufacture of 
the system is defined as the date of manufacture of the CT gantry, as provided by the 
identification labeling (21 CFR 1020.30(a)(3)). 
38. QUESTION: When an existing diagnostic x-ray system is disassembled or removed from its 
original location and reassembled at a different location, does its “date of manufacture” 
change? 
ANSWER: No. A system that is disassembled and reassembled with the same components 
retains its previous date(s) of manufacture.

entitled “Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff - Assembler’s 
Guide to Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment.”13 
D. 
Measurements 
39. QUESTION: There are many references in Radiological Health Regulations to test programs 
used to determine compliance with the Performance Standards. (See 21 CFR 1020.30(k), (l), 
(m)(3), (n), 1020.31(b)(2), (c)(3), (d)(2)(iii), (e)(4), (g)(3), (h)(2), (l), (m)(3), 1020.32(a)(2), 
(b)(1), (d)(3)). Is a manufacturer required to develop its quality control testing program to use 
these test programs exactly? 
ANSWER: The test programs described in these portions of the Performance Standards 
must generally be used in a manufacturer’s quality control testing program. If a 
manufacturer wishes to use test programs other than those set forth in the Radiological 
Health Regulations, it may submit a written application to that effect, in which case the 
Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, will decide the matter in accordance 
with 21 CFR 1010.13. However, in the absence of an alternate test procedure authorized 
under 21 CFR 1010.13, FDA does not intend to object to an alternate test procedure for 
diagnostic x-ray equipment if a manufacturer has validated its test program and the test 
program is adequate to ensure conformance of the assembled x-ray system to the relevant 
Performance Standards. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to maintain records

pertaining to its quality control testing, including the basis for selecting any alternate test 
procedures (21 CFR 1002.30(a)(2)). 
40. QUESTION: Is it permissible to round off measured test results if the measured values are 
slightly in excess of regulatory limits stated in the Performance Standards and the rounding 
would allow the values to fall within the regulatory limits? 
ANSWER: No. The regulatory limits in the Performance Standards are absolute values and 
as such, they cannot be exceeded. Rounding measured test results to obtain compliant 
values is not acceptable. For example, during testing of a fluoroscopic system, a measured 
maximum air kerma rate of 88.1 mGy per minute was obtained. Since the limit for the 
applicable requirement is 88 mGy per minute for this system, the measured value of 88.1 
mGy per minute exceeds the limit in the performance standard, and the unit is not 
compliant. Manufacturers (including assemblers) should employ action limits more 
stringent than the regulatory limits to assure that equipment meets all regulatory limits in 
the relevant Performance Standards. 
41. QUESTION: What is meant by the term “measurement criteria” as related to “technique 
factors” in 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3)(viii)? 
ANSWER: The regulations define technique factors such as peak tube potential, tube 
current, etc. (21 CFR 1020.30(b)). However, the definitions are general in nature and more 
precise information is needed to interpret the technique factors. Specifically, the criteria 
used to obtain the indicated technique factors must be given (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3)(viii)). 
For example, when measuring exposure time for three-phase equipment, one manufacturer 
may specify the measurement by defining it as the time between the beginning and end of 
the exposure cycle, while another manufacturer may define it in some other way. In some 
cases, the measurement criteria may vary among models produced by the same 
manufacturer. A statement of the measurement criteria used must be provided in the 
manufacturer’s literature to allow meaningful comparisons (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3)(viii)). 
42. QUESTION: Does the linearity requirement of 21 CFR 1020.31(c) apply to the x-ray system 
as a whole or to individual components? Some systems are composed of components that may 
have different maximum limiting specifications. If so, is the linearity requirement of the 
system in a compliance test restricted to the maximum value as specified by the 
manufacturer’s rating of the limiting component? 
ANSWER: The requirement in 21 CFR 1020.31(c) applies to the x-ray system.  Testing 
compliance for linearity of the maximum milliampere-second product selection or 
maximum current setting of the system is limited by the manufacturer’s rating of the 
limiting component.

43. QUESTION: When measuring leakage from the diagnostic source assembly, may the main 
beam be blocked at the exit end of the beam-limiting device? 
ANSWER: Yes. Note that, as defined in 21 CFR 1020.30(b), leakage radiation “means 
radiation emanating from the diagnostic source assembly except for . . . [t]he useful beam,” 
and useful beam is defined in 21 CFR 1020.30(b) as “radiation which passes through the 
tube housing port and the aperture of the beam-limiting device . . .” This means radiation 
passing through the aperture of the beam-limiting device is not leakage radiation and 
therefore is not subject to the leakage requirement. Thus, the proposal of blocking the 
aperture at the exit end of the beam-limiting device is appropriate. 
E. 
Models (See also questions 33and 34) 
44. QUESTION: A firm manufactures several slightly different versions of certain component 
models. Must each version have its own unique model number? 
ANSWER: It depends on the differences among the versions. 21 CFR 1000.3(o) defines 
model as “any identifiable, unique electronic product design, and refers to products having 
the same structural and electrical design characteristics and to which the manufacturer has 
assigned a specific designation to differentiate between it and other products produced by 
that manufacturer.” If the different versions have different structural or electrical design 
characteristics, including compatibility issues, they must have different model numbers (21 
CFR 1000.3(o), 1020.30(e)). However, if the differences are cosmetic (such as different 
paint colors), it is acceptable to use the same model number for the different versions. 
45. QUESTION: Under 21 CFR 1020.30(e), each certifiable component must have a model and 
serial number. May manufacturers use any alphanumeric format in standard English 
characters for these numbers (e.g., “BLK012,” “100245,” or “ALMM”)? 
ANSWER: Any alphanumeric format is acceptable for model and serial numbers as long as 
the model number and the serial number are unique to that component, or approved single-
labeled system or single-labeled subsystem as authorized by FDA.

systems, do the purchasers then become “assemblers,” as defined in the regulations? Must 
they file Form FDA 2579? 
ANSWER: In this situation, the purchasers or their employees become assemblers. 21 CFR 
1020.30(b) defines an assembler as “any person engaged in the business of assembling, 
replacing, or installing one or more components into a diagnostic x-ray system or 
subsystem. The term includes the owner of an x-ray system or his or her employee or agent 
who assembles components into an x-ray system that is subsequently used to provide 
professional or commercial services.” Therefore, anyone who installs certified components 
or systems meets the definition of an assembler (21 CFR 1020.30(b)). Unless they meet 
one of the exceptions to the reporting requirements provided under 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2), 
the assembler must submit a report of assembly (Form FDA 2579, see 21 CFR 
1020.30(d)(1)) to the purchaser, and, where applicable, to the State agency responsible for 
radiation protection. The form does not need to be submitted to FDA. The requirements of 
21 CFR Part 1002—Records and Reports are not applicable to assemblers of diagnostic x-
ray equipment subject to the provisions of 21 CFR 1020.30(d), provided the assembler has 
submitted the required report of assembly and retains a copy of such report for a period of 
5 years from its date (21 CFR 1002.1(c)(4)).15 For additional details and exceptions on 
when to file Form FDA 2579, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Guidance for Industry and 
Food and Drug Administration Staff - Assembler’s Guide to Diagnostic X-Ray 
Equipment.”16 
47. QUESTION: Must a Form FDA 2579 be filed when an assembler installs used certified 
equipment that has been donated? 
ANSWER: Yes. The regulations make no distinction regarding the method of acquisition 
of the equipment. When an assembler installs certified equipment for use on humans, they 
are required to file Form FDA 2579 (21 CFR 1020.30(d)(1)), regardless of how the 
equipment is acquired. 
48. QUESTION: What date should be used as the “date of installation” on Form FDA 2579 
(Report of Assembly of a Diagnostic X-ray System)? 
ANSWER: The date of installation of a diagnostic x-ray system or component is 
considered to be the date the x-ray system or component is released by the assembler to the 
facility or user for use on humans. Assemblers have fifteen (15) days following completion 
of assembly to complete and distribute Form FDA 2579 before they are considered to be in 
violation of 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(1). Form FDA 2579 should properly indicate the actual

49. QUESTION: What are the manufacturer’s and assembler’s responsibilities relative to final 
testing of a newly-assembled x-ray system or component before it is released to the user? 
ANSWER: Manufacturer’s Responsibilities: Manufacturers certify that each of their 
products meet all applicable requirements when installed according to their instructions for 
assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing. Descriptions of any testing that must be 
performed after installation in order to ensure compliance with the applicable Performance 
Standards should be included in these instructions. This information shall be provided to 
assemblers (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). The instructions for testing of components must be 
adequate to assure that the products will comply with the applicable Performance Standards 
when assembled, installed, adjusted, and tested as directed. 
Step-by-step instructions and a thorough explanation of the required test equipment should 
be provided. The instructions should include a requirement to record those key data that 
will permit demonstration that all specified tests were performed and that the equipment 
was installed and tested in compliance with the assembly instructions. Manufacturers who 
rely on the results from tests performed during assembly to support their certification but 
do not include final compliance testing in their assembler instructions may have their 
quality control and testing programs disapproved (21 CFR 1010.2(c)). 
Assembler’s Responsibilities: Assemblers of diagnostic x-ray equipment must perform all 
testing specified in the assembly instructions provided by the component or system 
manufacturer(s) at the time of installation (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). Assemblers who file a 
report of assembly (pursuant to 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(1)), but fail to perform, and document 
the results of, final compliance tests as required by the manufacturer(s) may be considered 
by the FDA to have issued a false and misleading certification and may be subject to 
regulatory action by the FDA. Assemblers shall not be liable for noncompliance of a 
certified component if the assembly of that component was performed according to the 
component manufacturer’s instruction (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). 
50. QUESTION: An assembler determines that the available rated line voltage and/or range of 
line voltage regulation is not within the manufacturer’s specified requirements. May this 
installation be completed? 
ANSWER: No. The installation described here is not permitted. The manufacturer must 
provide assembly instructions adequate to assure compliance of its components with the 
applicable Performance Standards (21 CFR 1020.30(c) and (g)), which must include a 
statement of the rated line voltage and the range of line-voltage regulation for operation at 
maximum line current (21 CFR 1020.30(g)(1)), and the assembler shall assemble, install, 
adjust, and test the certified components according to the instructions of the manufacturer

51. QUESTION: A firm manufactured and sold a fluoroscopic C-arm system that was fully 
compliant with the Performance Standards if installed and assembled according to its 
instructions. However, this particular system was incorrectly installed and assembled, and is 
noncompliant with the Performance Standards. Is the manufacturer responsible for correcting 
the noncompliant system? 
ANSWER: No. Manufacturers are not responsible for noncompliance of their products if 
that noncompliance is due solely to the improper installation or assembly of that product by 
another person (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). However, manufacturers are responsible for 
providing assembly instructions adequate to assure compliance of their components with 
the applicable provisions of the Performance Standards (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). 
52. QUESTION: A firm manufactured, sold, and installed a fluoroscopic C-arm system that was 
fully compliant with the Performance Standards when it was assembled. However, the 
owner’s service engineer adjusted the tube output to increase the air kerma rate. The 
maximum air kerma rate after the adjustment was found to be 120 mGy per minute and, as a 
result, the system fails to comply with 21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(ii). The facility’s medical 
physicist notified the assembler that the system needs to be adjusted to comply with the 
Performance Standards. Is the assembler or manufacturer responsible for adjusting the system 
at no cost to the user? 
ANSWER: No. If the owner’s service engineer did not adjust the system by following the 
assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing instructions, the manufacturer is not 
responsible for the failure to comply. (See also question 51). However, if the owner’s 
service engineer adjusted the system by following the assembly, installation, adjustment, 
and testing instructions, and the resulting air kerma rate did not meet the requirement 
provided in 21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(ii), the manufacturer is responsible for the failure to 
comply and must act according to 21 CFR 1003.10, including notification to the Secretary 
(21 CFR 1003.20), notification to affected persons (21 CFR 1003.21), and unless exempted 
from notification requirements (21 CFR Part 1003, Subpart D), repurchase, repair, or 
replace the system at no cost to the user (21 CFR Part 1004). 
53. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.31(b)(2), “Measuring Compliance,” appears to limit an assembler 
to install systems where only plus or minus 1 percent (1%) line-voltage regulation is 
available. Is this correct? 
ANSWER: 21 CFR 1020.31(b) provides certain requirements that apply when the 
equipment is operated on an adequate power supply as specified by the manufacturer in 
accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3). The plus or minus 1 percent 
(1%) line-voltage regulation in 21 CFR 1020.31(b)(2) means that if the line voltage

regulation (expressed as a percent) for one measurement departs from the mean value of 
line voltage regulation for any of the 10 measurements (expressed as a percent) by more 
than 1 percent, the test result does not demonstrate compliance. However, because the 
available line voltage regulation may vary in real world hospital installations settings (e.g., 
plus or minus 2 percent), FDA does not intend to object if a manufacturer establishes 
alternative specifications for adequate line voltage regulation that must be provided for the 
assembled system. The manufacturer must provide a statement of the rated line voltage and 
the range of line-voltage regulation for operation at maximum line current to assemblers 
(21 CFR 1020.30(g)(1)). Further, 21 CFR 1020.31(b)(1) provides that, for any specific 
combination of selected technique factors, the estimated coefficient of variation of the air 
kerma shall be no greater than 0.05. FDA does not intend to object if a manufacturer uses 
alternate test procedures in their test program to measure compliance to 21 CFR 
1020.31(b)(1) under their modified line-voltage regulation specifications, provided that 
they have been validated as adequate to ensure conformance when a line-voltage regulation 
of plus or minus 1 percent is used. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to maintain 
records pertaining to its quality control testing, including the basis for selecting any 
alternate test procedures (21 CFR 1002.30(a)(2)). (See also question 39). 
(1) 
Assembly Instructions (See also questions 49, 50, and 51) 
Manufacturers of components identified in 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1) are required to provide 
assemblers with adequate instructions for assembly, installation, adjustment and testing of those 
components (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). While manufacturers are generally not required to disclose 
trade secrets or confidential information, the instructions must be adequate to assure that the 
products will comply with the applicable provisions of the Performance Standards when 
assembled, installed, adjusted, and tested as directed (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). Manufacturers of 
diagnostic x-ray systems and components must provide these instructions to assemblers and, 
upon request, to other interested parties at a cost not to exceed the cost of publication and 
distribution (21 CFR 1020.30(g)).  
In addition, manufacturers of x-ray equipment, including components, are required to provide to 
purchasers, and upon request, to others, manuals or instruction sheets with the information 
required under 21 CFR 1020.30(h).

54. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(g) requires manufacturers to provide adequate instructions to 
complete a compliant installation of their component(s) into a diagnostic x-ray system. 
However, assembly of a manufacturer’s system may require the use of unique software 
programs to assure a compliant assembly. Must the manufacturer provide access to these 
software programs as part of the information to be provided to assemblers? 
ANSWER: Yes. If assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing of the certified 
components requires the use of unique software programs, then access to those software 
programs must be provided to assemblers and, upon request, to others at a cost not to 
exceed the cost of publication and distribution (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). If adequate 
instructions to complete a compliant installation can only be conveyed by other modes 
(e.g., instructional videos or in-person training), then those forms of instructions must 
similarly be provided at a cost not to exceed the cost of publication and distribution. 
Some manufacturers bundle the unique software programs covered by 21 CFR 1020.30(g) 
with other types of proprietary software; in some instances, the proprietary software cannot 
be deleted from the bundled information. Nothing in 21 CFR 1020.30 prohibits bundling 
software information or programs; however, the practice does not relieve manufacturers of 
their responsibilities under the performance standard to provide the necessary 
documentation or software at a cost not to exceed the cost of publication and distribution. 
55. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(g) requires manufacturers to provide adequate instructions to 
complete a compliant installation of their component(s) into diagnostic x-ray systems. It is 
understood that if software is required to assure a compliant assembly, the manufacturer is 
required to provide the software. However, does 21 CFR 1020.30(g) apply to ancillary 
software developed by the manufacturer that may be helpful but is not required for such an 
installation? 
ANSWER: No. Some manufacturers have developed proprietary software beyond that 
required by 21 CFR 1020.30(g) for use as an aid during the assembly process. They are not 
required to provide such additional ancillary software.  
Additional information is available in FDA’s guidance entitled “Information Disclosure by 
Manufacturers to Assemblers for Diagnostic X-ray Systems – Guidance for Industry and 
FDA Staff.”18

instructions to complete the installation? In these situations, what are manufacturer’s 
responsibilities? May assemblers or others obtain access to the software through other means? 
ANSWER: Assemblers or others who believe they are not being provided access to 
software programs that are necessary to comply with the performance standard governing 
assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing or believe that they do not have adequate 
assembly, installation, adjustment, and testing instructions to comply with applicable 
regulations when assembled, installed, adjusted, and tested as directed should inform the 
manufacturer and request clarification or access to the software. When evaluating this 
information, FDA expects manufacturers to assess whether existing assembly, installation, 
adjustment, and testing instructions meet the performance standard. Manufacturers must 
take any corrective actions or submit any regulatory notifications that are required, such as 
notifying FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 1003.20 (see 21 CFR 1003.10(a)) regarding the 
manufacturer’s noncompliance with a performance standard governing information to be 
provided to assemblers (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). 
Additionally, the assembler may advise FDA about the concern in writing through the 
CDRH Device Allegation process by submitting an allegation using the “Allegations of 
Regulatory Misconduct” Form19 by email at CDRHDeviceAllegations@fda.hhs.gov, or by 
regular mail.20 Should FDA determine that the manufacturer’s assembly, installation, 
adjustment, and testing instructions are insufficient, then FDA has authority to review and 
take suitable action. 
All other persons who believe a manufacturer’s assembly, installation, adjustment, and 
testing instructions are confusing, unclear, inadequate, or incorrect should inform the 
manufacturer of the concern. 
57. QUESTION: Are manufacturers required by the Performance Standards to provide 
maintenance and repair instructions to users or others? 
ANSWER: No. The Performance Standards only require manufacturers to provide a 
schedule of maintenance (if any) necessary to maintain compliance with Performance 
Standards (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)(ii)). For more direction regarding information disclosure 
by manufacturers to assemblers, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Information Disclosure by

58. QUESTION: How does the FDA interpret the phrase “cost not to exceed the cost of 
publication and distribution,” as used in 21 CFR 1020.30(g)? 
ANSWER: Manufacturers may charge for the cost of producing and distributing each 
additional package or copy of instructions. The charge can incorporate expenses such as the 
cost of paper, labor, use of a copying machine, shipping cost, or other costs associated with 
each package or copy the manufacturer provides under the performance standard. For 
software, recoverable charges equivalent to printed materials would include such expenses 
as the cost of the labor (e.g., technical and clerical) of producing such additional package or 
copy, computer disks, and packaging materials used to produce each additional package or 
copy of software.  
59. QUESTION: Some manufacturers include the assembly of their x-ray equipment as part of 
the initial purchase. Are such manufacturers required to provide assembly instructions to 
anyone who requests a copy? 
ANSWER: Yes. Assembly instructions must be provided to assemblers and, upon request, 
to others at a cost not to exceed the cost of publication and distribution (21 CFR 
1020.30(g)). Even though the manufacturer may perform the initial assembly, the system 
could subsequently be moved or sold and might need to be dismantled and then re­
assembled by an assembler. 
60. QUESTION: If two certified components depend on their compatibility to ensure compliance 
with applicable Performance Standards (e.g., a high-voltage generator and a tube housing 
assembly), but are made by different manufacturers, must both manufacturers state 
compatibility between the two components? 
ANSWER: In the information to be provided to assemblers (21 CFR 1020.30(g)), a 
certified component manufacturer must include “specifications of other components 
compatible with that to be installed when compliance of the system or subsystem depends 
on their compatibility.” Any manufacturer that states compatibility is responsible for 
ensuring that the integration of their component with the compatible component does not 
interfere with the compliance of the compatible component or the assembled x-ray system, 
and must in its instructions provide the specifications of other compatible components.

Accidental Radiation Occurrence 
61. QUESTION: Does the requirement in 21 CFR 1002.20 concerning the reporting of 
“accidental radiation occurrences” apply to foreign manufacturers of products sold in the 
U.S.? 
ANSWER: Yes. Foreign manufacturers of products sold in the U.S. are subject to, among 
other requirements, the reporting requirements provided in 21 CFR 1002.20. 
62. QUESTION: If an x-ray system initiated an exposure but encountered a fault and did not 
collect an adequate image for review and a new exposure (rescan or restart) was initiated by 
the operator to obtain an adequate image, should this be reported as an accidental radiation 
occurrence (ARO)? 
ANSWER: FDA does not consider an additional exposure commanded by the operator 
(rescan or restart) to be an ARO reportable event (though, depending on the reason for the 
additional exposure, such system might have a defect which relates to the safety of use by 
reason of the emission of electronic product radiation under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)). FDA does 
consider the following events to be reportable as AROs: 
• Events where radiation emission was generated without a valid command from the 
operator. 
• Events where radiation emission was produced that was not at the technique factors 
prescribed. 
• Events where radiation emission does not stop when commanded. 
63. QUESTION: Is there a lower threshold of radiation emission or received dose below which an 
accidental radiation exposure is not reportable as an ARO? 
ANSWER: Any dose of x-ray radiation is considered injurious or potentially injurious. 
Leakage radiation from x-ray components, such as the diagnostic source assembly, is 
known to occur. If the level does not exceed those prescribed in 21 CFR 1020.30(k) 
(leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly) and 1020.30(l) (radiation from 
components other than the diagnostic source assembly), it is not reportable as an ARO. But 
any other exposure as a result of the manufacturing, testing, or use of an x-ray system that 
was accidental should be reported as an ARO.  (See also question 62). In addition, if an 
event occurs where the leakage radiation exceeds the limits of 21 CFR 1020.30(k) and 
1020.30(l), then those events must be reported as AROs and the x-ray system may have a 
defect (see also section I below).

Records 
64. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1002.30(a)(1) and (2) require maintaining records relating to quality 
control procedures and test results. How do these requirements apply to foreign 
manufacturers, and where does FDA expect the records to be maintained? 
ANSWER: Because all manufacturers are required to have quality control procedures and 
testing programs (21 CFR 1010.2(c)), they are responsible for generating and maintaining 
records of the results of these programs. Records must be maintained in a manner that 
makes them available within a reasonable timeframe during an FDA inspection of the 
manufacturing facility.

Defects (See also questions 51 and 52) 
65. QUESTION: Does a failure which prevents a diagnostic x-ray system from producing x-rays 
meet the definition of a “defect” under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)? 
ANSWER: Under 21 CFR 1003.2(b), an electronic product is considered to have a defect 
which relates to the safety of use by reason of the emission of electronic product radiation 
if it is a product which utilizes electronic product radiation to accomplish its primary 
purpose and from which such emissions are intended, and as a result of its design, 
production or assembly it fails to accomplish the intended purpose (21 CFR 1003.2(b)(3)) 
or fails to conform to its design specifications relating to the emission of electronic product 
radiation, including through the production of x-rays not in conformance with design 
specifications (21 CFR 1003.2(b)(1)). If, as a result of the design, production, or assembly 
of the x-ray system, the system emits x-rays not in conformance with its design 
specifications or starts and then prematurely stops emitting x-rays during a procedure, then 
the failure will be considered a defect in an electronic product by FDA under 21 CFR 
1003.2(b). 
For example, if, as a result of the system’s design, production, or assembly, the x-ray tube 
in an x-ray system fails mid-exam, the amount of radiation emitted will result in an image 
of inadequate quality, necessitating a retake of the image and, cumulatively, resulting in 
excess radiation exposure to the patient. This x-ray system has a defect relating to safety of 
use by reason of the emission of electronic product radiation. 
Additionally, if, as a result of the system’s design, production, or assembly, the x-ray tube 
in a fluoroscopic imaging device fails during an interventional surgical procedure, the loss 
of imaging during the procedure is a serious safety issue; the procedure would need to be 
halted or performed without the guidance of imaging, or the patient would need to be 
transferred mid-procedure so that imaging can be resumed. This fluoroscopic imaging 
device also has a defect relating to safety of use by reason of the emission of electronic 
product radiation.

66. QUESTION: Should a manufacturer give notification of the failure of a mechanism that is not 
responsible for the emission of electronic product radiation (e.g., broken wheel or drive 
mechanism failure on a mobile x-ray system) as a “defect” under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)? 
ANSWER: FDA does not intend to enforce the notification requirements arising under 21 
CFR Part 1003, subpart B, with respect to defects arising from mechanisms that are not 
responsible for the emission of electronic product radiation at this time. Here, the broken 
wheel or drive mechanism failure may be the result of the design, production, or assembly 
of the system, but these mechanisms are not responsible for the emission of electronic 
product radiation. 
67. QUESTION: Does a burned-out x-ray tube that does not produce an x-ray as intended meet 
the definition of a “defect” under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)? 
ANSWER: A defect might arise under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)(3) if the product fails to 
accomplish the intended purpose “as a result of its design, production or assembly.” 
Because x-ray tubes have an expected lifetime that is influenced by the age and use of the 
tube, the failure of an x-ray tube due to age and use will generally not be considered a 
defect under 21 CFR 1003.2(b)(3), but rather a normal and expected failure of the x-ray 
tube. However, an x-ray tube that stops producing an x-ray (e.g., burns out prematurely) as 
a result of the design, production, or assembly of the tube housing assembly or other 
components in the system might be considered to have a defect under 21 CFR 
1003.2(b)(3), if it fails mid-exam, for example. A burned-out x-ray tube that emits 
radiation but, as a result of its design, production or assembly, fails to emit x-rays in 
conformance with its design specifications would be considered to have a defect under 21 
CFR 1003.2(b)(1) due to a failure to conform to its design specifications relating to the 
emission of electronic product radiation. (See also questions 65 and 69). 
68. QUESTION: Are image artifacts such as blurring from patient motion, beam hardening 
resulting from dense objects in the x-ray field, or CT reconstruction artifacts, considered 
defects? 
ANSWER: No. Artifacts such as those caused by patient motion, beam hardening resulting 
from dense objects in the x-ray field, and CT reconstruction, are not considered defects. 
However, an artifact caused by a failure related to the emission of radiation, such as 
blurring caused by unexpected device movement during an exposure, which is the result of 
the product’s design, production, or assembly, would indicate the presence of a defect. 
69. QUESTION: Is a tube with an excessively large focal spot a “defect” under 21 CFR 1003.2 
(i.e., the tube fails to meet the manufacturer’s specifications for focal spot size)? 
ANSWER: If a tube is sold with a focal-spot size that exceeds its specifications, then there 
is a defect because the product fails to conform to its design specifications relating to the

emission of electronic product radiation (21 CFR 1003.2(b)(1)). If the tube met 
specifications when it was sold, but no longer meets the specifications due to age or 
misuse, that failure to meet specifications may or may not be considered a defect. Relevant 
information may include whether the nonconformance with the specifications results from 
its design, production, or assembly, whether the nonconformance results from normal wear, 
and whether the nonconformance results from misuse of the equipment. A certain amount 
of normal wear will occur in electronic products. If such normal wear results in radiation 
emitted by the product exceeding the limit prescribed in an applicable standard, the 
manufacturer may be charged with noncompliance because of their failure to design the 
product to maintain an acceptable level of radiation leakage over its useful life. See FDA’s 
Compliance Policy Guide (CPG) 390.200 Determination by Secretary that Product Fails to 
Comply or has Defect – 21 CFR 1003.11.22 
70. QUESTION: A manufacturer has found that some diagnostic x-ray systems that it shipped are 
noncompliant with the beam quality requirements under 21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1) because the 
manufacturer failed to install an aluminum filter plate in these systems. The manufacturer 
knows that other systems tested at its manufacturing facility passed this requirement with the 
filter plate installed, and therefore installing a filter plate will correct the noncompliant 
systems. Can the manufacturer start correcting the noncompliant installed systems concurrent 
with notification to FDA? 
ANSWER: Yes. Upon discovery of a defect or failure to comply with an applicable 
performance standard, a manufacturer shall immediately notify the FDA in accordance 
with 21 CFR 1003.20 (see 21 CFR 1003.10(a)). Implementation of a corrective action plan 
may begin prior to the plan’s approval by FDA. However, if the plan fails to correct the 
noncompliance or defect, or if FDA otherwise does not approve the corrective action plan, 
the manufacturer may be required to perform additional actions (21 CFR 1004.2 and 
1004.6). To avoid this situation, a manufacturer should contact FDA regarding its 
corrective action plan prior to the plan’s implementation. 
71. QUESTION: What procedure does FDA follow upon discovering that a diagnostic x-ray 
system or component fails to comply with the regulations or has a defect? 
ANSWER: If FDA, through testing, inspection, research, or examination of reports or other 
data, determines that a diagnostic x-ray system or component does not comply with an 
applicable Federal standard issued pursuant to the Act or has a defect, it immediately 
notifies the manufacturer of the product in writing specifying:

72. QUESTION: On June 10, 2006, several new requirements became effective for fluoroscopic 
x-ray systems manufactured on or after that date. If new components manufactured on or after 
June 10, 2006 are added to a fluoroscopic system manufactured before June 10, 2006, are the 
new requirements applicable to the system? 
ANSWER: No, the new requirements that became effective for fluoroscopic x-ray systems 
manufactured on or after June 10, 2006 are only applicable if: 
a. The complete system is certified and the system’s date of manufacture falls on or after 
June 10, 2006; or 
b. All of the certified components in the system were manufactured on or after June 10, 
2006, as provided by each of their identification labels. 
For additional information on these requirements, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Policy 
Clarification for Certain Fluoroscopic Equipment Requirements.”23

fluoroscopy (i.e., a live image; 21 CFR 1020.32(j)(3)). How does FDA interpret the 
requirement to “clearly indicate” which image is being displayed? 
ANSWER: Any readily recognizable and distinguishable wording, icon, or image that is 
prominently displayed on the images or at the location where the “image hold” and “live 
image” information is displayed, in conjunction with clear explanations and descriptions in 
the information to be provided to users (21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)(i)) (e.g., manuals or 
instructions) will satisfy the requirement under 21 CFR 1020.32(j)(3). 
74. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.32(k) specifies that fluoroscopic equipment manufactured on or 
after June 10, 2006 must display at the fluoroscopist’s working position both the air kerma 
rate (AKR) and the cumulative air kerma. Would the display of the dose area product (DAP) 
(also called kerma-area product) and the cumulative DAP satisfy these requirements? 
ANSWER: No. Display of the DAP and cumulative DAP provide significantly different 
information relating to the x-ray field than the AKR and the cumulative air kerma, and thus 
do not satisfy 21 CFR 1020.32(k). 
75. QUESTION: If a fluoroscopic system uses an under-table tube, and is also capable of spot-
film exposures, is the tube considered a radiographic tube when used for spot-film exposures? 
If it is considered a radiographic tube, where should the indicator be placed to show that it 
was selected for an exposure, as required by 21 CFR 1020.31(k)? 
ANSWER: The under-table tube is considered a radiographic tube when used for spot-film 
exposures, but a separate indicator is not required. 21 CFR 1020.31(k) applies to the 
situation where two or more tubes are controlled by the same exposure switch. Even 
though the tube is typically controlled by a separate exposure switch when used for 
radiography, it is not a separate tube. Therefore, the separate indication required by 21 CFR 
1020.31(k) does not apply to the scenario here. 
76. QUESTION: A fluoroscopic x-ray system was manufactured after May 19, 1995, and the 
system limits the air kerma rate (AKR) to 88 mGy per minute (10 R per minute) by limiting 
the maximum peak tube potential. However, the fluoroscopic AKR could exceed the 88 mGy 
per minute limit momentarily (less than two seconds) if the operator changes to a higher mA 
setting while x-rays are being produced. This occurs during the time that the peak tube 
potential is driven down to a value sufficient to limit the AKR to 88 mGy per minute. The 
alternative would be to terminate production of x-rays during this time, but that could lead to 
a loss of important diagnostic information. The audible signal for high-level control (HLC) 
mode is set so that anytime the AKR exceeds 88 mGy per minute, the signal is activated. Is 
such a system acceptable? 
ANSWER: No. For fluoroscopic equipment manufactured on or after May 19, 1995, AKRs 
greater than 88 mGy per minute are allowed only during activation of HLC or during

recording of fluoroscopic images (21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(iii)). A special means of HLC 
activation is required (21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(iii)(C)). When HLC is activated, the audible 
signal must also be activated, regardless of the actual AKR (21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(iii)(C)). 
77. QUESTION: A manufacturer is planning to provide a HLC mode switch for fluoroscopy that 
does not require continuous pressure for activation. The manufacturer believes this would be 
safer because it would avoid accidental use of HLC by operators, free the operator from using 
a hand or foot consciously and allow them to concentrate on the clinical procedure, and would 
still provide a visual and audible warning immediately if the previous operator had left the 
unit in HLC mode. Is this acceptable? 
ANSWER: No. HLC mode shall be operable only when continuous manual activation of 
the fluoroscopic HLC switch is provided by the operator (21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(iii)(C)). A 
switch that activates the HLC mode without continuous pressure could activate HLC mode 
indefinitely and does not provide the positive means required in the Performance Standards 
(21 CFR 1020.32(d)(2)(iii)(C)). 
78. QUESTION: In certain fluoroscopy systems, the peak tube current is not user selectable. It 
remains constant and the average current changes automatically by varying pulse width and 
frequency (frame rate). In these systems, where peak tube current is held constant, will a label 
that provides the specified tube current meet the requirement of 21 CFR 1020.32(f)? 
ANSWER: No. 21 CFR 1020.32(f) requires continuous indication of both x-ray tube 
potential and tube current during any fluoroscopic exposure. A label is not an acceptable 
substitute for a continuous indication and is noncompliant with 21 CFR 1020.32(f). 
79. QUESTION: The June 10, 2006 regulatory changes in the fluoroscopic regulations included a 
change under 21 CFR 1020.32(h)(2). A preset timer having a maximum cumulative time of 5 
minutes is no longer required. Since this timer is not required for new equipment, may a 
manufacturer remove or disable the 5 minute preset feature from older equipment when 
customers request this modification? 
ANSWER: Yes, as long as the fluoroscopic system is modified appropriately. The 
regulatory changes that became effective on June 10, 2006 removed the requirement for the 
5 minute preset timer limit, but replaced it with new requirements for several additional 
features, as specified in 21 CFR 1020.32(h)(2). Under 21 CFR 1020.30(q)(2), the owner of 
a diagnostic x-ray system may modify the system as long as the modification does not 
create a failure to comply with any requirements in effect at the time the affected system or 
component was manufactured. (See also question 4). Simply removing or disabling the 
timer would create such a problem. However, under 21 CFR 1020.32(h)(1)(i) this 
modification is permitted if the system is also modified to meet the requirements of 21 
CFR 1020.32(h)(2), and if a label stating “Modified to comply with 21 CFR 1020.32(h)(2)” 
is affixed to the control.

Beam Limiting Devices (see also questions 13, 16, 19, 22, 
and 100) 
80. QUESTION: To produce a radiograph in a particular panoramic dental system, the diagnostic 
source assembly and film cassette rotate about the patient’s head at a fixed Source-Image 
Receptor Distance (SID) while the film is advanced through the film holder. A narrow slit in 
the film cassette holder allows the useful x-ray beam to pass through while blocking scatter 
radiation from the exposed and unexposed sections of the film. This produces a laminographic 
view of the patient’s jaw and teeth. Is such a design consistent with the requirements of 21 
CFR 1020.31? 
ANSWER: Yes. However, for the panoramic unit described in the question, the image 
receptor size is equal to that portion of the film instantaneously exposed through the slot in 
the cassette holder, rather than the entire image receptor. This means that for dental 
panoramic type units designed with a fixed SID and one image receptor size, the 
dimensions of the portion of the x-ray beam whose intensity is equal to or greater than 25 
percent of the maximum intensity of the x-ray field (21 CFR 1020.30(b)) at the front plane 
of the cassette holder must be limited to the dimensions of the film instantaneously exposed 
through the slot in the cassette holder (21 CFR 1020.31(f)(2)) and the center of the x-ray 
field must be aligned with the center of the slot in the cassette holder within 2 percent of 
the SID. Alternatively, means may be provided to both size and align an x-ray field such 
that the x-ray field at the front plane of the cassette holder does not extend beyond any 
edge of the slot in the cassette holder. 
For dental panoramic type units in which the SID is variable, the x-ray beam dimensions 
where the intensity is equal to or greater than 25 percent of the maximum intensity of the x-
ray field (21 CFR 1020.30(b)) at the front plane of the cassette holder shall not exceed the 
dimensions of the slot by more than 2 percent of the SID (21 CFR 1020.31(f)(4)). 
Alternatively, means may be provided to both size and align an x-ray field such that the x-
ray field at the front plane of the cassette holder does not extend beyond any edge of the 
slot in the cassette holder.

apparatuses or certified components being installed (e.g., head positioners, cassette 
holders), it may be necessary to install a complete cephalometric system. If the resulting 
cephalometric system is designed to be operated at one SID and one image receptor size, 
21 CFR 1020.31(f)(2) is applicable; otherwise, 21 CFR 1020.31(f)(4) is applicable. 
82. QUESTION: Is it permissible for a beam limiting device to indicate the field size with a 
number that, along with the SID, must be taken to a lookup table located elsewhere to 
determine the numerical field size? 
ANSWER: No. The beam limiting device shall numerically indicate the field size in the 
plane of the image receptor to which it is adjusted (21 CFR 1020.31(e)(2)) and shall be 
specified in inches and/or centimeters (21 CFR 1020.31(e)(3)). The use of a lookup table 
which is not located on the beam limiting device does not satisfy the requirements of 21 
CFR 1020.31(e).

Controls (See also questions 19, 35, and 36) 
83. QUESTION: Users have requested that manufacturers install a remote exposure switch to 
permit the operator to be located further away from the x-ray beam and patient than normally 
would be permitted by the use of a retractable cord. The remote exposure switch would be 
provided in a separate box, on which are mounted the exposure switch, a light indicating that 
power is on to the entire control, and a light that indicates exposure. Is such an installation 
allowed by the regulations? 
ANSWER: Yes, as long as the following requirements are met: 
• The control panel containing the main power switch bears the warning statement 
required under 21 CFR 1020.30(j), legible and accessible to view, and indication of 
technique factors to be used during an exposure are visible from the operator’s position 
except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist. (21 CFR 1020.31(a)(1)); 
• At the remote location, the beam-on indicators required by 21 CFR 1020.31(j) are 
provided (both a visual indication of x-ray production and a signal audible to the 
operator to indicate that the exposure has terminated); and

84. QUESTION: When a diagnostic x-ray system with a single x-ray control is used to control the 
operation of two or more diagnostic source assemblies (DSAs), how should the system 
indicate which tube or tubes have been selected? 
46

ANSWER: Where two or more radiographic tubes are controlled by one exposure switch, 
 
 
 
 
the tube or tubes which have been selected must be clearly indicated before initiation of the 
 
exposure (21 CFR 1020.31(k)). This indication must be provided on both the x-ray control 
 
 
 
and at or near the tube housing assembly that has been selected (21 CFR 1020.31(k)). This 
 
 
 
could be accomplished with a graphical representation of the x-ray system at the x-ray 
 
 
control which indicates the active tube with lights or color accents. Alternatively, clear 
 
 
 
language may be presented to the user at the x-ray control such as “under-table tube active” 
or “over-table tube active”. 
 
 
 
 
85. QUESTION: When a diagnostic x-ray system with a single x-ray control is used to control the 
 
 
operation of two or more DSAs, does the linearity requirement (21 CFR 1020.31(c)) apply 
 
between the two DSAs? 
 
 
 
 
ANSWER: No. If two or more DSAs are operated from the same control, each combination 
 
 
 
 
 
of DSA and x-ray control will be considered as a separate system for the purpose of 
 
 
 
 
determining applicability of the linearity requirement. Therefore, linearity is applicable for 
  
each such combination of DSA and x-ray control, but not between the two DSAs.

87. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1) specifies that, for diagnostic x-ray systems, “positive 
 
 
 
 
 
 
means” must be provided to ensure the minimum filtration beam quality requirement is met 
 
 
for each exposure. In systems having variable filtration capability, where special radiographic 
 
 
 
techniques require temporary disengagement of the filter and/or mirror optic system, would a 
special tool with appropriate warnings and instructions that would disengage the filtration 
 
 
 
  
elements meet the requirements of “positive means”? 
 
 
 
 
ANSWER: No, a special tool would not qualify as being a “positive means.” To meet the 
requirement of “positive means,” the manufacturer should design the equipment so that 
 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure is inhibited until the proper filtration is in the beam (21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1)). 
 
 
Although special tools may be used to remove the filter during servicing, the operator 
should not have to routinely add and/or remove it during normal use. In the case of a 
 
 
 
 
diagnostic x-ray system that is to be operated with more than one thickness of filtration, 
this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector that will 
 
 
 
 
  
 
prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in the beam.

NOTE: A requirement to provide optional additional filtration is provided in 21 CFR 
1020.30(m)(2) for certain fluoroscopic systems manufactured on or after June 10, 2006. 
88. QUESTION: Do the Performance Standards cover use of a filter of varying thickness (beam-
shaper) to obtain a uniform exposure at the surface of the film during an examination? 
ANSWER: No. The Performance Standards do not place requirements on such filtration, 
but they do set requirements in Table 1 of 21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1) for minimum beam 
quality. (See also questions 86 and 87). FDA will test systems for compliance with the 
compensation filter in place and the beam-limiting device opened to the widest setting to 
make the half-value layer determination. Since the filtration is not uniform across the 
useful beam, the region of minimum thickness will be the value used to determine 
compliance. 
89. QUESTION: A manufacturer produces an x-ray system rated nominally at 70 kVp and has 
established a kVp tolerance of plus or minus 5 percent (±5%). If the measured kVp of the 
system is 73, and referencing Table 1 of 21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1), must the minimum half-
value layer (HVL) be at least 2.6 mm of aluminum (by linear interpolation from the “above 
70” kVp section) or 1.9 mm of aluminum (by linear extrapolation from the “51 to 70” kVp 
designed operating range)? 
ANSWER: 1.9 mm of aluminum is an acceptable value. In 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(3) and 
1020.31(a)(4), each manufacturer is required to establish and state its own technique factor 
accuracy specifications. If a machine is designed to operate only in the range of 51 to 70 
kVp, the appropriate range in Table 1 of 21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1) for determining HVL 
compliance is the 51 to 70 kVp range, regardless of whether the measured kVp exceeds 70 
or falls below 51 kVp. If the measured kVp value falls outside of this range, the 
manufacturer should determine the correct HVL by linear extrapolation from Table 1 under 
21 CFR 1020.30(m)(1). The manufacturer should extrapolate from the values for HVL 
given for the two kVp values (within the designed operating range) that are closest to the 
measured kVp. In this example, the HVL value for 73 kVp should be extrapolated from the 
51 to 70 kVp operating range and the correct minimum HVL is 1.89 mm of aluminum. 
If a system is designed to operate in multiple kVp ranges, the appropriate range for 
determining HVL compliance is dictated by the selected operating tube potential.

Image Receptors 
90. QUESTION: Under 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i)(F), the June 10, 2006 update of the Performance 
Standards now includes “Image receptors that are electrically powered or connected with the 
x-ray system manufactured on or after June 10, 2006,” as certifiable components of diagnostic 
x-ray systems. How does FDA interpret this change and what requirements are applicable to 
the covered products?

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
ANSWER: FDA generally enforces 21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i)(F) only with respect to those 
electrically powered image receptors that are used as fluoroscopic image receptors. This 
includes image receptors that are used for a combination of both fluoroscopy and 
radiography. FDA does not intend to enforce the requirements under 21 CFR 
1020.30(a)(1)(i)(F) to electrically powered image receptors used in radiographic-only 
systems at this time. 
NOTE: Additional requirements may apply to image receptors if they perform additional 
functions where requirements are specified in the Performance Standards. (See also 
question 7). 
91. QUESTION: What additional information is required to be provided to users regarding image 
receptors that are electrically powered or connected? 
ANSWER: For x-ray systems manufactured on or after June 10, 2006 that produce images 
using a fluoroscopic image receptor, the following information is required by 21 CFR 
1020.30(h)(5) and must be provided in a separate, single section of the user’s instruction 
manual or in a separate manual devoted to this information: 
“(i) For each mode of operation, a description of the mode and detailed instructions on how 
the mode is engaged and disengaged. The description of the mode shall identify those 
technique factors and system controls that are fixed or automatically adjusted by selection of 
the mode of operation, including the manner in which the automatic adjustment is 
controlled. This information shall include how the operator can recognize which mode of 
operation has been selected prior to initiation of x-ray production. 
(ii) For each mode of operation, a descriptive example(s) of any specific clinical 
procedure(s) or imaging task(s) for which the mode is recommended or designed and how 
each mode should be used. Such recommendations do not preclude other clinical uses.” 
For additional information on requirements for these image receptors, see FDA’s guidance 
entitled “Guidance for the Submission of 510(k)s for Solid State X-ray Imaging 
Devices.”24

b. When both switches are activated, the light intensity is equal to about 160 lux at 100 
cm, and it is timed so that after 30 seconds, the intensity decreases to about 100 lux? 
Would such a system meet the requirement in 21 CFR 1020.31(d)(2)(ii)? 
ANSWER: No. 21 CFR 1020.31(d)(2)(ii) requires that whenever the light localizer is 
activated, the intensity must be equal to or greater than 160 lux at 100 cm or the maximum 
SID, if less than 100 cm. 
93. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.31(d)(2)(ii) and (iii) place requirements on the intensity and edge 
contrast that must be provided when light field localizers are incorporated into general 
purpose x-ray systems. What requirements, if any, are applicable to special purpose x-ray 
systems such as mammography, podiatry, and cephalometric systems incorporating light 
localizers? 
ANSWER: It depends on how the light field is used. If the light field device is intended for 
use only as a centering light and is not intended by the manufacturer or perceived by the 
user as visually defining the perimeter of the x-ray field, then no specific illumination 
intensity or light field contrast requirements apply. However, if the light field is intended 
for use by the manufacturer or perceived by the user to visually define the perimeter of the 
x-ray field, then the illumination intensity requirement of 21 CFR 1020.31(d)(2)(ii) and the 
light field edge contrast requirements of 21 CFR 1020.31(d)(2)(iii) are applicable.

Mechanical Tomographic Systems 
94. QUESTION: Traditionally, a tomographic attachment for a standard radiographic x-ray 
system consists of a mechanical interconnecting arm, a drive system, and electrical switches, 
one of which initiates exposure and another of which terminates the exposure. Thus, the 
tomographic device becomes an exposure timing device. However, its accuracy may be 
suspect because of mechanical friction or accuracy of attachment by the user. If the exposure 
termination switch is removed, the exposure timing function would revert to the x-ray control, 
to be set by the user. Would the tomographic attachment then no longer be a certifiable 
component? 
ANSWER: Yes. 
95. QUESTION: A manufacturer markets a mechanical tomographic kit to be added to its x-ray 
table. However, since the kit is capable of controlling exposure time, it is subject to the 
Performance Standards. The manufacturer’s instructions specify that the console timer must 
be set to terminate the exposure before the exposure switch in the tomographic attachment 
would terminate it, thus making the tomographic exposure control serve merely as a back-up. 
Therefore, the manufacturer concludes that the tomographic timer would not need to be 
certified. Would this be a satisfactory approach?

ANSWER: No. Tomographic attachments that control the exposure time are required to be 
certified (21 CFR 1020.30(a)(1)(i)(A)). This is true even of tomographic controls used as 
back-up timers. (See also question 7). 
96. QUESTION: Are exposures made during the operation of radiographic systems in a 
tomographic mode subject to the reproducibility and linearity requirements of 21 CFR 
1020.31(b) and (c)? 
ANSWER: Yes. The reproducibility and linearity provisions of 21 CFR 1020.31(b) and (c) 
are applicable during the tomographic mode of operation. 
(6) 
Source-Image Receptor Distance Indicators 
97. QUESTION: 21 CFR 1020.31(e)(1) states that “means shall be provided to indicate when the 
axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor, to align the center 
of the x-ray field with respect to the center of the image receptor to within 2 percent of the 
SID, and to indicate the SID to within 2 percent.” A manufacturer proposes meeting the 
requirement for indicating SID by placing microswitches at discrete operating locations and 
providing: (1) user instructions specifying the position of each microswitch and the 
corresponding SID to the permanently-mounted image receptor; and (2) installation of an 
“exposure ready light” on the beam-limiting device. This light would only be illuminated 
when a microswitch is activated. The microswitches are frequently used to provide discrete 
SIDs with a wall-mounted image receptor and are occasionally used to provide discrete SIDs 
with an under-table image receptor. Would such a configuration satisfy the applicable 
requirements? 
ANSWER: No. A statement of the SID(s) in the user instructions alone is not sufficient. 
With the exception of when spot-film devices are in service, all stationary general purpose 
radiographic systems must be equipped with means to provide numerical indication of any 
and all SIDs (21 CFR 1020.31(e)(1)) at which the system is designed to operate when the 
x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor. The SID value must be 
indicated on the system (21 CFR 1020.31(e)(2) and (3)). 
(7) Timers (See also question 95) 
98. QUESTION: A firm wants to manufacture and sell replacement electronic timers for 
installation into existing x-ray controls. Are there any specific requirements for these timers? 
ANSWER: Yes. FDA considers such timers to be x-ray controls (21 CFR 
1020.30(a)(1)(i)(A)) and, as such, they must be certified (21 CFR 1020.30(c)). 
Replacement timers require certification (based upon an appropriate test or testing 
program) (21 CFR 1010.2(c)), adequate labeling, and compatibility information (21 CFR 
1020.30(g)). The certification and identification labels must be legible and readily

(8) Tube Housing Assemblies (See also questions 13 and 34) 
99. QUESTION: A manufacturer produces a number of x-ray tube housing assemblies to be used 
solely for testing purposes and never to be used on patients. The manufacturer also has tube 
housing assemblies that are used in trade show displays that will never be sold for patient use 
and are not intended to be connected to produce x-rays. Does the manufacturer have to certify 
these tube housing assemblies? 
ANSWER: No. The intent of electronic product certification for x-ray systems and 
components is to assure that patients and users are protected from unnecessary electronic 
product radiation. Since these tube housing assemblies will not be used to irradiate any part 
of the human body for the purpose of diagnosis or visualization, then they are not 
considered components of a diagnostic x-ray system (21 CFR 1020.30(b)) and they do not 
have to be certified. Manufacturers should mark the tube housings clearly as to their 
intended purpose, make them non-functional, or include assembly instructions to indicate 
that the tube housings are not to be used on patients. 
100. QUESTION: The Performance Standards limiting x-ray leakage (21 CFR 1020.30(k)) and 
radiation from capacitor energy storage equipment (21 CFR 1020.31(l)) apply to the 
diagnostic source assembly, which includes the tube housing assembly and the beam limiting 
device. How does a manufacturer who wishes to certify only a tube housing assembly or beam 
limiting device perform certification testing on this component? 
ANSWER: The manufacturer must ensure that the tube housing assembly or beam limiting 
device it is certifying is compatible with the components with which it is intended to be 
used (21 CFR 1020.30(g)). The firm, or the manufacturer of the other components (if the 
components are manufactured by different firms), must test the tube housing assemblies or 
beam limiting devices with those devices with which compatibility is specified (21 CFR 
1020.30(g)). Such specifications may describe pertinent physical characteristics of the 
components and/or may list by manufacturer model number the components which are 
compatible. A firm which specifies compatibility with other components should perform 
periodic direct testing of the component combinations to confirm continuing compatibility. 
Once established, compatibility may be specified in terms of manufacturer name and model 
number and/or in terms of pertinent physical characteristics of the components. (See also 
question 8). 
101. QUESTION: If a manufacturer replaces a tube insert in a tube housing assembly, does it need 
to change the date of manufacture on the tube housing assembly’s identification label? What 
about any other required labeling on the housing?

ANSWER: With the exception of quick-change tubes, replacing the tube insert in a tube 
housing assembly requires that the tube housing assembly show a new date of manufacture 
(21 CFR 1020.30(e)(1), (2) and (3)). The previous label must be removed, covered, or 
defaced so that only the new date is shown (21 CFR 1020.30(e)(2)). In the event that any 
other information is different, such as name and address of manufacturer or model or serial 
number, this information also must be changed in the same manner (21 CFR 1020.30(e)(1), 
(2) and (3)). (See also question 34). 
102. QUESTION: Does the answer to question 101 change if the system contains a single-labeled 
group of components that includes the tube housing assembly that is to be re-loaded – the 
replacement of a new tube insert into an old housing? 
ANSWER: If there is a single-labeled group of components that includes a tube housing 
assembly that need to be replaced, there are two options: 
a. If adding the tube insert may affect some aspect of compliance, re-label the single-
labeled group of components (date of manufacture, model number and serial number if 
applicable, tube insert model information and change of certifying manufacturer if 
applicable) to meet 21 CFR 1020.30(e)(1). The date used should be the date of 
replacement of the tube insert, not the original date of manufacture. (21 CFR 
1020.30(e)(2)). 
b. If adding the tube insert does not affect any aspect of compliance, an additional label 
may be used to provide tube insert model information and change of certifying 
manufacturer if applicable. 
103. QUESTION: Do repairs to a tube housing assembly, including repairs that require the 
temporary removal and reinstallation of the same insert, constitute the manufacture of a new 
tube housing assembly? 
ANSWER: No. Any repair done on any tube housing assembly that does not include 
insertion of a different tube insert in a previously certified tube housing is considered repair 
(21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2)(iii)) and does not constitute the manufacture of a new tube housing 
assembly. However, any time that the integrity of the tube housing assembly shielding has 
been compromised, evidence should be provided to the user to assure continued 
compliance of the tube housing assembly with leakage and compatibility requirements.
