Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Premarket Notification [510(k)]
Submissions for Chemical Indicators
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

I.

Introduction

A chemical indicator intended for use in health care facilities to monitor sterilization
processes is a class II device as identified in 21 Code of Federal Regulation (CFR)
section 880.2800. Chemical indicators are also known as “physical/chemical sterilization
process indicators.” The term “chemical indicators” used in this document includes
process indicators, chemical integrators, and air removal indicators used in test packs
such as the Bowie Dick Test Pack.
A person intending to market a chemical indicator to be used in health care facilities must
submit to FDA, and have cleared, a premarket notification submission prior to
introduction of the device into interstate commerce, in accordance with section 510(k) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).
Regulations governing the general content and format of 510(k) submissions for chemical
indicators are codified under 21 CFR Part 807. These and other regulatory requirements
pertaining to the marketing of a new medical device are discussed in guidance documents
available from CDRH, Division of Small Manufacturers, International, and Consumer
Assistance (DSMICA). These requirements are also explained on the Internet in CDRH
Device Advice, http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/ .
Management of current sterilization technologies requires the use of more than one type of
monitoring procedure. Chemical indicators are an integral part of this monitoring process.
Along with biological indicators and mechanical monitors, they can provide an effective
program to detect sterilization process failures. As part of a complete quality control
program, they can help guard against problems associated with user error, sterilizer

malfunction or inadequate sterilant penetration. The adequate performance of sterilizers in
health care facilities is important to prevent nosocomial infections. Chemical indicators can
provide health care facilities with information on the effectiveness of a sterilization process.
FDA recognizes the importance of providing submitters and other interested parties with
the Agency’s recommendations for chemical indicators in order to facilitate the assembly
of data to maintain consistency of review, and to provide for a more efficient regulatory
process. This guidance is intended to provide specific recommendations to 510(k)
submitters about information that they should include in 510(k)s for chemical indicators
used in health care facilities.
This guidance replaces the draft document entitled, “Chemical Indicators Premarket
Notification [510(k)] Submissions; Draft Guidance for Industry and FDA,” which was made
available on January 27, 2003. There have been no major changes from the previous draft
version.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.
Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues
we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is
available on our Center web page at: https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/
.

II. Background
A. Scope
This document provides guidance concerning the content and format of 510(k)
submissions for chemical indicators intended to monitor sterilization processes in health
care facilities. Chemical indicators for use in health care facilities are class II devices.
The product code is JOJ. Section 21 CFR 880.2800 (b), Physical/chemical sterilization
process indicator identifies these devices as:

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A physical/chemical sterilization process indicator is a device
intended for use by a health care provider to accompany
products being sterilized through a sterilization procedure and
to monitor one or more parameters of the sterilization process.
The adequacy of the sterilization conditions as measured by
these parameters is indicated by a visible change in the device.
FDA has cleared, through the 510(k) process, the following three types of chemical
indicators for use in health care facilities:1
•

process indicators

•

chemical integrators

•

air removal indicators for test packs.

Therefore, this guidance addresses only these three types of chemical indicators.
The FDA encourages you, the 510(k) submitter, to contact DSMICA or the Infection Control
Devices Branch, Division of Anesthesiology, General Hospital, Infection Control, and Dental
Devices, Office of Device Evaluation, if you have any questions before submitting a 510(k)
for chemical indicators.
B. Exclusions
This document does not cover the following chemical indicators and indicator related
products:
•

chemical indicators intended to be used with liquid chemical sterilants2

•

chemical indicators intended for use in a manufacturing setting

•

chemical indicators used for radiation sterilization.

C. Definitions
The following are definitions of terms used throughout the document. Many of the
definitions have been standardized by organizations such as the International

IV. Device Description
You should provide a detailed description of your chemical indicator. The description for
your chemical indicator should include the general characteristics regarding the device
design and manufacturing specifications. The bulleted list below is an example of the type of
information that you should provide in the description for your device. We may request
additional information, if the differences in design, formulation, or performance warrant.
•

chemical name of indicator agent, e.g., ink, dye, chemical reagent

•

chemical composition or formulation of the indicator

•

reaction that takes place to achieve its intended endpoint

V.

Intended Use

You should clearly state the intended use of the chemical indicator. The following are
examples of intended use for each type of indicator.
A. Process indicator
The process indicator is intended to be used by a health care provider with sterilization
wraps, containers, cassettes, or pouches to distinguish between processed and
unprocessed units.
B. Chemical Integrators
The chemical integrator is intended to be used by a health care provider to demonstrate
that the parameters over a specified range of sterilization cycles have been met in a
specified sterilization wrap, container, cassette, or pouch.
C. Air Removal Indicators
The air removal indicator is intended to be used by a health care provider in a
standardized test pack, e.g., Bowie Dick Test Pack, to assess the ability of a prevacuum
sterilizer to remove air and allow steam to penetrate into wrapped goods and porous
loads. The test pack is usually positioned over the chamber drain in an otherwise empty
chamber. An inefficient air removal stage, an air leak, or non-condensable gases in the
steam supply are some of the conditions that could cause an incomplete change in the air
removal indicator, e.g., uneven color change. The Bowie Dick Test is not an indication
that the sterilizer has reached the parameters for sterilization.

VI. FDA-Recognized Standards
If any part of the device design or testing relies on an FDA-recognized standard, you may
submit (1) a statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the product is marketed, or (2) a declaration of conformity to the standard in lieu of
data.4 Please note that testing must be completed before submitting a declaration of
conformity to a recognized standard. (Section 514(c)(1)(B) of the act). For more
information, refer to the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence
Determinations; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1131.html.
Recognized standards that apply to chemical indicators are discussed in the following
sections.

VII. Performance Characteristics
You should provide sufficient information to allow FDA to evaluate the endpoint
specifications and performance of the chemical indicator. In order to provide the user with
adequate instructions for use, there should be a high visual contrast between the initial and
endpoint appearance or physical/chemical change that takes place after processing the
chemical indicator, e.g., colors change.
You should provide the critical parameters to which the chemical indicator is intended to
respond. For the traditional sterilization processes that are generally used in the health care
facility, ANSI/AAMI ST 60 (see XII. References) specifies the parameters shown in Table 2
as critical.

Ethylene Oxide (EO)
Time, temperature, humidity, and EO concentration
The critical parameters not normally tested for chemical indicators are steam quality or
degree of saturated steam in a steam sterilization process and relative humidity in an
EO sterilization process. The performance of the chemical indicator is evaluated while
controlling these critical parameters under specified conditions. These specified
conditions are called limiting values. The limiting values for saturated steam, referred
to as dryness values, are 0.85 –1.0. The limiting value for EO relative humidity is
greater than 30%.
a

FDA recommends that you provide the following information in your 510(k):
•

clear statement of the study objective(s)

•

description of the sterilization process used in health care facility for which the
indicator is intended, e.g., steam, EO

•

description of the health care facility sterilization cycle for which the indicator is
intended, e.g., gravity cycle for 15 minutes at 121°C

•

critical parameters to which the indicator responds

•

specifications for the pass/fail criteria

•

pass/fail results obtained from a resistometer

•

pass/fail results from an actual sterilization cycle used in a health care facility

•

information on the resistance of the biological indicator used in the parallel study, if
applicable

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

information showing that you used a statistically valid sample size, e.g., 3 lots from 3
different manufacturing runs (i.e., one lot from each manufacturing run)

•

description of the positive and negative controls

•

conclusion drawn from study.

If feasible, you should also provide actual samples of unprocessed and processed indicators.
A. Process Indicators
You should provide the following information for process indicators.
To characterize the process indicator and demonstrate substantial equivalence, you
should provide pass/fail results demonstrating how the indicator reacts to the critical
parameters in a resistometer. FDA recommends that the resistometer used for chemical
indicator performance testing meet ANSI/AAMI ST 44 (see XII. References).
FDA also recommends that the submission include pass/fail results showing how the
process indicator would react in an actual sterilizer used in a health care facility. These
results should be compared to the resistometer vessel results. If there is a discrepancy
between the resistometer and health care facility sterilizer results, you should provide this
information in the labeling.
Steam Process Indicators
You should demonstrate, as specified in ANSI/AAMI ST 60, that the chemical
indicator does not reach its endpoint when exposed to dry heat at 140°C for 30
minutes.
EO process indicators
You should evaluate EO process indicators as specified in ANSI/AAMI ST 60 to
show that after being exposed to 60°C±2°C at greater than 85% relative humidity for
not less than 90 minutes, the indicator does not reach its endpoint. This test is done
without EO present.
The following table provides the criteria that a process indicator should meet according
to the consensus standard ANSI/AAMI ST 60 for the indicated sterilization methods.

B. Chemical Integrators
The testing described in Section VII. Performance Characteristics and VII. A. Process
Indicators also applies to chemical integrators, with the exception of the performance
criteria shown in Table 3. There are no specific performance criteria established for
chemical integrators in any published consensus standard. You should provide the
specifications for the endpoint reaction for each critical parameter identified and provide
the following pass/fail results to support the specifications.
Critical Parameters
You should describe the pass/fail criteria for each critical cycle parameter and
provide the pass/fail results to show how the chemical integrator reacts to all the
critical parameters in the sterilization cycle for which it is intended. We recommend
that you evaluate one parameter at a time in a resistometer while holding the other
parameter or parameters constant. The reproducibility of the endpoint reaction
should be within the 15% tolerance level of the stated value, as specified in
ANSI/AAMI ST 60.
Side-by-Side Testing with the Biological Indicator
You should conduct side-by-side testing of the biological indicator and the subject
chemical integrator in an appropriate resistometer. You should use a biological
indicator in the study that is legally marketed for the intended sterilization process
and cycles. You should also state the D-value for the biological indicator used in the
study. The chemical integrator should parallel the performance of an appropriate
biological indicator. The results of this study should demonstrate that the integrator
does not reach its endpoint before the biological indicator is inactivated, as specified
in ANSI/AAMI ST 60.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
C. Chemical Integrator Test Packs
Chemical integrators may be used in test packs to simulate products being sterilized.5
These test packs are intended to create a challenge to the sterilization process that is
equal to or greater than the most difficult item routinely processed.
For chemical integrator test packs, you should provide the following information:
•

pass/fail results comparing the performance of the chemical integrator in the test
pack to the AAMI reference biological indicator test packs in their respective
processes (The AAMI standardized test packs are considered the “gold”
standards.)

•

information to show that the integrator test pack provides an equivalent or greater
challenge than the AAMI standardized test pack

•

additional information to show that the integrator test pack provides a greater
challenge to the process than the integrator by itself.

D. Process Indicators for New Technology Sterilizers
There are no specific performance criteria for chemical indicators for use with new
technology sterilizers; however, we believe that the criteria outlined above can be used to
evaluate the performance of these chemical indicators. Chemical indicators intended to
monitor new technology sterilizers, e.g., vaporized hydrogen peroxide, microwave, gas
plasma, ozone, may be determined substantially equivalent to any legally marketed
chemical indicator, including a pre-amendments chemical indicator or a chemical
indicator found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. You should provide
pass/fail results characterizing your chemical indicator according to its indications. In
general, you should:

5

•

identify the critical parameters of the sterilization cycle, e.g., temperature, time,
sterilant concentration

•

identify the minimum exposure parameters needed to affect the change of the
indicator

•

establish the pass/fail criteria

•

describe in detail the endpoint reaction or change that is intended to occur

•

provide pass/fail results demonstrating how the chemical indicator reacts to the
critical parameters specified in an appropriate resistometer vessel, if available,
for characterization and compare it to the results obtained above

•

demonstrate reproducibility using a statistically valid number of samples.

These test packs are also called process challenge devices (PCDs).

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
E. Chemical Integrators for New Technology Sterilizers
The testing described in sections VII. B. Chemical Integrators and VII. D. Process
Indicators for New Technology Sterilizers also applies to new technology sterilizer
integrators.
In addition, FDA recommends that the biological indicator used to validate the new
technology sterilizer cycle also be used to validate the performance of the chemical
integrator. The integrator should not reach its endpoint before the biological indicator is
inactivated.
F. New Technology Chemical Integrator Test Packs
For new technology integrator test packs, there are no “gold” standards. We recommend
that you use the performance criteria for traditional sterilization methods to demonstrate
the resistance of the new technology chemical integrator. These performance criteria are
identified in ANSI/AAMI ST 46 and ST 41 (see XII. References). You should provide
pass/fail results demonstrating that the test pack provides a greater challenge to the
process than the biological indicator that was used to validate the new technology
sterilization process and the integrator itself. For example, the challenge should be
equivalent to the increase in the D-value that is provided by the ANSI/AAMI ST 46 and
ST 41 standard biological indicator test packs in their respective processes.
G. Air Removal Indicators
For air removal indicators, FDA recommends that you determine the following
performance criteria and endpoint specifications inside a test pack (Bowie Dick Test).
You should provide pass/fail results demonstrating that the indicator does not reach its
endpoint when exposed to dry heat at 140±2°C for 30 minutes.
You should also provide pass/fail results demonstrating the tolerances for the detection of
air in a prevacuum sterilizer. You can simulate this fault condition by injecting air or by
not pulling a complete vacuum to produce a non-uniform change in the indicator agent.
You should include a thermocouple graph showing the decrease in temperature during
the fault condition at the different locations in the cycle.
The thermocouple graph demonstrating a failed result should be compared to the graph
showing that the indicator passed. As specified in ANSI/AAMI ST 66, the test
temperature within the test pack should be less than 0.5°C for a pass.
For greater sensitivity in detecting air over a larger area, FDA recommends that the air
removal indicator sheet in the test pack measure approximately 8 inches by 10 inches
(ANSI/AAMI ST 60). The indicator agent should cover a large percentage of the test
sheet and it should be uniform.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
You should provide specification for the porosity of the material used to construct the air
removal indicator. The standard, ANSI/AAMI ST 66 (see XII. References) recommends
using a standard densitometer to measure the time required for a given volume of air
(25ml to 300ml) to flow through a standard area of the indicator being tested to measure
the porosity of the test material.

VIII. Biocompatibility
There is the possibility that an active ingredient in some chemical indicators may leach onto
the surgical instruments when it comes in contact. You should address this concern by
demonstrating that your chemical indicator does not release any substance known to be toxic
in sufficient quantities to cause a health hazard or deleterious effect to the user or the devices
that are sterilized.

IX.

Endpoint Stability for Chemical Indicators

You should demonstrate the stability of the specified endpoint reaction (e.g., color stability)
for the chemical indicator at the end of its shelf life.

X.

Shelf Life

You should demonstrate that the specification for the endpoint reaction of the chemical
indicator is maintained throughout its labeled shelf life. For all studies, you should test at
least 3 lots of the production chemical indicators using a sample size that is statistically
significant. You should use storage conditions described in the device labeling.
You should provide the following information about shelf life:
•

labeled shelf life of the chemical indicator

•

dates and length of time for each testing interval, e.g., 0, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years

•

resistometer vessel data for each testing interval that demonstrates that the established
endpoints are maintained.

Chemical indicators may be unstable at elevated temperatures; therefore, accelerated aging
studies may be inappropriate and are not recommended.
In lieu of complete real time shelf life data, the FDA will consider preliminary real time shelf
life data (e.g., 6 months) along with a detailed protocol and sampling plan for an ongoing
real time (e.g., 2 years) study that you will continue after your device is cleared. These study
protocols should include the shelf life information listed above. We also recommend that

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
you document the results in your design history file as a part of the Quality Systems
Requirements (21 CFR 820.30).

XI. Labeling
The premarket notification should include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you in
preparing labeling that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e).6
FDA suggests that you provide in the labeling:
•

performance characteristics, so that users can determine whether your indicator will
meet their needs

•

any interfering substances or conditions known to affect the performance of the
indicator

•

clear description of the physical change that is designed to occur, with descriptions of
the indicator both before and after the change, if applicable

•

any intermediate changes between the initial and endpoint appearance

•

adequate directions for interpretation of the endpoint results or provide a mechanism
by which a clearly defined endpoint can be determined by the user, if the endpoint is
not clearly obvious

•

storage conditions

•

expiration date of the unused indicator under specific storage conditions

•

any safety precautions required during use

•

stability of the endpoint color reaction

•

the minimum exposure parameters necessary to affect the change (for chemical
integrators only)

In addition to the above, labeling for a Bowie Dick Test Pack should contain the following:
•

statement indicating that the device is for use in determining air removal

6

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply
with the requirements of 21 CFR 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate
commerce. Labeling recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements
of part 801.

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

warning indicating that extending the manufacturer’s recommended time for the
Bowie Dick Test may result in false endpoints developing because entrapped air
diffuses over time

•

warning indicating that Bowie Dick Test should be performed in an empty chamber.
