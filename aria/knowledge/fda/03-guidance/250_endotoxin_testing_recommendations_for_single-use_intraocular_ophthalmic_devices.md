Endotoxin Testing Recommendations for
Single-Use Intraocular Ophthalmic Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) current thinking on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is
not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach,
contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
This guidance document was developed to notify manufacturers of the recommended endotoxin
limit for the release of intraocular devices and single-use intraocular ophthalmic surgical
instruments/accessories in an effort to mitigate future Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome
(TASS) outbreaks. TASS is a sterile inflammatory condition localized to the anterior segment of
the eye following intraocular surgery. It has been associated with significant decreases in vision
and may require additional surgical procedures, including corneal transplants and glaucoma
surgery, to resolve some of its sequelae.
National outbreaks of TASS have been associated with endotoxin. Devices used inside the eye,
including intraocular devices and single-use intraocular ophthalmic surgical
instruments/accessories, can potentially be contaminated with endotoxin as part of the
manufacturing, sterilization, or packaging processes. This guidance document provides
recommendations for endotoxin limits as well as endotoxin testing to manufacturers and other
entities involved in submitting premarket applications (PMAs) or premarket notification
submissions [510(k)s] for different categories of intraocular devices to aid in the prevention of
future outbreaks of TASS.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Definitions
A. Intraocular Fluids: A nongaseous fluid intended to be introduced into the eye to aid
performance of surgery such as to maintain anterior chamber depth, preserve tissue
integrity, protect tissue from surgical trauma or function as a tamponade during retinal
reattachment. 21 CFR 886.4275.
1. Ophthalmic Viscosurgical Device (OVD): Both viscous and viscoelastic
intraocular fluids intended for use during surgery in the anterior chamber as a
surgical aid to maintain space in the eye and protect ocular tissue from surgical
trauma. They are usually intended for use in cataract surgery, corneal transplant
surgery, and glaucoma filtration surgery. These devices are typically prepackaged in a syringe and require PMA approval prior to being marketed. This
term includes viscoelastic surgical aids.
B. Intraocular Lenses (IOLs): An artificial lens intended to be implanted to replace the
natural lens of an eye. 21 CFR 886.3600. IOLs can be used to restore vision and replace
the natural lens of the eye after it is removed during cataract surgery. IOLs can also be
used in eyes where the natural lens is not removed but that require correction of refractive
error. Examples of types of IOLs include monofocal, toric, multifocal, accommodative,
iris reconstruction and phakic. Iris reconstruction lenses are used to cosmetically correct
defects in the appearance of the eye, usually caused by the absence of an iris.
C. Capsular Tension Rings: A prosthetic device designed to stabilize the crystalline lens
capsule in the presence of weak or partially absent zonules in patients undergoing
cataract extraction with an intraocular lens.
D. Glaucoma Devices: A device used to treat glaucoma, a condition in which the pressure
within the eye (i.e., intraocular pressure) is abnormally high, resulting in damage to the
optic nerve. These devices are often partially implanted in the anterior segment of the eye
with the other portion of the device residing on the eye. These devices include aqueous
shunts (21 CFR 886.3920).
E. Phacofragmentation System: A phacofragmentation system is an AC-powered device
with a fragmenting needle intended for use in cataract surgery to disrupt a cataract with
ultrasound and extract the cataract. 21 CFR 886.4670. The hand piece is composed of a
tip that delivers ultrasound energy which emulsifies the lens and aspirates lens material
from its open end.
1. Sleeves: Surrounding the tip of the phacofragmentation handpiece is the sleeve,
which is often of rubbery consistency and allows for irrigation around the tip as
well as a barrier to tip penetration into lens material.
2. Tubing: Any lumened device that transmits fluid into or out of the eye.
F. Endotoxin: High molecular weight complex associated with the cell wall of Gramnegative bacteria that is pyrogenic in humans and specifically interacts with Limulus
amebocyte lysate (LAL).1
G. Endotoxin unit (EU): Standard unit of measure for endotoxin activity initially
established relative to the activity contained in 0.2 ng of the U.S. Reference Standard
Endotoxin Lot EC-2 (USP standard reference material). Endotoxin is expressed in
International Units (IU) and one EU is equal to one IU.1
H. Anterior segment: The front third of the eye including all structures located between the
front surface of the cornea and vitreous.

I. Anterior chamber: The space in the eye that is behind the cornea and in front of the
iris. It contains aqueous humor.
J. Aqueous humor: A transparent, watery fluid circulating in the anterior and posterior
chamber of the eye. It maintains the intraocular pressure of the eye, provides amino acids
and glucose to the avascular ocular tissues and plays a role in the immune response of the
eye.
K. Bacterial endotoxin test (BET): Assay for measuring active endotoxin by combining a
liquid test sample with Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) reagent and measuring the
resulting proportional reaction by gel-clot, turbidimetric, chromogenic, or other validated
means of detection.1

III. Background
TASS has been increasing in frequency over the past decade from approximately 1 in 1,000 to
about 2 in 100. 2-4 Some cases of TASS are severe enough to require secondary surgical
interventions including glaucoma surgery and corneal transplantation. 5 The use of inadequately
or improperly processed ophthalmic surgical instruments is one of many factors suggested as a
potential cause of TASS.6-9 In many TASS cases, bacterial endotoxin from medical devices is
believed to cause the inflammation.10,11 Endotoxin was found to be an intrinsic contaminant of a
balanced salt solution used in cataract surgery that resulted in a TASS outbreak in 2005
involving 112 patients.12
Because bacteria thrive in media containing water, medical devices that are aqueous in nature,
contain an aqueous component, or are otherwise exposed to water during the manufacturing
process are vulnerable to bacterial proliferation and subsequent endotoxin contamination. Thus,
ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs) that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery are
prone to endotoxin contamination. Further, the raw materials used in fabricating sodium
hyaluronate (HA)-based OVDs, which are of biological origin, can also be a source of
endotoxins. It has been shown that endotoxin in viscous materials such as OVDs incite more
inflammation intraocularly than endotoxin in aqueous solution due to the prolonged contact with
sensitive ocular tissue.13
The general principles of endotoxin testing, as described in the most recent FDA-recognized
versions* of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) <85> Bacterial Endotoxin Test,14 and the
American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/Association for the Advancement of Medical
Instrumentation (AAMI) ST72 Bacterial Endotoxins-Test Methodologies, Routine Monitoring
and Alternatives to Batch Testing,1 can be followed to test the endotoxin levels of these singleuse intraocular ophthalmic devices.
The endotoxin limit for OVDs specified in International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
15798 (Ophthalmic implants-Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices) is 0.5 endotoxin units (EU) per
milliliter (mL). During cataract surgery, the anterior segment of the eye can accommodate more
than 0.3 ml of OVD after lens extraction and as much as 0.1 mL OVD may remain in the eye at

the end of the procedure. Hence, it is possible for 0.05 EU endotoxin to be left in the eye at the
conclusion of the surgery, and this amount has been shown to cause inflammation. 13 This same
study showed that inflammation can be elicited by as little as 0.02 EU endotoxin in an OVD.
Therefore, FDA does not recognize the endotoxin levels in the ISO 15798 (Ophthalmic implantsOphthalmic viscosurgical devices) standard.
In ISO 11979-8 (Ophthalmic implants-Intraocular lenses-part 8: Fundamental requirements
Amendment 1), the endotoxin limit for IOLs is 0.5 EU per device or less. Any endotoxin present
on an IOL or other solid ophthalmic devices goes into solution when placed in an aqueous
medium such as the aqueous humor. Studies have shown that 0.08 EU endotoxin in a balanced
salt solution can elicit inflammation in the eye.13 Therefore, FDA does not recognize the
endotoxin limit in ISO 11979-8 (Ophthalmic implants-Intraocular lenses-part 8: Fundamental
requirements Amendment 1) or the limit in the ANSI series of standards for intraocular lenses.

Recommendations
A. Intraocular Fluids
1. OVDs
a. The recommended endotoxin limit for release testing is ≤0.2 EU/mL regardless of
whether the intended site of use is the anterior or posterior segment.
b. Endotoxin test method validation:
The viscosity of OVDs can interfere with the BET. In addition to the general
validation principles described in USP <85> and ANSI/AAMI ST72, the
validation of the BET should include recovery of known amounts of endotoxin
added/spiked to the OVD. For each OVD that is to be marketed, random samples
from 3 lots of the OVD should each be spiked with endotoxin to final
concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 EU/mL. Each test should be conducted in
triplicate (i.e., each lot should be spiked and sampled three times for testing). The
OVD should then be tested for endotoxin using the BET and the percentage
endotoxin recovery should be calculated from the average of the values obtained
from the three test samples from each lot. The detection limit may vary with the
method used for testing (e.g., gel clot, turbidimetric and chromogenic) and, as
such, it may be appropriate to experiment with different methods to ensure
maximal recovery of endotoxin. For OVDs fabricated from HA of a high
molecular weight, it may be appropriate to use an enzyme containing nondetectable levels of endotoxin to break down large molecules and make endotoxin
more accessible for testing. The use of enzyme digestion will avoid the use of a
high dilution factor to overcome interference, which may be appropriate for the
OVD to meet the endotoxin limit.13
c. If performed, animal testing for quality control and acceptance criteria with
associated labeling claim:
The phrase “non-inflammatory” in the labeling of an OVD should not be used
since the OVD could elicit some inflammation but it may not be clinically
significant. OVDs may be labeled as having “low inflammatory potential” if
animal testing or another validated method for detecting inflammation is
performed as a product release test.
Although endotoxin in an OVD can be detected and quantified using a BET, the
amount detected is only an approximation of the actual value due to the inherent
limitations of the test. Furthermore, the amount of endotoxin detected can be
affected by the unique properties of the individual OVD (e.g., the molecular
weight), which could alter how the OVD binds to the ocular tissue and
consequently the efficiency of enzyme digestion. Thus, the recommended method
to assure that an OVD has low inflammatory potential is to test the product in the
anterior segment of the eye with subsequent assessment of inflammation.
Testing of an OVD in an animal model should be performed by injecting the
OVD intracamerally.15 The eyes should then be monitored for clinical signs of

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
inflammation using a slit lamp for at least three days (i.e., 72 hours). The test
method should be validated by quantifying the inflammation elicited by injecting
spiked OVD which results in intraocular doses of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 EU/eye, at a
minimum.
We recommend that sponsors who intend to perform this testing submit a PreSubmission to obtain feedback and recommendations from the Division of
Ophthalmic and Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices on the animal testing validation,
acceptance criteria for release testing, and any other methods of detecting
inflammation. For more information on Pre-Submissions, please see “Requests
for Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and
Meetings with Food and Drug Administration Staff”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/UCM311176.pdf).
B.

Anterior Segment Solid Devices
1. The recommended endotoxin limit for all anterior segment solid intraocular
devices is ≤0.2 EU/device. This limit applies to implants that are placed entirely
in the anterior segment such as IOLs, iris reconstruction lenses, and capsular
tension rings. For glaucoma devices, this limit applies to the segment of the
device placed in the anterior chamber and the segment(s) contacting the aqueous
humor even though the main portion of the device may reside outside the eye. For
single-use cannulated or lumened devices (e.g., irrigation/aspiration sleeves and
tubing), this limit applies to the fluid path and the portion of the device with
aqueous humor contact.
2. Test sample preparation:
The standard 40 mL/device extraction ratio can be adjusted to accommodate the
small size of solid intraocular devices in accordance with the recommendation in
the “FDA Guidance for Industry Pyrogen and Endotoxin Testing: Questions and
Answers”
(http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidanc
es/ucm314718.htm). The volume of the extraction solution chosen should also
take into consideration the endotoxin limit for the device and the sensitivity of the
LAL lysate used in the testing. ANSI/AAMI ST72 specifies the minimum
extraction time as 15 minutes at 37°-40°C or one hour at controlled room
temperature (typically 18-25°C), or other demonstrated equivalent conditions.1
Because of the extreme sensitivity of the eye to endotoxin, the FDA recommends
that the extraction be performed at 37°-40°C with agitation for a minimum of 60
minutes to maximize the extraction efficiency. For cannulated or lumened
devices, sample preparation should consist of filling the fluid pathway with the
extracting medium that has been pre-warmed to 37°± 1°C and then held at 37°±
1°C for at least 60 minutes.
