This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA's
Good Guidance Practices, GGP's. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if
such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be up dated in the next revision to include the standard elemnt s of GGP 's .

Positive-Beam Limitation (PBL) Requirements
Background
On May 3, 1993, the FDA published a final rule in the Federal
Register to amend the Performance Standard for Diagnostic
X-Ray Systems and Their Major Components (Performance
Standard). This change allows assemblers to install manual
beam-limiting devices (BLD) in stationary, general-purpose
radiographic x-ray (GP) systems. The requirement that GP
systems be equipped with PBL has been eliminated. For those
systems equipped with PBL, this proposal still contains the
requirements that apply to PBL. This change was effective
June 2, 1993. In our previous memorandum, dated April 15,
1993, we provided interim guidance to field surveyors on the
testing of certain radiographic systems.
Policy
This memorandum supersedes the April 15 memorandum. All of
the requirements for PBL still apply for assembled PBL
systems. The following represents testing guidance for GP
systems:
1.

Routine testing of GP systems equipped with an x-ray
table should continue, using the Abovetable X-Ray Source
Radiographic Systems (AR) test procedure, including the
testing of the PBL. Any PBL problems, such as failure of
the PBL system to operate properly, will be valid
noncompliances. These violations include, but are not
limited to, failure to prevent exposure until proper
collimation has been accomplished, PBL size comparison,
and failure to prevent exposures at source-image receptor
distances (SID) at which the PBL is not designed to
operate. If a GP system is equipped with a manual BLD,
then the answer to item 53 on the field test record would
be ItCn as before. This question will not generate a
noncompliance. The system testing should continue as

2

before, with an "*I1 placed in data item 54. Skip
the rest of section 8 and all of section 9 of the
instructions in the AR test procedure.
2.

For those GP systems without a table which are equipped
with a manual BLD, the Vertical Cassette Radiographic
Systems (VC) test procedure should be used. Failure to
install PBL on these systems will not be cited as a
violation.

3.

If a GP system without a table is equipped with PBL, then
the Chiropractic Supplement to the AR procedure (ARB)
would apply.

4.

When a system is tested involving a PBL collimator, you
should determine whether the PBL mode of operation
actually functions. If not, then you should determine
whether the PBL functioned at the time of installation.
We allow the owner, under 21 CFR 1020.30(q)(2), to modify
a system under the following conditions:
The owner of a diagnostic x-ray system who
uses the system in a professional or
commercial capacity may modify the system,
provided the modification does not result
in the failure of the system or component
to comply with the applicable requirements
of this section or of S 1020.31,
§ 1020.32, or § 1020.33.
The owner who
causes such modification need not submit
the reports required by Subpart B of Part
1002 of this chapter, provided the owner
records the date and the details of the
modification, and provided the
modification of the x-ray system does not
result in a failure to comply with
§ 1020.31, § 1020.32, or 5 1020.33.
If the user decided to disable his own PBL system for
manual operation, this would not constitute a
noncompliance. If the user has modified the system in
such a manner that the PBL mode is no longer operational,
but all other aspects of the system appear compliant,
record a I1Cmat item 53 on the field test record and add
the following statement in the remarks section of the
field test record:
PBL mode disabled by user on [insert date of
modification here].
We do not expect that many users will have their PBL
systems disabled, since they can usually use the system
in the override condition without a modification of the

hardware. If, however, the user states that the PBL mode
has not functioned since the date of installation, then
this would still be a valid noncompliance. Record an "Aw
or "Bgg for the type of PBL at item 53 on the field test
record and a "NW at item 54. This will generate a
noncompliance for fully certified systems.
We have also attached a copy of a letter to manufacturers and
assemblers, providing additional guidance as to how the new
amendments will be enforced with respect to PBL.
Change in Performance Standard (CFR) References
As you should already be aware, the Performance Standard for
Diagnostic X-Ray Systems and Their Major Components
(Performance Standard) was amended on May 3, 1993 (Federal
Register, Volume 58, Number 83, page 26386) to change various
requirements, the most notable are those pertaining to
positive beam limitation (PBL) and reassembly of components.
With these changes in the Performance Standard, the references
used have changed in certain circumstances. To use the
correct reference for the Performance Standard, please refer
to the Federal Register publication. This is especially
important for FDA district offices when issuing diagnostic xray field test noncompliance letters.
Reaching Maximum Entrance Exposure Rate (EER)
With the advent of larger field image intensifiers, there may
be difficulties making sure that the maximum EER is measured
when the automatic exposure rate control (AERC) mode is
tested. since AERC modes operate by monitoring the light
level from the output phosphor of the image intensifier, the
beam must be completely blocked by lead to drive the system to
the maximum value of EER. If the lead sheet included with the
test kit is used (118 x 10 x low), it may not be large enough
to completely cover a large field image intensifier. When the
x-ray field extends beyond the edge of the lead sheet and
produces light on the output phosphor, the system will not
reach the maximum EER (see Figure 1
the table and test stand
are not shown in this diagram). To avoid this problem, the
lead sheet may be moved closer to the x-ray tube and away from
the image intensifier. However, it might be easier to observe
the following instructions:

-

1.

For undertable-source fluoroscopic systems (UF), the
x-ray field may be adjusted so that it is just larger
than the MDH chamber. The position of the chamber
should be determined by viewing the monitor without the
lead sheet in the beam. Reduce the size of the field

and position the chamber in the center.
lead before the final EER measurement.

Insert the

For C-arm fluoroscopic systems (CF), the beam-defining
assembly should be in slot 1 of the test stand. With
the lead sheet out of the beam, reduce the size of the
x-ray field to slightly larger than the aperture (see
Figure 2).
Only the aperture, with the MDH chamber in
the center, will be visible on the monitor (see
Figure 3). Insert the lead sheet before the final EER
measurement.
Small Target Angle X-Ray Tubes
Recently, we received a copy of a diagnostic x-ray field test
noncompliance letter where a General Electric assembler was
notified that a system did not comply with the-PBL sizing
requirements in 21 CFR 1020.31(g)(l)(i).
The testing was
conducted with a 14" by 1711 film cassette at a source-image
receptor distance (SID) of 36". After the letter was sent to
General Electric, they stated that the system tested uses an 11°
target angle x-ray tube insert. They responded by indicating
that the test was conducted at an SID where full film coverage
was limited to certain film sizes. They provided a copy of a
page from the user's information, which states these limits as
follows:
Target Angle

(40"

SID)

Field Coverage

While the PBL sizing requirements state that such a system must
align the x-ray field with the image receptor at this SID, we
believe that use of these film sizes under the above conditions
does not constitute a public health concern. We believe that the
possibility of this type of undersizing becoming a problem in a
real clinical situation in unlikely (see attached diagram for
graphical representation of this scenario).

Enforcement Policy for Positive-Beam Limitation (PBL)
Requirements in 21 CFR 1020.31(g)

On May 3, 1993, the FDA published a final rule in the Federal
Register to amend the Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray
Systems and Their Major Components (Performance Standard). This
change allows assemblers to install manual beam-limiting devices
(BLD) in stationary, general-purpose radiographic x-ray (GP)
systems. The requirement that GP systems must be equipped with
PBL was eliminated. For those systems equipped with PBL, this
rule still contains the requirements that apply to PBL, This
change was effective June 2, 1993.
Recently, we have received questions from several different
sources requesting clarification as to the requirements that
apply to GP systems. We hope this policy letter helps clarify
our position with respect to the new amendments, We have chosen
a question and answer format to address some of the questions we
have already received and others that we anticipate might be
asked.
If you have any questions on this
