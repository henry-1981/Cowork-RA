Logical Observation Identifiers Names
and Codes for In Vitro
Diagnostic Tests
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) recognizes that with the increasing
implementation of electronic health records (EHR), there has been a greater demand to
standardize the way that in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests are coded. Efforts to harmonize and
standardize information captured and stored in electronic healthcare systems carry important
implications for public health, including expediting access to patient diagnostic information for
healthcare providers, reducing burdens on laboratories for connecting new diagnostic systems to
Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), and facilitating the use of healthcare information for
decision support tools, in addition to many more potential uses.
Information from IVD tests form a significant proportion of all EHRs. Laboratories commonly
associate a LOINC® (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; owned, developed, and
curated by the Regenstrief Institute)1 code with each test being performed by a laboratory. For
each IVD test, LOINC provides a unique numeric code associated with test attributes that
identify the type of IVD test such as the component, property, time, system, scale and method. 2
At present, LOINC is the IVD coding system that is most widely used by clinical laboratories
and EHRs, and is the IVD coding standard recommended by the Office of the National
Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) in the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) as an essential part of meaningful use. LOINC is a partially FDA1

recognized consensus standard, where the recognition is limited to IVD tests. To review the
classes of LOINC that are currently not recognized by FDA, see the FDA Recognized Consensus
Standards Database Web site.3
It is important to distinguish between LOINC codes and Unique Device Identifiers (UDIs). The
LOINC coding system identifies the type of laboratory test being performed, and the UDI
identifies a specific model/version of a regulated laboratory device made by a specific
manufacturer.4 This guidance neither addresses nor affects the requirements related to the
assignment of UDIs for regulated devices.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word “should” in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required. Similarly, the use of “should not” in this guidance does not
suggest or create an independent legal prohibition, but indicates a recommended practice.

II. Background
The essential role of semantic interoperability in healthcare information technology has been
well recognized.5 Executive Order 13410 defines interoperability as “the ability to communicate
and exchange data accurately, effectively, securely, and consistently with different information
technology systems, software applications, and networks in various settings, and exchange data
such that clinical or operational purpose and meaning of the data are preserved and unaltered.”6
FDA’s “Study Data Technical Conformance Guide” further defines semantic interoperability as
“the ability of information shared by systems to be understood, so that nonnumeric data can be
processed by the receiving system. Semantic interoperability is a multi-level concept with the
degree of semantic interoperability dependent on the level of agreement on data content terminology
and other factors. With greater degrees of semantic interoperability, less human manual processing is
required, thereby decreasing errors and inefficiencies in data analysis. The use of controlled
terminologies and consistently defined metadata support semantic interoperability.” 7
The unambiguous and consistent representation of laboratory tests is essential for achieving
many of the potential benefits of electronic health records. Semantic interoperability is essential
for developing decision support algorithms that can access and seamlessly aggregate data from
multiple systems. For instance, in the context of infectious diseases, semantically interoperable
EHR systems can allow for more efficient tracking of outbreaks or significant public health

threats by providing access to evaluable real-time IVD test information from multiple geographic
locations. Consistent representation also allows EHR databases to be used to study diagnostic
assays without having to adjust for different coding schemes at individual sites. Examples of
studies using EHR databases might include post marketing studies that address the need for rapid
nucleic acid assays to be routinely followed by conventional confirmatory methods, or studies
that assess IVD performance in different clinical environments. Potential analysis of
standardized data holds great promise for providing access to real-world evidence that may be
useful for future regulatory actions. Unambiguous and consistent representation of IVD tests in
EHRs can also minimize potential errors as information is transmitted across systems (for
example, by ensuring that the correct units for test results are always maintained), helping to
minimize patient risks as systems become increasingly interconnected.
Semantic interoperability should be considered as a specific application of general
interoperability. FDA’s support of the adoption of a uniform LOINC coding system for IVD tests
is consistent with other FDA efforts in promoting aspects of medical device interoperability.8

III. Scope
As FDA seeks to encourage consistency in the coding of IVD tests, this guidance addresses
questions regarding the distribution of LOINC codes by IVD test manufacturers to users,
primarily clinical laboratories and software vendors. This guidance is restricted to the
appropriate use of LOINC codes for specific types of IVD tests, and does not address the coding
of test results for interoperability, for example, through the use of response sets within coding
systems such as SNOMED-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine – Clinical Terms) or
LOINC. It also does not address unique device identification (UDI), which identifies individual
devices as required by statute and regulation.9

IV. LOINC Coding of IVDs
A. Is LOINC-coding mandated by FDA for IVD tests?
No. LOINC, or any similar coding system for IVD tests, is voluntary and not required by FDA.10
FDA, however, strongly encourages the use of consensus standards for coding of IVD tests and
specifically recognizes the utility of LOINC for this purpose.11

B. Should manufacturers include LOINC codes in device
labeling?
FDA supports the voluntary inclusion of LOINC codes for IVD tests in labeling if the
information is accurate and consistent with the approved or cleared indications for the device.
FDA does not intend to perform premarket review of LOINC codes that manufacturers may
choose to provide to clinical laboratories or to other users. However, device labeling remains
generally subject to other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including
misbranding and adulteration.
Manufacturers may choose to include LOINC codes in printed labeling or to include a reference
to a location external to the labeling that lists or otherwise provides LOINC codes for the IVD
test. For example, labeling could include a hyperlink to a web site with a table of LOINC codes
associated with the manufacturer’s test(s). LOINC codes incorporated directly into devices – for
example, LOINC codes included with device output that is directly transferred to an external
system such as an LIS – may be subject to quality system requirements applicable to the device.

C. What are FDA’s views on manufacturers providing LOINC
codes for uncleared or unapproved indications for use?
In general, LOINC codes provided by the manufacturer should be consistent with FDA-cleared
or FDA-approved Indications for Use for that IVD test. A manufacturer’s dissemination,
through, for example, inclusion in printed labeling or on manufacturer website, of a LOINC code
that suggests an unapproved or uncleared indication for use may be considered evidence of a
new intended use and result in the device being considered adulterated and/or misbranded under
the FD&C Act.12
However, FDA understands that a clinical laboratory or other persons may make individual,
unsolicited requests to manufacturers for LOINC codes for specific uncleared or unapproved
indications for use. In that event, where the manufacturer’s response provides the appropriate
LOINC coding for the specific circumstance named in the request or identifies the need for a
new LOINC code to address the clinical use referenced in the request, FDA does not intend to
consider that response as evidence of the firm’s intent that the product be used for unapproved or
uncleared uses.13

360e). See also FDA’s guidance for industry Drug and Device Manufacturer Communications with Payors

final, this guidance will represent FDA’s current thinking on this topic.

This guidance does not alter the requirements for when IVD tests are required to submit a new
premarket notification submission (510(k)) or new Premarket Approval Application (PMA).
Additionally, this guidance does not affect requirements applicable to clinical laboratories under
other statutes or regulations currently in place.

D. Does FDA recommend a specific format for distributing
LOINC codes?
No. There is no specific FDA recommended format for distributing LOINC codes. FDA
acknowledges that LOINC codes may be displayed as simple text in a table format, or in
structured formats such as Java Script Object Notation (JSON) or Extensible Markup Language
(XML).
However, FDA strongly encourages the use of an FDA-recognized consensus standard as the
mechanism to communicate or disseminate the LOINC codes provided by manufacturers or
others (for example, the Regenstrief Institute), to laboratories or other end users. The LOINC
transmission document for IVDs (LIVD) standard is one communication standard explicitly
developed for this purpose by the IVD Industry Connectivity Consortium.14 Standardized
formats can facilitate a laboratory’s ability to adopt new LOINC codes, incorporate updates or
changes to existing LOINC codes, and maintain a database of LOINC codes applicable for local
use. FDA recommends that manufacturers follow developments in this area as standards for
electronically transmitting recommended LOINC codes are modified or expanded, or as new
standards emerge, as these may further contribute to greater semantic interoperability within and
across laboratories.
