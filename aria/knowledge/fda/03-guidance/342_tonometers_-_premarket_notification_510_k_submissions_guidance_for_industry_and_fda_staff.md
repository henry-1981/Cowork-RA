Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Tonometers - Premarket Notification [510(k)]
Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket notification
submissions for contact and non-contact tonometers. The device is intended for measuring
intraocular pressure (IOP).

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered the
burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues we
have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the "A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues" document. It is available
on our Center web page at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type should conform to the general
controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), including the premarket
notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a substantial
equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also 21 CFR 807.81 and
807.87.)
This guidance document identifies the classification regulation and product codes for tonometers
(refer to Section 4. Scope). In addition, other sections of this guidance document provide
additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks related to these devices in premarket
notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements of
a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and "How to
Prepare a 510(k) Submission" on FDA Device Advice at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial
Equivalence in Premarket Notifications; Final Guidance,”
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html, a manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or
has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an
Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing
that device. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices may
lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA may consider the
contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the meaning of 21 CFR
807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary report. The report should
describe how this guidance document was used during the device development and testing and
should briefly describe the methods or tests used and a summary of the test data or description of
the acceptance criteria applied to address the risks identified in this document, as well as any
additional risks specific to your device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the
requirements of section 807.87 as well as some other items that we recommend you include in an
Abbreviated 510(k).

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A. Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and cite
the title of this guidance document.

B. Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Please refer to Section 12. Labeling for specific information that
should be included in the labeling for devices of the type covered by this guidance document.)

C. Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the performance specifications and, when appropriate,
include detailed, labeled drawings of the device. Please refer to Section 5. Device
Description for specific information that we recommend you include in the device
description for devices of the type covered by this guidance document. You should also
submit an “indications for use” enclosure. 1
Description of device design
We recommend that you include a brief description of the device design requirements.
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess the risk
profile, in general, as well as the specific device’s design and the results of this analysis.
Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health for the risks to health generally associated with
the use of this device that FDA has identified.
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks identified
in this guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in your risk analysis.
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have used or
intend to use to address each performance aspect identified in Sections 7-11 of this
guidance document. If you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the method
rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method
1

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.

but should provide sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for the
modification. For each test, you may either (1) briefly present the data resulting from the
test in clear and concise form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that
you will apply to your test results. 2 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design
Controls for the Quality System Regulation.)
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or testing,
you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

declaration of conformity to the standard. 3

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe you cannot
properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the testing the
standard describes. For more information, please refer to section 514(c)(1)(B) of the Act
and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence Determinations;
Final Guidance for Industry and FDA. 4
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks identified
through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of the device’s
performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we need it to assess
the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we may request any
additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding substantial
equivalence.)
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k) that
provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in this
guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods, data, acceptance criteria, and
conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices should
consider submitting Special 510(k)s.

2

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the subject
device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being introduced into
interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance criteria and, thus, differs
from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends that submitters apply the same
criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to
determine whether marketing of the finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

The following is a specific discussion of how you should apply this guidance document to a
premarket notification submission for a tonometer.

4.

Scope

The scope of this guidance document is limited to the device described below, 21 CFR 886.1930,
product codes, HKY (Tonometer, Manual) and HKX (Tonometer, AC-Powered).
§ 21 CFR 886.1930 Tonometer and accessories.
A tonometer and accessories is a manual device intended to measure intraocular pressure by
applying a known force on the globe of the eye and measuring the amount of indentation
(Schiotz type) or to measure intraocular tension by applanation (applying a small flat disk to
the cornea). Accessories for the device may include a tonometer calibrator or a tonograph
recording system. The device is intended for use in the diagnosis of glaucoma.
The generic type device includes other types of contact tonometers (e.g., strain gauge), as well as
non-contact (i.e., air-puff) tonometers. It also encompasses tonometers that adjust IOP based on
other ocular parameters. These technologies are within the scope of this guidance.

5.

Bench Testing

For all tonometers, we recommend that you provide accuracy and repeatability results for your
device that span the nominal range of pressures your device is intended to measure. This testing
may be an element of a clinical study; or it may be accomplished through use of pressurecontrolled model, ex vivo animal, or human (eye bank) eyes.
For any method used, we recommend that you describe its strengths and limitations. We also
recommend that you validate your baseline IOP during testing and verify that the act of repeated
measurements does not significantly influence IOP.

A.

Accuracy

If you use pressure-controlled eyes (i.e., model, animal, or eye bank eyes) in your accuracy
studies, we recommend that you conduct testing at the lower limit of the nominal pressure
measurement range and every multiple of 10 mmHg, up to the upper limit. For a device with
a nominal range of 5 to 45 mmHg, for example, we recommend that you test at 5, 10, 20, 30,
40, and 45 mmHg.

B.

Repeatability

We recommend that you conduct testing on a set of 3 (or more) eyes for each pressure value,
with 10 measurements (i.e., normal clinical outputs) per eye. Each eye should only be used at
one pressure.
We recommend that for each eye at each reference pressure, you report the mean measured
IOP, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation. Additionally, we recommend that you

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
report the overall accuracy and repeatability at each pressure as the average of the 3 (or more)
mean measured IOP values and the average of the 3 (or more) coefficients of variation at that
pressure.

C.

Additional Device Features

If the device contains any feature that adjusts the measured IOP based on other ocular
parameters (e.g., corneal thickness or mechanical properties), we also recommend that you
provide performance results to validate each feature.

D.

Devices Containing Software

If your device contains software, we recommend you provide the information appropriate to
the “level of concern” for your device, as described in Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. 5

8.

Clinical Performance (non-Goldmann-type Tonometers only)
A.

Non-Goldmann-type Tonometers

In addition to the bench testing described above, for all non-Goldmann-type tonometers, we
recommend that you compare your device with a calibrated Goldmann-type applanation
tonometer in a statistically significant representative sample of human subject’s eyes.
1. Data Collection
We recommend that you follow the data collection aspects of the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) tonometer standard Z80.10-2003 or equivalent method.
2. Calibration
We recommend that you describe the calibration method and provide calibration results
for the reference Goldmann-type tonometer.
3. Sample Size
We recommend a sample size of 150 eyes, distributed according to the ANSI Z80.10-2003
standard. However, we will consider an alternative sample size, if supported by a valid
sample size estimate.

See https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/ucm089593.pdf.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
4. Testing Protocol
We recommend that your testing protocol follow Annex A.3 and Annex B, of ANSI
Z80.10-2003 or equivalent method. If you use a different protocol, we recommend you
provide a complete description. However, if you followed any portions of ANSI Z80.102003, we recommend you indicate which ones.
5. Analysis of Results
We recommend that you analyze your results as described below.
a. Scatter Plot of Measured IOP Values
We recommend that you submit a scatter plot showing the IOP values measured by
your tonometer on the y-axis versus the Goldmann type tonometer on the x-axis. We
also recommend that you submit a linear regression of the scatter plot data, showing
the resulting line, its equation, and the correlation coefficient.
b. Bland-Altman type plot
We recommend that you submit a Bland-Altman type plot showing the paired
differences between the reference Goldmann-type tonometer and your tonometer
readings (y-axis) versus the mean of the Goldmann-type tonometer and your
tonometer readings (x-axis).
We also recommend that you provide the mean and standard deviation of the paired
differences, and show the mean and two standard deviations around it as horizontal
lines on the plot. If you make multiple measurements on the same eye with either the
Goldmann-type or your tonometer, we recommend that you use the mean of the
normal clinical outputs of the tonometer in your analysis.
c. Comparability to a Goldmann-type Tonometer
We recommend that you tabulate the number and percent of paired differences, i.e.,
[reference tonometer measurement] – [your device measurement] that exceed the
tolerance for each pressure range as described in ANSI Z80.10-2003 or equivalent
method.
To show comparability to the Goldmann-type tonometer, no more than 5% of the
paired differences should exceed the tolerance for each pressure range. If more than
5% of paired differences in your study exceed the tolerance, we recommend that you
explain these results and provide a scientifically sound rationale for the equivalence of
your device.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA believes the devices addressed by this guidance document is a non-significant risk
device, therefore the study is subject to the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b). 6
In addition to the requirements of section 21 CFR 812.2(b), sponsors of such trials must
comply with the regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR Part 56) and
informed consent (21 CFR Part 50).

9.

Validation of Cleaning and Sterilization Methods

For single use devices that are provided sterile, the device should be sterile with a sterility
assurance level (SAL) of 1 x 10-6 using a sterilization cycle validated in accordance with the
Quality System Regulation (QSR) (21 CFR Part 820). We also recommend you provide the
sterilization information described in the guidance entitled, Updated 510(k) Sterility Review
Guidance K90-1. 7
For tip covers, we recommend high-level disinfection or sterilization before use.
If the device is reusable, we recommend that you identify the method that you used to validate the
cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of your device. (See also Section 12. Labeling.)

10. Biocompatibility
We recommend that you evaluate the biocompatibility of the patient-contacting materials as
described in the International Standard Organization (ISO) standard ISO-10993, "Biological
Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing, 8 for limited contact with intact
corneas. If identical materials and identical material processing are used in a predicate device
with the same type and duration of patient contact, you may identify the predicate device in lieu
of performing biocompatibility testing. We also recommend that you provide a list of the patientcontacting materials in your device.

11. Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility
We recommend that you address the electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility of your
device by following both standards below or equivalent method.
•

International Electrotechnical Committee (IEC) standard IEC 60601-1, Medical Electrical
Equipment Part 1: General Requirements for Safety

12. Labeling
The premarket notification should include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements
of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you in preparing labeling
that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 9
As a prescription device, under 21 CFR 801.109, the device is exempt from having adequate
directions for lay use. Nevertheless, we recommend providing clear and concise instructions that
delineate the technological features of the specific device and how the device is to be used on
patients. Instructions should encourage local institutional training programs designed to
familiarize users with the features of the device and how to use it in a safe and effective manner.
Labeling should include the indications for use of your device, for example:
A tonometer is indicated for measuring intraocular pressure to aid in the screening and
diagnosis of glaucoma.
Labeling should contain a summary of all performance testing of the device as outlined in
Sections 7 and 8, including accuracy and repeatability statistics and, if applicable, comparability
testing to a Goldmann-type reference tonometer. Additionally, we recommend that you include in
the labeling any relevant references that describe the scientific basis for any features that adjust
measured IOP.
Labeling should list separately single use, disposable, and reusable parts.
If the end user is to sterilize any parts, we also recommend that your labeling include instructions
for cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization based on the validation process described in your
submission. Sterilization instructions should be sufficient to achieve a sterility assurance level
(SAL) of 1 x 10-6.

9

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with the
requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate commerce.
In addition, final labeling for prescription medical devices must comply with 21 CFR 801.109.
Labeling recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements of Part 801.
