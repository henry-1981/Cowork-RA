PREMARKET NOTIFICATION [510(K)] SUBMISSIONS FOR 
TESTING FOR SKIN SENSITIZATION TO CHEMICALS IN 
NATURAL RUBBER PRODUCTS 
GUIDANCE DOCUMENT 
A. PURPOSE 
This document is intended to provide to manufacturers and FDA 
personnel, guidance for the preparation and evaluation of 
510(k) submissions of natural rubber (NR) medical devices with 
labeling claims for: 
(a) reduced potential for sensitizing users to rubber 
chemical additives, 
or; 
(b) reduced potential for causing reaction in individuals 
sensitized to rubber chemical additives. 
In addition, this document describes testing recommended to 
support these claims. 
B. BACKGROUND 
The increased use of natural rubber (NR) medical gloves and 
other NR containing medical devices, which coincided with the 
emergence of HIV infection, resulted in the increased 
prevalence and intensity of adverse reactions to NR. There are 
three distinctive types of adverse reactions to NR that differ 
in their mechanisms of induction and resulting clinical 
manifestations. These reactions include irritation, delayed 
hypersensitivity (Type IV allergy) and immediate 
hypersensitivity (Type I allergy). The major distinctions 
between the three types are: a) irritation is a nonimmunologic 
response with symptoms described as irritant contact 
dermatitis; b) Type IV allergy is a cell-mediated 
immunological reaction resulting in allergic contact 
dermatitis that develops 1 to 4 days after the exposure; and 
c) Type I allergy is an antibody-mediated reaction occurring 
immediately, usually within minutes after the exposure. While 
clinical manifestations of irritation and Type IV allergy are 
limited to skin reactions, clinical symptoms of Type I 
allergic reactions may range in severity from local skin 
reactions, defined as contact urticaria, to life-threatening 
anaphylactic reactions. Irritation can be induced by water, 
powder and chemicals, while Type IV allergy is predominantly 
3 


induced by the residual chemical additives (thiazoles, 
thiurams and carbamates) on the finished NR containing medical 
devices. Type I allergy is primarily caused by NR proteins 
remaining on the finished products. Although the term Type IV 
allergy is synonymous to Type IV hypersensitivity, the term 
Type IV allergy will be used in this document. Both Type I and 
Type IV allergic reactions to NR containing medical devices 
represent serious problems as the exposure of sensitized 
individuals to natural rubber medical devices may be life-
threatening (Type I) or career-threatening (Type I and IV). 
Although Type I allergy is presently an issue of major concern 
due to an increase in prevalence and severity of the reactions 
in the past few years, Type I allergy is not the subject of 
this document. This guidance document is focused only on Type 
IV allergy to residual chemicals (predominantly thiazoles, 
thiurams and carbamates) on the finished NR containing medical 
devices. It is important, however, for users of this 
document, when selecting the human test subject panel, to 
consider the possibility that some of the healthy test 
subjects and some of the individuals demonstrating Type IV 
allergy may also have Type I allergy. Irritation reaction, a 
nonimmunolgical response, is also not a subject of this 
document (Section E.2.1.). 
Allergy to chemical additives in NR containing medical devices 
has been known for a long time. Efforts have been made by 
industry to alleviate the problem by manufacturing products 
with reduced levels of chemical additives which are known to 
have sensitizing potential. In the past, the label 
"hypoallergenic" was sometimes applied to distinguish such 
products from the rest of the marketed products. However, 
with the apparent recent increase in the prevalence and 
severity of Type I allergy to NR proteins, the term 
“hypoallergenic” has been frequently misinterpreted as being 
related to protein allergy. Such devices, despite being 
labeled hypoallergenic, can cause allergic reactions in 
individuals sensitized to NR proteins and should not be used 
by such individuals. FDA published in the Federal Register 
(FR, Vol.62, No. 189, September 30, 1997, pages 51021-51030, 
“Natural Rubber-Containing Devices; User Labeling”) a rule 
prohibiting the label claim of “hypoallergenic" on NR 
containing medical devices. This rule became effective on 
September 30, 1998. 
4 


 
  
   
     
 
           
     
The manufacturers of NR containing medical devices can utilize 
this guidance document to address the labeling options 
presented below regarding Type IV allergy and to conduct 
appropriate testing to support these claims: a) reduced 
potential for sensitizing users to rubber chemical additives; 
and b) reduced potential for causing reaction in individuals 
sensitized to specific rubber chemical additives. 
C. CLAIMS AND TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS 
Firms wishing to make a claim regarding the reduced potential 
of chemical sensitization or reduced reaction-inducing 
potential of their products in allergic individuals should 
submit to FDA the recommended biocompatibility test data for 
each NR containing medical device as described in the FDA 
manual “Guidance for Medical Gloves: A Workshop Manual” (FDA 
96-4257). These tests include skin irritation and dermal 
sensitization studies in animals. In addition to these basic 
biological tests, this guidance document should be followed to 
support the following claims: 
Claim 1: 
Low Dermatitis Potential 
This product demonstrated reduced potential for 
sensitizing users to chemical additives. 
Warning: Do not use this product if you have a known 
allergy to natural rubber protein or chemical additives. 
Supporting Test Data:
 A negative skin sensitization test (Modified Draize-95 Test) 
on a minimum of 200 nonsensitized human subjects, as described 
in Section E. 
Claim 2:
 Low Thiuram, and/or Carbamate, and/or Thiazole 
This product demonstrated reduced potential for causing 
reaction in individuals sensitized to (name of chemical) 
Warning: Do not use this product if you have a known
 natural rubber protein allergy. 
5 


  
        
 
 
Supporting Test Data: 
a) 
A negative Modified Draize-95 test as recommended for 
claim 1 above; 
b) 
A negative patch test on 25 individuals who are allergic 
to the defined major chemical sensitizers present in 
natural rubber products as described in Section F below. 
D. ADDITIONAL REGULATORY INFORMATION REGARDING CLAIMS 
1. The NR containing medical devices labeled 
“hypoallergenic” which are presently on the market may, 
upon removal of that claim from all labeling, remain on 
the market without the need to supply additional 
documentation to the FDA. 
2. Manufacturers who intend to use labeling claim 1 to 
market a NR containing medical devices, previously 
labeled “hypoallergenic”, do not need to submit a new 
510(k) if they have the supporting test data described 
in this guidance. However, the test data described for 
claim 1 should be in compliance with this guidance 
document and kept on file to support the claim. 
3. Manufacturers who intend to use claim 2 to market a NR 
containing medical devices, previously labeled 
“hypoallergenic”, in addition to the requirements for 
claim 1, would have to submit a 510(k) with completed 
testing on the 25 sensitized subjects. 
4. For new NR containing medical devices intended to bear 
the claims described in this document, a 510(k) should 
be submitted with data from testing described in this 
guidance document. 
A list of testing laboratories equipped to perform the 
Modified Draize-95 test on normal subjects is available 
through the Office of Health and Industry Programs, 
Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) by 
telephone at #1-800-638-2041 or DSMA FAX ON DEMAND at 
#1-800-899-0381. A partial list of physicians and groups 
with access to sensitized individuals and equipped to 
perform testing on sensitized subjects can also be obtained 
from DSMA.

E. MODIFIED DRAIZE-95 TEST 
The purpose of this test is to evaluate whether residual 
chemical additives at the level that may induce Type IV 
allergy in the unsensitized general user population are 
present in a finished natural rubber (NR) containing medical 
device. 
The original sensitization test was developed by 
John Draize for use with rabbits and later adopted for skin 
testing in humans. For the purpose of this guidance document, 
the Modified Draize-95 Test includes additional changes that 
specifically evaluate the sensitization potential of chemical 
compounds in finished NR containing medical devices. These 
changes were based on the existing data, past experience and 
recent knowledge from published literature. This test should 
be used for claim 1 and for initial testing to support claim 
2. 
E.1. Test Subjects: 
The test should be completed on a minimum of 200 nonsensitized 
adult human subjects. This sample size, with all negative 
results, provides 95% confidence that the chemical 
sensitization potential of the NR containing medical device in 
the user population is expected to be less than 1.5%. 
The criteria for selection of the test subjects should be as 
follows: 
E.1.1. Inclusion 
a. 
The test subjects should be normal volunteers who have 
documented informed consent and have not participated in 
other voluntary testing for at least 30 days. 
b. 
Efforts should be made to provide racial and sex 
diversity of the test subjects that reasonably reflects 
the general user population in the U.S. 
c. 
Age of the test subjects should range from 18 to 65 
years. 
7 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
E.1.2. Exclusion 
a. 
Potential test subjects with any visible skin disease 
that might be confused with skin reactions caused by the 
test material. 
b. 
Potential test subjects with any knowledge or indication 
of existing Type IV allergy to natural rubber chemical 
additives. 
c. 
Potential test subjects with any indication of existing 
Type I allergy to natural rubber proteins. 
d. 
Potential test subjects with a history of frequent 
irritation. 
e. 
Potential test subjects who have used corticosteroids 
either systemically or topically on the potential test 
site two weeks before testing. 
f. 
Potential test subjects who have received endogenous or 
exogenous immunosuppressive treatment (or prolonged 
exposure to sun). 
g. 
Potential subjects who are pregnant or become pregnant 
during the study. 
h. 
All lactating women. 
E.2. Procedure: 
E.2.1. Induction Phase - A sample of the test article, 
minimum size 2cmx2cm, should be applied to each test 
subject in the study. The patch should be applied to 
upper back area and continuously secured on the 
edges with a nonreactive adhesive tape. 
Complete 
occlusion of the patch is essential. 
The induction phase of the test includes application 
of ten patches of the test article on each Monday, 
Wednesday, and Friday. The test article is removed 
and replaced by a new one at the same site every 48 
hours for a total of ten changes. The patches 
applied on Fridays are removed on Mondays. 
Any and all skin reactions should be recorded during 
this induction phase. If a reaction to an initial 
8 


 
 
 
induction test patch is observed, the subject should 
be considered a presensitized individual. A 
reaction observed after placement of the second 
patch in the induction phase is generally considered 
an irritation. In each of these cases, the 
procedure described in section E.2.5. would apply. 
If a local irritation caused by the occlusion 
material occurs, occlusion tape should be replaced 
with the non-irritating one, and the induction 
patching could be continued. 
E.2.2. Rest Period - At the end of the induction period, 
the test article is removed. No test articles are 
to be applied to the test subjects for the next 
three weeks, until the challenge patches are 
applied. 
E.2.3. Challenge Phase - Two samples of the same test 
article, a minimum 2cm X 2cm in size are applied 
consecutively to a virgin site for 48 hours each. 
The test site is evaluated for reaction at the time 
of each patch removal and again two to four days 
after removal of the second patch. 
E.2.4. Scoring Criteria - The intensity of reactions 
should be scored according to the following 
criteria: 
Basic Score: 
Description: 
0 
-
No visible reaction 
0.5 -
Doubtful or negligible erythema reaction 
1.0 -
Mild or just perceptible macular erythema 
reaction in a speckled/follicular, patchy 
or confluent pattern (slight pinking) 
2.0 -
Moderate erythema reaction in a confluent 
pattern (definite redness) 
3.0 -
Strong or brisk erythema reaction that may 
spread beyond the test site 
9 


Supplemental scores: 
Description: 
Label: 
0.5 
Edema 
E 
0.5 
Papules 
P 
0.5 
Vesicles 
V 
0.5 
Bullae 
B 
The supplemental scores may be added to the basic 
score, if the reactions include described symptoms. 
The final score should be the sum of basic and 
supplemental score values. 
E.2.5. General - With any NR containing medical devices 
evaluated according to this guidance document, the 
surface of the device that the user is mostly 
exposed to should be tested.
 In the case of medical gloves, the inside of the 
glove should be tested. The study should be 
conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a 
population of 50 human subjects may be tested to 
evaluate product for the potential to cause 
irritation or sensitization. If the test product 
does not indicate a potential for inducing dermal 
irritation and does not show sensitization 
capability, the second stage can be initiated on the 
remaining 150 individuals.
 During the induction phase of the study, if a 
subject develops a positive reaction(a score value 
of 1.5) to chemicals or shows signs of irritation 
after patch applications, further patching on those 
individuals should be stopped. After 3 weeks of 
rest, these individuals should receive a challenge 
patch to confirm observed reaction as either 
preexisting sensitivity or irritant reaction. All 
such cases should be recorded and reported in 
addition to the 200 subjects in the test panel 
group. 
E.3. Data Presentation: 
A detailed study report should be kept on file and/or 
submitted in a 510(k), which should include at a minimum such 
items as study protocol, test subject selection, scoring 
criteria, test results, and interpretation of results. In 
order to qualify for the claim of a reduced sensitization 
potential, all 200 individuals completing the study should 
10 


 
   
exhibit a score value of no more than 1.5 based on the scoring 
criteria described in section E.2.4. of this document. The 
individuals who were identified as either presensitized to 
natural rubber chemicals or presenting irritant reactions, 
would be excluded from the statistical evaluation. However, 
the data from each such case should be recorded and reported 
in addition to the data for the 200 nonsensitized test 
individuals completing the test. 
F. PATCH TEST ON SENSITIZED INDIVIDUALS 
The purpose of this test is to determine whether a finished 
natural rubber containing medical device contains residual 
chemicals which might cause a skin reaction in individuals who 
are already allergic to one or more of the following classes 
of chemicals: thiazoles, thiurams and carbamates. These test 
data combined with the data from the Modified Draize-95 test 
described for claim 1, should be completed to support claim 2. 
The test subjects with a prediagnosed allergy of a 
minimum grade of 1.5 according to the standard scoring of 
the North American Contact Dermatitis Research Group 
(NACDRG) (“Am. J. Contact Dermatitis” 2:122-129,1991) 
should be selected for this study. The diagnostic test 
determining the sensitivity level of the test subjects 
should be completed one month prior to the date that the 
subject is being included in this study. 
F.1. Test Subjects: 
The study should include a minimum of 25 individuals who were 
positively diagnosed to be allergic to one or more of the 
above classes of chemical sensitizers in NR containing medical 
devices. This sample size, with all negative results, 
provides 95% confidence that chemicals on the tested natural 
rubber medical products would be expected to cause reactions 
in less than 11.3% of sensitized individuals. 
The criteria for selection of the test subjects should be as 
follows: 
F.1.1. Inclusion 
a. 
Individuals who have a prediagnosed allergy to NR 
chemicals of a minimum of 1+ reaction according to the 
NACDRG standard. 
11 


 
 
  
 
 
 
b. 
The test subjects with documented informed consent. 
c. 
Efforts should be made to provide racial and sex 
diversity of the test subjects that reasonably reflects 
the general user population in the U.S. 
d. 
Age of the test subjects should range from 18 to 65 
years. 
F.1.2 Exclusion 
a. 
The test subjects with any visible skin disease that 
might be confused with skin reactions caused by the 
test material. 
b. 
The test subjects with any indication of existing Type I 
allergy to natural rubber proteins. 
c. 
The test subjects who have used corticosteroids either 
systemically or topically on the potential test site two 
weeks before testing. 
d. 
Test subjects who have received endogenous or exogenous 
immunosuppressive treatment(or prolonged sun exposure). 
e. 
All subjects who are pregnant or become pregnant during 
the study. 
f. 
All lactating women. 
F.2. Test Procedure: 
A minimum 2cm x 2cm sample of the test article is applied to 
each of the 25 human subjects who were previously diagnosed to 
be allergic to one or more of the three classes of known 
chemical sensitizer(s) in NR containing medical devices; 
thiurams, carbamates and thiazoles. 
In this test procedure the patch is applied with all edges 
continuously secured with non-reactive adhesive tape for 48 
hours. Complete occlusion of the patch is essential. If the 
test article causes discomfort to the individual, it should be 
removed earlier. The test sites are evaluated at the time of 
the patch removal and again two to four days later. 
12 


F.3. Data Presentation: 
A detailed study report should be submitted in a 510(k), which 
at a minimum should include such items as study protocol, test 
subject selection, scoring criteria, test results, and 
interpretation of results. The sensitivity level score for 
each allergic subject before involvement in the testing should 
be recorded and reported with the test results. In case of 
allergy to more than one chemical, the score should be 
reported for each chemical. All tested individuals in this 
group should present negative results (a score of less than 
1.0 based on the scoring criteria in section E.2.4. of this 
document) as a prerequisite for the claim of reduced reaction-
inducing potential. 
G. INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE REQUIREMENTS: 
This guidance document applies to the NR containing medical 
devices which have gone through additional manufacturing 
processes to reduce levels of residual chemical additives, and 
which have shown negative results in the irritation and dermal 
sensitization studies in animals. Therefore, the level of 
risk to the nonsensitized subject during a skin patch test 
would be considered nonsignificant risk. In addition, the 
studies performed on sensitized subjects with a patch test of 
NR containing medical devices should be nonsignificant risk 
studies because the products should, as a prerequisite, have 
passed the Modified Draize-95 test. 
A nonsignificant risk device study, under IDE regulations (CFR 
812), requires an institutional review board approval and 
affords the patient informed consent. Studies conducted in 
foreign countries are not subject to the IDE regulations, 
although FDA recommends that they be conducted according to 
the IDE provisions. 
At a minimum, they need to be conducted 
in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
