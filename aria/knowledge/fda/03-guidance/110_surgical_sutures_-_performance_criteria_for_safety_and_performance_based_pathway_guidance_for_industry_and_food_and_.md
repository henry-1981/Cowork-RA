Surgical Sutures – Performance
Criteria for Safety and Performance
Based Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for surgical sutures in support of the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway.1 Under this framework, submitters (you) planning to submit a
510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for surgical sutures will have the option
to use the performance criteria provided in this guidance to support substantial equivalence,
rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate
device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA
guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices.3
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because the Agency has
determined that prior public participation is not feasible or appropriate (section 701(h)(1)(C)(i)
of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document
presents a less burdensome policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document

is being implemented immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the
Agency’s good guidance practices.
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind
the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway4 – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter
could demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate
that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the
specific set of performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an
appropriate predicate for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria
represent performance that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed
devices of that device type. Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA
staff, information in literature, and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed
surgical sutures to determine the performance criteria and associated testing methods that could
support a finding of substantial equivalence for surgical sutures as described in this guidance.
FDA recognizes that in some cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct
testing against an appropriate predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set
of performance and technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets
appropriate performance criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the
optional device-specific Safety and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance
criteria identified in this guidance provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public
health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The surgical sutures that are the subject of this guidance are absorbable and nonabsorbable
sutures under the following regulations and product codes outlined in Table 1. These devices are
Class II and are intended for the approximation and/or ligation of soft tissue.

Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k))
Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile.6
Some of the recommendations in this safety and performance guidance may assist in complying
with some of the special controls for surgical sutures. For information regarding the special
controls for surgical sutures, see “Surgical Sutures - Class II Special Controls Guidance
Document for Industry and FDA Staff.”7
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission8 to engage in discussion with
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k).

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing

against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) recommended below for each test or
evaluation below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k)
submissions under the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review
underlying data demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria
and testing methodology, as necessary. We recommend that all surgical sutures conform to the
monographs and sections of the currently FDA-recognized edition of the USP, as identified
below. Additionally, we recommend that you conduct all testing on the sterilized suture in
finished form (e.g., needled, in reels) as per the Monograph for Nonabsorbable Sutures or as per
the Monograph for Absorbable Sutures. Unless otherwise identified in the sections below, test
information such as results summary, test protocols, and complete test reports should be
submitted as part of the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based
Pathway. For additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing
information, refer to FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench
Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.9

Sutures That Do Not Meet the Performance Criteria: If your suture does not meet
USP requirements for diameter (e.g., oversize in diameter), it may still be appropriate for
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway provided that the suture diameter is not
oversized by more than 1 USP size (i.e., the maximum diameter for a given size is not
more than the maximum individual limit on diameter for the next larger size). The
labeling should clearly state that the suture is non-USP and should identify, for each
suture size, the maximum oversize in diameter. This information can be presented as a
table that identifies the USP size, associated USP diameter range, and maximum oversize
for each proposed size.

Test name: Resorption Profile (only for absorbable surgical sutures)
Methodology: The resorption profile testing should include information to document the
device’s rate of absorption, time to complete absorption, and residual tensile strength
over time. The resorption profile should be presented in a chart, table, or graph that
illustrates the residual tensile strength of the suture for a clinically significant period of
time. The length of time considered clinically significant depends on the suture’s
intended use. We recommend that studies be performed in vivo using a model that
appropriately replicates how and where the surgical suture is intended to be used. A
significant number of sutures should be tested to demonstrate consistent tensile strength
retention of the surgical suture. Additionally, testing should include at least the largest
and smallest sizes of your suture, as well as sizes in between, skipping no more than two
size differences between sizes tested. For example, if you intend to market all suture sizes
from 7 to 7-0, we recommend that you test the sizes 7, 4, 1, 2-0, 5-0, and 7-0 for tensile
strength retention. For additional information, see the special controls document
“Surgical Sutures – Class II Special Controls Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff.”
Performance Criteria: The device has a resorption profile that is consistent with the
intended use of the device (e.g., short-term or long-term approximation of soft tissue).

Test name: Sterilization (for devices labeled as sterile)
Methodology: Current FDA-recognized version of the following consensus standards (as
applicable):
· ISO 17665-1 Sterilization of health care products – Moist heat – Part 1:
Requirements for the development, validation, and routine control of a
sterilization process for medical devices
· ISO 11135-1 Sterilization of health care products – Ethylene oxide – Part 1:
Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization
process for medical devices
· ISO 11137-1 Sterilization of health care products—Radiation—Part 1:
Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization
process for medical devices
· ISO 20857 Sterilization of health care products — Dry heat — Requirements for
the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for
medical devices
· ISO 11607-1 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1:
Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems
· ISO 11607-2 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 2:
Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes
Performance Criteria: Validation testing should demonstrate the sterility of, or the
ability to sterilize to a sterility assurance level of 10-6 for, the device.
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Performance Criteria Source: FDA’s guidance:
· Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile10
Submission Information: You should provide a description of the packaging (sterile
barrier system) and how it will maintain the device’s sterility, and a description of the
package test methods, but not package test data. With respect to the Established
Sterilization Method, whether using an Established Category A or Established Category
B sterilization method, you should provide the information in Section V.A. of the FDA
guidance Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile; generally, the validation data itself
is not needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence.
8.

Test name: Shelf Life
Methodology: Shelf life studies should evaluate the critical device properties to ensure
the device will perform adequately and consistently during the entire proposed shelf life.
You should follow performance testing methods outlined in Tests #1-7 above (as
applicable) using aged versions of the suture. Testing should be performed on at least
three (3) production lots of devices aged according to the proposed shelf life.
Performance Criteria: To demonstrate continued sterility, package integrity, and device
functionality over the labeled shelf life, the aged versions of the suture should meet the
respective performance criteria outlined in Tests #1-7 above (as applicable).
Performance Criteria Source: See performance criteria sources for Tests #1-7 above.
Additional Considerations: If you use devices subject to accelerated aging for shelf life
testing, we recommend that you specify the way in which the devices were aged. We
recommend that you age your devices as per the current FDA-recognized version of
ASTM F1980 Standard Guide for Accelerated Aging of Sterile Barrier Systems for
Medical Devices and specify the environmental parameters established to attain the
expiration date. For sutures containing polymeric materials, you should plan to conduct
testing on real-time aged samples to confirm that the accelerated aging is reflective of
real-time aging.
Submission Information: See “Submission Information” sections for Tests #1-7 above.
We recommend that you provide a summary of the test methods used for your shelf life
testing, results and the conclusions drawn from your results.

Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation,
you should use Attachment A of the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
“Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process,”11 referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. The contact type and duration for surgical sutures will depend on the

intended use. FDA considers surgical sutures to be implant devices in contact with tissue/bone,
as well as blood in some cases, for a prolonged or permanent contact duration, as described in
ISO 10993-1 and Attachment A of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. For a prolonged or
permanent contact duration suture in contact with tissue/bone, the following endpoints should be
addressed in your biocompatibility evaluation.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity
· Acute systemic toxicity
· Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity
· Subacute/Subchronic Toxicity
· Genotoxicity
· Clinically-relevant implantation
· Chronic Toxicity
· Carcinogenicity
Additional endpoints for prolonged or permanent contact duration sutures in contact with blood
include:
· Hemocompatibility
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, as
discussed in Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive,
negative, and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. As described in the FDA guidance, Safety
and Performance Based Pathway,12 if a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria
identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program; however, the previously established
510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are
conducted, including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated 510(k)s, remain available.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Methodology: Current FDA-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct tissue contacting components of the device should be
determined to have an acceptable biological response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered appropriate under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
For surgical sutures supplied with needles, you should cite conformance to an FDArecognized standard (e.g., for stainless steel) and provide a justification for why
biocompatibility testing is not needed for the needle. If you are unable to cite
conformance to a recognized standard and/or if your needle is coated, biocompatibility
testing should be conducted on the needle component in accordance with ISO 10993-1
for the appropriate contact classification – e.g., external communicating device with
limited contact duration (< 24 hours).
