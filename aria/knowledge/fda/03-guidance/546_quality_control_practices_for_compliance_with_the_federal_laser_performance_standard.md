FOREWORD

The Bureau of Radiological Health conducts a national program to limit
man's exposure to ionizing and nonionizing radiations. To this end, the Bureau
(1) develops criteria and recommends standards for safe limits of radiation
exposure, (2) develops methods and techniques for controlling radiation
exposure, (3) plans and conducts research to determine health effects of
radiation exposure, (4) provides technical assistance to agencies responsible
for radiological health control programs, and (5) conducts an electronic product
radiation control program to protect the public health and safety.

The Bureau publishes its findings in appropriate scientific journals and
technical report and note series prepared by Bureau divisions and offices.

Bureau publications provide an effective mechanism for disseminating
results of intramural and contractor projects. The publications are distributed
to State and local radiological health personnel, Bureau technical staff, Bureau
advisory committee members, information services, industry, hospitals, labora-
tories, schools, the press, and other concerned individuals. These publications
are for sale by the Government Printing Office and/or the National Technical
Information Service.

Readers are encouraged to report errors or omissions to the Bureau. Your
comments or requests for further information are also solicited.

PREFACE

The Performance Standard for Laser Products (21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11)
becomes effective August 2, 1976. Lasers and products containing lasers
manufactured on or after that date must conform to the applicable provisions
of the standard. In addition, manufacturers will be required to certify
that their products comply with the regulations and to furnish reports
to the Bureau of Radiological Health which clearly substantiate the product
compliance.

This document has been prepared in order to assist manufacturers in
developing and implementing quality -control and testing programs which
are in accordance with good manufacturing practices and which assure
compliance with the standard and adequacy of safeguards against hazardous
electronic product radiation. Because laser products may operate over a
large variety of wavelengths, emission durations, and spatial characteris-
tics, a detailed step-by-step protocol would be of very limited application.
The purpose here, therefore, is to set forth a general description of the
procedures and philosophy of quality control as appropriate for laser
products, beginning from the concept and ending after final testing of.
the product.

The guide incorporates what is considered to be good manufacturing
practice and also provides fair and standard criteria by which all
manufacturers’ programs will be evaluated. This document is intended
for use in conjunction with the "Guide for Submission of Information on
Lasers and Products Containing Lasers Pursuant to 21 CFR 1002.10 and
1002.12" (July 1976).

It should be strongly emphasized, however, that this guide does not
preclude other alternative procedures that the manufacturer may adopt
that are equivalent to, or as effective as, those methods in this document.
Each manufacturer's test procedures and testing programs will be considered
on an individual case-by-case basis. If the manufacturer has established
alternative procedures that are still within the limits of good manufacturing
practice, and that assure the adequacy of safeguards against hazardous
electronic product radiation and compliance with the standard, the Bureau
of Radiological Health would have no reason to disapprove such a program.

Neither the failure of the Bureau to disapprove a testing program,
nor the fact that such a program was established pursuant to this guide
relieves a manufacturer from his obligation to comply with the Radiation
Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 and any subsequent regulations.
Additionally, this guide should not be interpreted as a limitation of
the Food and Drug Administration's authority to disapprove a manufacturer's
testing program pursuant to 21 CFR 1010.2.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

A viable quality control program ensures the performance of a
product at a designated level throughout its useful life, and is essential

to demonstrate the compliance of a product with the Federal Performance
Standard.

This document outlines some general quality control practices to
assist manufacturers of laser products in ensuring the compliance of a
product with the Federal Performance Standard for Laser Products. As
such it should not be considered to be complete or adequate for all
cases. The adequacy of a specific quality control and testing program
must be judged solely on its own merits and applicability to the product.
The essential elements of a quality assurance program are the following:

(a) Proper organization and administrative procedures to ensure an
objective and defensible program.

(b) Preproduction evaluation and testing of the product and testing of
components and material obtained from other manufacturers.

(c) Valid measurement techniques, calibrations, and treatment of
uncertainties.

(ad) Evaluation of the product during and after production and statistical
analysis of data. The establishment of confidence limits and rejection
criteria are important components of such an evaluation.

(e) Procedures to ensure that any rejected units, if modified and
recycled back into the production sequence, undergo the same level of
scrutiny as other units that have been found acceptable.

(f) An audit procedure to randomly select completed and tested units
for retest as a check on the effectiveness of the quality control and
testing program.

(g) Life and reliability testing procedures which determine whether the
product will continue to meet its design specifications during its
useful life.

(h) An ongoing review of the product performance throughout its production
life and a procedure to ensure that any problems discovered are corrected,
and that appropriate design changes are made to eliminate them from
subsequent units produced.


2.0 ADMINISTRATION OF A QUALITY ASSURANCE PROGRAM

2-1 Objectivity of Program

The quality assurance program should be autonomous in order to be
objective. Conflicting duties of personnel can be detrimental to objective
evaluation of products. For example, the personnel responsible for
maintaining production schedules may be less inclined to reject large
numbers of unacceptable units.

2.2 Records and Uniform Procedures

The quality assurance program should be based on standardized
tests. Specific written test procedures and standardized forms for data
recording should be used. The forms should provide for logging all
information relevant to the product and the test such as the product
model and serial numbers, date of test, date of manufacture of unit,
sample lot, results of test, names of personnel performing and reviewing
the test, model and serial numbers of test instruments, a place for
calculations, and so forth.

2.3 Validity of Measurements

A valid program of measurements made as part of quality assurance
testing involves:

(a) A thorough evaluation and error analysis of the test methods and
instruments including calibration uncertainties, drifts and other instrument
performance characteristics, errors introduced by the data analysis, and

so forth.

(b) Participation in intercomparisons with other organizations performing
similar measurements, and

(c) Records of instrument calibrations. This involves a periodic
recalibration of measuring instruments against a standard and the maintainance

of control groups of test instruments to be used as controls.

2.4 Documentation

A complete written documentation of the quality assurance program
should be available. This should include the description of tests —
performed, description and evaluation of the measurement instrumentation
and techniques, the sequence in which tests are performed, detailed
uncertainty evaluations of the measurements, the rejection criteria or
confidence limits used and the justification for the particular choice
of such limits, methods of data analysis, sampling plans, etc. Ifa
sampling technique must be used, it must be scrupulously documented and
followed. Quality assurance testing of all units manufactured is urged.
Any sampling plans must be defensible under the most critical scrutiny.


2.5 Audit Procedures

Audit procedures should be developed and documented to act as a
further check on the test procedures. Random sampling is the only acceptable
method in selecting units for audit testing. The audit should be
independent of the quality assurance tests.


3.0 MEASUREMENT QUALITY ASSURANCE

3.1 Measurement Program

The credibility of all. measurements made as part of.a quality
control program is one of the-more important. considerations in evaluat-
ing that program. .It is therefore imperative that manufacturers carefully
plan their measurement facilities and techniques. . Some considerations ©
that should go into this planning are enumerated here, however, they are
not exhaustive and do not cover all parameters. Detailed planning to
assure credible measurements and proper treatment of uncertainties is
the responsibility of the manufacturer.

3.2 Instrumentation Selection

The instrumentation should be carefully specified and selected to
ensure that it has the capabilities required for a particular test.
Instruments for optical radiation measurements should have suitable
sensitivity to measure the anticipated radiation levels from the product
and acceptable linearity and temporal drift characteristics, temporal
response, environmental stability, spectral sensitivity, durability, and
noise characteristics. The degree of automation which should be considered
is based on the volume of testing and the level of training of the
operator.

3.3 Instrumentation Characterization

Once the measurement instruments have been obtained they need to be
thoroughly characterized to ensure specified performance. Character-
ization is used to develop quantitative estimates of instrument related
errors or uncertainties. Linearity of instruments for optical radiation
measurements should be confirmed over the dynamic range to be covered in
testing. Short term and long term temporal response characteristics
should be evaluated. If the instruments are to be used in an uncontrolled
environment, one should determine the temperature dependence of the
instrument response over the range of temperature at which the instrument
will actually be used. Wavelength drives and readouts should be checked
for accuracy and repeatability in instruments as applicable. Other
relevant features of the instrumentation such as frequency response,
bandwidth, and so forth should also be characterized. The characterization
of the instrumentation will yield quantitative estimates of its capabilities
and constraints. These estimates will be useful when one performs an
error analysis on the instrument to estimate the uncertainties that are
associated with the measurements. It must be noted that as a product
emission approaches the limits of the class in which it is intended to
function, measuring precision and accuracy become increasingly more
important.

3.4 Calibrations and Experimental Design

Much of the burden of credible measurements falls on the validity
of calibrations and the design of measurement procedures. Test instruments
should be calibrated against standards or reference instruments calibrated
by the National Bureau of Standards. Use of standards or reference


instruments calibrated by secondary calibration laboratories against
standards obtained from NBS may be acceptable. It is imperative, however,
that the manufacturer has valid documented estimates of the uncertainties
that are introduced at each stage of the calibration process.

Although a manufacturer has reference standards in his laboratory,
it may be useful to calibrate a set of working standards for use in the
routine quality assurance measurements. Working standards can be either
sources or detectors. The calibration of working standards should be
performed according to statistically designed scheme. Working standards
should be calibrated periodically and each calibration should consist of
a set of measurements. Working standards should be calibrated in
groups. It may also be useful to maintain a set of control samples
which are calibrated with the working standards, but not used for routine
measurements. Repeated calibrations of the control standards will provide
a check on the measurement system and should also reveal any gross
misbehaviors of the reference standard itself. Calibrations should be
done in such a manner that each working standard, reference standard
control standard has been measured several times in the same order to
yield credible measurements.

Control charts and logs of instrument performance and calibrations
are essential. Any changes in the instrument or its components, techniques,
standards, operator or other relevant components of the measurements
system should be recorded.

Another aspect of measurement assurance is the participation of the
manufacturer in intercomparisons with other laboratories making similar
measurements. The National Bureau of Standards, and other organizations
such as ASTM, conduct such measurement assurance programs in some measurement
areas. Participation would lend further credibility to the measurement
uncertainties claimed by the manufacturer.

3.5 Uncertainties

Any calibration of a standard source or detector will have an
uncertainty assigned to the measurements, relative to absolute units,
i.e., the Systeme Internationale (SI) units. Estimating this uncertainty
is not trivial and consists of several phases. For example, let us
assume that a manufacturer has a reference standard obtained from a
secondary calibration laboratory who, in turn, had calibrated this
reference standard against standards obtained from NBS. Vague and
undefined claims of "traceability to NBS" are unacceptable to the Bureau
of Radiological Health. The uncertainty which the manufacturer would
assign to his measurements would have the following components:

(a) The uncertainty with respect to SI assigned by NBS to the standard
supplied to the secondary calibration laboratory. This uncertainty is
with regard to the internationally defined unit of measurement and is
normally supplied by NBS with its calibrations. _


(b) The transfer uncertainty (see d below) assigned by the secondary
calibration laboratory in transferring the calibration to the reference
standard it supplies to the manufacturer. In addition to this, the
manufacturers should also request from the secondary laboratories the

NBS uncertainty relative to SI if the transfer uncertainty of the secondary
laboratory is presented as relative to NBS only.

(c) The transfer uncertainty assigned by the manufacturer to calibrations
of the working standards against the reference standard.

(d) The uncertainty generated in the measurement of the samples with
respect to the working standard.

With respect to (a) above, the National Bureau of Standards supplies
uncertainty statements regarding the uncertainties associated with its
calibrations with respect to SI. Each other component (b, c and d
above) of uncertainty has at least the following subcomponents: the
precision or repeatability of the measurements, systematic uncertainties
based upon experimental and/or theoretical characterization of the
instrumentation and a complete error analysis of the measurements, any
uncertainties that may be introduced in the method of data reduction or
analysis. :

Quantitative estimates of all these uncertainties should be obtained
and recorded since they are required in determining a product's compliance
with the laser product performance standard. The question then arises
as to how these uncertainties should be combined to provide defensible
estimate of the final uncertainties that can be assigned by the manufac-
turer to measurements for determination of compliance. There are several
ways in which this can be done. A simple way is to combine them linearly
and obtain an arithmetic sum of the percent uncertainties as an indication
of the maximum error in the measurements. There are more sophisticated
ways to combine uncertainties. If the various uncertainties can be shown
to be independent, one could combine them in quardratures, i.e., take
the squre root of the sum of the squares. The uncertainties which are
not independent may be combined in other ways. Details on these are
available in statistics text books that cover the combination of different
types of variances.

. Measurement assurance programs that NBS may conduct or participate
in would provide a good mechanism for achieving an estimate of uncertainties.


4.0 PRE-PRODUCTION EVALUATION

The preproduction evaluation and testing should be conducted to
include a review of the design to ensure that the design will yield a
product in compliance with the performance standard, evaluation of
critical components and material obtained from other manufacturers for
use in the product, and engineering and prototype testing and evaluation
to confirm that the product can be manufactured in compliance with the
standard.

4.1 Design Review

Before the manufacture of the product begins, the product design
must be analyzed to ensure that the finished product will comply with
the Federal Performance Standard. If the product is intended to be of a
certain class (Classes I through IV as enumerated in the laser standard),
its electrical and mechanical design should be such that the product
will be in compliance with the requirements for products in that class.
The aspects of the laser standard that must be considered in any review
of the design to include at least:

(a) The accessible emission limits of laser radiation from the product
must be less than the accessible emission limits of the lowest class
necessary for the product to perform its intended function. Be aware of
requirements for lasers emitting beams of a single wavelength, multiple
wavelengths in the same range, multiple wavelengths in different ranges,
and the dual limits for Class I products which are contained in (21 CFR
40.10(d)).

(b) The requirements (21 CFR 1040.10(f)) regarding protective housing,
safety interlocks, key actuated master control, laser emission indicator,
beam attenuator, viewing optics, location of controls and specific
requirements for products which emit scanned laser radiation should be
kept in mind during the review of product design.

(c) The design must clearly define the contents and locations of the
labels required in Sections 1010.2, 1010.3 and 1040.10(g), and their
permanence and visibility must be assured.

(d) The design must also comply with the requirements for specific
purpose laser products as applicable. Medical laser products, surveying,
leveling and alignment laser products, and demonstration laser products
must comply with 21 CFR 1040.11(a),(b), and (c), respectively.

4.2 Evaluation of Critical Components

Many components of a product affect the level of accessible laser
radiation which may be generated or emitted either by direct action or
by failure. These may be optical, electrical, or mechanical parts.
Whether such components are fabricated by the manufacturer of the laser
product or purchased from a vendor, proper evaluation is essential to


determine that the product will comply with the applicable standard

when completed. Critical components are those which affect the spatial
or spectral quality or quantity of the radiation emission from the
product or in any way affect its radiation safety characteristics. Such
components would typically include reflectors, attenuators or shutters,
warning devices, emission indicators, energy source components, interlocks
and other switches, labels, and so forth. In accordance with 21 CFR
1040.10(a), the responsibility for product compliance rests with the
manufacturer of the final product and not the supplier of components or
material except as indicated therein. The testing of all critical
components is, therefore, an important responsibility of the manufacturer.
Important aspects of evaluation of these critical components prior to
their use in the product include:

(a) Performance specifications for the critical components should be
developed taking both the requirements of the performance standard and

a tolerance analysis of the product into consideration. A tolerance
analysis is a calculation of the range of performance of a product that
can result from variations that can occur in components. Such an analysis
should, whenever possible, be experimentally validated.

(b) All critical components should be tested to verify that their
performance is within the range of specifications required for them by

the manufacturer of the final product. Many of the tests of critical
components may not be possible or feasible after these components have
been incorporated into the product. For example, switches and interlocks
may need to undergo accelerated life testing to ensure reliability;
durability and ruggedness may be appropriately tested under extreme
environmental conditions. Wherever possible, a 100 percent testing of
components is recommended. If this is not possible or feasible, sampling
procedures may be used. The sampling plan must be of demonstrable validity.

(c) If at any time the design specifications or materials of any critical
components are changed, the design of the entire product should be

reviewed to ensure that the change does not in any way affect the compliance
of the product with the performance standard.

4.3 Engineering and Prototype Testing and Evaluation

Engineering models and prototypes should be tested thoroughly and
exhaustively to assure that the product can be manufactured in compliance
with the performance standard, and that it will remain in compliance
under all forseeablie conditions during its useful life. This would
include adequate transportation tests, tests of performance under
expected and adverse environmental conditions, use and abuse testing and
accelerated life tests. A consistent effort is required to keep drawings
and prototypes up-to-date and accurate. Any design changes should be
properly documented, tested and evaluated in relation to radiation
emission and safety.


Sections 5 and 6 of this document should be consulted for more detailed

guidance on types of tests, test parameters, test conditions, and testing
procedures.


5.0 PRODUCTION TESTING

5.1 Design of the Production Quality Control and Testing Program

After a manufacturer has verified through design review and prototype
that a product can be manufactured in compliance with the performance
standard, he must design and establish a production quality control and
testing program which will ensure that each individual laser product
manufactured complies with the standard. In designing the production
quality control and testing program, it is first necessary to identify
the parameters that need to be measured or tested in order to determine
compliance with the laser performance standard. The identification and
criticality of these parameters depend to a large extent on the design,
function, and anticipated use of a specific product. Some examples of
such parameters are the accessible radiation levels, collateral radiation
level, reliability of interlocks, switches and warning indicators, the
quality of the mechanical and optical components, and the inclusion and
durability of labels. Specific tests should be designed to take into
consideration all the relevant parameters. Some such tests may be
simple inspection. For example, the product should be inspected to
determine that all labels are in the correct postions and properly
attached on the product. However, other tests, such as those involving
the power or energy measurement of the accessible laser radiation as
well as the collateral radiation, are more complicated and require
design of test methods and the use of defensible measurement instrumentation
and techniques.

Testing will be of two types: qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative
testing refers to functional tests of performance features and inspections
such as those to confirm the inclusion of labels or instructional material.
The quantitative testing refers to the measurement of variable parameters
such as the accessible emission level which can be measured. Individual
tests may be designed for each parameter. Wherever applicable, the
measurement facility for each of these tests should be subjected to the
measurement quality assurance ag detailed in Section 3 of this document.
Testing plans should be documented and the use of checklists and standardized
forms is urged for logging and analysis of data.

Sets of rejection criteria will need to be determined for the different
tests. In qualitative tests it is easy to establish these criteria
since one is faced with a "has" or "has not", or "functions" or "does
not function" type of a situation. The establishment of rejection
criteria for the quantitative tests is more involved. For example,

10


consider measurements of the accessible laser radiation from a product
intended to be a Class I product. The rejection criteria will have to
be such that even when the total measurement uncertainty (discussed in
Section 3.5) is taken into account the accessible laser radiation is
still less than the accessible emission limits for Class I products as
specified in the laser standard. If the testing is done on less than

100 percent of the production, it may be necessary to have more stringent
rejection criteria.

5.2 Qualitative Testing

Qualitative testing should be conducted on a 100 percent basis and
include checks and testing of the following:

5.2.1 The presence and secure attachment of a label certifying compliance
of the product.

5.2.2 The presence, secure attachment and proper content of the label
bearing identification of the manufacturer and place nd date of manufacture.

5.2.3 The presence, secure attachment and proper content of all hazard
warning labels including classification, aperture and removable protective
housing labels.

5.2.4 The integrity of the protective housing not only before, but most
importantly, after installation on the product. The inspection should be
directed to verify at least that there are no holes, cracks or other
paths which give access to laser or collateral radiation. Human access
as defined within the context of the standard and its preamble not only
includes direct exposure but also exposure which may become accessible
by means of insertion of a specifically defined probe. Evaluation of
the adequacy of the protective housing is to be made in view of these
criteria.

5.2.5 The presence and proper function of interlocks to ensure that:

a. they have been installed in the quantity and locations specified in
the design,

b. they operate and perform the intended function of preventing human
access to laser and collateral radiation upon removal or displacement of
the interlock protected portion of the protective housing (this should
be tested actively on each unit in order to verify not only proper
functioning of the interlock itself but also its proper integration into
the overall control logic of the system),

11


c. removal or displacement of the protected portion of the housing is
prevented upon failure of the safety interlocks to prevent human access

to laser and collateral radiation as required upon removal or displacement
of the interlocked portion of the protective housing (an active test is

in order with the interlock logic disabled or defeated), and

d. visual or aural indicators of interlock defeat will operate and
function properly

5.2.6 The presence of a remote control connector if the product is in
Class III or IV, and a functional test to verify that interruption of
the circuit connecting its terminals does in fact prevent human access
to laser and collateral radiation as required.

5.2.7 The presence and proper functioning of the required number of
emission indicators for Class II, III or IV products. Functional testing
of the indicator(s) on Class III or IV products should include measurement
of the time interval between activation of the emission indicator(s) and
initiation of the laser radiation.

5.2.8 The presence and proper functioning of the beam attenuator re-
required for Class II, III, or IV products. If the beam attenuator is
not totally opaque, the actual level of transmitted laser and collateral
radiation must be measured to verify that it is below the limits of
Class I or Table III of 1040.10(d).

5.2.9 The presence and proper functioning of the safeguard required for
scanning laser products. Functional testing should include interruption

of or a change in the scan velocity or amplitude to verify that the
safeguard operates to prevent human access to laser radiation in excess

of the limit that is applicable to the scanned radiation. If the safeguard
operates by cessation of the radiation, simple functional testing will
suffice. If, however, the safeguard operates to adjust the level of

laser radiation, measurement of the actual level of laser radiation will

be required under all conditions of scan alteration.

5.2.10 Functional testing of any shutter or variable attenuator in-
corporated in any viewing optic, viewport or display screen to include:

a. the physical presence and proper operation of the shutter or atten-
uator, and

b. the prevention of shutter opening or attenuator variation upon
failure of the means incorporated into the product to prevent human
access to transmitted laser or collateral radiation in excess of the
accessible emission limits of Class I and Table III of paragraph (d) of
section 1040.10.

12


5.2.11 The presence and proper functioning of the means incorporated

into the product to measure the level of laser radiation of medical

laser products of Class III or Class IV, intended for irradiation of the
human body. The calibration of this means shall be determined by measure-
ment of laser radiation under Section 5.3.5,

5.3 Quantitative Testing

Quantitative testing includes the following types of tests:

5.3.1 Measurement of the maximum accessible levels of all laser radi-
iations for the purpose of determination and verification of the classi-
fication of the product as well as maximum output. The precision and
accuracy of the measurements must be such to assure that the product
cannot be operated to emit laser radiation levels higher than the maximum
accessible emission limit of that class which is used to determine the
required performance features and labeling of the product. Therefore, as
a product can be operated at a level approaching the limit of its class,
measurement error and uncertainties become increasingly critical. Note
that measurements for classification are to be made with all controls

and adjustments listed in the operation, maintenance and service in-
structions adjusted to maximize the emission of radiation during operation.

Except for demonstration laser products and surveying, leveling,
and alignment laser products for which the standard specifies maximum
emission levels, failure of the measurements to assure that the product
Cannot exceed the maximum accessible emission limit of one class requires
that the product be classified within the lowest of the higher class(es)
for which such assurance is possible and subject to all of the labeling
and performance requirements appropriate to that higher class.

5.3.2 Measurement of the maximum accessible levels of collateral radiation.
Determination of the presence of and the measurement of the levels of
collateral optical and x-radiation are necessary to determine compliance
with the standard. The nature of the product may be such as to preclude

the necessity of production testing of individual units; e.g., the use

of a properly interlocked protective housing may contain all collateral
radiation making it inaccessible. If the level of collateral radiation

is of such nature that variations between units are not anticipated,
measurements made on the prototype with occasional spot checks of production
units may suffice.

As with laser radiation, the level of collateral radiation must be

determined for the purposes of compliance with all adjustments and
controls adjusted to produce maximum radiation.

13


5.3.3 The level of laser and collateral radiation transmitted by viewing
optics, viewports or display screens. Because of the individual variability
of lasers and optical components that might be used in such subsystems,
measurements of individual units are considered to be appropriate in

this case. Note that measurements are to be made with all adjustments

and controls adjusted to produce maximum radiation.

5.3.4 The level of laser radiation accessible upon removal or displacement
of noninterlocked or defeatably interlocked portions of the protective
housing to confirm or verify the appropriateness of warning labels

required by Section 1040.10(g) (6) and (7) of the performance standard.

If these levels are well below the upper limit of the appropriate class
level, measurements made on the prototype with occasional spot checks

of production may suffice.

5.3.5 Calibration of the means incorporated into Class III or IV medical
laser products for measurement of the level of laser radiation intended
for irradiation of the human body.

5.3.6 Measurement of accessible laser radiation as a result of scanning
failure or other failure causing a change in either scan velocity or
amplitude, if applicable.

5.3.7 Measurement of laser radiation transmitted through beam attenuators.

5.3.8 Any other quantitative measurements required to assure compliance
with the standard.

5.4 Test Conditions

All testing must be conducted under the test conditions and measurement
parameters specified in Section 1040.10(e). The following additional
guidance is offered:

5.4.1 The product should be carefully evaluated to determine the conditions
which maximize the accessible emission levels including start-up, stabilized
emission and shutdown of the laser product in order to assure worst case
testing.

5.4.2 Tests for classification must be made with all controls and
adjustments listed in the operation, maintenance and service instructions
adjusted to maximize the accessible emission level of radiation during
operation. The product is considered to be operating as long as there

is no clear indication of malfunction.

14


5.4.3 Other measurements of accessible laser radiation must be made
with all controls and adjustments listed in the operation, maintenance
and service instructions adjusted to maximize the emission of radiation
during operation, maintenance or service as appropriate. For example,
measurements made of laser radiation made accessible upon removal or
displacement of non-interlocked portions of the protective housing must
be made when all controls including service controls are adjusted for
maximum radiation.

5.4.4 Measurements must be made at points in space in which human

access is possible in. the product configuration which is necessary to
determine compliance. For example, in determining compliance with the
requirements of Section 1040.10(g) (6) it would be necessary to conduct
measurements at points in space made accessible upon removal or displacement
of the non-interlocked portion of the protective housing.

5.4.5 When making laser and collateral radiation measurements, the
measuring instruments must be positioned and oriented to maximize the
measured quantity.

5.4.6 If the laser product is not equipped with its own energy source,
Measurements must be made with the laser coupled to a compatible energy
source or type of energy source which produces the maximum emission
level of accessible radiation. The laser energy source or type of laser
energy source must be that specified in user instructions or operation
manuals as required by Section 1040.10(h) (1) (v).

5.4.7 Except for scanned laser radiation, measurements of radiant power
(W) or radiant energy (J) are to be made using instruments and procedures
which will include the maximum power or radiant energy incident within a
circular aperture stop having a diameter of 80 millimeters. This is not
necessarily to be construed as requiring that the measuring instruments
themselves have a collecting aperture of 80 millimeters. A smaller
aperture may also be adequate to collect or account for all of the
emission as required. If however, the extent of the radiation field
equals or exceeds that dimension, the emission level measurement must
account for the total and maximum which could be collected by an 80-
millimeter circular diameter aperture. This could be accomplished by
focusing the radiation into a smaller measurement instrument aperture.
Similar reasoning applies to the 7-millimeter aperture for measurements
of radiance, integrated radiance, irradiance, and for scanning laser
preducts.

5.4.8 The instruments which are used for measurement of the radiometric

quantities of radiation may often not be adequate to provide sufficient
information regarding the temporal characteristics of the emission to

15


determine the proper classification of the product. For example, a
quasi continuous wave laser, the output power of which may appear to be
quite stable when observed using a thermo-electric radiometer, can often
be seen using a wide bandwidth detector and oscilloscope to consist in
reality of a train of short pulses. Such pulses may be the result of
power supply characteristics, relaxation oscillations within the laser
resonant cavity, mode locking, and so forth. Modulation of these types
is not to be considered as necessarily undesirable and may in fact be
necessary for the product to accomplish its intended function. The
effect, however, may be that a product may exceed the class limit of its
long term average emission when considered in terms of the individual
composite pulses The point to be made is that the measurements

for the determination of classification must be capable of accounting
for such modulation if it is present. Manufacturers of laser products
which incorporate lasers as components should be aware that the product
may introduce optical feedback to the laser which can affect its temporal
characteristics.

5.5 Sampling, Audit and Recycling

5.5.1 Sampling

All products must comply with the applicable requirements of the
laser performance standard. The Bureau of Radiological Health recommends
100 percent testing of products for the determination of compliance.

For some tests and inspections a sampling plan may be appropriate i.e.,
use of a sampling procedure whereby release of noncomplying products may
be prevented by testing less than 100 percent of the units produced.
When this is done, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer to
demonstrate the validity of the sampling plan in ensuring compliance of
the product with the standard. A sampling scheme must be random, i.e.,
the probability of a unit being selected is the same for all produced
units. The so called "random" selection of units from a production line
based on a judgment of randomness by an individual does not constitute
true random sampling. A scheme that is based on generating random
numbers or other specified statistical schemes are a more objective
basis for random sampling. Examples of sampling plans are contained in
Mil-Std-105D and Mil-Std-414.

In addition to random sampling to test for compliance, any systematic
problem areas may warrant testing; e.g. at the beginning of a production
run, or at the beginning of each day, or when a new assembler begins
work on a product, and so forth.

5.5.2 Audit
An audit is a testing of a previously tested and accepted products

to provide a check on the measurement process and the acceptance procedures.
A specific sampling procedure (see discussion in Section 5.5.1) should

16


be used to select accepted units which should be subjected to all the
tests and inspections of the product quality assurance program. Repeated
failures of audited samples indicate problems in the product design or
the quality assurance program which must be traced and corrected.

5.5.3 Recycling

Units or lots which are rejected during the quality assurance and
are subsequently corrected may be recycled into the production line.
Corrected units should be subjected to all of the testing and scrutiny
and the same acceptance or rejection criteria as other units.

17


6 LIFE TESTING

The standard for laser products specifies in Section 1040.10 (e)
that compliance is required for the useful life of the product. Accel-
erated life testing is necessary to assure the continued performance of
critical components and assemblies. Primary concern is with products
which may increase in radiation emission or degrade in radiation safety
with age. Although lasers generally decrease in output with age, the
aging of other components may nevertheless increase the level of accessi-
ble emission or degrade the radiation safety of the product. Such may
include: deterioration or warping of protective housings, the failure
of interlocks, deterioration of optical coatings of attenuators, and so
forth. It is necessary that components and products be adequately
specified and tested to preclude such occurrences and that periodic
accelerated life testing of such components or products be conducted to
assure the continued robustness of the product.

During the production of the| product, units should be randomly
selected at adequate intervals for accelerated life testing to ensure
that characteristics have not be inadvertently introduced which could
adversely affect the product's compliance throughout its useful life.
Procedures should also be established to identify, review, and promptly
correct any problems with the product reliability related to laser
radiation safety that may occur during the use of the product. It is
important that product reliability information obtained during use be
fed back to engineering and quality control for evaluation and design
modification.
