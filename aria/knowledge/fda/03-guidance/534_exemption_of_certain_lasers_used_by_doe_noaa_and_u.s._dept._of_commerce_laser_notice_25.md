TO: ALL LASER PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF
LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Exemption of Certain Laser Products Used Exclusively by
the Department of Energy or Its Contractors, and by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department
of Commerce

The purpose of this memorandum is to notify all laser product manufacturers
of exemptions granted for laser products intended for U.S. Government
use (21 CFR 1010.5). These laser products may not be the same as models
that are certified and sold or leased commercially. They are to be used
exclusively by (1) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
U.S. Department of Commerce or by (2) the Department of Energy or by its
contractors at DOE designated, government-owned contractor-operated
(GOCO) facilities in unique research applications or as components in
larger research and development systems. The exemption is from the FDA
performance standard for laser products, 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11, and
the associated reporting and recordkeeping requirements, 21 CFR Part
1002, except for paragraph 1002.20 relating to accidental radiation
occurrences.

The exemptions were approved by the Director, Bureau of Radiological

Health, by letters dated May 26, 1978, to Mr. James Liverman, Acting
Assistant Secretary for Environment, Department of Energy and June 4, 1979

to Mr. Ferris Webster, Assistant Administrator for Research and

Development, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department
of Commerce.

The exemptions apply to all Department of Energy and to all National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce,
contracts and sub-contracts. However, DOE and NOAA procurement specifi-
cations will prescribe compliance with the FDA standard to the extent
practicable and will be supplemented with safety controls and procedures
utilized by DOE and NOAA.

All exempted products are to be clearly identified by labels permanently
affixed to or inscribed on each such product so as to be legible and
readily accessible to view when each product is fully assembled for
