Needlesticks - Medical Device Reporting
Guidance
This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public. An
alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statute, regulations, or both.

Introduction
On August 9, 1996, the FDA published a guidance document entitled “MDR Guidance Document
and Exemption – Needlesticks and Blood Exposure – E1996003.” The document was designed to
provide guidance to user facilities, manufacturers, and importers to use for determining when an
adverse event involving a needlestick, or a device intended to prevent a needlestick, would require
the submission of a mandatory medical device death, serious injury, or malfunction report to the
FDA.
Needlestick-related injuries, and malfunctions of devices intended to prevent needlesticks, that
result in occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), continue to be an important public
health concern.
Healthcare workers are especially at risk from bloodborne pathogen exposure on a daily basis and
may not be aware that needlestick-related adverse events are reportable to the FDA by user
facilities, manufacturers and importers. In addition, healthcare workers may not be aware that FDA
has a voluntary reporting program they can use to report their needlestick-related events.
Due to continuing health concerns related to needlesticks and the devices intended to prevent
needlesticks, the FDA decided to update its 1996 Needlestick Guidance document. The purpose
of this revised Needlestick Guidance document is to provide user facilities, manufacturers, and
importers with user-friendly information about their roles and obligations for reporting adverse
events related to these products. The revised document also provides information for healthcare
workers to report adverse events to the FDA through the voluntary MedWatch reporting system.
This document conforms to the requirements of the Good Guidance Practices (GGP) regulation.

The Least Burdensome Approach

We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical
device regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and
legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with
those requirements. However, if you believe that the information requested in the guidance
is not relevant to the decision-making process or that an alternative approach would be less
burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your
written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the
CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways
to contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/

Needlesticks - Medical Device Reporting Guidance
A. What are the mandatory requirements, under 21 CFR Part 803, for device user
facilities, importers , and manufacturers to report needlestick-related adverse events to
the FDA?
The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, 21 CFR Part 803, requires that user facilities
must submit medical device adverse event reports, on FDA Form 3500A, to the FDA and the
device manufacturer whenever the facility become aware that a device used at the facility may have
caused or contributed to a patient death. User facilities must also report adverse events to the
device manufacturer or to FDA (if the manufacturer is unknown) whenever they become aware that
a device may have caused or contributed to a serious injury to a patient of the facility.
In addition, user facilities are required to submit an annual report on FDA Form 3419 summarizing
the reports submitted by the user facility during the reporting period. 21 CFR Part 803.3
The MDR regulation requires that device importers must submit medical device adverse event
reports, on FDA Form 3500A, to the FDA and the device manufacturer whenever they become
aware that one of their imported devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious
injury. Device importers must also submit adverse event reports to the device manufacturer
whenever they become aware that one of their imported devices has malfunctioned, and such a
malfunction would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.

The MDR regulation requires that device manufacturers must submit medical device adverse event
reports to the FDA, on FDA Form 3500A, whenever the manufacturer becomes aware that one of
their manufactured devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. Device
manufacturers must also submit adverse event reports to FDA whenever they become aware that
one of their manufactured devices has malfunctioned, and such a malfunction would be likely to
cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
In addition, the manufacturer is required to submit a baseline report, on FDA Form 3417, for a
device when the device model is first reported as required by Parts 803.50 and 803.52. 21
CFR Part 803.55

B. Where can I find more information about the mandatory reporting requirements for
device user facilities, importers and manufacturers?
The mandatory MDR requirements, forms, instructions for filling out the forms, guidance documents
and Federal Register notices can be found on the Reporting Problems with Medical Devices
homepage at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdr/
You may also submit questions to the Reporting Systems Monitoring Branch, Division of
Surveillance Systems, Office of Surveillance and Biometrics e-mail account at: rsmb@cdrh.fda.gov
or by contacting them directly at (301) 594-2735.

C. When to I have to report a needlestick-related event reportable under 21 CFR Part
803?
A needlestick-related event is reportable as a death, serious injury or malfunction as detailed below:
1. A death report should be submitted by a user facility, importer and manufacturer if the device
may have caused or contributed to the death of the individual.
2. A serious injury report should be submitted by a user facility, importer and manufacturer if the
device resulted in an injury to an individual and the injury was life-threatening, resulted in
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure, or
necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body
function or permanent damage to a body structure.
3. A device malfunction report should be submitted by an importer and manufacturer if the device
failed to perform as intended and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious
injury if the needlestick event recurred.

If a person who is exposed to infectious materials via a needlestick that resulted from a device
failure is subsequently treated medically or surgically to prevent permanent impairment, then the
event becomes reportable by the user facility, importer, and manufacturer as a serious injury report.
We do not consider first aid to constitute medical intervention, and this type of intervention will not
require an MDR report. Examples of first aid are the application of a bandage or simple cleaning of
the site of a needlestick. In addition, we do not consider an in-vitro diagnostic test for blood-borne
diseases to constitute medical intervention. However, administration of a tetanus shot, a gamma
globulin shot or stitches is considered medical intervention. This type of intervention triggers the
submission of a mandatory serious injury adverse event report by a device user facility, importer, or
manufacturer.
D. What is a medical device malfunction?
A malfunction is the failure of a device to meet its performance specifications or to perform as
intended. If you are an importer or manufacturer of a device, you must report a malfunction when it
is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.
Once a malfunction has caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, a presumption that the
malfunction is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury has been established. This
presumption will continue until the malfunction has caused or contributed to no further deaths or
serious injuries for a period of two years, or valid data shows that the likelihood of another death or
serious injury because of the malfunction is remote.
A malfunction that is or can be corrected during routine service or device maintenance should be
reported if the malfunction is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to
recur.
You do not need to report a malfunction if it is not likely to result in a death or serious injury.
If you are a user facility, you are not required to report any device malfunctions. However, we
encourage you to report device malfunctions to the device manufacturer and/or to the FDA through
the voluntary MedWatch program.
E. Do I have to report a needlestick-related event that involves blood spillage or
splattering?
You do not need to report a device-related blood spillage or splattering event unless the incident is
the result of a device malfunction. If you are a manufacturer or an importer, you should report any
spillage or splattering malfunction event if a recurrence is likely to cause or contribute to a death or
serious injury.

F. Do I have to report a needlestick-related event due solely to user error?
It depends on the severity of the event. Events involving a death or a serious injury where user error
may have caused or contributed to a needlestick-related event are reportable by a user facility,
importer, and manufacturer.

G. As a manufacturer, what type of follow-up investigation should I conduct for events
involving needlestick-related devices?
We require that you make a “good faith effort” to obtain information about the event. 21 CFR
803.50. You should document all follow-up attempts and reasons why any of the required MDR
information could not be obtained. You should include in your file a record of each attempt to
obtain information, and the reporter’s responses. We may review the documentation contained in
your files to determine whether you have made a reasonable attempt to follow up and obtain the
required information. If your firm determines that the event is not reportable under the MDR
regulation, then your files should contain documentation supporting this decision.
The follow-up investigation should focus on obtaining as much information as possible.
H. How can I submit voluntary MedWatch reports concerning needlestick-related events
to FDA when those events are not required to be reported by 21 CFR Part 803?
User facilities are not required to submit mandatory malfunction adverse event reports involving
needlesticks to the FDA. However, we encourage healthcare workers to report malfunctions
involving needlestick-related events to the device manufacturer or to the FDA through the FDA
MedWatch Voluntary Reporting Program on FDA Form 3500. Information about the FDA
MedWatch Voluntary Reporting program and the Form FDA 3500 Voluntary Reporting Form can
be found on the FDA MedWatch home page at: www.fda.gov/medwatch/. A voluntary report
can be filled out on line by accessing the MedWatch homepage and clicking on “Submit Reports”
or by direct access at: www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/. In lieu of submitting a
voluntary report via the internet, you may report to us by dialing 1- 800- FDA- 1088 or
1-240-276-3000.
