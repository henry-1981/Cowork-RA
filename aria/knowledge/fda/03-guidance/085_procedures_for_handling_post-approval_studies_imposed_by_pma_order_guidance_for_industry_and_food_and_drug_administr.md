Procedures for Handling
Post-Approval Studies Imposed by
Premarket Approval Application
Order
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction
Evaluation of premarket approval applications (PMA) by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) is a multi-step process in which we evaluate whether reasonable assurance of device
safety and effectiveness has been demonstrated. To provide reasonable assurance, or the
continued assurance, of safety and effectiveness of an approved device, we may require a postapproval study (PAS) as a condition of approval in a PMA approval order under 21 CFR
814.82(a)(2) and 21 CFR 814.82(a)(9). 1 A PAS is usually a clinical or non-clinical study, 2 as
specified in the PMA approval order, and is typically intended to gather specific data to address
questions about the postmarket performance of or experience with an approved medical device.
As described in “Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices Subject to
Premarket Approval,” 3 FDA may consider it acceptable to collect certain data in the postmarket
setting, rather than premarket under certain circumstances when FDA has uncertainty regarding
certain benefits or risks of the device, but the degree of uncertainty is acceptable in the context of
Under 21 CFR 814.82(a), FDA may impose post-approval requirements in a PMA approval order or by
regulation at the time of approval of the PMA or by regulation subsequent to approval. The focus of this
guidance document is on PAS imposed by a PMA approval order at the time of approval of the PMA.
However, the recommendations in this guidance document may also apply to PAS imposed at the time of
approval of humanitarian device exemption (HDE) applications.
2
The focus of this guidance is on clinical studies; however, the concepts and principles discussed in this document
may also apply to non-clinical PAS.

the overall benefit-risk profile of the device at the time of premarket approval. 4
The purpose of this guidance document is to assist stakeholders with understanding PAS
requirements imposed as a condition of PMA approval by providing:
•
•
•
•
•
•

procedural information;
recommendations concerning the format, content, and review of PAS-related
submissions;
recommendations to help facilitate FDA’s review of a PAS protocol in a timely manner;
recommendations for study timelines including enrollment milestones and study
completion;
revised definitions to PAS status categories that we believe better reflect progress of the
PAS; and
revised FDA review time goals for PAS-related submissions.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

Background
FDA established an internal tracking system for the PAS Program in 2006, and since that time,
has implemented initiatives to increase transparency, including the establishment of the webpage
for the Post-Approval Studies Program Database. 5 The PAS Program Database typically displays
the following information for each PAS: general information, general and detailed PAS protocol
parameters, interim or final data summary, the sponsor’s progress or “study status,” and
reporting information.
Additionally, FDA may provide updates on the status of certain PAS requirements during public
meetings of a Medical Device Advisory Committee Panel (an “Advisory Panel”) and, in the past,
has invited sponsors to provide PAS updates to help ensure Advisory Panels are kept current on
See the following FDA guidance documents for additional information on balancing premarket and postmarket
data collection and benefit-risk determinations: “Balancing Premarket and Postmarket Data Collection for Devices
Subject to Premarket Approval” (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/balancing-premarket-and-postmarket-data-collection-devices-subject-premarket-approval);

the progress of a certain PAS. FDA may also provide PAS updates through other public
communications.
These PAS program initiatives aim to help ensure that:
•
•
•
•
•

sponsors conduct PAS that use valid scientific methodologies in the study design;
least burdensome 6 approaches, including use of relevant and reliable real-world data
(RWD), 7 are followed when designing and conducting a PAS, as appropriate;
sponsors provide PAS results at intervals specified in the approval order;
FDA provides timely notification to sponsors regarding their PAS status; and
FDA posts PAS information publicly and, in situations where the legal criteria are met,
undertakes regulatory actions such as withdrawal proceedings in accordance with section
515(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. 360e(e))
and 21 CFR 814.46.

Post-Approval Study Requirements in PMA Approval
Orders
When a PAS is required as a condition of approval, the PMA approval order specifies certain
information about the requirement (i.e., the reason or purpose for such requirement, the number
of patients to be evaluated, and the reports required to be submitted). 8 For each required PAS,
FDA intends to describe the following in the PMA approval order: study design, objectives,
population, and endpoints to be collected; the length of follow-up and frequency of assessments;
and a high-level description of the data analysis plan for the primary endpoints. Generally, FDA
also intends to specify PAS timelines in the approval order, including enrollment milestones (or
data accrual milestones for a nonclinical study, if applicable), report submission timelines,
completion timeline (e.g., complete follow-up and data analyses), and expectations for any
additional milestones or submissions, as necessary.
When a PAS is likely to be required as a condition of approval, sponsors and FDA should work
collaboratively to establish a PAS protocol, enrollment milestones, and study completion
timelines prior to PMA approval to help ensure that the PAS achieves its objectives and is
completed in a timely manner. Based on FDA’s experience with PAS and the importance of
timely postmarket data collection for ensuring continued device safety and effectiveness, the
enrollment milestones below are recommended in developing your study protocol for clinical
studies.

First subject enrolled within 6 months of the study protocol approval date 9
20% of subjects enrolled within 12 months of the study protocol approval date
50% of subjects enrolled within 18 months of the study protocol approval date
100% of subjects enrolled within 24 months of the study protocol approval date

These recommended milestones are intended to be reflective of those that are most likely to
result in successful PAS completion in a timely manner. FDA expects for manufactures to meet
PAS requirements outlined in the PMA approval order and FDA intends to use the milestones
identified in the approval order to assess study status.
For non-clinical studies, similar milestones for data accrual can also be used to track study
progress.

Post-Approval Study Protocols
In general, when a PAS is required as a condition of approval of the PMA, prior approval of the
PAS protocol 10 is included as part of the condition. Sponsors should engage with FDA as early
as possible in the PMA review to discuss the need for and details of a PAS protocol. FDA
intends to review the PAS protocol interactively with the sponsor during the review of the PMA.
Section IV.B. and Section IV.C. describe the process for submission and review of PAS
protocols and changes after PMA approval.

Recommended Elements in a Post-Approval Study Protocol
FDA recommends you include the following elements in a PAS protocol:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

background (e.g., device’s regulatory history, brief description of device, indications for
use)
purpose of study
study objectives
study design
study population (including subject inclusion and exclusion criteria and definition,
source of comparator group, and targets for ensuring diversity with respect to sex, 11 age,
race, and ethnicity 12, as appropriate)
enrollment and recruitment plan
sample size calculation that is statistically justified and based on study hypothesis, where

The date of the PAS protocol approval is the date the PMA or PMA supplement, which includes the full PAS
protocol, is approved.
10
Use of the term “protocol(s)” throughout this guidance is intended to reflect the complete study plan which
includes PAS protocol, data collection forms, informed consent forms, IRB documentation, and enrollment
milestones/study timelines.

Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval documentation
enrollment milestones and study timelines (see Section III)

Post-Approval Study Protocol Review
When a PAS is likely to be required as a condition of approval of the PMA, FDA intends to
review the PAS protocol interactively with the sponsor during the review of the PMA and
concurrent with the review of the premarket data. FDA’s goal is to complete the review of the
PAS protocol and establish study enrollment milestones and completion timelines at the time of
PMA approval, for inclusion as part of the conditions of approval within the PMA approval
order. Accordingly, we recommend that the PMA include a discussion of potential postmarket
evaluation needs, a proposed PAS protocol or PAS outline (including objective and general study
design, study population, study endpoints, sample size, length of follow-up, frequency of
assessments, and enrollment milestones), or the sponsor’s rationale as to why a PAS is not
needed.
If a PAS protocol has not been developed by the time of PMA approval, the PMA may be
approved with a PAS outline. In these circumstances, FDA intends to require, as part of the
condition of approval in the PMA approval order, that a PAS protocol must be submitted as a

See FDA guidance “Patient Engagement in the Design and Conduct of Medical Device Clinical Investigations:
Guidance for Industry, Food and Drug Administration Staff, and Other Stakeholders” (available at:

PMA supplement 14 within 30 calendar days 15 of the PMA approval date. 16 Your PMA
supplement should be clearly labeled as a “PAS Protocol.” If there are multiple PAS protocols
being finalized after PMA approval, we recommend each protocol be submitted as a separate
PMA supplement. FDA strives to finish its review of a study protocol within 60 calendar days of
PMA approval 17. To achieve this, FDA intends to complete the review of a PAS protocol (a
PMA supplement) and respond within 30 calendar days of receipt. Sponsors should prioritize
resolution of any protocol deficiencies and work interactively with FDA to help ensure that
FDA’s review of the protocol is completed within 60 calendar days from the PMA approval date.

How to Submit Changes to an Approved Post-Approval
Study Protocol
If you wish to propose a change to an approved PAS protocol (e.g., changes to sample size,
endpoints, follow-up assessments) or to data collection forms, informed consent forms, and IRB
documentation after PMA approval, you should submit a PMA supplement, clearly labeled as a
“PAS Protocol,” for FDA review and approval. If multiple PAS protocols are revised, we
recommend each be submitted as a separate PMA supplement.
FDA understands that study delays sometimes may occur, however, FDA generally does not
intend for sponsors to routinely modify the PAS protocols in order to adjust study milestones.
Sponsors may request changes to the original enrollment milestones identified in the PMA
approval order and FDA intends to consider these on a case-by-case basis. 18 An example of
where a change to the original study milestone could be appropriate might be when new
information indicates that the original study enrollment milestones were impractical at the time
of the PMA approval order. Based on past experience, FDA expects that it may be appropriate in
limited circumstances to revise the original study milestones in the PMA approval order and
intends to determine the study progress and to designate its status (e.g., as pending, ongoing, or
delayed) based on the milestones specified in the PMA approval order. See Section V and
Section VI.C. for recommendations regarding the communication of anticipated or occurring
study delays in progress reports. See Section VII for considerations for mitigating study delays.

What Happens if the Sponsor and FDA Cannot Complete
the Development of a Post-Approval Study Protocol
FDA intends to facilitate timely discussions with sponsors concerning PAS protocol issues and
PMA supplements containing only a PAS protocol should be submitted as supplements with no user-fee. See
FDA’s guidance “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device Biologics License
Applications” (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/user-feesand-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-license-applications)
15
Use of the term “calendar days” throughout this guidance is intended to distinguish calendar days from working
days.
16
See 21 CFR 814.82(a).
17
FDA intends to review study protocols within 60 calendar days of PMA approval but actual review times may be
longer in certain cases, such as when there is a government shutdown or other disruptions to normal operations.
18
Proposed changes to study enrollment milestones should be submitted as a PMA supplement. Such requests
should not be combined with any other requests for changes to the PAS protocol.

challenges. We believe that early and ongoing interactions should be the primary method to
discuss PAS protocols and resolve any PAS issues. However, if FDA is unable to complete its
review of the study protocol within 60 calendar days after PMA approval due to outstanding
deficiencies that the sponsor needs to address, we intend for the PAS status to be categorized as
“Protocol Overdue” on FDA’s PAS Program Database webpage 19 (see Section X for more
information on study status).

When and How to Submit Post-Approval Study Reports
FDA may impose post-approval requirements in a PMA approval order or by regulation at the
time of approval of the PMA or by regulation subsequent to approval. Such requirements may
include continuing evaluation and periodic reporting on the safety, effectiveness, and reliability
of the device for its intended use. 20 FDA tracks and evaluates the conduct of a PAS through
review of study reports submitted to the Agency. An interim report is a written report to FDA on
the status of the PAS prior to its completion. Generally, FDA recommends submitting two types of
interim reports: “Enrollment Status Report” and “PAS Progress Report.” An Enrollment Status
Report should provide the progress towards meeting the enrollment milestones per the approval
order (see Section III). A PAS Progress Report should describe the status of the PAS prior to its
completion, including subject accountability, as well as device performance, and safety and
effectiveness data (see Section VI for additional report content details). When delays are
anticipated or are occurring, sponsors should notify FDA in the next scheduled PAS Progress
Report of the delays, reasons, and plans to address challenges and meet established milestones
identified in the PMA approval order. A Final PAS Report is a written report of a completed or
terminated PAS.
FDA intends for the PMA approval order to include a submission timeline for PAS reports. The
timing of Enrollment Status Reports may be based on the deadlines identified for each
enrollment milestone. There may be instances in which the timing for the submission of an
Enrollment Status Report coincides with the timing for the submission of a PAS Progress Report.
In such instances, a sponsor may decide to submit one report labeled as “Enrollment Status and
PAS Progress Report” to address reporting requirements. 21 If study enrollment milestones are
missed, FDA may change the timing of your Enrollment Status Reports. Generally, FDA intends
to require in the approval order that PAS Progress Reports are to be submitted every six (6)
months until subject enrollment has been completed and annually thereafter; PAS Progress
Reports for PAS without new subject enrollment (e.g., extended follow-up of premarket cohorts)
are to be submitted every six (6) months for the first year of the study and annually, thereafter,
from the date of the PMA approval letter or other negotiated starting date, unless a different
reporting schedule is agreed upon. You must follow the reporting schedule, as required by the
PMA approval order, until you have submitted the Final PAS Report. Generally, FDA intends to
require in the approval order that the Final PAS Report is to be submitted no later than three
months after study completion (i.e., last subject’s last follow-up date), unless a different

FDA recommends the sponsor contact FDA if they wish to combine reports or submit one report for more than

reporting schedule post study completion is agreed upon.
To help facilitate and triage review, FDA recommends that the sponsor indicate the type of PAS
report and time span on the report cover letter in bold letters (e.g., Enrollment Status Report, 6Month PAS Progress Report, 12-Month PAS Progress Report, Final PAS Report). We also
recommend that the sponsor identify the condition of approval for which the report is being
submitted (i.e., refer to the condition of approval wording and the PAS number if more than one
PAS is identified as a condition of approval in the approval order).
FDA requires all applicants to provide one electronic copy (eCopy) of PAS submissions. 22 The
eCopy must be accompanied by a single paper copy of your signed cover letter. Submissions
should be sent to the current address displayed on the website
http://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress.

Content and Format of Interim and Final PostApproval Study Reports
FDA’s ability to adequately track and evaluate a PAS depends on the quality and timeliness of
the information provided by the sponsor. The recommendations in this section are intended to
help ensure the PAS reports that are submitted contain adequate information for FDA to identify
the product being studied, the specific study being conducted, the status of that study, and, if
applicable, the reasons for any delays or failures to complete the study in accordance with the
timelines typically included in the approval order.
FDA recommends that PAS reports (interim and final) include the information listed below,
clearly identified, and in separate sections. All reports should contain the data listed below and
submitted per the timeline in the approval order. For some studies (e.g., retrospective analysis of
RWD, 23 non-clinical studies), sponsors are encouraged to work with FDA to determine the
applicability of the PAS Enrollment Status Report and content of any PAS reports.

General Information
FDA recommends all reports include a section that contains the following general information:
•
•

PMA application number and, if applicable, the supplement number for which the PAS
requirement was made a condition of approval in the PMA approval order
Sponsor name and contact information (name of the individual or entity holding the

FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage sponsors to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.

towards the study enrollment milestones identified in the PMA approval order (i.e., comparing
study enrollment milestones to actual enrollment).
PAS Progress Report: FDA intends to consider several factors when evaluating the PAS
Progress Report, including:
•
•
•
•
•

the completeness of the report content (especially in regard to progress towards
achieving primary and secondary endpoints and performance goals, or sufficient
individual endpoint data to infer progress in the case of composite endpoints);
protocol adherence and reasons for deviations from the methodology;
the performance and postmarket safety and effectiveness of the device;
whether study enrollment milestones are met (see Section X);
causes for delays in PAS progress or failure to meet enrollment milestones and plan to
address challenges and meet established milestones;
o When a sponsor fails to meet enrollment milestone requirements, FDA expects
sponsors to act with due diligence to mitigate continued study delays. FDA intends
to consider the sponsors’ mitigation efforts to address study delays. Mitigation
efforts may include, but are not limited to, the following:
- current and past enrollment recovery efforts;
- evaluation of slow enrollment;
- device availability on the market;
- measures taken to initiate study sites;
- measures taken to incentivize study subjects;
- outreach to study investigators and potential subjects; and
- plans to remove barriers to site and subject participation.

Although it is recommended that the sponsor identify any missed milestones as part of PAS
reports, the sponsor should communicate circumstances which are impacting their ability to meet
PAS requirements to FDA as soon as possible.
FDA intends to review interim PAS reports within 30 calendar days of submission receipt date.
If we have questions regarding the data provided in the report, or if we believe the data are
incomplete or insufficient, we may request additional information interactively and/or through a
deficiency letter. If an interim report includes insufficient data or the sponsor failed to meet
enrollment milestones or study timelines, FDA ultimately may take enforcement actions to
ensure compliance with PAS requirements, as appropriate (see Section XI). Additionally, if the
PAS results identify new safety and/or effectiveness concerns for a device, FDA may consider
taking actions, which may include issuing a Safety Communication to provide recommendations
on patient management, as appropriate.

Evaluation of a Final PAS Report
The Final PAS Report should describe the study methodology and results. If the Final PAS
Report is for a completed study, it should also explain how the study fulfills the PAS
requirement identified in the PMA approval order. If the Final PAS Report is for a terminated
study, it should include the data captured prior to termination. See Section VI for additional

recommendations on the content and format of PAS reports.
FDA intends to consider multiple factors when evaluating a Final PAS Report, including:
•
•
•
•

the completeness of the report content;
adherence to methodology in the PAS protocol and reasons for deviations from the
methodology;
evaluation of data in the report to assess the performance, safety and effectiveness of the
device; and
evaluation of fulfillment of the condition(s) of approval identified in the PMA approval
order.

FDA intends to review final PAS reports within 60 calendar days of submission receipt date. If
we have questions regarding the data provided in the Final PAS Report, or if we believe the data
are incomplete or insufficient to address the PAS requirement(s), we intend to request additional
information interactively and/or through a deficiency letter. Additionally, if the PAS results
identify new safety and/or effectiveness concerns for a device, FDA may consider taking action,
which may include issuing a Safety Communication, as appropriate.
If we conclude the sponsor has fulfilled the PAS requirement(s), we intend to send the sponsor a
letter stating the PAS requirement(s) has been fulfilled. Generally, submission of additional PAS
reports to FDA is not necessary after FDA determines that the PAS requirement is satisfied. If
the PAS results affect device labeling, the labeling change will generally trigger the need to
submit a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39). 35

Sponsor’s Reporting Status
Upon receipt of a PAS Progress Report or a Final PAS Report, FDA intends to assess the
sponsor’s reporting status based on the schedule specified in the PMA approval order and post
the reporting status on the webpage for the PAS Program Database 36 for each PAS Progress and
Final Report submission. The reporting status categories are described in Table 1 below.

PMA supplements that include only labeling changes reflecting the results from a PAS should be submitted as
supplements with no user-fee. See FDA’s guidance “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications
and Device Biologics License Applications” (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fdaguidance-documents/user-fees-and-refunds-premarket-approval-applications-and-device-biologics-licenseapplications)

Report
Overdue/Received

Study Status
FDA intends to determine the PAS status after reviewing a PMA supplement (i.e., a protocol for
a new PAS or modifications to a PAS protocol), an Enrollment Status Report, a PAS Progress
Report, and a Final PAS Report. Factors in considering the PAS progress and status include, as
applicable:
1. Assessing the status of protocol approval;
2. After PAS protocol approval, assessing the following:
a. Whether the study enrollment milestones are met
b. Progress with data accrual
c. Submission of a Final PAS Report
Based on the above, FDA intends to consider the appropriate status category to be posted on the
webpage for the PAS Program Database. 37 Of note, there may be circumstances in which a PAS
may be put on a hold temporarily, be redesigned/replaced, or be terminated. A sponsor’s
progress status is considered based on currently available information and may be revised
accordingly based on the availability of new information. FDA generally intends to use the
original study schedule identified in the PMA approval order to assess the study progress and to
designate its status (see Section IV.C.). Each of these status categories are described in Table 2
below.

Hold

This category is used from the time the PAS protocol has been
approved to the initial status assessment based on the data in the first
Interim PAS report.
The study is proceeding according to, or is ahead of, the study
timelines specified in the PMA approval order. The FDA considers the
study to be ongoing until a Final PAS Report is submitted to the FDA,
as long as the activities are proceeding according to the approved PAS
protocol.
The progression of the study is behind the study timelines specified in
the PMA approval order. For example, the enrollment of subjects (or
data accrual) may or may not have started but the projected date for
completion of that milestone has passed. Delays can occur in any
phase of the study, including subject enrollment, analysis of data, or
submission of the Final PAS Report to the FDA. While the enrollment
milestones specified in the PMA approval order serve as the basis for
defining the study as delayed, each phase of the study will be
considered on its own right. If the sponsor has one delayed phase, but
gets back on schedule during the next phase, the delayed status will no
longer apply.
The sponsor has fulfilled the post-approval requirement identified in
the condition(s) of approval (PAS requirement) in the PMA approval
order, and FDA considers the PAS requirement to be satisfied.
The sponsor has not fulfilled or cannot fulfill the post-approval
requirement identified in the condition(s) of approval (PAS
requirement) as originally designed. All reasonable efforts to fulfill the
PAS requirement have been exhausted, and FDA has agreed to allow
the sponsor to redesign and replace the original PAS protocol with a
new PAS protocol to fulfill the post-approval requirement. The new
PAS protocol supersedes the previous protocol.
The sponsor has not fulfilled or cannot fulfill the post-approval
requirement identified in the condition(s) of approval (PAS
requirement), e.g., postmarket questions are no longer relevant, device
is not currently being sold and sponsor withdraws premarket
submission that received the PAS as condition of approval. If FDA
determines that all appropriate efforts to fulfill the condition of
approval have been exhausted, FDA intends to terminate the study.
This status reflects when a study has been placed on a hold
temporarily. Examples of situations when a PAS might be temporarily
paused include the following examples:
• while a change in ownership is completed, a pending separate
study is being used to address condition of approval, or
• ceased device sales, but the premarket submission associated
with the PAS is not withdrawn.
When the circumstances necessitating the hold have resolved, the
sponsor is responsible for resuming the PAS. The progress is assessed
against approved study milestones.

Failure to Complete a Post-Approval Study
Requirement
There may be circumstances that make it impossible or inappropriate for the sponsor to complete
a PAS requirement. For instance, the sponsor may have instituted a voluntary withdrawal or
recall of the device from the market that impacts the sponsor’s ability to complete the PAS.
In addition, if FDA believes the PAS cannot be completed as designed or can no longer address
the study questions, FDA intends to discuss with the sponsor the need to redesign the PAS and,
establish a new PAS protocol and timelines to fulfill the PAS requirement. We recommend that
the sponsor initiate early communication with FDA if they encounter barriers that limit the
ability to fulfill their PAS requirement.
If FDA concludes the sponsor has not complied with a PAS requirement and the sponsor has not
provided a valid justification for doing so, we may take a variety of actions. Under certain
circumstances, we may initiate withdrawal of approval of the PMA under section 515(e) of the
FD&C Act. In appropriate instances, FDA may order postmarket surveillance under section 522
of the FD&C Act. Note that the failure or refusal to comply with section 522 is a prohibited act
under section 301(q)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(q)(1)(C). Further, under section
502(t)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(t)(3), a device is misbranded if there is a failure or
refusal to comply with any requirement under section 522 of the FD&C Act. Please note that
violations of sections 301(q)(1)(C) or misbranding under section 502(t)(3) may lead to
enforcement actions including seizure, injunction, prosecution, or civil money penalties.

Public Disclosure of Post-Approval Study Information
FDA Website
To increase transparency to FDA stakeholders, including consumers, patients, healthcare
providers, and industry, FDA posts certain information about PAS (e.g., study description and
interim or final study results, see details below) on the webpage for the PAS Program
Database. 38 This information will be posted in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR
814.9 on the confidentiality of data and information in the PMA file and 21 CFR Part 20 on the
public disclosure of information.
PAS-related information that may be posted includes:
General Information
• PMA number
• sponsor name
• device name
• medical specialty (e.g., cardiovascular, orthopedic)
• date of issuance of PMA approval order

Interim PAS Report Data
FDA intends to post on its website, or otherwise make public, PAS interim results consistent
with the interim data release plan (included as part of the PAS protocol) and may post additional
information that may be beneficial for public awareness. If the PAS protocol does not include an
interim data release plan, FDA intends to post PAS interim summary data and/or FDA analyses
thereof when appropriate to protect the public health, such as in cases where interim results raise
safety concerns, serve to provide critical device performance information, or may otherwise
impact treatment. FDA generally considers such data to be publicly releasable in accordance
with applicable disclosure laws, such as the Freedom of Information Act. When sharing
information appropriate to protect public health, FDA will consider the benefits of sharing the
information, as well as other considerations on the study conduct. Examples of interim report
data that FDA may publicly disclose includes:
•
•
•

number of subjects enrolled
number of sites enrolled
interim safety/effectiveness findings.

However, if a sponsor believes in a particular instance that interim results are restricted from
public release; for example, because they constitute personal identifying information, trade
secrets, or confidential commercial information, they should notify FDA of this in the interim
report containing the results and explain why they believe disclosure of the data is restricted.
Final PAS Report Results (where applicable)
FDA intends to post on its website or otherwise make public PAS final summary data and/or

Act. Final PAS data that is posted may include:
•
•
•
•
•

final number of study subjects enrolled
final number of study sites enrolled

Advisory Panels
FDA may seek the advice of an Advisory Panel when considering the initiation or progress of a
PAS, or for input on data that raise concerns regarding the safety and/or effectiveness of a
device. These Advisory Panels are composed of experts outside FDA who independently review
information and make recommendations to FDA. 39 Although not always part of an Advisory
Panel meeting, in order to, for example, help ensure the Advisory Panel is kept current on the
progress of a certain PAS, FDA may present or request that the sponsor present the status or
outcomes of a PAS during a scheduled public meeting. When asked to present at such meetings,
we recommend that the sponsor’s presentation contains the report contents described in Section
VI. FDA’s presentations at such meetings are anticipated to include our analysis and evaluation
of the PAS.
