Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Hemodialysis Blood Tubing Sets - Premarket
Notification [510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

1.

Introduction

This guidance document is intended to assist industry in preparing an Abbreviated premarket
notification submission (510(k)) to establish that the device is substantially equivalent to a
predicate hemodialysis blood tubing set for use as the extracorporeal blood circuit during
hemodialysis treatment. This guidance document identifies specific recommendations for the
content and format of an Abbreviated 510(k) submission for hemodialysis blood tubing sets. This
version of the guidance is intended to clarify the April 14, 2008, guidance of the same title and is
consistent with FDA’s original approach to premarket notification (510(k)) submissions.

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered the
burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues we
have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the "A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues" document. It is available
on our Center web page at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are

1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type must conform to the general
controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), including the premarket
notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a substantial
equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also 21 CFR 807.81 and
807.87.)
This guidance document identifies the classification regulation and product codes for
hemodialysis blood tubing sets (refer to Section 4. Scope). Other sections of this guidance
document provide additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks related to these
devices in premarket notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements of
a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR 807.87, the guidance,
Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s, 1 and “Premarket Notification 510(k)” on
CDRH Device Advice. 2
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating Substantial
Equivalence in Premarket Notifications,” 3 a manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or
has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an
Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing
that device. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices may
lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), we recommend that you
include an abbreviated 510(k) summary report of appropriate supporting data within the meaning
of 21 CFR 807.87(f) or (g). The abbreviated 510(k) summary report should explain how this
guidance document was used during the device development and testing, briefly describe the
methods or tests used, and include a summary of the test data or description of the acceptance
criteria applied to address the risks identified in this document and any other additional risks

specific to your device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the requirements of
section 21 CFR 807.87 and identifies other items that we recommend you include in an
Abbreviated 510(k).

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and cite
the title of this guidance document.

Proposed Labeling
Proposed labeling must be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (21 CFR 807.87(e).) (Please refer to Section 11. Labeling for specific
information that should be included in the labeling for devices of the type covered by this
guidance document.)

Abbreviated 510(k) Summary Report4
In accordance with 21 CFR 807.87, your abbreviated 510(k) summary report should contain
the following:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the device and include an explanation of how the device
functions and the specific physical and performance characteristics of the device. (Please
refer to Section 5. Device Description for specific information to include in the device
description for devices of the type covered by this guidance document.) You should also
submit an “indications for use” enclosure. 5
Description of device design
Please include a brief description of the device design requirements. (21 CFR 807.87(f).)
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess the risk
profile, in general, as well as the risk profile of the specific device’s design and the results
of this analysis. Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health for the risks to health generally
associated with the use of this device that FDA has identified.

An abbreviated 510(k) summary report is intended to explain how a device-specific guidance
document was used during development and testing of your device. This is not the 510(k)
summary described in 21 CFR 807.92, which may be submitted to satisfy 21 CFR 807.87(h). For
additional information on abbreviated 510(k) summary reports, see section 9 of Format for
Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/1567.html.

Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks identified
in this guidance document and any additional risks identified in your risk analysis.
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the nonclinical tests submitted,
referenced, or relied on in your submission. See Sections 7-10 of this guidance for
specific performance aspects. If you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the
method rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the
method but should provide sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for
the modification. For each test, you may either (1) briefly present the data resulting from
the test in clear and concise form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria
that you will apply to your test results. 6 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design
Controls for the Quality System Regulation.)
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or testing,
you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

declaration of conformity to the standard. 7

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, you cannot properly
submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the testing the standard
describes. For more information, please refer to section 514(c)(1)(B) of the act and the
FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence Determinations. 8
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks identified
through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of the device’s
performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we need it to assess
6

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the subject
device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being introduced into
interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance criteria and, thus, differs
from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends that submitters apply the same
criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to
determine whether marketing of the finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), you must submit any
additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding substantial
equivalence.
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k) that
provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in this
guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods, data, acceptance criteria, and
conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices should
consider submitting Special 510(k)s.
The following is a specific discussion of how you should apply this guidance document to a
premarket notification submission for hemodialysis blood tubing sets.

4.

Scope

The scope of this guidance document is limited to the device described below, 21 CFR 876.5820
and product codes FJK and KOC.
Section 876.5820 Hemodialysis system and accessories.
The extracorporeal blood system and accessories consists of tubing, pumps, pressure
monitors, air foam or bubble detectors, and alarms to keep blood moving safely from the
blood access device and accessories for hemodialysis (§ 876.5540) to the blood compartment
of the dialyzer and back to the patient.
This generic type of device does not include any tubing or devices used for vascular access, such
as hemodialysis catheters, or any tubing used for peritoneal dialysis.

5.

Performance Testing

You should describe the performance characteristics of the blood tubing set and include
functional testing demonstrating the device performs as you describe. Please compare the results
of performance testing data to results obtained for the predicate device. (21 CFR 807.87(f)) If
your device performance range falls outside of the range for the predicate device, explain why
this difference does not affect the safety or effectiveness, and therefore, the substantial
equivalence of your device.
We recommend you perform the following tests on three or more hemodialysis tubing sets of each
model you intended to market:
•

pressure leak testing demonstrating that the blood tubing can withstand pressures up to 1.5
times the maximum labeled positive and negative pressures;

•

endurance testing of the pump segment at maximum labeled blood flow rates and
pressures;

•

endurance testing, under both positive and negative pressures, of any injection ports (if
applicable), using the largest recommended gauge needle identified in the labeling;

•

priming volume assessment;

•

tensile testing of joints and materials of all tubing segments;

•

the ability of pressure transducers to withstand leakage when subjected to pressures up to
2 times the maximum labeled pressure, e.g., “strikethrough”

•

performance testing of the device’s clamps to demonstrate that they can successfully
occlude the blood tubing;

•

hemocompatibility (i.e., mechanical hemolysis) for a new or significantly altered
hemodialysis tubing design that affects the pattern of blood flow; and

•

performance testing to evaluate the ability of the tubing to resist kinking after repeated
clamping, particularly in the post-pump tubing segment.

We also recommend you evaluate a blood tubing set on each hemodialysis delivery system(s)
specified in your labeling and operator’s manual by operating the unit with a blood analog fluid

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
for four hours at 37 °C to demonstrate that tubing failure (i.e., tube kinking) does not occur.
During this testing, we recommend that you inspect the tubing for kinks caused by excessive or
undersized tubing, across the length of the tubing, using a variety of hemodialyzer sizes. We also
recommend that you validate the diameter of the blood pump segment to ensure that the correct
blood volume is being pumped by the hemodialysis delivery system. .

8.

Device Materials and Biocompatibility

Please describe the materials used to fabricate all components of the hemodialysis tubing set
(807.87(f)), including any colorants (e.g., inks, dyes, markings), plasticizers (including di-(2Ethylhexyl) phthalate or DEHP) or additives. We recommend you group these materials
according to whether they have direct or indirect contact with the circulating blood. For each of
these materials, we recommend you:
•

identify a current, legally marketed device that uses the identical materials and
manufacturing methods for a similar intended use; or

•

provide appropriate biocompatibility testing on a finished, sterilized device such as the
testing recommended in the current FDA guidance on biocompatibility testing, Office of
Device Evaluation (ODE) Blue Book memorandum, G95¬-1 "Use of International
Standard ISO-10993 ‘Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and
Testing’".

Hemodialysis blood tubing sets are considered externally communicating devices, contacting
circulating blood, prolonged contact Class II (Category B). If you are unable to identify a legally
marketed predicate device that uses the exact materials as described above, we recommend you
conduct the following tests:
•

cytotoxicity;

•

sensitization (Guinea pig maximization with polar and non-polar extracts);

•

irritation or intracutaneous reactivity;

•

acute systemic toxicity;

•

hemocompatibility, e.g., chemical and mechanical hemolysis; and

•

genotoxicity.

Alternatively, you may provide a justification for not conducting any of the tests identified above.

9.

Sterility
FDA recommends that you provide sterilization information, such as that described in the
Updated 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1; Final Guidance for Industry and
FDA 9 . We recommend the device be sterile with a sterility assurance level (SAL) of 1 x 10-6.

9

http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/361.html.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Blood tubing sets are in contact with circulating blood; therefore, we recommend you test the
devices for pyrogenicity. We recommend you provide a:
•

description of the method used to make the determination, e.g., limulus amebocyte
lysate (LAL);

•

identification of the testing endpoint reached and rationale for selecting that endpoint;

•

description of the extraction technique used to obtain the test fluid from the test
device, showing that all clinically relevant contact surfaces of the test device were
assessed; and

•

identification of the reference method used, e.g., United States Pharmacopoeia (USP),
ANSI/AAMI ST 72:2002, Bacterial endotoxins - Test methodologies, routine
monitoring, and alternatives to batch testing or FDA guidance.

10. Expiration Date Testing
We recommend all labels for hemodialysis blood tubing include an expiration date. We
recommend you provide the following tests to substantiate the validity of the proposed expiration
date on devices subjected to real-time or accelerated aging:
•

biocompatibility testing of hemodialysis blood tubing sets including all testing described
in Section 8. Device Materials and Biocompatibility;

•

performance testing on aged samples including the testing listed in Section 7.
Performance Testing; and

•

package integrity testing to demonstrate sterility and non-pyrogenicity.

Accelerated conditions may be used to support the labeled expiration date, as long as you include
an adequate scientific rationale supporting your accelerated testing. In addition, we recommend
you initiate real-time testing when you submit your 510(k) and include the real-time results in
your device master record.

11. Labeling
The premarket notification must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of
21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are intended to assist you in preparing labeling that
satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 10

10

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with
the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate
commerce. In addition, final labeling for prescription medical devices must comply with 21 CFR
801.109. Labeling recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the requirements of Part
801.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A. Directions for Use
As a prescription device under 21 CFR 801.109, the device is exempt from having
adequate directions for lay use. Nevertheless, you must adequate information for use,
including indications, effects, routes, methods, and frequency and duration of use and any
relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions. (801.109(d))
Instructions should encourage local and institutional training programs designed to
familiarize users with the features of the device and how to use it in a safe and effective
manner.

B. Intended Use
You must state the intended use of your device and include the indications for use and the
intended (target) population (e.g., pediatric patients). (801.109(c))

•

a statement that the device is for single use only, and has a nontoxic and nonpyrogenic fluid path;

•

a statement that the package is sterile, if the package is intact and undamaged, and
protective caps are secure.

We also recommend you color code the device so that the patient and dialyzer
connectors of the arterial blood tubing are red and the patient and dialyzer connectors
of the venous blood tubing are blue.

D. Warnings
You must include a warning that significant hemolysis of red blood cells can occur in
kinked blood tubing, especially in the post-pump, arterial tubing segment. (801.109(d))

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
As a precaution, you must include a warning indicating that the device is intended for
single use only.

E. Outer Package Labeling
In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 801, we recommend that the outer package
labeling include:
•

device name;

•

U.S. point of contact;

•

storage conditions;

•

priming volume;

•

sterility status and method;

•

sterilization date;

•

a non-pyrogenic statement;
