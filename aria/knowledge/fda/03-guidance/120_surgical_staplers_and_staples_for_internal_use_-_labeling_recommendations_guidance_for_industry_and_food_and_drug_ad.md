Internal Use - Labeling
Recommendations

______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this guidance to provide labeling
recommendations for surgical staplers and staples for internal use. These labeling
recommendations are being issued because malfunctions and misuse associated with these
devices have resulted in serious adverse events, including deaths. 1
FDA believes that the labeling recommendations in this guidance would help promote the safe
and effective use of surgical staplers and staples for internal use by helping manufacturers
develop labeling with information about specific risks, limitations, and directions for use of the
device. 2
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the
public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended only to
provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA guidance
documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific
regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance
means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

See e.g., FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) Database, search of the product
codes GDW and GAG from January 1, 2011 – March 31, 2018.

In addition, FDA has finalized the reclassification of surgical staplers for internal use from class I to class II with
special controls. See the final order “Reclassification of Certain Surgical Staplers” issued October 8, 2021 (86 FR
56195) available at https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-22041.

II. Background
Surgical staplers for internal use are specialized prescription devices used to deliver compatible
staples to internal tissues during surgery for resection, transection, and creating anastomoses.
Surgical staplers and staples for internal use may be indicated for use in a wide range of surgical
applications, including but not limited to gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and thoracic surgery.
FDA developed the draft of this guidance because we had become aware of a large number of
adverse events associated with use of both surgical staplers and staples for internal use. Between
January 2011 – March 2018, FDA received over 41,000 adverse event reports associated with
surgical staplers and staples for internal use, including over 360 deaths associated with the use of
surgical staplers and staples for internal use. 3 Some of the most commonly reported problems in
these adverse event reports include an opening of the staple line or malformation of staples,
misfiring, difficulty in firing, failure of the stapler to fire the staple, and misapplied staples (e.g.,
user applying staples to the wrong tissue or applying staples of the wrong size to the tissue). 4,5
Although the majority of the adverse events were reported under product code GDW (Staple,
Implantable), FDA believes that many of the problems identified in these reports can be
primarily attributed to surgical staplers for internal use, since proper staple formation is largely
contingent on proper function and use of the stapler.7
Stapler and/or staple malfunctions may result in prolonged surgical procedures or unplanned,
additional surgical interventions, and other complications such as bleeding, sepsis, fistula
formation, tearing of internal tissues and organs, and death. Common causes for complications
also include the use of incorrectly sized staples for the tissue, incorrect use of the device by the
user and improper use of the device for the condition of the patient’s tissues, which may result in
reoperation or prolonged hospitalization. 6 For example, an early postoperative anastomotic leak
due to such device issues may result in a septic patient with peritonitis, requiring immediate
surgery with diversion of stool into a stoma. Minor or delayed anastomotic leaks due to such
device issues may result in an intra-abdominal abscess requiring surgical or other invasive
drainage procedures, temporary diversion of stool, and prolonged intravenous nutrition. These
complications commonly result in prolonged hospital stays. 7

Both device misuse and device malfunctions are root causes of these adverse events. 8 Device
misuse may be exacerbated by inadequate instructions for use, and insufficient warnings or
precautions in the device labeling. 9 FDA believes that these problems will be mitigated by
providing specific information about the risks, limitations, and directions for use in the labeling
for the surgical staplers and staples for internal use. The inclusion of such information should
also be helpful in developing labeling with adequate information for use under 21 CFR 801.109.
For example, FDA believes the inclusion of important device technical characteristics and
performance parameters in the labeling would inform end users on device limitations, thereby
increasing the likelihood of appropriate device use and mitigate against device malfunctions. For
these reasons, FDA recommends that the labeling of surgical staplers and staples for internal use
contain the warnings, contraindications, instructions, and usage information identified below.

IV. Labeling Recommendations
Accurate labeling with clear communication will help mitigate the safety issues associated with
surgical staplers and staples for internal use and help manufacturers develop labeling with
adequate information. Based on FDA’s review of the adverse event reports discussed above, the
labeling for these devices may not contain all important information about the risks, limitations,
and directions for use of the device, and therefore, may not contain adequate information for use

FDA has finalized the reclassification of surgical staplers for internal use from class I to class II with special
controls that include specific labeling requirements cited in this section. See the final order “Reclassification of
Certain Surgical Staplers” issued October 8, 2021 (86 FR 56195) available at
https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2021-22041.
11
Although the special controls under 21 CFR 878.4740 do not apply to product codes GDW, NLL, and NAY, the
recommendations in this guidance are applicable to all product codes identified in this table.
12
An analysis of adverse events for robotic surgical staplers for internal use (i.e., “robotic staplers”), which are class
II devices and assigned the product code NAY, indicate that the same risks apply to robotic staplers as surgical
staplers for internal use. Therefore, FDA believes that the labeling recommendations in this guidance should also
apply to robotic staplers.

under 21 CFR 801.109. 13,14 FDA believes that accurate product labeling is important to make
device users aware of the risks, limitations, and directions for use of surgical staplers and staples
for internal use. As such, the contraindications, warnings, directions for use, technical
characteristics and performance parameters identified below should help mitigate the safety
issues associated with surgical staplers and staples for internal use and help manufacturers
develop labeling with adequate information for use. 15
In addition, FDA has established special controls that require specific labeling for surgical
staplers for internal use (21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix) and 21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(x)). To help
manufacturers develop labeling that complies with the required special controls (shown in italic
font) and to mitigate the safety issues identified in surgical staplers for internal use, FDA is
providing the following labeling recommendations. These recommendations are intended to
supplement, and not replace, good clinical judgement. Although the special controls identified
herein are only required for surgical staplers for internal use under 21 CFR 878.4740, the
recommendations in this guidance are applicable to all surgical staplers and staples for internal
use identified in Section III (Scope). We intend for the recommendations below to supplement
and enhance the information that is often already included in labeling for these device types.

Contraindications
Special control 21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(A) states:
Unless data demonstrates the safety of doing so, contraindications must be
identified regarding use of the device on tissues for which the risk of stapling
outweighs any reasonably foreseeable benefit due to known complications,
including the stapling of tissues that are necrotic, friable, or have altered
integrity.
Recommendation: A statement noting that the device should not be used to staple
tissues that are necrotic, friable, or have altered integrity, e.g., ischemic or
edematous tissues

Warnings
Special control 21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B) states:

See 21 CFR 801.109 for a complete list of the required information in device labeling. There are also other
labeling requirements under the regulations and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), e.g.,
section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act.
14
Moreover, a device shall be deemed misbranded if, among other things: its labeling is false or misleading or its
labeling does not contain adequate warnings (see sections 502(a), 201(n), and 502(f) of the FD&C Act).
15
While the recommendations are intended to help manufacturers develop labeling that contains adequate
information for use under 21 CFR 801.109, the specific information required in device labeling to comply with this
provision and other provisions in the regulations and the FD&C Act depends on the facts and circumstances
regarding the particular device (e.g., the design of the device).
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Unless available information demonstrates that the specific warnings do not
apply, the labeling must provide appropriate warnings regarding how to avoid
known hazards associated with device use including:
•

Avoidance of use of the stapler to staple tissue outside of the labeled limits for
maximum and minimum tissue thickness (21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B)(i));
Recommendation: A statement noting that the device should not be used to
staple tissue outside of the labeled limits for maximum and minimum tissue
thickness

•

•

A statement to visually inspect prior to firing for inclusion of unintended
anatomic structures within the staple line
A statement to ensure that no obstructions, such as clips, are incorporated
into the instrument jaws when positioning the stapler on the application
site, and that firing over an obstruction may result in incomplete cutting
action and/or improperly formed staples

Avoidance of clamping and unclamping of delicate tissue structures to prevent
tissue damage (21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B)(iii));
Recommendation: A statement that clamping and unclamping of delicate
structures, such as venous structures and bile ducts, may result in damage to
tissue irrespective of stapler firing

•

Avoidance of use of the stapler on the aorta (21 CFR
878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B)(iv));
Recommendation: A statement to avoid use of the stapler on the aorta

•

Establishing proximal control of blood vessels prior to stapling where
practical and methods of blood vessel control in the event of stapler failure
(21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B)(v));
Recommendation: A statement that, where practical, proximal control of
blood vessels is recommended prior to stapling, and that surgeons should have
methods of blood vessel control in place in the event of stapler failure

•

Ensuring stapler compatibility with staples (21 CFR
878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(B)(vi)); and

staplers and staples for internal use contain clear instructions for use
addressing the following:
•

•
•
•

The procedures for proper cartridge installation, removal/exchange, and
preventing and mitigating the effects of the stapler jamming, locking,
misfiring, or otherwise malfunctioning. Manufacturers should consider use
of diagrams to help illustrate these procedures, when appropriate.
The procedures for determining that a tissue is appropriate for stapling
The time required for adequate pre-firing compression

Validated methods and instructions for reprocessing of any reusable device
components (21 CFR 878.4740(b)(2)(ix)(H)).
Recommendation: For recommendations regarding the development and
validation of reprocessing instructions in your proposed device labeling, refer
to FDA’s guidance “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings:
Validation Methods and Labeling.” 16
