RESPONSE: The central question revolves around whether the company is
"engaged in the business" of manufacturing or assembling these laser
products within the meaning of Section 355(3) of the Public Health
Service Act, as amended by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety
Act of 1968 (the Act), and is therefore a "manufacturer" required by
Sections 358(h) and 360B(a) (5) of the Act to certify compliance of these
laser products with the standard.

The Bureau of Radiological Health has been advised previously by General
Counsel that an electronic product, including laser products, constructed
on a one-time basis by a particular company for use by that company in

its manufacturing process at the place where constructed is not considered
"manufacturing". If, however, the products are made on a continuing

basis in the course of a commercial enterprise and used by employees

other than those directly involved in the manufacture of the electronic
product, the company is considered to be "engaged in the business" of
manufacturing products subject to the- Act.
