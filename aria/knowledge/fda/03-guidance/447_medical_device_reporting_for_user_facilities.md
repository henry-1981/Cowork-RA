FOREWORD

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), part of the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), develops and implements national programs and regulations to protect
the public health in the fields of medical devices and radiological health. These programs are
intended to assure the safety, effectiveness, and proper labeling of medical and radiationemitting devices.
The Center publishes the results of its work in scientific journals and in its own technical
reports. Through these reports, CDRH also provides assistance to industry and to the medical
and health professional communities in complying with the laws and regulations mandated by
Congress. The reports are sold by the Government Printing Office (GPO) and by the National
Technical Information Service (NTIS). Many reports are also available on the
Internet/World Wide Web.

PREFACE
The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) imposed significant new reporting requirements on the medical device industry and users of medical devices. SMDA requires user
facilities to report device-related deaths and serious injuries to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the manufacturer. Although the user facility reporting requirements of
SMDA were automatically effective November 28, 1991, this guidance document is based on
the final Medical Device Reporting (MDR) rule which was published in the December 11, 1995,
Federal Register. The final rule also addresses changes mandated by the Medical Device
Amendments of 1992.
Much of the information in this document is general in nature and may not apply to a
specific situation. Questions should be sent by facsimile (FAX) to (240) 276-3454 or mailed to:

1. INTRODUCTION
In 1990, Congress enacted the Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA) to increase the
information that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and manufacturers receive about
serious problems with medical devices. Although manufacturers and importers of medical
devices have been required since 1984 to report to FDA all device-related deaths, serious
injuries, and certain malfunctions, numerous reports show widespread under reporting. A 1986
General Accounting Office (GAO) study showed that hospitals reported less than one percent of
problems with medical devices and, the more serious the problem with a medical device, the less
likely it was to be reported. A GAO follow-up study in 1989 concluded that despite full
implementation of the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation, serious under reporting still
existed.
Under SMDA, device user facilities and manufacturers must report deaths and serious
injuries to which a device has or may have caused or contributed and must establish and
maintain adverse event files. A device user facility is defined as a hospital, an ambulatory
surgical facility, a nursing home, an outpatient treatment facility, or an outpatient diagnostic
facility which is not a physician’s office. A medical device is any item that is used for the
diagnosis, treatment, or prevention of a disease, injury, or other condition and is not a drug or
biologic. (See sections 5 and 6 for definitions of terms and concepts.) The user facility
reporting section of SMDA became effective on November 28, 1991.
To implement SMDA, FDA published a tentative final rule in the November 26, 1991,
Federal Register and invited comments on the regulation. Over 300 comments were received.
Then, on June 16, 1992, the President signed into law the Medical Device Amendments of 1992
(Public Law 102-300; the Amendments of 1992), amending certain provisions (section 519 of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) relating to reporting of adverse events. The primary impact
of the 1992 Amend-ments on user facility reporting was to establish a single reporting standard
for user facilities, manufacturers, and importers. The final medical device reporting rule
published in the December 11, 1995, Federal Register addresses the comments received by
FDA and the changes mandated by the Amendments of 1992. For easy reference, sections of
the MDR regulation are enclosed in brackets following terms and concepts.
The following tables summarize the MDR requirements for user facilities and manufacturers.

2. USER FACILITY
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
User facilities must report deaths and serious injuries when they become aware of information
that reasonably suggests a medical device has or may have caused or contributed to the adverse
event. They must also establish and maintain adverse event files.
2.1 Type of reports

2.2 Individual adverse event report data
elements [§803.32]

User facilities are required to file two
types of reports:

User facility reports (using FDA Form
3500A) must contain the following:

Individual adverse event reports
[§803.30]

• patient information (block A);

Individual adverse event reports include
reports of death and serious injury which are
submitted on FDA Form 3500A or an
electronic equivalent.

• description of adverse event or product
problem (block B);
• suspect medical device information
(Block D);

A user facility must report to the device
manufacturer and FDA whenever the facility
has information that reasonably suggests a
device has or may have caused or contributed
to a patient’s death. If a facility has
information that reasonably suggests a device
has or may have caused or contributed to a
patient’s serious injury, it must report this
information to the device manufacturer. If
the manufacturer is not known, the report
should be sent to FDA.

• initial reporter information (Block E);
and
• user facility information (Block F)
2.3 Semiannual report data elements
[§803.33]
A semiannual report must contain the
following information:
• user facility’s Health Care Facility
Administration (HCFA) provider number or number assigned by FDA;

Semiannual reports [§803.33]
If any individual adverse event report
was submitted during the previous 6-month
reporting period, a user facility must submit a
semiannual report to FDA on FDA Form
3419, or an approved electronic equivalent.
Semiannual reports are due by January 1 (for
reports made July through December) and by
July 1 (for reports made January through
June) of each year.

• reporting year and period, e.g., January
through June or July through December;
• facility’s name and complete address;
• total number of reports attached or
summarized;
• date of the semiannual report and the
lowest and highest report numbers
submitted during the report period; e.g.,
1234567890-1995-0001 through 1000;

A semiannual report should not be
submitted if no individual reports were
submitted to FDA or manufacturers during
the reporting period.
3

•

•

name, position title, and complete
address of the individual designated
as the facility contact person
responsible for reporting to FDA,
and whether or not that person is a
new contact for that facility; and

Semiannual reports are due on January 1
and July 1.
2.5 “Information that reasonably
suggests” [§803.20(c)]
Information that reasonably suggests
that a medical device has caused or
contributed to a MDR reportable event (i.e., a
death or serious injury) includes any
information such as professional, scientific,
or medical facts and observations or opinions
that a device has caused or may have caused
or contributed to a reportable event.

information for each reportable
event that occurred during the
semiannual reporting period
including:
- user facility report number;
- name and address of the device
manufacturer;

2.6 “Information that is reasonably
known” to user facilities [§803.30].

- device brand name and common
name;

User facilities must provide all
information that is reasonably known to them.
This includes information found in
documents in the possession of the user
facility and any
information that becomes available as a
result of reasonable follow-up within the
facility. A user facility is not required to
evaluate or investigate the event by obtaining
or evaluating information that is not
reasonably known to it.

- product model, catalog, serial, and
lot number;
- a brief description of the event
reported to the manufacturer
and/or
FDA; and
- where the report was submitted,
i.e., to FDA, manufacturer,
distributor, etc.

2.7 Requests for additional information
[§803.15]

In lieu of submitting a summary of each
reported event, a user facility may complete
only Part 1 of FDA Form 3419 and attach a
copy of each mandatory report (FDA Form
3500A, or an approved electronic equivalent)
filed during the reporting period. The copies
and envelope should be clearly identified as
“Semiannual Report.”

FDA may determine that protection of
the public health requires additional or
clarifying information for an MDR report. In
these instances and when additional
information is beyond the scope of FDA
reporting forms, or is not readily accessible,
the agency will notify the user facility of the
additional information that is required. Any
request will state the reason or purpose for
which the information is being requested,
specify the date that the
information is to be submitted, and clearly
relate the request to a reported event. All
verbal requests will be confirmed in writing
by FDA.

2.4 When to report [§803.20]
All individual reports of death and
serious injury must be submitted within 10
work days from the time that any medical
personnel of the facility becomes aware of a
reportable event.
4

alternative reporting media (magnetic tape,
disc, FAX, etc.) and computer-to-computer
communi-cation. Any electronic report
meeting electronic reporting standards,
guidelines, or other procedures developed by
FDA for MDR, will be deemed to have prior
approval for use.

2.8 When not to file [§803.22]
If a user facility becomes aware of
information from multiple sources regarding
the same patient and same event, only one
MDR report is required. An MDR report is
not required if the user facility determines
that the information received is erroneous,
because a device-related adverse event did
not occur. Documentation of such reports
must also be retained in the facility’s MDR
files for two (2) years.

2.13 Where to get forms and coding
manual [§803.11]
FDA forms 3500A and 3419,
instructions, and the coding manual necessary
to complete 3500A are available through the
Internet at:

2.9 Exemptions, variances, and
alternative reporting. [§803.19]
Upon written application or at its own
discretion, FDA may grant a user facility an
exemption, a variance, or an alternative form
of reporting and may change the frequency of
reporting. When FDA grants an exemption,
variance, or alternative form of reporting, it
may impose other reporting requirements to
ensure the protection of public health. It may
also revoke or modify any exemption,
variance, or alterative form of reporting, if
necessary.

3. WRITTEN PROCEDURES, RECORD
KEEPING, AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE
User facilities must develop, implement, and maintain written procedures for reporting
adverse medical device events. In addition to reporting device-related deaths and serious injuries,
user facilities must establish and maintain MDR files.
3.1 Written procedures [§803.17]

3.2 Files [§803.18]

Written procedures include internal
systems that provide:

User facilities must establish and maintain MDR event files. MDR event files are
written or electronic files maintained by the
user facility. They must be prominently
identified as such and filed to facilitate timely
access. MDR files must contain:

•

for timely and effective identification, communication, and evaluation of adverse events;

•

a standardized review process and
procedure for determining whether
or not an event is reportable; and

•

procedures to assure the timely
transmission of complete reports.

User facilities must also establish,
implement, and maintain written procedures
to assure compliance with documentation and
record-keeping requirements. This includes:
•

information that was evaluated to
determine if an event was
reportable;

•

all MDR reports and information
submitted to FDA and manufacturers;

•

information in the possession of the
user facility or references to information related to the event. This
includes all documentation of the
reporting decisions and decisionmaking process; and

•

copies of all completed MDR forms
and other information submitted to
FDA, distributors, and manufacturers.

Records related to an adverse event,
whether reported or not, must be kept for two
(2) years from the date of the event. A user
facility must permit FDA employees to have
access, at all reasonable times, to all required
records for copying and verification.
3.3 Public availability of reports [§803.9]

•

•

any information that was evaluated
for the purpose of preparing the
submission of semiannual reports;
and

Certain information from MDR reports,
including any FDA record of a telephone
report, is available for public disclosure.
Before public disclosure of a report, FDA will
delete from the report:

systems that ensure access to
information that facilitates timely
followup and inspection by FDA.

•

7

any information that constitutes
trade secret or confidential
commercial or financial
information;

•

•

any personal, medical, and similar
information (including the serial
number of implanted devices)
which would constitute an
unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy; and
any names and other identifying
information of a third party
voluntarily submitting an MDR
report. This includes physicians,
healthcare professionals, or other
hospital employees, unless they are
designated the MDR contact
person.

•

a communication to a manufacturer
of a device which is the subject of a
report required by a user facility;

•

a disclosure relating to an MDR
report required by a manufacturer or
distributor; or

•

a disclosure to employees of the
Department of Health and Human
Services and to the Department of
Justice or to duly authorized
committees and subcommittees of
the U.S. Congress.

3.4 Disclaimers [§803.16]
FDA will disclose to a patient
requesting a report all information in the
report concern-ing that patient.

Submission of a report or information
under MDR, as well as any release by FDA
of that report or information, does not
necessarily reflect that FDA or the submitter
admit or conclude that the device, the user
facility, or its employees caused or
contributed to the reportable event.

FDA will not disclose the identity of a
user facility which makes a report except in
connection with:
•

an action brought to enforce the
medical device reporting requirements, including the failure or
refusal to furnish material or
information;

MedWatch Form 3500A contains a
disclaimer statement at the bottom of the
front page.

4. ENFORCEMENT

FDA has criminal and civil penalty authority to enforce the MDR requirements.
4.1 Authority to enforce MDR
Criminal penalty authority: Failure to comply with the MDR requirements is a prohibited
act under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). Commission of a prohibited act may
subject user facilities to injunction proceedings under Section 302 and criminal penalties under
Section 303 of the FD&C Act.
Criminal penalties may be up to a $1,000 fine and one year imprisonment for the first offense
if the offense was unintentional, and up to $10,000 and three years imprisonment for subsequent
offenses, or for intentional offense.
Civil penalty authority: Failure to comply with MDR reporting requirements may result in
civil penalties if the failure is a significant or knowing departure from the requirements, or a risk to
public health. Civil penalties are fines imposed administratively by FDA for noncompliance with
the provisions of SMDA. A person who receives a civil penalty is entitled to a hearing before an
Admini-strative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ’s decision may be appealed to the Commissioner of
FDA, and the Commissioner’s decision may be appealed to a U.S. Court of Appeals. Penalties
may not exceed $15,000 per violation or $1,000,000 for all violations adjudicated in a single
proceeding.

an entity) that operates for the primary
purpose of providing:

5.6 Malfunction [§803.3(m)]
A malfunction is failure of a device to
meet its performance specifications or to
perform as intended. Performance
specifications include all claims made in the
labeling for the device. The intended
performance of a device refers to the intended
use for which the device is labeled or
marketed. (See 6.14 for user facilities.)
5.7 MDR [§803.3(p)]

local government, or whether or not it is
accredited by a recognized accreditation
organization. If an adverse event meets the
criteria for report-ing, the nursing home must
report that event regardless of the nature or
location of the medical service provided by
the nursing home.

5.8 MDR Reportable Event [§803.3(q)]
An "MDR reportable event" is an event
about which a user facility becomes aware of
information that reasonably suggests that a
device has or may have caused or contributed
to a death or serious injury.
5.9 Medical Personnel [§803.3(r)]
“Medical personnel” means an
individual who:

criteria for report-ing, the outpatient
diagnostic facility must report that event
regardless of the nature or location of the
medical service provided by the outpatient
diagnostic facility.

5.13 Patient of the Facility [§803.3(v)]
“Patient of the facility” means any
individual who is being diagnosed or treated
and/or receiving medical care at or under the
control or authority of the facility. For the
purpose of the MDR regulation, the definition
encompasses employees of the faculty or
individuals affiliated with the facility who, in
the course of their duties, suffer a devicerelated death or serious injury that has or may
have been caused or contributed to by a
device used at the facility.

manufacturers and FDA. This number
consists of three parts:

5.15 Serious Injury [§803.3(aa)]
•

the user facility’s 10-digit Health
Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) number. If the HCFA
number is less than 10 digits, fill the
remaining spaces with zeros;

•

the four-digit calendar year in which
the report is submitted; and

•

the four-digit sequence number of
the reports submitted for the year,
starting with 0001. For example, a
complete number will appear as
follows: 1234567890-1996-0001.

“Serious injury” means an injury or
illness that is:
•

life threatening;

•

results in permanent impairment of
a body function or permanent
damage to a body structure; or

•

necessitates medical or surgical
intervention to preclude permanent
damage or impairment.

If a facility has more than one HFCA
number, it must select one number that will
be used for all of its MDR reports.

5.16 Permanent [§803.3(aa)(2)]
Permanent damage or impairment is
irreversible damage or impairment that is not
trivial.

5.18 Work day [§803.3(ee)]

6. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
The following are questions that FDA is frequently asked. They provide background
information on MDR and attempt to explain some of FDA’s policy decisions.
user facilities to determine when injuries
caused by devices must be reported to FDA.

6.1 Why did Congress require medical
device reporting for user facilities?
Congress enacted the Safe Medical
Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA) based on its
review of the 1976 Amendments to the Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act. Congress
believed that significant changes were needed
in the statutes, so that FDA could better
protect the public health.

Single definition of types of injuries
that must be reported
Section 5(a) of the 1992 Amendments
adopted a single definition for the types of
injuries that user facilities, manufacturers,
importers, and distributors must report. The
definition now requires reporting of an injury
or illness that is:

As a result of Congressional hearings
and studies conducted by the General
Accounting Office, Congress concluded that
FDA received less than adequate information
about problems with medical devices. With
better information, FDA can take appropriate
actions to protect the public from hazardous
medical devices.
6.2 How do the Medical Device
Amendments of 1992 affect medical
device reporting?
The Medical Device Amendments
of 1992 modified the reporting of adverse
device events as follows:

•

life-threatening; or

•

results in permanent impairment of
a body function or permanent
damage to a body structure; or

•

necessitates medical or surgical
intervention to preclude permanent
impairment of a body function or
permanent damage to a body structure.

It deleted the SMDA requirement that an
injury must require “immediate medical or
surgical intervention” to preclude permanent
impairment or damage in order to qualify as a
reportable adverse event.

Adoption of a single reporting
standard
Section 5(a) of the 1992 Amendments
revised the reporting requirements for user
facilities to report whenever the facility
receives or otherwise becomes aware of
information that reasonably suggests that a
device “has or may have caused or
contributed” to the death, serious illness, or
serious injury of a patient of the facility. This
statutory language change adopts a single
standard for manufacturers, importers, and

New authority to require reporting of
“other significant adverse device
experiences”
The 1992 Amendments also authorized
FDA to issue regulations requiring the
reporting of “significant adverse device
experiences” other than deaths, serious
injuries, or serious illnesses that the agency
determines are necessary to be reported. This
15

provision will be implemented in a future
regulation.

6.6 Our facility has more than one HCFA
number. Which one should we use?
If a facility has more than one HCFA
number, it must select one to use for all MDR
reports. If a facility has no HCFA number, it
should use all zeros in the appropriate space
in its initial report (e.g., 0000000000-1995-0001), and FDA will assign a number for
future use. The number assigned will be used
in FDA’s record of that report and in any
correspondence with the user facility. All
zeros should be used subsequent to the first
report, if the user does not receive the FDA’s
assigned number before the next report is
submitted. If a facility has multiple sites, the
primary site can report centrally and use one
reporting number for all sites. A primary site
must provide FDA the name, address, and
HCFA number for each respective site with
its first report.

6.3 What is the relationship between
medical device reporting and user
facility reporting?
User facility reporting is a component or
subset of FDA’s Medical Device Reporting
(MDR) program. Since 1984, manufacturers
and importers have been required to report
device-related deaths, serious injuries, and
certain malfunctions. SMDA amended the
medical device provisions of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act by requiring user facilities
to notify manufacturers and/or FDA of
reportable events.
6.4 What is MedWatch and how does it
relate to MDR and user facility
reporting?

6.7 What is a device?
MedWatch is FDA’s postmarket
surveillance program for reporting adverse
events associated with all medical products
(drugs, medical devices, biologics, and
special nutritional products) regulated by
FDA. Medical Device Reporting (MDR) is
part of MedWatch, and user facility reporting
is a subset of MDR.

The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
defines the term “device” as “an instrument,
apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance,
implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or
related article, including any component, part,
or accessory, which is:
•

recognized in the official National
Formulary, or the United States
Pharmacopeia, or any supplement
to them;

•

intended for use in the diagnosis of
disease or other conditions, or in the
cure, mitigation, treatment, or
prevention of disease in man or
other animals; or

•

intended to affect the structure or
any function of the body of man or
other animals, and which is not a
drug, i.e., the product does not
achieve its primary intended

6.5 What is the effective date of the final
MDR reporting requirements?
The user facility reporting section of
SMDA has been in effect since November 28,
1991, even though a final regulation for MDR
had not been published. Although the
original effective date for the final MDR rule
was
April 11, 1996, FDA has extended the date to
July 31, 1996. This will provide additional
time for user facilities and manufacturers to
prepare for the new requirements.

16

purposes through chemical action
within or on the body of man or
other animals and which is not
dependent upon being metabolized
for the achievement of its primary
intended purposes.”

6.11 Does an HMO have to report?
User facilities (see 5.4 for definition)
that are part of an HMO or which belong to
an HMO must report.
6.12 Does a user facility need to designate
a contact person? [§803.32(e)(4)]

Examples of medical devices (for which
FDA has received MDR reports) are hospital
beds, heart valves, ventilators, patient
restraints, x-ray machines, defibrillators, and
bandages. Generally, if it is used in medical
practice and it is not a drug or biologic, it is a
device.

Yes. A facility must designate a
contact person with whom FDA can conduct
its correspondence relating to MDR. A third
party may act as a contact person and submit
reports for a user facility.

6.8 Are ambulances and rescue services
required to report device-related
adverse events?

6.13 Are user facilities required to investigate adverse events?
In the final MDR rule, FDA has
clarified that a user facility must report only
information that is “reasonably known” to it
and is not required to investigate adverse
events by obtaining or evaluating information
that is not reasonably known.

Yes. Ambulances and rescue services
fall within the definition of user facility,
because they are outpatient treatment
facilities. Be-cause of the critical risks posed
by potential malfunctions of devices used by
such services, FDA has included them in the
definition of a user facility.

Reasonably known information
includes information found in documents in
the posses-sion of the user facility and any
information that becomes available as a result
of reasonable followup within the facility. Of
course, the user facility must still make an
initial determination as to whether or not an
event should be reported under MDR.

6.9 Why are home healthcare agencies
required to report under MDR?
FDA included home healthcare agencies
in the definition of a user facility because of
the critical risks posed by potential malfunctions of devices used in home healthcare.

6.14 If a device malfunctions but does not
cause a death or serious injury,
should a report be filed?

Home healthcare agencies (as well as
their device distributors) are likely to be the
first to learn of problems with critical home
healthcare devices such as apnea monitors,
ventilators, infusion pumps, etc.

User facilities are encouraged, but are
not required, to report malfunctions that do
not result in a death or serious injury.
Although these reports are voluntary, FDA
recommends that Form 3500A be used to
report to the manufacturer, since this form
provides for more detail about the event and
the device. Such reports provide important
information to the manufacturer and FDA
concerning device safety.

6.10 Are foreign user facilities required
to report under MDR?
No. Only those user facilities located
outside the United States that are operated by
the U.S. Government are required to report
under MDR.
17

6.18 Can a patient’s identity be
protected?

6.15 What does “permanent damage” or
“permanent impairment” mean in
the definition for “serious injury?”

Yes. A patient’s identity will be protected, because FDA does not release any
patient identifiers to the public. A reporter
may submit an identifier in lieu of a patient’s
name. If FDA requires further patient information, the request will be on an exception
basis.

“Permanent” means irreversible
impairment or damage to a body structure or
function, excluding trivial impairment or
damage. While some cosmetic damage may
be considered trivial, not all cosmetic damage
would be considered trivial.

6.19 Can MDR reports submitted to FDA
be used as evidence in a civil action?

6.16 Is “temporary damage” from use of
a device reportable under MDR?

SMDA states that reports are not
admissible into evidence or otherwise used in
any civil action involving private parties,
unless the facility, individual, or physician
who made the report knew that the
information in the report was false.

Yes, if the “temporary damage” was
“life-threatening.” Life-threatening events
that may have been caused by or contributed
to a device must be reported, regardless of
whether or not the damage was “temporary.”
However, temporary damage that is not life
threatening is not reportable.

6.20 Is the identity of a reporter of an
MDR event, such as a physician at
the hospital, releasable under the
Freedom of Information Act?

6.17 Is an “incident file” the same as an
“MDR event file?”
Because of comments received to the
proposed definition of “incident files,” FDA
has changed the definition and renamed it
“MDR event files.” MDR event files include
MDR reports filed (with FDA or other
entities) and any documents related to the
adverse event. This includes documents
relating to deliberations and decision-making
processes used to determine if an event is an
MDR reportable event (even if the facility
decides not to submit an MDR.)

No. FDA will not disclose the identity
of physicians or other employees of the user
facility, although the identity of the user
facility and MDR contact may be disclosed
under certain circumstances described in 3.3.
However, the user facility’s MDR contact
person in Block F of MedWatch Form 3500A
is releasable.

The final MDR regulation also allows
the user facility to incorporate certain
information by reference (such as medical
records, patient files, and engineering reports)
rather than include them in the MDR event
file.

Yes. The language of SMDA, as
amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1992, requires reporting of all
instances that reasonably suggest a device has
or may have caused or contributed to a
device-related death, serious injury, or serious
illness. FDA needs to be aware of events that

6.21 Is “user/operator error” reportable
under MDR?

18

and 11 injuries. FDA’s review also found
that many incidents were the result of
improper use of the device or inadequate
monitoring of the restrained patient. In
response to these findings, FDA issued a
safety alerts to warn the public about dangers
associated with the use of patient restraints.
In addition, FDA designated restraints as
prescrip-tion devices and issued a letter to
manufacturers to revise their labeling to
prevent such improper use. Without the
MDR reports, FDA would not have known
that these actions were needed to protect the
public health.

are related to user error any time such an
error has or may have caused or contributed
to a reportable event. By receiving
information about user problems, FDA can
determine whether or not additional measures
are necessary to resolve the problem, e.g.,
relabeling or redesign of the device.
6.22 Must a user facility allow the manufacturer of a device (involved in a
patient’s death or serious injury)
access to it?
FDA has no legal authority to require
that a device be returned to the manufacturer
or that a manufacturer have access to the
device. However, FDA believes that the
manufacturer of a device should evaluate any
problems with its device. FDA encourages
users to permit
access to or return of the device to the
manufacturer for evaluation.

In 1995, FDA received over 100,000
MDR reports, many of which were submitted
by user facilities.

6.23 Does MDR really help prevent device
problems?
Yes. For example, a review of MDR
reports concerning patient restraints revealed
34 deaths
