TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS
SUBJECT: Clarification of Compliance Requirements for Certain Manufacturers

Who Incorporate Certified Class I Laser Products into Their Products

BACKGROUND:

Numerous questions have arisen regarding the applicability of 21 CFR 1040.10(i),
Modification of a Certified Product, in those situations in which a firm
purchases a certified Class I laser product and incorporates it into another
product for sale. Examples of this practice include certified Class 1 optical
disc drive units incorporated into computers, compact disc players installed in
home entertainment centers, and compact disc players installed in automobiles.

POLICY:

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) will consider firms
incorporating certified Class I laser products into another product to be
distributors of laser products certified and reported by other manufacturers
provided the following conditions are met:

1. No modification of performance or intended use of the certified
product is made and incorporation of the certified laser product
results only in concealment of the original manufacturer’s
certification and identification labels required by Part 1010; and

2. The labeling requirements of 21 CFR 1010 and 1040.10(g) for the
Class I laser product would be met when the certified product is
removed from the product into which it had been incorporated; and

3. The labeling requirements of 21 CFR 1040.10(g) for the Class I laser
product would be met in any service configuration of the certified
laser product, even when that product could be serviced without
removal from the incorporating product; and

4. The laser safety information provided by the certifying manufacturer
is distributed with the final product.

Distributors of laser products must only comply with the recordkeeping
requirements of Part 1002. Distributors need not submit initial and annual
reports described in Part 1002 nor apply new certification and identification
labels to the outside of the final product.
