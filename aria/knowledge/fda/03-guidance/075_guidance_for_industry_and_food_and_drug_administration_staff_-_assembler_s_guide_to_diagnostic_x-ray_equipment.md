Assembler’s Guide to Diagnostic X-Ray
Equipment
Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is charged with the responsibility
for enforcing regulations created under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of
1968 (Public Law 90-602) (the Act). The Act was later moved to the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) with the passage of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990, in
a new section entitled Electronic Product Radiation Control (EPRC), under Subchapter V –
Part C. The regulations written under the Act are covered in 21 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter J,
and the Diagnostic X-ray Performance Standards for Electronic Products. These regulations
cover the manufacturing, importing, and installation of equipment that emits electronic
product radiation to achieve its intended purpose or as a byproduct of meeting its intended
purpose. Specific regulations under "Diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components"
(21 CFR 1020.30), "Radiographic equipment" (21 CFR 1020.31), "Fluoroscopic equipment"
(21 CFR 1020.32), and "Computed tomography (CT) equipment," (21 CFR 1020.33) cover
aspects of the performance of each listed type of equipment and place specific requirements
on the manufacturers, importers, dealers, distributors, and assemblers of the covered
equipment. The term “Performance Standards” will be used in this document to refer to
these regulations collectively known as the Performance Standards for Diagnostic X-ray
Systems and Their Major Components. This document addresses only requirements that
apply to diagnostic x-ray equipment under the EPRC provisions of the FD&C Act. This
document does not address requirements that apply to such equipment under the medical
device provisions of the FD&C Act.
As a part of the requirements under the Performance Standards, manufacturers of diagnostic
x-ray equipment that is used on human patients must comply with all applicable requirements
in the Performance Standards covered in 21 CFR 1020.30, 1020.31, 1020.32, and 1020.33.

They must also affix labels to their products that declare they are certifying those products to
meet the regulations (21 CFR 1010.2). Many diagnostic x-ray systems consist of
components from different manufacturers while other systems use components from a single
manufacturer. Whether these systems comply with the Performance Standards is dependent
upon proper installation and final testing of the complete system at the user location, which
FDA considers the final step in the manufacture of these systems.
In general, FDA's guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
A. General Responsibilities of Manufacturers of Diagnostic X-Ray
Equipment
21 CFR 1000.3(n) defines a manufacturer as "any person engaged in the business of
manufacturing, assembling, or importing electronic products."
In general, manufacturers must:
1. Certify that each component complies with the Performance Standards. Certification
of compliance means the manufacturer guarantees the component will perform as
required by the Performance Standards when it is assembled, installed, adjusted,
tested, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (21 CFR
1020.30(c)).
2. Place certification and identification labels complete with the full name and address
of the manufacturer, date and place of manufacture, model designation, and serial
number on each component (21 CFR 1020.30(e)).
3. Provide the assembler with instructions for assembly, installation, adjustment, and
testing of the component adequate to assure the product will comply with the
Performance Standards when the instructions are followed. The instructions must
also provide specifications for other components that are compatible with the
component to be installed when compliance of the component or system depends on
such compatibility. The specifications may describe physical characteristics of
compatible components and/or may list, by manufacturer's name and model
designation, specific components that are compatible (21 CFR 1020.30(g)).
4. Provide the purchaser with instructions describing specific technical specifications of
the equipment and any necessary radiological safety precautions and procedures.
This information must include a recommended maintenance schedule required to
keep the equipment in compliance with the Performance Standards (21 CFR
1020.30(h)).

B. General Responsibilities of Assemblers of Diagnostic X-Ray Equipment
21 CFR 1020.30(b) defines an assembler as "any person engaged in the business of
assembling, replacing, or installing one or more components into a diagnostic x-ray system
or subsystem. The term includes the owner of an x-ray system or his or her employee or
agent who assembles components into an x-ray system that is subsequently used to provide
professional or commercial services." This is true even if the individual is not normally in
the business of installing such equipment.
Although the above clearly specifies that the "assembler" is also a "manufacturer," the
Performance Standards have different requirements for each.
Assembler responsibilities, outlined in 21 CFR 1020.30, are applicable to all assemblers of
diagnostic x-ray systems and/or components installed into any system used on live human
patients.
"1020.30(d) Assemblers' responsibility. An assembler who installs one or more components
certified as required by paragraph (c) of this section shall install certified components that
are of the type required by Sections 1020.31, 1020.32, or 1020.33 and shall assemble, install,
adjust, and test the certified components according to the instructions of their respective
manufacturers. Assemblers shall not be liable for noncompliance of a certified component if
the assembly of that component was according to the component manufacturer's instruction.
(1) Reports of assembly. All assemblers who install certified components shall file
a report of assembly, except as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
The report will be construed as the assembler's certification and identification
under Sections 1010.2 and 1010.3 of this chapter. The assembler shall affirm
in the report that the manufacturer's instructions were followed in the assembly
or that the certified components as assembled into the system meet all
applicable requirements of Sections 1020.30 through 1020.33. All assembler
reports must be on a form (Form FDA 2579 made available at
https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/reports-manuals-forms/forms) prescribed by the
Director, CDRH. Completed reports must be submitted to the purchaser, and,
where applicable, to the State agency responsible for radiation protection
within 15 days following completion of the assembly."

III. Policy ­ The Assembly of Certified Diagnostic X­ray
Equipment
1. QUESTION: What reporting requirements apply to assemblers of x-ray systems?
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

ANSWER: The Performance Standards permit the assembler, who only installs components
or systems manufactured by others, to meet most of the reporting and recordkeeping
requirements by filing the report of assembly (Form FDA 2579) specified in 21 CFR
1020.30(d)(1) and keeping copies for at least five years (21 CFR 1002.1(c)(4)). The only
other reporting requirement placed on such assemblers is found under 21 CFR 1002.20,
which requires assemblers to file reports of situations where accidental radiation occurrences
have occurred or where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that such an incident has
occurred.
2. QUESTION: What is an accidental radiation occurrence (ARO)?
ANSWER: An ARO means "a single accidental event or series of accidental events that
has/have resulted in injurious or potentially injurious exposure of any person to electronic
product radiation as a result of the manufacturing, testing, or use of an electronic product."
(21 CFR 1000.3(a))
3. QUESTION: Must an assembler report AROs?
ANSWER: Yes. If an assembler becomes involved with or aware that such a situation
exists or where reasonable grounds for suspecting that such an incident has occurred, he/she
must notify the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (21 CFR 1002.20). Such reports
shall be submitted either electronically through the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health eSubmitter1 at https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-esubmitter/radiological-healthprogram or addressed to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and
Radiological Health, ATTN: Accidental Radiation Occurrence Reports, Document Mail
Center, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 66, rm. G609, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.
The reports and their envelopes shall be distinctly marked "Report on 1002.20" and shall
contain all of the following information, where known:
(1) The nature of the accidental radiation occurrence,
(2) The location at which the accidental radiation occurrence occurred,
(3) The manufacturer, type, and model number of the electronic product or products
involved,
(4) The circumstances surrounding the accidental radiation occurrence, including
causes,

1

If submitting the ARO report electronically, please follow the instructions in item 6, "Determine if there are
any (or if you are aware of any) radiation safety concerns," at https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/getting-radiation-emitting-product-market-frequently-asked-questions/submitting-reports-andrequirements-maintaining-records-radiation

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(5) The number of persons involved, adversely affected, or exposed during the
accidental radiation occurrence, the nature and magnitude of their exposure and/or
injuries and, if requested by the Director, Center for Devices and Radiological
Health, the names of the persons involved,
(6) The actions, if any, taken by the manufacturer, to control, correct, or eliminate the
causes and to prevent reoccurrence, and
(7) Any other pertinent information with respect to the accidental radiation
occurrence.
The assembler should also notify (1) the user, (2) the State and local radiation control
authorities, and (3) the component manufacturer.

A. Components and Systems
4. QUESTION: What are certified components?
ANSWER: Certified components are specified components manufactured after an effective
date (as published in the Performance Standards) that a manufacturer has designed,
manufactured, and tested to meet the applicable requirements of 21 CFR 1020. Each
manufacturer certifies that, when installed and tested according to manufacturer instructions,
the resulting system will meet all applicable requirements. The manufacturer must affix a
certification label to each component to indicate that the component complies with the
Performance Standards (see 21 CFR 1010.2). Each component manufactured after its
specified effective date must be certified.
5. QUESTION: What is a certified x-ray system?
ANSWER: A certified system is one that is assembled of all certified compatible
components that are designed to function together as a system meeting all applicable
requirements in 21 CFR 1020.
6. QUESTION: What components are subject to the Performance Standards?
ANSWER: The following specific components are included along with any other
components that behave in substantially the same way (i.e., serve the same function) as those
listed. For example, x-ray timers are not listed below, but they are certifiable components
requiring inclusion in the report of assembly because they serve substantially the same
function as components listed in the regulations (see 21 CFR 1002.1 Table 1, and
1020.30(a)):
·
·

Tube housing assemblies (tube housings with x-ray tube installed)
X-ray controls (includes exposure timers when housed separately)

10, 2006
Electrically powered fluoroscopic image receptors in x-ray systems manufactured on
or after June 10, 2006.

7. QUESTION: Can I legally modify a certified component or system and, if so, do I need
to file the report of assembly?
ANSWER: If you are an owner of a diagnostic x-ray system and use the system in a
professional or commercial capacity or are acting under the instructions of such an owner,
you may, under certain conditions, modify certified components and/or systems without
filing report of assembly. Certified components or systems may be modified, provided that
the modification does not result in the failure of the x-ray component or system to comply
with the Performance Standards (see 21 CFR 1020.30(q)). Modifications that adversely
affect the compliance of a component or system are permitted only when a variance has been
granted in accordance with the regulations (see 21 CFR 1010.4).
An owner who modifies his/her x-ray system without affecting compliance (including
compatibility) need not submit the report of assembly usually required of manufacturers
and/or assemblers, but is required to record the date and the details of the modification and
retain that information (see 21 CFR 1020.30(q)).
8. QUESTION: What does the FDA mean when referring to the "repair" of a component or
system?
ANSWER: Repair of a certified component or system means the act of bringing a
malfunctioning item back to the original manufacturer’s specification.

B. Restrictions on Assembly of Components
The certification status of the components in a system influences the ability of an assembler
to legally install additional components into an existing system.
9. QUESTION: What requirements are applicable to assembly and reassembly of diagnostic
x-ray systems?
ANSWER: The rules covering the assembly and reassembly of these systems are addressed
in 21 CFR 1020.30(d). The important points to remember are:
1. A new system, consisting of all unused components, may only be assembled with all
certified or all uncertified2 (manufactured before August 1, 1974) components.
2. A complete x-ray system may be assembled from all uncertified (manufactured
before August 1, 1974) components, without restriction, if all components were never
previously assembled into an x-ray system.
3. A complete x-ray system may be assembled from all certified components, without
restriction, if all components have documented necessary compatibility.
4. An existing x-ray system that contains all uncertified components may be
reassembled. Additional or replacement components must all be uncertified or all
certified. (This excludes repair or exact replacement of uncertified components.)
5. An x-ray system that contains one or more certified components may be reassembled.
Additional or replacement components must all be certified. (This excludes repair or
exact replacement of uncertified components.)
6. Exchange of an uncertified component for an identical uncertified component or
reinstallation of any component following repair of the component to its original
condition is not considered assembly or reassembly for the purposes of the
Performance Standards.
10. QUESTION: What does "accessory component" mean? Must the installation of such
components be filed as a report of assembly and reported to the purchaser, and, where
applicable, to the State agency responsible for radiation protection?
ANSWER: Accessory component means (21 CFR 1020.30(b)):
1. A component used with diagnostic x-ray systems, such as a cradle or film changer,
that is not necessary for the compliance of the system with applicable provisions of
this subchapter but which requires an initial determination of compatibility with the
system, or
2. A component necessary for compliance of the system with applicable provisions of
this subchapter but which may be interchanged with similar compatible components

2

CDRH defines an "uncertified component" as a diagnostic x-ray component that was manufactured before
August 1, 1974, and not certified before that date by the manufacturer. Questions related to uncertified
component can be directed to OHT8.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

without affecting the system's compliance, such as one of a set of interchangeable
beam-limiting devices, or
3. A component compatible with all x-ray systems with which it may be used and that
does not require compatibility or installation instructions. An example of a certified
accessory component which needs no reporting is a tabletop cassette holder without a
front panel.
If the manufacturer of such accessory components has certified the product, then no report of
assembly is required.
Components falling into categories 1 or 2 (above) do not require filing a report of assembly
for subsequent use of the accessory within other compatible systems within the same facility.
However, permanent relocation of a certified accessory component into a compatible
system(s) at a new address does require submission of another report of assembly to certify
compatibility and installation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (21 CFR
1020.30(d)(1)). Accessory components in category 3 (above) deserve special attention in
that their use within a system(s) does not require assembly. If the manufacturer of such
accessory components has indicated that no specific assembly is required, for instance, in the
system manuals (e.g., installation, user, etc.), then the assembler's reporting and certification
requirements of 21 CFR 1020.30(d) are not applicable.
11. QUESTION: What does "compatibility" mean when referring to components and why is
it important?
ANSWER: Many diagnostic x-ray systems are assembled from individual components.
Many times, these components may be manufactured by different firms and at different
times, often years apart. To assure that they will work together to form a system compliant
with the Performance Standards, a statement of compatibility is required from each
component manufacturer.
There are three definitions of compatibility that apply to diagnostic x-ray systems.
a. Operational or Functional Compatibility
Prior to the effective date of the Performance Standards, any combination of
components could be interconnected, provided the operational functions of the system
were not impaired to an extent objectionable to the user. This definition of
compatibility differs from the Performance Standard's implied definition of
compatibility (21 CFR 1020.30(g) and (h)). Installations based only on operational or
functional compatibility are no longer acceptable for installations involving certified
components.
b. Manufacturer Specified Compatibility
As implied by the name, this type of compatibility is specified by manufacturers of
certified diagnostic x-ray components. It means that when compatible components
are brought together following the manufacturer’s assembly and testing instructions,
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

the finished subassembly or system will meet the requirements of the Performance
Standards. According to these standards, it is the responsibility of the manufacturers
of individual components or systems to specify the compatibility of certified
components (see 21 CFR 1020.30(g) and (h)). If none of the manufacturers state
compatibility, either by specific model designation or a description of pertinent
physical characteristics, then the components are described as noncompatible and, if
installed, should be so stated on the assembler's forms. Operational compatibility,
although important, does not justify the assembly of certified components not stated
to be compatible by the manufacturers, since it is not known if they will perform in
accordance with the Performance Standards. An installation involving a
noncompatible, certified component is allowed only when a compatible component is
not commercially available and in conjunction with an approved variance (21 CFR
1010.4).
c. Noncompatible
Any components that rely on the performance or characteristic(s) of other
components for which no compatibility has been stated are considered to be
noncompatible.
NOTE: When the terms "compatible" or "compatibility" appear in this document, it is
intended that they reference the manufacturer specified compatibility, unless otherwise
indicated.
12. QUESTION: Is it necessary that compatibility be stated between all of the components
installed in a diagnostic x-ray system?
ANSWER: No. Compatibility statements are required of component manufacturers only
when the interconnection or use together of those components depends on their compatibility
(21 CFR 1020.30(g) and (h)). An example requiring a compatibility statement is a high
voltage generator used with a control. An example when the compatibility statement is not
required is an x-ray table installed with a permanently mounted wall cassette holder.
NOTE: If these were installed into a system having positive beam limitation (PBL), each
would require a statement of compatibility with the PBL collimator, but not with each other.
13. QUESTION: How should an assembler determine if there are any compatible
components for a particular situation?
ANSWER: An assembler, in attempting to determine commercial availability of a
component, should, at a minimum, take the following steps to find a compatible component:
(1) Consult the information supplied by the manufacturer of the certified component being
installed to see if the manufacturer has made a determination of compatibility regarding the
component or an alternate model for the system in question; if unsuccessful, (2) consult the
manufacturer(s) of the component(s) of the system not meeting the specification for
compatibility to determine if alternate components exist which would be compatible and
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

perform the intended functions. If the lack of compatibility was simply an oversight, contact
one or more of the manufactures to determine if they are willing to state compatibility.
14. QUESTION: What is meant by "commercial availability" and how does an assembler
determine commercial availability?
ANSWER: A component is "commercially available'' if it can be supplied by any
manufacturer within a reasonable time period.
15. QUESTION: If there are no commercially available compatible components, is it
permissible to interconnect components for which no statement of compatibility exists?
ANSWER: Certified components which are not compatible may not be interconnected
without a variance from the Performance Standards (see 21 CFR 1010.4).

C. Problematic Assembly Situations
16. QUESTION: If the manufacturer's instructions to the assembler are inadequate,
confusing, or incorrect in any way, is the assembler obligated to complete the installation?
ANSWER: If the instructions are unclear, the assembler should advise the manufacturer that
there is some confusion related to a particular installation and request clarification. The
“Comments” section of the report of assembly form is an appropriate means of documenting
such problems. Installation should be postponed if the problem could result in the assembled
equipment being noncompliant with the Performance Standards.
17. QUESTION: May an assembler refuse to connect equipment to a user’s power source?
ANSWER: Yes. The assembler of the x-ray control is required to assemble, install, adjust,
and test the certified component in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Connection of the unit MUST be refused if the required power specified by the manufacturer
is not available (21 CFR 1020.30(d)).

D. Temporary Installations
19. QUESTION: A component occasionally needs to be removed from a system for an
extended time for repair. Is it acceptable to temporarily install a compatible replacement
component so that the facility can resume using the system?
ANSWER: Yes. A compatible replacement component may be installed to temporarily
replace a component while it is being repaired. If the original component is certified, the
loaner must be certified (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). Upon installation of a certified loaner
component, the assembler is not required to file a report of assembly provided the loaner
component is (1) clearly labeled as a temporarily installed component and (2) bears a
temporary tag or label with the statement shown in the response to Question 22 below, (or a
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

temporary report of assembly stating the component involved is temporary) signed and dated
by the assembler affirming compliance with all applicable requirements of the Performance
Standards (see 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2)). Even though a report of assembly is not required, the
FDA considers the installation of a certified loaner component to be the introduction of the
component into commerce and the dealer, distributor, and manufacturer are still required to
maintain all of the records specified under 21 CFR 1002.40.

E. Reports of Assembly
20. QUESTION: What is a "Report of Assembly of a Diagnostic X-ray System"?
ANSWER: A report of assembly is a form (form FDA 2579) to document that an assembler
has installed the system or component according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
Performance Standards require that anyone who assembles a certified component into a
human use diagnostic x-ray system complete form FDA 2579 and that completed reports
must be submitted to the purchaser and, where applicable, to the State agency responsible for
radiation protection within 15 days following completion of the assembly (except as outlined
below) (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). This applies regardless of whether the assembler installs an
entire system or adds or replaces a single certified component into an existing system. It also
applies to users of systems who install a certified component into an x-ray system, even for
their own use. Many diagnostic x-ray systems consist of separate components that only
become a system at the user location. This means that the assembler’s installation of the
component(s) into an x-ray system is the last step in the manufacturing process. The form
serves as documentation that the equipment installed is certified, compatible with other
components in the system, was installed and tested following the manufacturer's instructions,
and is of the type called for by the Performance Standards.
21. QUESTION: How can I obtain form FDA 2579?
ANSWER: Form FDA 2579 is available for download as a PDF, at
https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/reports-manuals-forms/forms
22. QUESTION: Are there any exceptions to the requirement to file reports of assembly?
ANSWER: Yes. The Performance Standards have provisions for some exceptions to the
assembler reporting requirements and they are included under 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2).
21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2) states:
"Exceptions to reporting requirements. Reports of assembly need not be submitted
for any of the following:
(i)

Reloaded or replacement tube housing assemblies that are
reinstalled in or newly assembled into an existing x-ray system;
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(ii)

Certified accessory components;

(iii)

Repaired components, whether or not removed from the system and
reinstalled during the course of repair, provided the original
installation into the system was reported; or

(iv)

(A) Components installed temporarily in an x-ray system in place of
components removed temporarily for repair, provided the
temporarily installed component is identified by a tag or label
bearing the following information:
Temporarily Installed Component
“This certified component has been assembled, installed,
adjusted, and tested by me according to the instructions provided
by the manufacturer.”
Signature
Company Name
Street Address, P.O. Box
City, State, Zip Code
Date of Installation
(B) The replacement of the temporarily installed component by a
component other than the component originally removed for repair
shall be reported as specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section."

NOTE: The exception in 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2)(i) applies to those tube housing assemblies
that are equivalent to those being replaced. If the tube housing assembly differs from the one
it is replacing, the assembler should complete form FDA 2579. See also QUESTION 10 for
additional discussion of reporting of accessory components.
23. QUESTION: What does the filing of the report of assembly mean regarding the
assembler responsibility?
ANSWER: In signing the form, an assembler takes legal responsibility for the following:
·

·

the certified components installed were:
(a) adjusted and tested according to the instructions provided by the
manufacturer(s),
(b) of the type required by the manufacturer(s),
(c) of the type called for by the Performance Standards (21 CFR Part 1020),
(d) not modified to adversely affect performance, and
(e) installed in conformance with provisions of 21 CFR Part 1020,
that all instruction manuals and other information required by 21 CFR 1020 for this
assembly were furnished to the purchaser, and
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

·

the assembler will distribute a copy of the form FDA 2579 to the purchaser and,
where applicable, to the State agency responsible for radiation protection within 15
days following completion of the assembly.

24. QUESTION: What is meant by the expression "were of the type required by the
manufacturer(s)" as referenced on the form FDA 2579?
ANSWER: Every manufacturer of a certified component is required to state the
compatibility requirements with other components that may be included in a final assembled
system (see 1020.30(c)). The type required by the manufacturer(s) means that assemblers
must meet these compatibility requirements when matching components for a complete
system (see 21 CFR 1020.30(d)).
25. QUESTION: What is meant by the expression "the type called for by the diagnostic xray performance standard" as referenced on the form FDA 2579?
ANSWER: “The type called for by the diagnostic x-ray performance standard" means that
the assembler has installed certified components in a given system (except for certain
situations mentioned above where pre-August 1, 1974 uncertified components may be
installed) and that all compatibility issues have been resolved.
26. QUESTION: Some requirements in the Performance Standards regarding the type of
components called for in a system are different for "general purpose x-ray systems" and those
that are considered as “other than general purpose." How can an assembler determine if a
system is a "general purpose" system or not?
ANSWER: An x-ray system, designed for and limited by its design for diagnostic purposes
to only one of the following body regions, is classified as "other than general purpose" for
the purposes of 21 CFR 1020.31.
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Extremities;
Head or head and neck;
Thoracic;
Abdominal;
System designed for cystographic, urologic, or other specialized exams of the
kidney, bladder, and/or urinary tract;
6. Dental x-ray system designed for use with intraoral and/or extraoral image
receptors;
7. Cephalometric x-ray system or dental x-ray system designed for use with
extraoral image receptors whenever special cephalometric devices are
attached;
8. An x-ray system designed specifically for chest or spinal radiography when
installed:
a. with a single fixed source-to-image-receptor distance (SID) along the
horizontal axis, or
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

b. with two SIDs along the horizontal axis when exposure at one of the
two SIDs is restricted to image receptors with a dimension greater than
50 centimeters (20 inches);
9. Mammographic x-ray system;
10. Therapy simulation x-ray system;
11. System designed for and installed in operating rooms;
12. Pantomographic x-ray system; or
13. Conventional tomographic x-ray system (when used in the tomographic mode
of operation).
NOTE: Computed tomography (CT) systems are not considered general-purpose
radiographic systems. Any x-ray system, other than a CT system, which by its design is not
limited to radiographic examination of a specific anatomical region and does not meet the
requirements listed above, is considered to be "general purpose" for the purposes of 21 CFR
1020.31.

F. When to File a Report of Assembly (Form FDA 2579)
27. QUESTION: I sometimes install certified diagnostic x-ray components and systems in
veterinary facilities. Must I submit the report of assembly for these installations?
ANSWER: No. The Performance Standards only require filing the form to report
assemblies of certified diagnostic equipment intended for irradiation of any part of the human
body for the purpose of diagnosis or visualization. Veterinary equipment does not require
certification to the Performance Standards, but certified equipment is often installed in
veterinary facilities. The completion and filing of the form are not required for any nonhuman application. Some states and local agencies may have more stringent reporting
requirements and you should check with them regarding their requirements.
28. QUESTION: Our firm is frequently asked to remove diagnostic x-ray systems from
facilities. This is sometimes in preparation for installation of new equipment and other times
the equipment is being removed with no replacement. Does such removal of this equipment
require the reporting on a report of assembly?
ANSWER: No. FDA does not require notification of the removal of either certified or
noncertified x-ray equipment from facilities. Some states do require notification, but the
report of assembly should not be used for this purpose. You should contact the appropriate
state agency for guidance on its requirements.
29. QUESTION: If certified components are transferred from one x-ray system to another in
the same facility, does the assembler have to file a report of assembly?
ANSWER: Yes. If certified components are installed or reassembled (other than
reinstallation of repaired components) into any diagnostic x-ray system, a report of assembly
is required (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). Certified accessory components are excluded from this
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

requirement when moved or interchanged between systems, provided the initial installation
was reported in a report of assembly.
30. QUESTION: If I install a temporary "loaner" component into a system, am I required to
file a report of assembly?
ANSWER: If a loaner component is installed, no report of assembly is required, nor is such
a report required when the original component is reinstalled. A report of assembly is not
required when the loaner component is removed and the original repaired component is
reinstalled into the system. It should be noted that even though the report of assembly is not
required, the FDA considers the installation of a certified loaner component to be the
introduction of the component into commerce and the dealer, distributor, and manufacturer
are still required to maintain all of the records required under 21 CFR 1002.40.
NOTE: When a certified loaner component is removed and replaced with another certified
component that was not previously installed in the system, but will now remain with the
system, the installer must file a new report of assembly (21 CFR 1020.30(d)). This applies
when the replacement component is a new component or an exchange component of the
same type (exact replacement other than tube housing assemblies).
31. QUESTION: Would reinstallation of a repaired certified component into its original
system require a report of assembly?
ANSWER: No. In the case of the repair of a certified component, if the same component is
repaired and reinstalled into the original system, a report of assembly is not required.
However, the installation of any certified component that was not previously a part of the
system requires the assembler to follow the manufacturer's instructions and test procedures
and to file a report of assembly. A report of assembly is required even if the component is
replaced with the same exact model of component. Section 1020.30(d)(2)(i) exempts
"Reloaded or replacement tube housing assemblies that are reinstalled in or newly assembled
into an existing x-ray system" from the requirement to file a report of assembly, however, the
exception applies only to those tube housing assemblies that are equivalent to those they are
replacing. If the tube housing assembly differs from the housing assembly it is replacing,
then the assembler should file a report of assembly and submit copies of the completed report
to the purchaser and, where applicable, to the State agency responsible for radiation
protection within 15 days following completion of the assembly.
32. QUESTION: Is a report of assembly required for the installation of self-contained
(mobile, portable, some dental, etc.,) systems containing certified components?
ANSWER: It depends. In most cases the answer is yes, the form must be filed. However,
there are a few x-ray components or systems, typically limited to portable or hand-held
systems, not requiring assembly upon delivery. For such components or systems, the
manufacturer designed the system so that it would be operational and compliant upon
delivery (i.e., “no assembly required”). If the manufacturer has stated in its assembler/user
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

information that no assembly or installation is required, then no report of assembly is
required. The individual manufacturer is responsible for certifying these systems. The
manufacturer may require the user to perform checks or tests on the system before using the
system on patients. Instructions for conducting those checks or tests must be provided to the
assembler (in this case, the user). If only checks or tests are required, as mentioned above,
and no actual assembly is required, no report of assembly is needed.
33. QUESTION: Our firm does not sell diagnostic x-ray equipment. However, we do rent
and/or lease such equipment to end users. Do we need to file the report of assembly when
we install these systems?
ANSWER: Yes. Leased and loaned components installed at the user's facility are
considered owned by the users for a definite time period. As a result, installation and
recordkeeping requirements are identical to those for any permanent assembly. However, for
certified components on loan, filing a report of assembly is not required, provided the units
are labeled as temporarily installed components. If such labeling is not used, then the
assembly would have to be reported in the usual way.
34. QUESTION: Our firm occasionally installs demonstration units that are on temporary
loan for a facility's assessment prior to committing to a purchase. These units would be
installed, used for a short time, and then removed. Is it necessary to file a report of assembly
for these short-term installations?
ANSWER: CDRH considers such units to be similar to "loaner" components or systems that
may be temporarily installed (no more than 30 days) while a permanent component/system is
undergoing repair.
FDA recommends assemblers check with the State agency responsible for radiation
protection, which may have more stringent requirements regarding the use and reporting of
these systems. Systems used for mammography have additional requirements that must be
met before use on patients, so the Mammography Quality Standards Act regulations (see 21
CFR part 900) should be consulted for such systems. The above opinion does not relieve the
manufacturer, dealer, and/or distributor from their respective responsibilities under 21 CFR
1002.30 and/or 21 CFR 1002.41.
35. QUESTION: Would reinstallation of a repaired certified component require an
assembler's report?
ANSWER: No. In the case of the repair of a certified component, if the same component is
repaired and reinstalled into the original system, a report of assembly is not required.
However, the installation of any certified component that was not previously a part of the
system requires the assembler to follow the manufacturer's instructions and test procedures
and to report such assembly. If the component is replaced by an exact match, the assembly
must also be reported. Note that 1020.30(d)(2) specifically exempts "Reloaded or
replacement tube housing assemblies that are reinstalled in or newly assembled into an
16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

existing x-ray system" from the requirement to file a report of assembly, however, the
exception applies only to those tube housing assemblies that are equivalent to those they are
replacing. If the tube housing assembly differs from that it is replacing, then the assembler
should submit copies of the completed report to the purchaser and, where applicable, to the
State agency responsible for radiation protection within 15 days following completion of the
assembly.
36. QUESTION: If I replace a certified component with an exact replacement, must a report
of assembly be filed?
ANSWER: Yes. Note that 21 CFR 1020.30(d)(2) specifically exempts "Reloaded or
replacement tube housing assemblies that are reinstalled in or newly assembled into an
existing x-ray system" from the requirement to file a report of assembly.
37. QUESTION: If I install a tube housing assembly into an existing system, must I file a
report of assembly?
ANSWER: If the tube housing assembly is identical to the original it is replacing, no report
of assembly is required. However, the assembly of new or existing tube housings must be
reported when installing a new system or relocating a previously existing system and, if the
tube housing assembly installed differs from that being replaced.
39. QUESTION: Changes to the Performance Standards went into effect on June 10, 2006,
covering digital image receptors that are electrically powered or connected to the system.
When we install these components, do we need to file a report of assembly? If so, how do
we enter the information on the form?
ANSWER: A report of assembly is required for electrically powered image receptors
intended for use with fluoroscopic systems (including fluoroscopic systems used for both
fluoroscopy and radiography). When completing the form FDA 2579, select the most correct
descriptors from those in block 3b AND "DIGITAL,” then in block 4h select "OTHER" and
specify the component information in the "COMMENTS" space. The filing of a report of
assembly is not required for radiographic-only digital image receptors. Such an addition to a
radiographic only system is considered as an owner modification to a certified system and is
allowed with the understanding that it will not cause any violation of the applicable
Performance Standards and that records of the modification are retained by the owner as
previously discussed (see QUESTION 7).
40. QUESTION: The June 10, 2006, Performance Standards changes included provisions
covering cumulative air kerma displays and air kerma rate displays. When we install these
components, do we need to file a report of assembly? If so, how do we enter the information
on the current form?
ANSWER: Yes, a report of assembly is required to report the installation of these certified
components. When completing form FDA 2579, select the most correct descriptors from
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

those in block 3b, in block 4h, select "OTHER" and specify the component information in
the "COMMENTS" space.
41. QUESTION: If an assembler realizes that he/she has made an error on an already
submitted report of assembly, how should the assembler correct the error?
ANSWER: The assembler should make the necessary changes and explain the changes in the
"COMMENTS" on the copy of the form FDA 2579, copy the form, and distribute copies to
the purchaser, and, where applicable, to the State agency responsible for radiation protection.

G. Completing the Report of Assembly (Form FDA 2579)
42. QUESTION: The report of assembly seems to imply that a distinction exists between the
terms "assembly" and "reassembly." Please address and clarify any distinction between
"assembly" and "reassembly."
ANSWER: CDRH does make a distinction between the two terms. "Assembly" means the
installation of an unused system or unused component into a system. "Reassembly" means
the installation of a group of components (including any new upgrade components) that were
previously assembled and used as an "x-ray system." Note that the Performance Standards
do not make this distinction and the assembly or reassembly of certified components is
always considered as "assembly" for assembler reporting purposes.
43. QUESTION: The report of assembly seems straightforward, but are there any general
guidelines that might help with completing the form?
ANSWER: The table below provides some further clarifications to help assist in the
completion of the report of assembly.
