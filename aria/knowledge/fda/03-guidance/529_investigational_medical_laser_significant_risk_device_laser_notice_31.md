SUBJECT: Criteria for Considering an Investigational Medical Laser Device
as a Significant Risk Device

Background:

The sponsor of an investigation of any new medical device that exposes

human subjects to the risk of serious injury must submit an application

to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an investigational device
exemption (IDE). If, however, an investigation is considered by the sponsor
and by an appropriate institutional review board (IRB) to involve no
significant risk, then the sponsor may be considered to have an IDE under
the abbreviated requirements of Section 812.2(b). A manufacturer may not
deliver a new medical device to an investigator for use on human subjects
without an IDE, either formally approved by FDA or deemed granted under

the abbreviated requirements. FDA believes that some guidance is appro-
priate for manufacturers of laser products to enable manufacturers to
ascertain the degree of risk and hence the extent of regulatory requirements.

Definitions:

Medical devices are products used in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or
treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health. A
product becomes a medical device when it is intended for that use. A
medical device is considered a new device if substantially equivalent
products were not in commercial distribution, prior to May 28, 1976, for
the same intended use. New medical devices used in investigations that
"present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare
of a subject" are called "significant risk." Investigations are any
clinical trials exposing human subjects to determine the safety or effec-
tiveness of a medical device.

Criteria:

FDA believes that devices used in investigations involving laser products
that are Class IV according to the laser standard would present a potential
for serious harm and in general must be considered significant risk devices.
So also, higher power Class III laser products could be expected to satisfy
this criterion, depending on emission level, wavelength, and medical
application and may be considered significant risk devices. This does not
imply that other laser products are never significant risk devices. After
due consideration of the details of the investigation, (e.g., the controls,
the patient characteristics, the qualifications of the operator, etc.),

an IRB or the FDA may find any investigation to involve significant risk.

Requirement:

Sponsors of investigations using new medical devices that incorporate a
Class IV laser product must comply with all of the requirements of 21 CFR
812 applicable to significant risk devices. If a sponsor or manufacturer
believes that circumstances indicate that the investigation should not be
considered significant risk, the sponsor is urged to write to the Director,
Division of Compliance (HFX-400), Bureau of Radiological Health, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and provide a justification that includes
supporting technical data. Sponsors of investigations of new medical
devices that use Class III laser products should obtain a determination
from the Director, Division of Compliance, whether the FDA considers the
investigation to involve significant risk.

Manufacturers, importers and exporters of investigational devices are
further advised to consult the regulations of 21 CFR 812, that contain
requirements pertaining to the labeling, promotion, and commercialization
of such devices.

Sponsors of investigations may contact the IDE Coordinator of the Bureau of
Radiological Health (HFX-460), telephone (301) 443-3426, for assistance in
developing their IDE submission or in interpreting the IDE regulation.
