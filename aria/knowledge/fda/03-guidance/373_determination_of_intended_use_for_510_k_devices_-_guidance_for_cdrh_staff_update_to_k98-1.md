Determination of Intended Use for
510(k) Devices; Guidance for CDRH
Staff
This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the
public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statute and regulations.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this guidance document is to reflect the elimination of the sunset
provision of Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).
The sunset provision was eliminated by Section 208 of the Medical Device User Fee and
Modernization Act (MDUFMA) of 2002, permitting Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (CDRH) staff to continue following established procedures for the determination
of intended use in 510(k) submissions.
This guidance also updates our procedures to include minor changes we have instituted
since Section 513(i)(1)(E) was implemented. Additionally, we have revised the title to
clarify that these procedures, although they affect industry, are CDRH staff procedures.
This guidance supersedes Determination of Intended Use for 510(k) Devices;
Guidance for Industry and CDRH Staff, issued January 30, 1998.

Background
As stipulated in Section 513(i) of the Act, FDA may issue an order of substantial
equivalence only upon making the determination that the device to be introduced into
commercial distribution has the same intended use as the predicate device and is as safe
and effective as a legally marketed device. Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act generally
limits the determination of the intended use of a device that is the subject of a premarket
notification (510(k)) to the proposed labeling contained in the submission.
"Labeling" is defined in Section 201(m) of the Act as "all labels and other written,
printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its containers or wrappers, or (2)
accompanying such article." Proposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to
describe the device, its intended use, and the directions for use are required to be
submitted in a 510(k) for review during the substantial equivalence determination. (See
21 CFR 807.87(e))
Thus, based on the above, the intended use of a device is determined by an evaluation of
the proposed labeling for the device as submitted in the 510(k). As stated in ODE Blue

Book Memorandum #K86-3 entitled Guidance on the Center for Devices and
Radiological Health's Premarket Notification Review Program (June 30, 1986)
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/k863.html, “Ordinarily, intended use is determined by reference
to 'labeling' or promotional claims; only in rare cases might it be necessary to infer
intended use from other types of information.”
In addition to the restrictions regarding the determination of intended use, the law defines
the procedures to be followed if the Office Director believes “that there is a reasonable
likelihood that the device will be used for an intended use not identified in the proposed
labeling for the device" and "that such use could cause harm.” (See Section
513(i)(1)(E)(ii)). These procedures are described below.

Procedures
A. Procedures for Division Staff
In determining the intended use of a device that is the subject of a 510(k), reviewers
should continue to follow Blue Book #K86-3 guidance, which states that the intended
use of the device should be determined by the proposed labeling for the product. As
defined above, this includes the actual label for the device and any accompanying
information such as directions for use and promotional materials.
In reviewing the premarket notification, there may be rare instances in which the
design of the device or published literature referencing the subject device or a similar
device, would lead one to believe that there may be an intended use different than that
appearing in the labeling. If this situation occurs, the reviewer should bring the
discrepancy to the attention of senior division management.
The reviewer and division management should consider:
•

Whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the device will be used for an
intended use not identified in the proposed labeling for the device, and

•

if such use could cause harm to the patient or the consumer.

If, while reviewing the 510(k), the division makes the determination that there is a
reasonable likelihood that the device will be used for an intended use other than that
in the proposed labeling (hereinafter referred to as off-label use) that could cause
harm, the review of the submission should proceed as follows. The reviewer should
discuss all deficiencies with regard to the submission, except those regarding the offlabel use, with the firm and resolve the deficiencies in accordance with established
division procedures. Once all other outstanding issues have been resolved, the
reviewer should promptly bring the concern about the off-label use to the attention of
the Chief of the Premarket Notification Section (Chief), Program Operations Staff
(POS). The Chief will be responsible for coordinating the resolution of the off-label
use issue with the appropriate Office Director. If, while reviewing the 510(k), the
reviewer observes no deficiencies that prevent a substantial equivalence
2

recommendation other than the concern regarding an off-label use, the division
should bring that concern to POS as soon as the review of the 510(k) is complete.
Devices that are substantially equivalent to legally marketed devices that have
limitations regarding off-label use imposed by the Office Director under Section
513(i)(1)(E) should be subject to the same limitations. Review divisions should be
vigilant in identifying devices that fall within this category. When a review division
encounters a device that should be subject to the same limitations regarding off-label
use as the predicate, the review division should retrieve a copy of the predicate
device’s “substantially equivalent (SE) with limitations” letter and forward it with the
submission to POS as described above.1
B. Procedures for the Office Director
When the Office Director receives a referral from POS regarding off-label use, the
Office Director will evaluate the information provided and determine if the two
statutory criteria are met. That is, the Office Director must decide (1) if there is a
reasonable likelihood that the device will be used for an intended use not identified
in the proposed labeling and (2) if such use could cause harm to the user.2 If the
Office Director determines that these criteria are not met, the Office Director should
document the discussion and the Office should promptly issue a “substantially
equivalent” (SE) letter. If, however, the Office Director believes that the two criteria
are met, the 510(k) submitter will have an opportunity for consultation.

Consultation
Consultation between the Office Director and the 510(k) submitter may take the form of a
telephone call or a meeting. The form of the consultation will depend the needs of both
parties and the most expedient path to resolution.

Resolution
Following consultation, one of three actions may ensue.

1

When this situation is encountered, CDRH has determined that the most expedient
course of action is for POS to send a draft “SE with limitations” letter to the submitter of
the pending 510(k). The letter will propose the identical limitations imposed by the
Office Director on the predicate device. The submitter will have an opportunity to assent
or to request a telephone call or meeting with the Office Director, in accordance with the
procedures outlined in the “Consultation” section of this memorandum. In cases where
the submitter assents to the proposed limitations, the Office Director will immediately
issue a final order.

For purposes of this document, the term “user” may be the patient, health care provider,
or any other person who has the device used on or in himself/herself or who uses the
device him/herself.

First after discussing the off-label use issue with the firm, the Office Director may decide
that the two criteria regarding off-label use have not been met and direct the division to
issue a substantial equivalence determination.
Alternatively, if the Office Director believes that there is a reasonable likelihood that the
device will be used for an intended use not identified in the proposed labeling and that
this use could cause harm, the firm will have an opportunity to:
•

modify the device design to address the off-label use; or

•

request a written determination from the Office Director.

If the modified design satisfies the Agency's concerns regarding the off-label use, the
division will issue a substantially equivalent determination.
Finally, if the firm either fails to modify the device or decides to request a written
determination from the Office Director, the Office Director will issue an “SE with
limitations” letter within 10 days of the consultation.
The “SE letter with limitations” letter (the letter) will advise the 510(k) submitter that the
Office Director has determined that:
•

there is a reasonable likelihood that the device will be used for an intended use
not identified in the proposed labeling for the device; and

•

such use could cause harm.

The letter will specify appropriate limitations regarding the off-label use to be included in
the labeling for the device. These labeling limitations may be expressed using the
standardized language provided in the boilerplate letters3 or may include other labeling
limitations specific to the device and the off-label use, as determined by the Office
Director. The letter will require these limitations to be added to the Precautions,
Warnings, Contraindications, or other appropriate section of the device's labeling.
Finally, the letter will stipulate that the device is only substantially equivalent if the
labeling for the device conforms to the limitations specified in the letter.

Special Notes
As stipulated in Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act, the Office Director may not delegate any
of the responsibilities specified in this memorandum.
According to ODE Blue Book #K97-1 entitled, “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a
Change to an Existing Device” http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/510kmod.html,
manufacturers are permitted to make certain labeling changes without submission of a
The boilerplates “SE letter with Limitations” were drafted for use under the conditions
described above. Both Office of Device Evaluation (ODE) and Office of In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices Evaluation and Safety (OIVDES) “SE with Limitations” boilerplates,

new 510(k). The labeling limitations included in the "SE letter with Limitations,"
however, are required by Section 513(i)(1)(E) of the Act. Therefore, a manufacturer
must submit a new 510(k) before these limitations are modified in any way or removed
from the device's labeling.
