Technical Considerations for NonClinical Assessment of Medical
Devices Containing Nitinol
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction and Scope

Nitinol, a near equiatomic alloy of nickel and titanium, is a commonly used material in the
medical device industry. Device manufacturers have used nitinol’s unique properties (e.g.,
pseudoelasticity and shape memory behavior) to design innovative medical devices that would
not be possible with conventional materials. Nitinol has been extensively used in cardiovascular
devices such as stents, heart valves, guidewires, and vena cava filters. The use of nitinol in other
device areas is growing, particularly for products intended for use in minimally invasive
procedures. 1 The thermomechanical behavior and processing sensitivity of nitinol raise special
considerations when compared to conventional metals such as stainless steel, titanium or cobaltchrome alloys. The Agency has developed this guidance to provide FDA’s current thinking on
technical considerations specific to devices using nitinol due to the unique properties of nitinol.
The recommendations in this document should be evaluated in conjunction with the intended use
and technological characteristics of your device and any relevant device-specific guidances. The
purpose of this guidance is to outline technical considerations associated with medical devices
that have at least one patient-contacting component comprised of nitinol.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 2 For additional information on the appropriate

The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind
the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract. This document is intended
only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law. FDA
guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as recommendations, unless
specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency
guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II.

Background

Nitinol is a nearly equiatomic metal alloy of nickel and titanium. 4,5 Nitinol’s unique
thermomechanical behavior have made it a commonly used material in medical devices. The use
of nitinol in medical devices began over three decades ago in product areas such as orthodontic
archwires, cardiovascular guidewires, and surgical instruments. Its use has increased over the
past two decades into different device areas such as orthopedic fracture fixation, stents, and
transcatheter heart valves. With an increasing trend to treat patients using minimally invasive
procedures, nitinol has become a popular choice of material due to its ability to return to its
original shape after being mechanically deformed or after heat is applied. These properties are
due to reversible transformations between the austenite and martensite phases, which may be
temperature-induced (shape-memory) or stress-induced (pseudoelasticity). As a result, nitinol
can withstand greater amounts of reversible deformations without plastic deformation than
conventional metallic alloys, such as stainless steel, titanium, or cobalt-chrome alloys. 6
Given the complex properties of nitinol, characterizing the thermomechanical behavior of nitinol
devices presents unique considerations when assessing safety and effectiveness. Previous
literature has described the impact of manufacturing on transformation temperatures and
mechanical performance of nitinol devices. 7 In addition, standards developing organizations,
such as American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), have produced consensus
standards to aid the medical device industry in characterizing nitinol. These consensus standards
define terminology associated with nitinol materials, including specifications for chemical,
physical, thermomechanical, and metallurgical properties, and test methods to characterize the
transformation temperatures and mechanical properties of nitinol.

Previous literature has shown the corrosion resistance of nitinol to be highly dependent on
surface processing. 8,9 In vivo corrosion of nitinol may decrease the safety profile or performance
of the device by adversely impacting thermomechanical properties and/or biocompatibility. To
obtain stakeholder input regarding best practices for corrosion testing and the impact of
corrosion on the performance and safety profile of metals (including nitinol), FDA held a public
workshop titled “Cardiovascular Metallic Implants: Corrosion, Surface Characterization, and
Nickel Leaching” (March 8–9, 2012). 10 The information gathered from this workshop was
published 11 and used to update the FDA’s guidance document for “Non-Clinical Engineering
Tests and Recommended Labeling for Intravascular Stents and Associated Delivery Systems.” 12
However, the recommendations in that guidance were specific to intravascular stents and
delivery systems. With the expansion of nitinol to other product areas, the Agency is issuing this
general guidance document outlining the technical considerations when using nitinol in medical
devices.

Technical Recommendations

The following section contains a description of the type of information that we recommend you
include in a premarket submission of a device made from nitinol. The type of premarket
submission that is appropriate for your nitinol device is determined by the regulatory
classification of your device. The type and amount of data necessary to support your regulatory
submission will vary depending on the device design, intended use and classification of the
device type. For devices manufactured with multiple types of nitinol (e.g., components with
different surface finishes), we recommend that you provide the suggested information for each
type of nitinol. Where available, device-specific guidance documents may include additional
technical recommendations that should be considered. The Agency encourages manufacturers to
engage with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) through the Q-Submission

process to obtain more detailed feedback for questions. For more information on the QSubmission Program, please see “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device
Submissions: The Q-Submission Program - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug
Administration Staff.” 22 For more information on when a device change or modification would
require a new 510(k) submission, refer to FDA guidance, “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k)
for a Change to an Existing Device.” 23
Nitinol is used in a diverse range of medical devices, with varying durations of contact. The
recommendations in this guidance document vary depending on the anticipated duration of
contact. The anticipated duration of contact in this guidance document follows Section 5.3 of
ISO 10993-1 2009 “Biological evaluation of medical devices -- Part 1: Evaluation and testing
within a risk management process,” 24 with definitions listed below.
a) Limited exposure – devices whose cumulative single, multiple or repeated use or contact
is up to 24 hours.
b) Prolonged exposure – devices whose cumulative single, multiple or repeated long-term
use or contact is likely to exceed 24 hours but not 30 days.
c) Permanent contact – devices whose cumulative single, multiple or repeated long-term use
or contact exceeds 30 days.

A. General Information
The performance and behavior of nitinol depends on a number of factors including
alloy composition, thermal history, surface processing, and preconditioning. Based
on the device design and intended use of the device containing nitinol, different
material behavior or performance may be desirable. We recommend that you
provide the following general information on your nitinol-containing devices for
prolonged exposure and permanent contacting devices. For limited exposure
devices, some of this information may not be warranted based on device design and
intended use. For example, functional testing performed for passive cardiac
guidewires may be sufficient in lieu of providing the information listed below.
Where device-specific guidances are available, these may be useful to determine
what type of information is needed. Alternatively, sponsors may wish to discuss the
use of functional testing with FDA early in their device development process. FDA
recommends that sponsors use the Q-Submission process to facilitate these
discussions. 25

1. Material Composition
The composition of nitinol can be “tuned” to optimize performance for a
particular intended use. If your nitinol conforms to a recognized consensus
standard, this information should be included in your submission (e.g., ASTM
F2063 “Standard Specification for Wrought Nickel-Titanium Shape Memory
Alloys for Medical Devices and Surgical Implants”). If your nitinol does not
conform to a recognized consensus standard, we recommend you provide the
nitinol composition and a description of its specific properties.

2. Manufacturing
Manufacturing method and parameters including heat treatments and surface
processing can alter the behavior and performance of the nitinol device.
Therefore, we recommend that you provide a high-level flow chart to identify
the manufacturing processes leading from your raw material to the final device
sterilization (if relevant). Of specific interest are thermal processes (e.g., laser
cutting, annealing, thermal shape setting). Additionally, surface processing can
have a significant effect on the corrosion/nickel leach performance of nitinol.
Therefore, we recommend that you provide a detailed description of any surface
processing steps (e.g., honing, microblasting, pickling, polishing, passivation)
so the risk of corrosion and nickel release can be evaluated. In addition, you
should describe any final post-processing cleaning steps, and discuss how these
steps are designed to remove any surface residuals that could impact
biocompatibility.

3. Pseudoelasticity/Shape Memory Behavior
Nitinol can be “tuned” via composition and thermal treatments to either have
pseudoelastic (superelastic) or shape memory behavior at the desired operating
temperature. As these two behaviors are different, it should be stated in the
submission which one is being used. If neither behavior is being employed, that
also should be clarified.

4. Transformation Temperatures
As stated previously, variations in transformation temperatures of nitinol have
been shown to affect mechanical properties. Therefore, we recommend you
provide phase transformation temperatures of your final finished form (i.e., with
all manufacturing including sterilization, if relevant). When possible, samples
from a minimum of three production lots 26 should be used because nitinol
transformation temperatures are sensitive to small variations in manufacturing

21 CFR 820.3(m)

processes, such as temperature or heating duration. If the pseudoelastic
properties are being utilized to achieve the intended device performance, we
recommend providing either austenite finish (Af) temperature, R-phase finish
temperature (R’f) if the R-phase is present, 27 or body temperature mechanical
test data meeting a pre-specified acceptance criteria. If shape memory
properties are being utilized, you should also provide austenite start (As),
martensite start (Ms), and martensite finish (Mf) temperatures as these
temperatures govern the shape memory behavior. We recommend using the
methods described in ASTM F2004 “Standard Test Method for Transformation
Temperature of Nickel-Titanium Alloys by Thermal Analysis,” ASTM F2082
“Standard Test Method for Determination of Transformation Temperature of
Nickel-Titanium Shape Memory Alloys by Bend and Free Recovery,” or an
equivalent method. It should be noted that these test methods do not necessarily
measure the same Af temperature for a given material or device. 28,29 For
devices that are expected to be load bearing, we recommend ASTM F2082,
modified to assess the strains the device is expected to experience in its final
finished form (e.g., crimping of a stent or pre-deformation of a bone plate), as it
incorporates deformation. Alternative methods to assess transformation
temperatures can be used with a detailed test protocol and explanation of how
transformation temperatures are determined. We recommend you provide
specifications for body temperature, mechanical performance or transformation
temperature ranges for your device to ensure your device will perform as a
pseudoelastic or shape memory material.

B. Mechanical Testing
Nitinol has unique thermomechanical behavior. When available, device-specific
guidance or standards should be used to assess the mechanical performance of your
device. If mechanical testing will be performed as part of your non-clinical testing
plan, the following specific considerations may apply depending on device design
and/or intended use.

1. Experimental Testing Considerations

a. The pseudoelastic behavior of nitinol leads to a region of near constant
stress over a range of strains, and, therefore, mechanical testing is
commonly performed under displacement control, although other control
modes may be appropriate (e.g., pressure control with displacement
monitoring for radial pulsatile fatigue testing of a vascular stent per
ASTM F2477 “Standard Test Methods for in vitro Pulsatile Durability
Testing of Vascular Stents”). Given the unique thermomechanical

behavior of nitinol, we recommend that you provide a rationale for the
control mode used for mechanical testing.
b. Some devices are designed such that they may be exposed to strains
prior to and/or during implantation. For example, cardiovascular stents
are compressed to a smaller diameter onto a delivery system and tracked
through vasculature prior to deployment. In addition, orthopedic staples
are extended prior to implantation. Therefore, when appropriate, we
recommend you account for any clinical deformations/forces and
temperature excursions (e.g., sterilization) as a preconditioning step
prior to mechanical testing of a device.
c. Due to the thermomechanical response of nitinol, mechanical testing
should be performed at a clinically relevant temperature unless
otherwise justified.
d. Some devices are exposed to cyclic loading conditions during use (i.e.,
fatigue loading). If you conduct fatigue tests, we recommend that you
use a clinically relevant liquid test solution (e.g., phosphate buffered
saline (PBS)). Since fatigue testing of nitinol in air has been shown to be
sensitive to test frequency due to heating effects, 30 we do not
recommend that you conduct fatigue tests of nitinol in air. If you
conduct fatigue testing of nitinol in air, we recommend that you provide
a scientific justification for the test environment used.
e. For devices intended to utilize the shape memory properties of nitinol
(e.g., cyclic shape change through thermal cycling), we recommend a
cyclic shape memory test at a clinically relevant temperature range and
number of cycles. This testing should assess functional performance and
device integrity.

2. Computational Stress/Strain Analyses

If you plan to conduct computational analyses, 31 we recommend the following
to ensure the unique thermomechanical properties of nitinol are properly
captured:
a. The constitutive laws applicable to nitinol can differ substantially from
traditional metals. 32,33 Therefore, you should simulate nitinol material

with an appropriate material model. You should document and justify
the parameters used in the material model.
b. Material model parameters can be obtained from ASTM F2516
“Standard Test Method for Tension Testing of Nickel-Titanium
Superelastic Materials.” Test specimens should be representative of the
final manufactured device (e.g., including heat treatment and surface
processing steps). Testing should be conducted at a temperature
representative of the clinical use environment (e.g., 37°C for implantable
devices).
c. Your computational analysis should include the effect of any shape
setting steps in your manufacturing process since these will relieve preexisting stresses.
d. If your device is subjected to cyclic loading during use, we recommend
that you calculate fatigue safety factor(s) using a constant life curve.
Unlike traditional metals, which utilize stress-based fatigue life
estimates (e.g., Goodman, Soderberg diagrams), using a constant life
mean versus alternating strain diagram has been found to provide a good
model for fatigue life prediction for nitinol. 34 Fatigue life of nitinol is
sensitive to composition and processing. Therefore, we recommend that
you generate a constant life curve specific to your device by
experimental testing of nitinol samples that are representative of your
final manufactured device (e.g., including heat treatment and surface
processing) rather than leveraging data not specific to your device.
Since fatigue life can be adversely or favorably affected by pre-strain
(e.g., from crimping of a stent onto a delivery catheter), 35,36 we
recommend you consider and discuss the effects of pre-strain. We
recommend that you state and justify the method used to calculate mean
and alternating strain for fatigue safety factors (e.g., scalar or tensor). 37
e. You should validate the computational model used to analyze the nitinol
device, and justify the validation activity relative to the context of use
(COU) of the computational model, the risk and role of the
computational model in decision making, 38 and range of conditions
assessed relative to those in the COU. We also recommend that you

justify your choice of parameter measured (e.g., force, strain) and
loading path in your validation activities.
We recommend that submission of computational stress/strain analysis reports
follow the “Reporting of Computational Modeling Studies in Medical Device
Submissions Guidance.” 39

C. Corrosion Testing
Nitinol’s corrosion susceptibility is dependent on the manufacturing and surface
finishing processes 40 used to make the final finished form as well as potentially the
geometry of the final finished form. As corrosion can lead to nickel ion release or
even a compromise of the mechanical integrity of the device, we recommend that
pitting corrosion testing of the nitinol device be performed for prolonged exposure
and permanent contacting devices (see below for specific recommendations). If
pitting corrosion testing results meet pre-specified acceptance criteria (for details on
acceptance criteria, see Section C.1.: Corrosion Testing - Pitting Corrosion) and
your device is manufactured using established surface finishing that has been used
for device(s) with a good clinical history of use (i.e., no history of adverse events
associated with corrosion or nickel ion release) such as electropolishing, chemical
etch, or mechanical polishing, further testing may not be warranted. When
considering the effect of manufacturing processes (e.g., thermal processing) on
surface finish, comparison of surface characterization results (e.g., chemical
composition vs. depth) to an established surface finish may provide insight into the
quality of your protective oxide layer. Due to the spot size limitations of surface
characterization, this approach may not be appropriate to assess phenomena that are
influenced by the entire surface (e.g., nickel ion leach) if surface variability was
established during corrosion testing.
If the results of the testing do not meet pre-specified acceptance criteria or your
device is not manufactured using established surface finishing processes with a
good clinical history of use, we recommend characterizing the extent of nickel ion
release. A flowchart (Figure 1) is provided to illustrate the recommended testing
paradigm for corrosion and nickel ion release susceptibility.
Corrosion testing is generally not warranted for limited contact devices; however,
such testing may be requested in situations such as devices with an electrically
active component, a dissimilar metal couple, or a degradable metal/polymer
component where these features could accelerate nitinol corrosion. In these cases,
we recommend you seek more detailed feedback via the Q-submission process per

Pitting Corrosion

We recommend conducting pitting corrosion testing per ASTM F2129 “Standard
Test Method for Conducting Cyclic Potentiodynamic Polarization Measurements
to Determine the Corrosion Susceptibility of Small Implant Devices.”
Testing should be performed after subjecting the device to simulated assembly
and implantation, which includes compression/loading and deployment of the
device through an in vitro fixture that mimics in vivo anatomic conditions (e.g.,
vessel size, tortuosity). Alternatively, the device can be subjected to
stresses/strains expected during simulated use without the use of an in vitro
fixture, with justification. This device conditioning is intended to simulate the
clinical conditions of the device at the time of implantation. You should test
device sizes that are the worst-case in terms of corrosion susceptibility based on
surface area, size, and/or geometry. Considerations should be given to factors
such as geometry or size that may affect surface finishing such as adequate
polishing of regions of high curvature. Test devices should be representative of
the final finished form and selected such that potential variations due to
manufacturing can be assessed (e.g., by taking samples from multiple lots). If the
nitinol component is coated with a non-conductive material (e.g., polymer), we
recommend manufacturing an uncoated version that undergoes identical thermal
processing as the final finished device to serve as a worst-case sample for pitting
corrosion. If the tested devices did not undergo sterilization, a justification for

should be justified with consideration of variability in results. At least 6 samples
will likely be warranted based on known variability of corrosion performance 42
and more samples could be warranted based on the performance of your device
and your acceptance criteria. 43 If your worst-case device size cannot be
accommodated in the test fixture, alternative device sizes or shortened samples
could be used with a scientific rationale.
Test reports should include corrosion/rest potentials, breakdown potentials, as
well as polarization curves. When practical, we recommend that you plot all
polarization curves in one graph. You should discuss any deviations from the
ASTM F2129 standard (e.g., test setup not meeting the criteria outlined in ASTM
G5 “Standard Reference Test Method for Making Potentiodynamic Anodic
Polarization Measurements”). Results should be assessed against your
acceptance criteria. ASTM F2129 does not include an acceptance criterion.
Therefore, the acceptance criterion for the pitting corrosion testing should be
determined by comparison to a legally U.S. marketed comparator device with
good clinical history of use (i.e., no history of corrosion-related fractures or
adverse events associated with nickel release). Alternatively, while there is
limited data directly linking in vitro corrosion testing to in vivo corrosion
outcomes, studies have been published 44,45,46,47,48 that could be used to establish
acceptance criteria when a comparator device is not available. The criteria should
be justified based on pitting and crevice corrosion performance as well as risk of
nickel leaching for your device. If breakdown occurred, you should include
results of the visual inspection of your device before and after testing to assess
evidence of pitting and location of pits. Images of sufficient magnification should
be provided to support your assessment.

2. Nickel Ion Release
If your nitinol device does not meet your pre-specified acceptance criteria for
corrosion resistance or does not employ an established surface finishing process,
we recommend nickel ion release testing be performed per ASTM F3306

testing should quantify nickel over time by measuring concentrations of nickel
released from the device into a fluid at physiologic temperature and pH. To avoid
excursions in pH, we recommend using a buffered solution, such as PBS. For
prolonged exposures, immersion testing should be conducted for the entire
anticipated duration of contact. For permanent implants, we recommend testing
be conducted for 60 days. Alternatively, if the testing demonstrates that the
surface of your nitinol component is stable, i.e., equilibrium is being approached,
testing may be concluded earlier, with a minimum test duration of 30 days.
Justification for surface stability may include evidence of monotonically decaying
release rates over time that become negligible by the end of testing. Solution
sampling should be conducted at adequate intervals to characterize the nickel
release profile of the device in vitro. You should use a sampling regimen that will
adequately capture any initial bolus release of nickel ions. For example, sampling
intervals for a permanent implant might include at least days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and
28 days for the first month of cumulative exposure time, and at least bi-weekly
thereafter to capture the initial bolus release of nickel followed by the chronic
release behavior. Alternative sampling frequencies may be used with a scientific
rationale.
Testing should be performed on devices in final finished form after subjecting the
device to preconditioning that simulates device implantation (e.g., tracking and
deployment). Test devices should be selected such that potential variations due to
manufacturing can be assessed (e.g., by taking samples from multiple lots), with a
justification for the number and size of devices tested. In cases where there are
multiple sizes or different geometries, the devices should be selected and justified
such that they represent the worst-case for nickel ion release (e.g., largest surface
area, most challenging to surface finish, and/or highest local strains).
Validation testing should be performed and summarized in the test report. This
validation testing should include validation of the analytical instrumentation as
well as a spike and recovery test to demonstrate that nickel is not lost out of
solution during testing (e.g., due to adsorption onto the extraction container). The
duration should be at least equal to the longest interval during immersion testing.
The extraction ratio, or the ratio of the surface area of the tested device to the
volume of test solution, should be provided along with a scientific rationale for
why the ratio was selected. Both the detection limit of the analytical
instrumentation and nickel solubility in the test solution should be considered in
your rationale. For example, a surface to volume ratio of 0.1 to 1 cm2/mL may be
appropriate if the nickel released does not approach the nickel solubility limit in
the test solution and is sufficiently above the detection limit. We recommend that
you replace the entire test solution at each time point sampled with fresh solution.
Test results should be reported as total cumulative release per device in
micrograms, as well as a per day release (µg/day). In addition, if release rates are
compared between devices or samples with different geometries, results should
13

also be normalized by device surface area. These results should be used as part of
your risk assessment as described in Section D: Biocompatibility.

3. Galvanic Corrosion
Similar to pitting corrosion, galvanic corrosion may lead to higher than
anticipated rates of nickel ion release or compromised mechanical integrity. If
nitinol is in contact with dissimilar metals, galvanic corrosion testing should be
considered. We recommend the methods described in ASTM F3044 “Standard
Test Method for Evaluating the Potential for Galvanic Corrosion for Medical
Implants.” As an alternative to using devices for galvanic corrosion testing,
coupons representing an expected worst-case galvanic coupling that are subjected
to identical manufacturing processes could be used. In addition, a scientific
justification may be provided, in lieu of testing, if the expected worst-case
potential shift due to galvanic coupling is small and if the relative surface ratios of
the cathodic to anodic materials are low (e.g., marker band to stent surface ratio).

D. Biocompatibility
To assess the biocompatibility of your nitinol device, we recommend that you follow
the guidance “Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, ‘Biological evaluation of
medical devices - Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process.” 49
This guidance identifies the types of biocompatibility assessments that should be
considered and recommendations regarding how to conduct related tests.
In addition, if in vitro nickel release testing will be conducted (see Figure 1), a risk
assessment should be performed to compare the amount of nickel released from the
device to a Tolerable Intake (TI) value for nickel. A TI value is defined in the ISO
10993-17:2002/(R)2012 standard “Biological evaluation of medical devices -- Part
17: Establishment of allowable limits for leachable substances” as an “estimate of the
average daily intake of a substance over a specified time period, on the basis of body
mass, that is considered to be without appreciable harm to health.”
For adverse systemic effects that may occur following prolonged or permanent
patient exposure to nickel released from a nickel-containing device, with the
exception of hypersensitivity, CDRH recommends a TI value for parenteral (nonoral) exposure to nickel of 0.5 µg/kg/day (e.g., 35 µg/day for a 70 kg adult). 50 This
value is based on systemic toxicity data from experimental animals following
administration of nickel salts by parenteral routes of exposure (e.g., intravenous,
intraperitoneal) and derived using the approach outlined in the ISO 10993-17
standard. The FDA has not established an oral TI for nickel; however, the US
Environmental Protection Agency has established a Reference Dose (RfD) of 20
µg/kg/day (e.g., 1400 µg/day for a 70 kg adult) that is intended to be protective for

lifetime oral exposure to nickel. It is important to note that the TI values are not
intended to be protective for local effects (e.g., necrosis, inflammation, irritation) that
may result from nickel release from an implant into tissues surrounding the implant.
With regard to carcinogenicity, no increase in tumor incidence has been observed in
rats or mice following long-term oral or inhalation exposure to soluble nickel
compounds in well-conducted bioassays; 51 therefore, the TI for nickel ion released
from nitinol is adequately protective for carcinogenicity. If any in vivo nickel
exposure data exists for your device, these values should also be included in your risk
assessment.
As the lower limit of nickel exposure that can elicit allergic reactions in some patients
is not known, it is not possible to derive a hypersensitivity-based TI for nickel
released from nitinol. Therefore, appropriate labeling is recommended (see Section
E: Labeling).
If your nickel exposure estimate exceeds the recommended TI (i.e., 0.5 µg/kg/day),
an alternative TI may be derived in certain cases, such as for significantly shorter
exposure duration or other exposure routes (e.g., inhalation). To support the
alternative TI, you should provide evidence (e.g., literature) that the potential
toxicological risk(s) will be adequately mitigated or discuss how the probable benefit
to health from the use of the device outweighs any probable risk of injury or illness
from such use. Additional information on benefit-risk assessments can be found in
the “Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations for Medical
Device Investigational Device Exemptions - Guidance for Investigational Device
Exemption Sponsors, Sponsor-Investigators and Food and Drug Administration
Staff” 52 and “Factors to Consider When Making Benefit-Risk Determinations in
Medical Device Premarket Approval and De Novo Classifications - Guidance for
Industry and FDA Staff.” 53 If your nickel release exceeds the recommended or
alternative TI and cannot be justified, device modifications (e.g., surface
optimization) may be warranted to mitigate the risk.

E. Labeling - Warnings
Since there is no known lower limit on the amount of nickel that can elicit allergic
reactions in some patients, we recommend that the risk of potential allergic reaction
to nickel be mitigated through labeling for nitinol containing devices. Specifically,
we recommend that the labeling (e.g., instructions for use) include a warning for
prolonged and permanent contacting devices. Note that a contraindication against use
of nitinol-containing devices may be appropriate when the risk of use clearly
outweigh any probable benefit.
