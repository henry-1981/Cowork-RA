TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS, IMPORTERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF SUNLAMPS
SUBJECT: POLICY ON LAMP COMPATIBILITY
BACKGROUND:
The amended performance standard for sunlamp products (21 CFR 1040.20) was
published in the September 6, 1985, issue of the Federal Register and will
become effective September 8, 1986. Any ultraviolet lamp (intended to be
used in sunlamp products) and sunlamp products manufacturedeon or after
that date must comply with the amended standard.
. .-

The amended standard requires the user instructions of an ultraviolet
lamp not accompanying a sunlamp product to contain a clear identification
by brand name and model designation of all lamp models for which
replacement lamps are promoted, if applicable [21 CFR 1040.20(f)(2)(iii)1.
As stated in the preamble of the amendments to-thestandard (Federal
Register issue of September 6, 1985) the promotion of incompatible lamps
wlll be considered as marketing a falsely certified product.
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has been asked what
criteria will be used to evaluate lamp compatibility.
POLICY:

<

A replacement lamp will be considered compatible with (or equivalent to)
another (original) lamp if:
1) The replacement lamp will not cause any sunlamp product intended to use
the original lamp to fail to comply with the standard or to become
defective as defined by 21 CFR 1003.2, and;

2) the lamp is as effective, within plus or minus ten percent, as the
original lamp, in causing erythema and melanogenesis.
It should be noted that the above criteria apply to the sunlamp product
exposure schedule and maximum timer interval which must appear on the
product's labeling. The manufacturer should use the following procedure to
establish conformance with criterion number 2 above:

Page 2 - POLICY ON LAMP COMPATIBILITY
1) Calculate the recommended maximum exposure time for a single original
lamp (Y) using the CDRH August 21, 1986, guidance (POLICY ON MAXIMUM
TIMER INTERVAL AND EXPOSURE SCHEDULE FOR SUNLAMP PRODUCTS).

2) Calculate the recommended maximum exposure time for a single replacement
lamp (X) using the same method.
3) Compare the values, If the value for the replacement lamp (X) is within
plus or minus 10% of the value of the original lamp (Y), the lamp would
be considered compatible [Y= X +/- LOX].

The distance(s) used for this comparison should represent the typical use
distance range in products using the original (Y) lamp,
The CDRH welcomes comments on this policy.
