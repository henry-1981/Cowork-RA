Guidance for Industry1
Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing —
Questions and Answers

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It
does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.
You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes
and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate

INTRODUCTION

This guidance provides recommendations for biological product, drug, and device firms on
FDA’s current thinking concerning the testing recommendations and acceptance criteria in the
United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <85> Bacterial Endotoxins Test,2 USP Chapter
<161> Transfusion and Infusion Assemblies and Similar Medical Devices,3 and the Association
for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) ST72:2002/R2010, Bacterial
Endotoxins—Test Methodologies, Routine Monitoring, and Alternatives to Batch Testing
(AAMI ST72).4,5 These three documents describe the fundamental principles of the gel clot,
photometric, and kinetic test methods, and recommend that appropriate components and finished
products be tested for the presence of pyrogens and endotoxins.
This guidance does not cover the entire subject of pyrogen and endotoxins testing. Instead, it
addresses those issues that may be subject to misinterpretation and are not covered in compendial
procedures or in currently available guidance documents. You should already have a thorough
understanding of these documents when using this guidance.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II.

BACKGROUND

For more than 30 years, FDA has accepted the use of a Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) test
for endotoxins in lieu of the rabbit pyrogens test. In a November 4, 1977, Federal Register
notice (42 FR 57749), FDA described conditions for using LAL as a finished product test.6 By
1983, FDA indicated in guidance that an LAL test could be used as a finished product test for
endotoxins. These tests were described in a series of draft and final guidance documents. The
last guidance document, Guideline on Validation of the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate Test as an
End-Product Endotoxin Test for Human and Animal Parenteral Drugs, Biological Products, and
Medical Devices, was published in 1987 (the 1987 Guidance).
FDA has found that the published USP and AAMI documents describing methods and
calculation of pyrogen and endotoxins testing limits7 provide industry with appropriate
information. We also note the continued development of USP Chapters <85> and <161> and
FDA guidance documents. The Agency has withdrawn the 1987 Guidance because it no longer
reflects the Agency’s current thinking on the topic. However, because the compendial chapters
and standards do not address certain regulatory perspectives, FDA is providing supplemental
information in this guidance to explain our current thinking regarding the submission and
maintenance of pyrogen and endotoxins testing for FDA-regulated products.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
1. How do I establish a sampling plan for in-process testing and finished product
release?
The current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished
pharmaceuticals and the medical device quality system regulations require development
of controls that include scientifically sound and appropriate sampling plans.8,9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Sampling plan information is addressed in AAMI ST72, but not USP Chapter <85>.
Firms should include a sampling plan as part of their application documentation. In the
sampling plan, firms should consider the potential for contamination in raw materials, inprocess materials, and the finished product. Specifically, firms should take into account
aspects of the manufacturing design, including consistency of a manufacturing process,
impact of in-process hold times, endotoxins removal steps, and finished product
endotoxins specifications. The sampling plan should be considered dynamic; firms
should begin with maximum coverage and adjust their sampling plans as they gain
confidence in the prevention of endotoxins in their manufacturing processes. Firms
should update their regulatory filings when adjusting sampling plans. For drugs and
biological products, in-process changes to sampling plans are annual reportable
changes.10 For devices, a 30-day notice11 may be appropriate for in-process changes to
the sampling plan.12
2. When is retesting appropriate?
When conflicting results occur within a test run, firms should consult USP Chapter <85>,
Gel Clot Limits Test, Interpretation, for guidance on repeat testing. As specified in
Chapter <85>, if the test failure occurred at less than the maximum valid dilution (MVD),
the test should be repeated using a greater dilution not exceeding the MVD. A record of
this failure should be included in the laboratory results. If a test is performed at the MVD
and an out-of-specification (OOS) test result occurs that cannot be attributed to testing
error, the lot should be rejected. 13 All testing procedures, including those for retesting
within the above limits, should be specified in advance in written standard operating
procedures approved by the firm’s quality control unit.
3. Is sample storage and handling important?
Yes. The ability to detect endotoxins can be affected by storage and handling. Firms
should establish procedures for storing and handling (which includes product mixing)
samples for bacterial endotoxins analysis using laboratory data that demonstrate the
stability of assayable endotoxins content. Protocols should consider the source of

For guidance regarding how to examine results that are above acceptable limits, please refer to the FDA guidance
for industry on Investigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Production. Although this
guidance is not intended to address biological assays, many of the concepts in the guidance are applicable to
bacterial endotoxins testing. We update guidance documents periodically. To make sure you have the most recent
version of a guidance, check the FDA Drugs guidance Web page at

endotoxins used in the study, bearing in mind that purified bacterial endotoxins might
react differently from native sources of endotoxins.
4. Can finished product samples for analysis of bacterial endotoxins be pooled into a
composite sample prior to analysis?
Yes. With some exceptions (see below), finished drug product units may be pooled into
a composite sample and assayed for bacterial endotoxins. The composite sample may be
represented by the entire unit or partial aliquots (equal volumes) of finished product
containers from one manufactured lot of aqueous-based pharmaceuticals. Pooling would
generally be accepted for small-volume parenterals (those with volumes of 100 mL or
less) as long as the MVD is adjusted to a proportional, lower value because of the
potential for diluting a unit containing harmful levels of endotoxins with other units
containing lower, less harmful, levels of endotoxins. This “adjusted MVD” is obtained
by dividing the MVD computed for an individual sample by the total number of samples
to be pooled. FDA suggests pooling no more than three units per composite in keeping
with the concept of testing representative beginning, middle, and end finished product
containers. If this reduction in MVD results in an inability to overcome product-related
assay interference because of an insufficient dilution, then the samples should be tested
individually.
Finished medical devices may also be pooled into a composite sample and assayed for
bacterial endotoxins. Testing for medical devices should be conducted using
rinsing/eluting and sampling techniques as described in ISO 10993-114 and ISO 1099312,15 as also used for inhibition/enhancement. Sampling can be adjusted for special
situations. After a suitable eluate/extract pool is obtained from a finished production lot,
this pooled extract should be kept under conditions appropriate for stability until it is
tested in duplicate.
FDA recommends that pooled samples be a composite of aseptically removed aliquots
(after at least 30 seconds of vigorous mixing) from each of the product containers.16 In
this way, the original, individual containers will be available for possible retesting in the
event the pooled sample displays an OOS result.
Some product types should not be pooled. Two examples are drug products that have an
initial low MVD (see discussion above of “adjusted MVD”) and products that are
manufactured as a suspension, because sample aliquot homogeneity may present
significant interference issues. FDA also does not recommend pooling in-process

samples from different in-process stages of the manufacturing process because it may be
difficult to ensure the homogeneity of these materials.
5. May a firm use alternative assays to those in the USP for a compendial article?
Yes, firms may use alternative methods and/or procedures if they provide advantages in
terms of accuracy, sensitivity, precision, selectivity, or adaptability to automation or
computerized data reduction, and in other special circumstances. Such alternative
procedures and methods should be validated as described in the USP General Chapter
<1225>, Validation of Compendial Procedures,17,18 and should be shown to achieve
equivalent or better results.19 When a difference appears or in the event of a dispute, the
final decision is made based upon the USP compendial gel clot method unless otherwise
indicated in the monograph for the product being tested.20
Below are two examples of alternative assays.
(1) Recombinant Horseshoe Crab Factor C Assay
If a manufacturer chooses to use a recombinant factor C-based assay, then method
validation should be in accordance with the requirements of USP Chapter <85>,
Bacterial Endotoxins Test, as described in the section for Photometric
Quantitative Techniques, and USP Chapter <1225>, Validation of Compendial
Procedures. 21
(2) Monocyte Activation Type Pyrogen Test
Product-specific validation is necessary to establish whether a particular test
substance or material is appropriate for evaluation of the monocyte activation
method. The validation should include, but is not limited to, interference testing,
accurate detection of pyrogen in individual test samples, and, for devices, ability
of test system to provide direct contact to the monocytes.
6. What is the best process for transitioning from one alternate bacterial endotoxins
test (BET) method to another?
The transition between tests that measure the same entity (e.g., LAL cascade) can be
made by comparing the two tests to verify the equivalence of the new method. 22 The
comparison of the limit of detection and inhibition/enhancement is fundamental. The

sensitivity of the new method can be evaluated on spiked product samples. 23 In addition
to using spiked samples, a battery of field samples of product found to be positive may be
a good source for comparing results from the methods. The method validation should
also attempt to address the variability found in the normal use of the method and the
manufacturing environment (e.g., source materials or seasonal changes). 24
For drug, animal drug, and biological products, the transition to a new method should be
submitted in a prior approval supplement (PAS). Alternatively, once a firm has
established a general method for making the transition between tests, it may submit the
method for review in a PAS—comparability protocol (CP). The CP should describe, in
detail, the methods used to transition between assays and the acceptance criteria used to
establish the equivalence of the new method. After approval of the CP, results of
implementation of the CP may be directed to be reported in a reduced reporting category
(Supplement—Changes Being Effected or Annual Report or Special Report (21 CFR
314.80)). The firm should maintain the study protocol, final report, and all data at the
facility for FDA review. The firm should confirm the filing process with the appropriate
review division before submitting a CP. For Class III devices, the transition to a new
assay requires a 30-day notice filed under 21 CFR 814.39(e). See FDA’s guidance,
Modifications to Devices Subject to Premarket Approval (PMA) - The PMA Supplement
Decision-Making Process,
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Guidanc
eDocuments/UCM089360.pdf. Manufacturing changes for Class I and II devices should
be in accordance with the quality system regulation, 21 CFR part 820. Design control,
production and process control requirements can be found at 21 CFR 820.30, 21 CFR
820.70, 21 CFR 820.72, and 21 CFR 820.75.
For devices, a 30-day notice may be appropriate for changes to quality control testing
used on incoming components, raw materials, the in-process device, or the finished
device, including performing end-product pyrogen testing on nonsterile samples prior to
sterilization. 25 Manufactures of medical devices should demonstrate a sensitivity that is
consistent with the route of administration for the device and the type of body contact.
Manufacturers may use another endotoxin test after demonstrating a reproducible
correlation between methods and the USP reference standard.
7. What happened to the endotoxins limit table in Appendix E of the 1987 Guidance?
The endotoxins limit table is out of date due to the increase in numbers of dosage
(regimes) and drug strengths since the publication of the 1987 Guidance. The appropriate

25
21 CFR 814.39(f).

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
way to establish the endotoxins limit is to use the calculation methods provided in the
USP or AAMI standards. Monograph limits may also not account for current product
strengths or dosage regimes; these should also be checked using the calculations
recommended in the standards.
If there are several components in a finished product, then the overall endotoxins limit for
parenterally-administered products should not exceed the overall threshold limit specified
in the USP <85> Bacterial Endotoxins Test, regardless of an individual component
endotoxins limit. Intrathecally-administered products, ophthalmics, or devices (see
question 11 for devices) may have endotoxins limit requirements that are not based on the
calculation for parenterally administered products. FDA encourages firms to check with
the appropriate office or review division about these products.
8. How can Quality by Design concepts support endotoxins limits? 26
When implementing Quality by Design concepts, the strategy for endotoxins testing
should be based upon product and process understanding in combination with risk
management to ensure consistent final product quality. The appropriate in-process
testing should be used to evaluate the production process areas at risk of endotoxins
formation or incursion. Many firms already have programs for monitoring incoming
ingredients and components, including the processing water, for endotoxins
contamination. The finished product release specification should be considered when
determining in-process limits for each phase of manufacturing tested. For purposes of
evaluating the relative risk of product contamination, quantitative testing may be
preferable to limit testing to facilitate product quality trending and to identify and correct
excursions before they exceed the specification and cause product failure. An endotoxins
limit should be justified on a case-by-case basis, and will be evaluated as a part of each
relevant marketing application or supplement.
9. When is the USP Chapter <151> Pyrogenicity Test (the rabbit pyrogen test)
appropriate?
For certain biological products, 21 CFR 610.13(b) requires a rabbit pyrogen test. The
requirement in 21 CFR 610.13(b) may be waived if a method equivalent to the rabbit
pyrogen test is demonstrated in accordance with 21 CFR 610.9.
For human and animal drugs, some USP monographs still require a rabbit pyrogen test.
Even with such monographs, a firm may substitute an endotoxins test or alternative cellbased test if the firm can demonstrate equivalent pyrogen detection. The appropriate
FDA review division will consider alternative methods, such as monocyte activation, on a
case-by-case basis.

26

ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline, Q8(R2) Pharmaceutical Development, Step 4 Version (2009).

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
For devices and drug materials, firms should assess the risk of the presence of nonendotoxin pyrogens. If the risk assessment indicates that non-endotoxin pyrogens may be
present, it may be more appropriate to use the rabbit pyrogen test.
Bacterial endotoxins assays are subject to a variety of interferences related to the physical
and chemical properties of the test article. Where such interferences cannot be mitigated
through sample dilution (up to the MVD) or other validated means of sample preparation,
firms should use the rabbit pyrogen test.
10. How would an appropriate endotoxins limit be determined for a veterinary product
that targets multiple species?
For a veterinary product labeled for use in multiple species, the limit should be based on
the maximum product dose used on the smallest species. If the label indicates that the
product may be used on juvenile and adult animals, the juvenile is considered the worst
case. If the weight of the animal is required to calculate the dose, firms should use an
average weight for that species. For a listing of some average animal weights, see the
FDA draft guidance for industry on Waivers of In Vivo Demonstration of Bioequivalence
of Animal Drugs in Soluble Powder Oral Dosage Form Products and Type A Medicated
Articles. For animal weights not listed in that guidance, please contact FDA’s Center for
Veterinary Medicine.
11. What are the endotoxins limits for medical devices?
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has adopted the USP Endotoxin
Reference Standard and limits for medical device extracts expressed in EU/mL. USP
Chapter <161> Transfusion and Infusion Assemblies and Similar Medical Devices
provides the limits for medical devices within its scope. The endotoxins limit for a
medical device is dependent on the intended use of the device and what the device
contacts (e.g., blood, the cardiovascular system, cerebrospinal fluid, intrathecal routes of
administration, permanently implanted devices, and devices implanted subcutaneously).27
For medical devices, using the extraction volume recommendations described below, the
limit is 0.5 EU/mL or 20 EU/device for products that directly or indirectly contact the
cardiovascular system and lymphatic system. For devices in contact with cerebrospinal
fluid, the limit is 0.06 EU/mL or 2.15 EU/device. For devices that are in direct or
indirect contact with the intraocular environment, a lower endotoxins limit may apply.
Please contact the appropriate review division for specific recommendations.
The process of preparing an eluate/extract for testing may vary from device to device.
Some medical devices can be flushed, some may have to be immersed, while others may
need disassembly. Unless otherwise directed by another compendial standard, our
27

USP, 2011, Chapter <161>, Transfusion and Infusion Assemblies and Similar Medical Devices.

8

recommended rinse volumes include the following: (1) each of the 10 test units should
be rinsed with 40 mL of non-pyrogenic water; (2) for unusually small or large devices,
the surface area of the device that contacts the patient may be used as an adjustment
factor in selecting the rinse or extract volume. The endotoxins limit can be adjusted
accordingly. In any case, the rinse/extract procedure should not result in a greater
dilution of endotoxin than recommended in USP <85>. For inhibition/enhancement
testing, both the rinse/extract solution and the device eluate/extract should be tested.
Examples of medical devices with testing or interference challenges include devices that
are coated with anticoagulant, contain heavy metals, or that have particulates. In these
situations, treatments for interferences can include digestion, dilution, and addition of
buffers, centrifugation, or filtration.
During the same surgical procedure or placement in the same surgical site, multiple units
of the same device from one manufacturer should generally meet the same endotoxins
limit as a single device administered during the procedure. In instances where multiple
units of the same device are known or intended for use in a single procedure,
manufacturers should justify any deviation from the overall endotoxins limit identified in
this guidance.
When a manufacturer of medical devices plans to use LAL testing that deviates
significantly from this guidance or recognized standard, a premarket notification (510(k))
under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) or a
premarket approval application (PMA) supplement under section 515 of the Act should
be submitted. Significant deviations include, but are not necessarily limited to: higher
endotoxin concentration release criteria, sampling from fewer than three (3) lots for
inhibition/enhancement testing, lesser sensitivity to endotoxins, and a device rinsing
protocol resulting in greater dilution of endotoxins than that recommended in this
guidance.
12. What is the FDA’s expectation for regular screening of therapeutic drug products?
Ideally, the undiluted product should be screened as long as there is no
interfering/enhancing property within the LAL test. However, in some product
formulations, the ingredients interfere with the LAL test. For such formulations, the USP
recommends that the product be diluted to overcome interference or enhancement
properties. The calculated MVD is the dilution of a sample at which the endotoxins limit
would be detected, but it should not be the regular testing dilution. When product
interference is encountered during development, FDA recommends that the firm
determine the lowest product dilution that would neutralize the interfering condition.
FDA recommends that firms begin subsequent product screening at a product dilution
just above the level that neutralized the interference. For example, if the product has an
MVD of 1:100, and the product displays inhibition at the 1:10, but not at the 1:20, it may

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
be best to screen product at 1:30. If bacterial endotoxins are detected at this level, then
the firm should conduct full enumeration with the product to titrate the true amount of
endotoxins.
13. Are control standard endotoxins still acceptable for use in running bacterial
endotoxins tests?
Control standard endotoxins (CSEs) are endotoxin preparations other than the
international or national reference standards that are traceable in their calibration to the
international reference endotoxins standard. CSEs may be secondary or tertiary standards
and are usually manufactured and certified by an LAL reagent manufacturer for use with
a specific lot of reagent under defined assay conditions. CSEs have become an accepted
source for preparation of standard curve calibrators and as assay controls, and have
provided a cost saving to LAL users and helped to preserve the inventory of primary
standards. FDA encourages the continued use of CSEs that are suitably calibrated to the
international reference endotoxins standard.
