This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s
Good Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if

such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be updated in the nett revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

DRAFT

GUIDANCE FOR THE CONTENT OF PREMARKET NOTIFICATIONS
FOR
Urine Drainage Bags

A urine drainage bag is described in the FDA regulation, 21 CFR 876.5250({a), Urine
Collector and Accessories, as a "device intended to collect urine. The device and accessories
consist of tubing, a suitable receptacle, connectors, mechanical Supports, and may include a
means to prevent backflow of urine or ascent of infection. The two kinds of urine collectors
are: (1) a urine collector and accessories intended to be connected to an indwelling catheter,
which includes the urinary drainage collection kit and the closed urine drainage system and
drainage bag; and (2) a urine collector and accessories not intended to be connected to an
indwelling catheter, which includes the corrugated rubber sheath, pediatric urine collector, leg
bag for external use, urosheath type incontinence device, and the paste-on device for
incontinence." The classification for this device is Class II if used with an indwelling catheter
or Class I if used with an external catheter as stated in 21 CFR 876.5250(b).

Examples of devices within this generic type include:

Class. Procode _ Device Name

I FAQ Urine Collection Leg Bag for External Use

I FOC Newborn Urine Collection Bag

I EXJ Urosheath Type Incontinence Device

I EXI Paste~On Device for Incontinence

I EYT Corrugated Rubber Sheath for Non-Indwelling Catheter
II EYZ Closed Urine Drainage System for Indwelling Catheter

II FCN Urinary Drainage Collection Kit for Indwelling Catheter
II KNX Urine Collector (and Accessories) for Indwelling Catheter
II FFH Pediatric Urine Collector for Indwelling Catheter

The primary reference for the information required to be in a premarket notification (510(k))
for a medical device is set forth in 21 CFR 807.87. The purpose of this regulation is to
provide adequate documented information to determine substantial equivalence to a device in
commercial distribution. Substantial equivalence is to be established with respect to, but not
limited to, intended use, design, materials, performance, Safety, effectiveness, labeling, and
other applicable characteristics.

In addition to the information specified in the DRAERD "Draft Guidance for the Content of
Premarket Notifications" which is available from the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health's Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) at (800) 638-2041 or (301)
443-6597, FDA recommends that each premarket notification for a urine drainage bag and
accessories include the following information in order to ensure that the submission is complete
and will permit a determination of substantial equivalence:

L Device Deserioti

The physical description of each urine drainage bag and its accessories to be marketed should
be provided in the form of a labeled diagram, photograph/ picture, schematic, etc., which
includes the name and addresses the function of all internal/external, assembled/ unassembled,
interchangeable, etc., parts of the urine drainage bag and accessories.

The physical description should include the specific fluid volume of the urine drainage bag and (YNNA)

accessories, and the unique features of the bag (i.e., backflow valve - air trap, flutter, one-
way; built-in urometer; lack of drain; absorbent materials; etc.). The physical description
should also identify any parts which are disposable.

If the urine drainage bag is sold in a set that includes accessories, these accessories should be ____
identified and reviewed along with the urine drainage bag and require the same types of
information as stated above. These accessories might include a secondary drainage bag for
overnight drainage. Labeling should state whether the accessory is intended for single use and
disposable or whether it is reusable.

Il. Labeling __

A. A label includes any identification on the urine drainage bag and on the
package in which it is stored and shipped. The device label should include the
device name, corporation name, address, and telephone number. The package
label should include all of the above, as well as sterility status, expiration date,
disposable/ single use, quantity enclosed, size, etc. The label of the device
packaging should include the prescription device statement as outlined in 21
CFR 801.109(b)(1): "CAUTION: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or
on the order of a physician."

B. Device labeling for the urine drainage bag and its accessories includes the
intended use, a description of the device, and directions for use.

1. The directions for use should contain comprehensive instructions on
how to prepare the urine drainage bag for use, how to operate the urine
drainage bag, and which parts are single use/disposable or reusable. If
reusable, provide instructions on how to clean, disinfect, and/or sterilize
the urine drainage bag. If the device does not have a drain, the
instructions should provide a minimum time between replacements (e.g.,
at least every 24 hours or when the bag becomes full). The directions
should address positioning of the urine drainage bag to prevent urine
backflow (i.e., keep the bag below the level of the patient's bladder).

2. Applicable contraindications, warnings, and precautions should be
included in the labeling of the device.

3. All claims should be supported, and claims concerning reduced
possibility for infection or contamination may need to be supported by
clinical data.

C. Advertisements or promotional literature for the urine drainage bag should be
provided. Literature or labeling may not imply approval by FDA in any manner. ____
Guidance on labeling issues is described in Bluebook Memo G91-1 "Device
Labeling Guidance (3/18/91)" which is available from DSMA at the telephone
number referenced above.

Ill. Bench Testing NUDE?

The following studies and results should be provided to demonstrate the substantial
equivalence of the urine drainage bag with respect to functional performance. _

Typical tests include:

water backflow pressure through the anti-reflux valve;

24-hour inversion leakage test results;

standing column test to examine the drainage efficiency of bag; and
