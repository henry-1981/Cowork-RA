Magnetic Resonance (MR) Receiveonly Coil – Performance Criteria for
Safety and Performance Based
Pathway
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for magnetic resonance (MR) receive-only coils in
support of the Safety and Performance Based Pathway.1 Under this framework, submitters (you)
planning to submit a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for MR receiveonly coils will have the option to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to
support substantial equivalence, rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject
device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA
guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices.3
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are

cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope/Device Description
The MR receive-only coils that are the subject of this guidance are intended to produce images of
human anatomy for general diagnostic use by trained clinicians. These MR receive-only coils are
Class II and are regulated under 21 CFR 892.1000 Magnetic resonance diagnostic device, with
the product code MOS (Coil, Magnetic Resonance, Specialty).
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The MR receive-only coils that fall within the scope of this guidance document are intended for
hydrogen/proton imaging. These devices are intended to have no patient contact or intended only
for limited contact with intact skin (i.e., no endocavity coils). MR coils intended for specific
clinical indications (for example, disease identification or rule-out, diagnosis or prognosis with
respect to disease staging or severity, and prevention or reduction in morbidity and/or mortality
associated with particular diseases) or intended for new imaging agent uses are outside the scope
of this guidance document.
Device Design Characteristics:
The MR coils that fall within the scope of this guidance document are designed to be air-cooled
(i.e., no water-cooled or cryogen-cooled electronics). In addition, only receive-only
radiofrequency (RF) coils are within the scope of this guidance.

General guidance that is beyond the scope of this safety and performance guidance document
regarding submission of a 510(k) for MR coils (i.e., labeling), can be found in FDA’s guidance
Submission of Premarket Notifications for Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices.4
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission5 to engage in discussion with FDA prior
to submission of the 510(k).

III. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, you do not need to provide direct comparison testing against a
legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain

contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) identified for each test or evaluation below.
Unless otherwise identified in the submission information sections below, test information such
as results summary, test protocols (including MR system information), or complete test reports
should be submitted as part of the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and
Performance Based Pathway.6 For additional information regarding the submission of nonclinical bench testing information, please see FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and
Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.7
1.

Performance Criteria Source: Criteria are based on aggregated data submitted to FDA
in 510(k) submissions for MR coils previously found to be substantially equivalent.
Additional Considerations: The gray-scale uniformity map methods described in
NEMA MS 3 section 2.3.3 Gray-Scale Uniformity Map, NEMA MS 6 section 2.6
Primary Measurement Procedure for Image Uniformity, NEMA MS 9 (which refer to the
previously mentioned sections of NEMA MS 3 and NEMA MS 6), and Alternative
method “grey-scale map” in section A.2.2 in IEC 62464-1 (Edition 2.0 2018-12) are
excluded because these methods do not provide results that lend to simple objective
assessment and performance criteria.
Submission Information: Results summary and DoC

Biocompatibility Evaluation:
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health’s (CDRH)
guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1, Biological evaluation of medical devices –
Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk management process,9 referred to in the rest of this
document as the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices
covered by this guidance to be categorized as Surface Devices with intact skin and contact
duration of ≤ 24 hours, and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the
CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance.

Cytotoxicity
Sensitization
Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity

Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
biocompatibility endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests
performed unless a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be
appropriately provided, per Attachment E of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance. Any testspecific positive, negative, and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol
deviations should be thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol
deviations may invalidate comparison to the performance criteria listed below and require
submission of a Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k).
8.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance. For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device
control samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform
as expected, as specified above for the subject device samples.
Submission Information: Refer to CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
