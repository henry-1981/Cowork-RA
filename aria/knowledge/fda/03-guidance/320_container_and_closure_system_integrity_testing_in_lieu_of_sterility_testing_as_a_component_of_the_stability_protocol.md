GUIDANCE FOR INDUSTRY1
Container and Closure System Integrity Testing in Lieu of Sterility
Testing as a Component of the Stability Protocol for Sterile
Products
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this
topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the appropriate FDA staff. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff,
call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.
I.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This guidance document provides recommendations to you, manufacturers, for using methods
other than sterility testing to confirm container and closure system integrity as a part of the
stability protocol for sterile biological products, human and animal drugs, and medical devices.
This guidance document finalizes the draft guidance of the same title dated January 1998
(January 28, 1998, 63 Federal Register (FR) 4272).
Manufacturers of drugs and biologics purporting to be sterile must test each batch or lot, as the
case may be, to ensure that the product in question conforms to sterility requirements. 21 CFR
211.167(a); 21 CFR 610.12. Such drugs and biologics are also subject to stability testing
requirements. 21 CFR 211.166. The stability testing requirements include maintaining a written
testing program designed to assess stability characteristics. Manufacturers of medical devices
must validate processes, including sterilization for a device purporting to be sterile. 21 CFR
820.75. Stability testing should be part of the design validation of such devices. In vitro
diagnostic products for human use are required to be labeled with stability information. 21 CFR
809.10. For products labeled as sterile, we consider sterility to be a stability characteristic.
The purpose of stability testing is to provide evidence on how the quality of a substance or
product varies with time under the influence of a variety of environmental factors such as
temperature, humidity, and light, which enables you to establish or modify recommended storage
conditions, retest periods, and shelf life or dating period, as the case may be. 2 This guidance
document applies only to the replacement of the sterility test with an appropriate container and
closure system integrity test in the stability written testing program (referred to in this guidance

Biologics Evaluation and Research, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, and the Center for Veterinary Medicine.

"Dating period" being the term used for biologics, as defined at 21 CFR 600.3(l), and "shelf life" being the term
used for other drugs.

as the "stability protocol"), recommending an alternative to sterility testing for supporting the
continued capability of containers to maintain sterility. The guidance document does not apply
to sterility testing methods for product sterility testing prior to release, as container and closure
system integrity tests cannot demonstrate a product's initial sterility.
This guidance document provides information that we recommend you consider when you
propose using alternative methods to sterility testing to confirm the integrity of a container and
closure system throughout the product's shelf life or dating period. The recommendations in this
guidance document apply to both pre- and post-approval stability protocols for sterile biological
products, human and animal drugs, including investigational and bulk drugs. For medical
devices, the recommendations in this guidance document apply to stability protocols for those
devices labeled as sterile.
If you currently perform sterility testing as a stability-indicating test as part of a stability
protocol, you may continue to do so. If your product is approved for an alternative to sterility
testing as a component of your stability protocol, this document is not intended to recommend
additional testing requirements.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA’s guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.
II.

INTRODUCTION

Products labeled as sterile are expected to be free from viable microbial contamination
throughout the product's entire shelf life or dating period. For products labeled as sterile, we
consider sterility to be a stability characteristic. As a result, the stability protocol should include
confirmation of continuing sterility throughout the product's shelf life or dating period. The
minimum sterility testing generally performed as a component of the stability protocol for sterile
products is at the initial time point (release) and final testing interval (i.e., expiration).
Additional testing is often performed at appropriate intervals within this time period (e.g.,
annually). However, as discussed below sterility tests for the purpose of demonstrating
continuing sterility have limitations, with respect to the method's reliability, accuracy, and the
conclusions that may be derived from the results. Because of the limitations of sterility tests
described below, sterility tests are not recommended as a component of a stability program for
confirming the continued sterility throughout a product's shelf life or dating period. Alternative
methods may be more reliable in confirming the integrity of the container and closure system as
a component of the stability protocol for sterile products.
This guidance document does not suggest specific test methods and acceptance criteria (except
for references to USP methods), nor does it provide comprehensive lists of tests. You should
determine these details based on good scientific principles for each specific container and closure
system taking into consideration particular product formulations and, where applicable, routes of
administration.

DEFINITIONS

The definitions presented here are for the purposes of this guidance only.
A container and closure system refers to the entirety of packaging components that together
contain and protect the product.
A packaging component means any single part of a container and closure system. Typical
components are containers (e.g., ampules, vials, bottles), container liners, closures (e.g., screw
caps, stoppers), closure liners, stopper overseals, container inner seals, administration ports (e.g.,
on large-volume parenterals), overwraps, administration accessories, and container labels.
IV.

BACKGROUND

Sterility tests have long been used to verify that products maintain their sterility throughout the
product's entire shelf life or dating period. However, sterility testing has scientific and practical
limitations, which are well known. Some of these are:
1. Sterility tests will only detect viable microorganisms present at the time of the test;
2. Viable organisms present at the time of the test can only be detected if they are
capable of growth in the specified culture media;
3. Sterility tests may be subject to potential interference due to adventitious microbial
contamination introduced at the time of testing, resulting in false positive readings;
and
4. Sterility tests are always destructive of the samples tested and do not offer the
opportunity to reexamine the same samples in the event of either positive or negative
findings.
Some Centers of FDA have sought to address these shortcomings and communicated the
information to you in the guidance document: "Guidance for Industry for the Submission
Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary
Drug Products" (December 3, 1993, 58 FR 63996). Section V. A., page 16 of the guidance
states:
The ability of the container-closure system to maintain the integrity of its
microbial barrier, and, hence, the sterility of a drug product throughout its shelf
life, should be demonstrated. […] As previously stated, sterility testing at the
initial time point is not considered sufficient to demonstrate the microbial
integrity of a container-closure system. […].
In the Federal Register of July 10, 1996 (61 FR 36466), we published a notice regarding the final
guideline entitled "Quality of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of
Biotechnological/Biological Products", prepared under the auspices of the International
Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals
3

for Human Use (ICH Final Guideline). 3 The ICH Final Guideline is intended to provide
guidance to applicants regarding the type of stability studies that should be provided in support
of marketing applications for biotechnological/biological products. 4
V.

ALTERNATIVES

Alternatives to sterility testing as part of the stability protocol, such as replacing the sterility test
with container and closure system integrity testing, might include any properly validated
physical or chemical container and closure system integrity test (e.g., bubble tests,
pressure/vacuum decay, trace gas permeation/leak tests, dye penetration tests, seal force or
electrical conductivity and capacitance tests, etc.), or microbiological container and closure
system integrity tests (e.g., microbial challenge or immersion tests). Such tests may be more
useful than sterility testing in demonstrating the potential for product contamination over the
product’s shelf life or dating period. The advantages of using such container and closure system
integrity tests in lieu of sterility tests in the stability protocol for sterile products include:
1. Such alternate methods may detect a breach of the container and/or closure system
prior to product contamination;
2. Some of the alternate methods used to evaluate container and closure integrity can
conserve samples that may be used for other stability tests;
3. Alternative test methods may require less time than sterility test methods which
require at least seven days incubation; and
4. The potential for false positive results may be reduced with some alternative test
methods when compared to sterility tests.

For veterinary products, generally, see: VICH GL17, "Stability Testing of New Biotechnological/Biological
Veterinary Medicinal Products," 66 FR 19177, April 13, 2001, and VICH GL3(R), "Stability Testing of New
Veterinary Drug Substances and Medicinal Products (Revision)," 71 FR 19525, April 14, 2006.

The ICH Final Guideline is intended to supplement the tripartite ICH guideline entitled, “Stability Testing of New
Drug Substances and Products,” the notice for which is published in the Federal Register of September 22, 1994 (59
FR 48754). This guideline reflects formal scientific principles for stability testing of human drugs, and provides a
general indication of the information to be generated on product stability, but leaves sufficient flexibility to
encompass the variety of different practical approaches required for specific scientific situations and characteristics
of the materials being evaluated.

A revision of the September 22, 1994, ICH guideline with the same title (Q1A (R)) (66 FR 56332, November 7,
2001) was issued to add information to certain sections and to provide clarification to other sections. The most
important changes were as follows: (1) stress testing of the drug substance was moved from the glossary to the main
text; (2) the text on test procedures was made consistent with ICH guidance “Q6A Specifications: Test Procedures
and Acceptance Criteria for New Drug Substances and New Drug Products: Chemical Substances” (65 FR 83041,
December 29, 2000)), and relevant cross-references to other ICH guidelines were introduced; (3) the text on testing
frequency was amended for accelerated testing conditions; (4) storage conditions are described in more detail, and
testing at low temperature and testing of aqueous liquids in semipermeable containers are specifically addressed; (5)
the postapproval commitment is clearly described; and (6) the guidance was made editorially consistent. A second
revision of the guideline, “Guidance for Industry Q1A (R2) Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and
Products,” (68 FR 65717, November 21, 2003) was issued to harmonize intermediate storage conditions for zones I
and II with long-term storage conditions for zones III and IV.

Occasionally, applicants have proposed the use of a preservative effectiveness test in lieu of the
appropriate sterility test for products containing antimicrobial preservatives. However, these
tests only measure the effectiveness of preservatives against a panel of five different test
organisms. This method cannot confirm product sterility since it does not confirm the presence
or absence of contamination, but rather only demonstrates the microbiological effectiveness of
the preservative system against the five test organisms in question. For these reasons,
preservative effectiveness tests are not acceptable alternative tests for monitoring container and
closure system integrity or for demonstrating maintenance of sterility. However, such tests are
appropriate to perform as part of the stability protocol on multi-dose containers at the end of the
product's shelf life or dating period, to verify antimicrobial preservative effectiveness and
preservative content.
VI.

IMPLEMENTATION

When seeking to implement container and closure system integrity testing as an alternative to
sterility testing as a component of the stability protocol for sterile products, we recommend that
you consider the following:
1. A container and closure system integrity test may replace sterility testing in a stability
program at time points other than the product sterility test prior to release;
2. Container and closure system integrity tests do not replace sterility testing methods
for product sterility testing prior to release;
3. Any validated container and closure system integrity test method should be
acceptable provided the method uses analytical detection techniques appropriate to
the method and is compatible with the specific product being tested. A test method is
adequately validated if it has been proven through scientifically accepted studies to be
capable of detecting a breach in container and closure system integrity; and
4. An appropriate container and closure system integrity test should be conducted
annually and at expiration, or as otherwise required by applicable regulations.
VII.

APPLICATION SUBMISSION

For new marketing applications for sterile products, we recommend that you include container
and closure system integrity tests in your stability protocol. Pending new marketing applications
may be amended prior to approval.
If you wish to incorporate a validated container and closure system integrity test to demonstrate
the continued capability of containers to maintain sterility for an approved product, 5 you must
submit the appropriate application supplement, as follows:

5

As previously mentioned, if you currently perform sterility testing as a stability-indicating test as part of a stability
protocol, you may continue to do so. Also, if your product is approved for an alternative to sterility testing as a
component of your stability protocol, this document is not intended to impose additional testing requirements.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Human drugs: Submit methods and data labeled “Special Supplement - Changes Being
Effected” for new and abbreviated new drug applications under § 314.70.
Animal drugs: Submit methods and data as “Supplement - Changes Being Effected” under §
514.8.
Biological products: Submit a supplement with proper validation data in support of the
proposed change as a “Supplement - Changes Being Effected” under § 601.12.
Medical devices: Submit a PMA supplement with proper validation data in support of the
proposed change under § 814.39.
You should include in your application supplement a discussion of what the test method
evaluates and how it is applicable to microbial integrity. You should select methods that are
appropriate to the product in question, and validate all test methods. Validation of particular
methods should be specific to the product container and closure system or product type. Several
alternative container and closure system integrity test methods exist, as described above. We
encourage you to develop innovative methods of testing the integrity of specific container and
closure systems.
The use of media-filled containers is generally acceptable for initial validation studies. It may be
acceptable to use media-filled containers instead of product-filled containers for testing during
the product's shelf life or dating period, if the product contains a material, such as a preservative,
which would bias the results of the container and closure system integrity test. If you propose to
use media-filled containers for some or all of the testing, you should include data in your
application supplement to support this request.
If you manufacture a number of products that use the same type of container and closure system,
you may validate your integrity test method using a bracketing matrix. 6 It is not necessary to
perform validation studies on each product.
The number of samples to be tested should be statistically appropriate. Samples which pass
container and closure system integrity testing may be further utilized in the stability testing for
that specific test period or interval; however, the test should be non-destructive and the sample
unaltered by the container and closure testing method itself. Samples should not, however, be
tested for container and closure system integrity at one time interval (e.g., 12 months), and then
stored for further stability testing at later time periods (e.g., 24 months).
