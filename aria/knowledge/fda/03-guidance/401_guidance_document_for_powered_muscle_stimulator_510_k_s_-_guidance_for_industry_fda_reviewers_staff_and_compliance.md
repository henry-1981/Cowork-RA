Guidance1 Document for
Powered Muscle Stimulator 510(k)s
INTRODUCTION
This guidance document replaces documents entitled “Guidance Document for the Preparation of
Premarket Notification [510(k)] Applications for Powered Muscle Stimulators, and Ultrasound
Diathermy and Muscle Stimulators,” dated July 26, 1995; “Electrical Muscle Stimulator (EMS)
Labeling Indications, Contraindications, Warnings, etc.,” dated July 11, 1985; and
“Technological Reporting for Powered Muscle Stimulator 510(k) Submissions,” dated January 1,
1993.  The purpose of developing this new document is to provide the sponsor and FDA
reviewers/staff with updated and consolidated guidance regarding powered muscle stimulators
identified and classified under 21 CFR 890.5850 and reviewed under the premarket notification
[510(k)] process.  This guidance also serves to correct erroneous and outdated information
contained in the previous guidance documents.
The objective of this document is to identify important administrative, descriptive, and technical
information that should be included in a 510(k) submission for a powered muscle stimulator.
Individual 510(k) submissions may need additional information pertinent to each specific device.
The suggestions and recommendations included in the guidance reflect the typical minimal
information that would allow an evaluation of the device, as determined by the Restorative Devices
Branch (REDB).  Although the use of this document in the preparation of a 510(k) premarket
notification will not ensure FDA’s granting marketing clearance of a particular device, following
the guidance will help ensure that sufficient basic information is available to initiate a substantive
review.
This guidance document should be viewed as a “living” document.  Accordingly, it will be
revised periodically as scientific knowledge and/or regulations change.
All FDA publications referred to in this guidance document can be obtained by contacting the
Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) at 800-638-2041 (toll free) or
301-443-6597.  Some publications can be obtained via DSMA’s Internet site at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/dsma/dsmamain.html .  Specific questions and clarification regarding
this guidance document should be directed to the Restorative Devices Branch at 301-594-1296.
1This document is intended to provide guidance.  It represents the Agency’s current thinking on this topic.  It does
not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  An alternative
approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.

DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION
INTENDED USE AND INDICATIONS FOR USE
The sponsor should identify and describe the proposed intended use of the device.
The specific intended use(s), including the specific therapeutic indications, for the subject device
and the predicate device should be identified.  The new device should have the same intended
medical uses as those specified for the predicate device, to the extent that the changes do not alter
the therapeutic or diagnostic effect and do not affect the safety and effectiveness.  These intended
uses should be consistent with the descriptions of intended medical uses contained within the CFR
section that is applicable to the device and should identify the specific medical conditions for which
the device is indicated.  If the indication differs from the predicate device, all differences should be
identified and a justification as to how the change(s) do not affect safety and effectiveness should be
provided.  If special labeling claims are sought, information should be provided to support these
claims.
The standard indications for use for Powered Muscle Stimulators classified under 21 CFR 890.5850
are:
1.
Relaxation of muscle spasms;
2.
Prevention or retardation of disuse atrophy;
3.
Increasing local blood circulation;
4.
Muscle re-education;
5.
Immediate post-surgical stimulation of calf muscles to prevent venous thrombosis; and
6.
Maintaining or increasing range of motion.
A 510(k) submission for a powered muscle stimulator may seek marketing clearance for all of these
indications for use, or for a subset of these indications.
Note:
Some devices contain multiple operating modes, with each mode having a unique set (or
subset) of indications for use.   If this is the case for the proposed device, the sponsor should
clearly specify (i.e., in both the 510(k) submission and in the labeling) the particular set of
indications for use that corresponds to each mode of operation.
Note:
In general, muscle stimulators that operate continuously (or without a sufficient period of
rest between pulse trains) and/or at an effective frequency above the physiological range
may be appropriate only for relaxation of muscle spasms.  For such devices, additional
information should be provided to support any of the other indications for which repeated,
sustainable muscle contractions are necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
