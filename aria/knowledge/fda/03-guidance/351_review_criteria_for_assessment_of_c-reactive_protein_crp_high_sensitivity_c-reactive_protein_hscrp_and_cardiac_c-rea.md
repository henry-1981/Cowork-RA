Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Review Criteria for Assessment of CReactive Protein (CRP), High Sensitivity
C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) and Cardiac
C-Reactive Protein (cCRP) Assays
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction

This guidance is intended to provide device manufacturers and FDA staff with updated
recommendations concerning 510(k) submissions for various types of assays for C-Reactive
Protein (CRP). The document is a revision of “Guidance for Industry: In Vitro Diagnostic CReactive Protein Immunological Test System,” issued on July 20, 1998. It is updated to
address issues associated with the development of hsCRP (high sensitivity CRP) and cCRP
(cardiac CRP) assays. These types of CRP assays have significantly lower limits of
detection, and functional sensitivities that may be used to support new clinical uses of CRP
quantitation. This document now includes discussion of how you should support indications
for use claims of cCRP “for the evaluation of patients with coronary disease and coronary
syndromes” in premarket submissions, including how you should assess different ranges of
measurement, based on indications for use. Additionally, we provide recommendations for
limitations of CRP test interpretation based on the non-specific nature of CRP elevations in
blood.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe should be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues
we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there
is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in
the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is
available on our Center web page at:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.

2.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a CRP test system should conform to the general
controls of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act), including the premarket
notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a substantial
equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device.
This guidance document identifies the classification regulations and product codes for
various types of CRP tests. (Refer to Section 4 – Scope.) In addition, other sections of this
guidance document list the risks to health identified by FDA from the various CRP tests and
describe measures that, if followed by manufacturers and combined with the general controls,
will generally address the risks associated with these kinds of CRP tests and lead to a timely
[510(k)] review and clearance. This document supplements other FDA documents regarding
the specific content requirements of a premarket notification submission. You should also
refer to 21 CFR 807.87 and other FDA documents on this topic, such as the 510(k) Manual Premarket Notification: 510(k) - Regulatory Requirements for Medical Devices,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/manual/510kprt1.html
As explained in “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications; Final Guidance1,” a manufacturer
may submit a Traditional 510(k) or has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k)
or a Special 510(k), when appropriate. FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides the
least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device,
particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document. Manufacturers considering
modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a
Special 510(k).

Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA may consider the
contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the meaning of 21
CFR 807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary report. The
report should describe how this guidance document was used during the device development
and testing and should describe the methods or tests used and a summary of the test data,
description of the acceptance criteria applied to address the risks identified in this document,
and any additional risks specific to your device. This section suggests information to fulfill
some of the requirements of 807.87 as well as some other items that we recommend you
generally include in an Abbreviated 510(k).
Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and
cite the title of this guidance document.
Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Refer to Section 11 for specific information that should be
included in the labeling for devices of the types covered by this guidance document.)
Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain the following:

2

•

A description of the device and its intended use. We recommend that the
description include a complete discussion of the performance specifications and,
when appropriate, detailed, labeled drawings of the device. You should also
submit an "indications for use" enclosure.2

•

A description of device design and its requirements.

•

Identification of the Risk Analysis method(s) used to assess the risk profile in
general as well as the specific device’s design and the results of this analysis.
(Refer to Section 5 for the risks to health generally associated with the use of this
device that FDA has identified.)

•

A discussion of the device characteristics that address the risks identified in this
guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in your risk analysis.

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.
6

•

A description of the test method(s) you used to address each performance aspect
identified in Sections 8-9 (and 10, if appropriate) of this guidance document. If
you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the method rather than
describing it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method but
should provide sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for the
modification. For each test, you may either (1) present the data resulting from the
test in clear form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that you
apply to your test results.3 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design Controls
for the Quality System Regulation.)

•

If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or
testing, you may include either: (1) a statement that testing will be conducted and
meet specified acceptance criteria before the product is marketed, or (2) a
declaration of conformity to the standard.4 Because a declaration of conformity is
based on results from testing, we believe you cannot properly submit a declaration
of conformity until you have completed the testing the standard describes.

If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks
identified through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of
the device’s performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we
need it to assess the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we may
request any additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding
substantial equivalence.)
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k)
that provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in
this guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include your data, as well as methods, acceptance
criteria, and conclusions. Manufacturers considering modifications to their own cleared
devices should consider submitting Special 510(k)s.

4.

Scope

The scope of this document is limited to the following devices as described in 21 CFR
866.5270, C-reactive protein immunological test system.
The product codes are:

5.

Types of CRP Assays

The following types of CRP assays have been cleared:
•
•
•

Conventional C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)
Cardiac C-Reactive Protein (cCRP)

Conventional CRP
Conventional CRP assays include qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative assays, with
indications for use for evaluation of infection, tissue injury, and inflammatory disorders.
These assays provide information for the diagnosis, therapy, and monitoring of inflammatory
diseases. CRP is one of the cytokine-induced "acute-phase" proteins [1] whose blood levels
rise during a general, unspecific response to infections and non-infectious inflammatory
processes [2]. For conventional CRP assays, test values are typically considered to be
clinically significant at levels above 10 mg/L. In apparently healthy persons blood CRP
levels are below 5 mg/L, while in various conditions this threshold is often exceeded within
four to eight hours after an acute inflammatory event, with CRP values reaching
approximately 20 to 500 mg/L. [3]
CRP is a more sensitive and more reliable indicator of acute inflammatory processes than the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and leukocyte count. Blood CRP levels rise more
rapidly than ESR, and after the disease has subsided CRP values rapidly fall and reach the
reference interval often days before ESR has returned to normal. [4, 5]
High sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)
High sensitivity CRP assays have a range of measurement that extends below the
measurement range typical of most conventional CRP assays. This lower range of
measurement may expand the indications for use to include the evaluation of conditions
thought to be associated with inflammation in otherwise healthy individuals. Increases in
CRP values are non-specific and should not be interpreted without a complete clinical
evaluation. Indications for hsCRP assays are general and not associated with specific
diseases or risks for disease.

8

Cardiac C-Reactive Protein (cCRP)
Cardiac CRP assays are indicated for use as an aid in the identification and stratification of
individuals at risk for future cardiovascular disease. When used in conjunction with
traditional clinical laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes, cCRP may be
useful as an independent marker of prognosis for recurrent events in patients with stable
coronary disease or acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac CRP assays, like hsCRP assays,
have measurement ranges that extend below the measurement range typical of most
conventional CRP assays. The difference between hsCRP and cCRP is not the analyte itself,
but is due to the additional performance validation to support the expanded intended use in
the evaluation of coronary disease discussed below. For cCRP, the validity of the indications
related to cardiovascular disease should be demonstrated in clinical studies. You may use
literature based on a predicate device to support a cCRP claim for your device if you present
bridging studies, showing comparability of values across devices, to support transfer of
clinical findings to the new cCRP device. Bridging studies should demonstrate
comparability of devices in terms of method comparison study results, precision, and
interference. In addition, to enable comparison of cCRP assay results to each other, cCRP
assays should be standardized to IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 470, a certified reference material
for the acute-phase reactants [6]. Manufacturers of cCRP assays should always emphasize in
the device labeling that increases in CRP values are non-specific and should not be
interpreted without a complete clinical evaluation.
The table below outlines similarities and differences between these 3 types of assays, in
terms of intended use and performance features that you should demonstrate in a 510(k).

Risks to Health

Failure of a CRP assay to perform as indicated may lead to improper patient management. A
falsely low or falsely high measurement could contribute to improper risk assessment or
improper differentiation of tissue injury and inflammatory processes, from non-inflammatory
processes. A false result for a cCRP assay could result in assignment of inappropriate risk
stratification for individuals thought to be at risk for cardiac events. In addition, an error in

10

interpretation of results, such as use of assay results to adjust a treatment regimen without
consideration of other clinical factors, may also lead to improper patient management.
In the table below, FDA has identified the risks to health generally associated with the use of
CRP tests addressed in this document. The measures recommended to mitigate these
identified risks are given in this guidance document, as shown in the table below. We
recommend that you conduct a risk analysis, prior to submitting your premarket notification,
to identify any other risks specific to your device. The premarket notification should
describe the risk analysis method. If you elect to use an alternative approach to address a
particular risk identified in this document, or have identified risks additional to those in this
document, you should provide sufficient detail to support the approach you have used to
address that risk.

Device Description

You should identify your device by regulation and product code in your 510(k).
For any CRP test, you should fully describe the principle method of the assay in the 510(k).
For new technologies or methods, you should also provide details on how this new method
for CRP relates to predicate CRP assays, cleared with the same indications for use as your
assay.

8.

Analytical Performance Characteristics

General Study Recommendations
Whenever possible, we recommend that you include patient samples or sample pools, derived
from the intended use population (i.e., apparently healthy individuals suspected to be at risk
of the specific inflammatory associated condition or disease) for the various analytical
protocols described below. If sufficient samples at the low end of the assay range cannot be
obtained from such samples, then we recommend supplementing with patient samples or
sample pools derived from healthy individuals, at low risk of inflammatory conditions or
disease.

11

Although spiked samples can be used to supplement the analytical studies, FDA cautions
against using spiked samples as the only matrix in the evaluations, because spiked samples
may not provide an accurate assessment of the performance characteristics. FDA
recommends that you do not use hemolysates in the analytical studies because these
specimens may not test the effects of all preparatory steps on test performance.
So that acceptance criteria or results can be best interpreted during the review, we
recommend that you provide appropriate specifics concerning protocols. These specifics are
also necessary to aid users in interpreting information in your labeling. For example, when
referring to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute)/NCCLS protocols or guidelines,
we recommend that you indicate which specific aspects of the protocols or guidelines you
followed, and describe any modifications.
Generally, we recommend that performance be assessed in the testing environment where the
device will ultimately be used (i.e., central laboratory or point of care), by the types of
individuals who will use the test in clinical practice (e.g., trained technologists, nurses). We
recommend that you initially analyze data separately to evaluate any inter-site variation and
include results of the analysis in the 510(k) summary report. You may be able to pool
method comparison results from the individual sites in the package insert if you demonstrate
that there are no significant differences in the results among sites. You may contact OIVD
before initiating a clinical study.
The intended use of your device should be compatible with the performance characteristics
of the assay; for example, assays that do not meet high sensitivity performance criteria
should not claim use for evaluation or stratification of patients for diseases associated with
inflammation. Additionally, claims for cardiac risk stratification should be supported with
clinical data, whether from new studies, peer-reviewed literature sources using the same
device for which clearance is sought, or literature together with device-specific bridging
studies.

Specific Performance Characteristics
Precision of Quantitative C-Reactive Protein Assays
For quantitative assays, we recommend that you characterize within-run, and total precision
using patient samples or sample pools. We recommend that you follow guidelines provided
in “Evaluation of Precision Performance of Quantitative Measurement Methods”; Approved
Guideline –Second edition (2004) CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute)/NCCLS,
EP5-A2. That document includes guidelines for experimental design, computations, and a
format for stating performance claims.
You should evaluate precision at relevant CRP concentrations, including near medical
decision points, and concentrations near the limits of reportable range. We recommend that
for hsCRP and cCRP assays, one level should be at the American Heart Association/Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (AHA/CDC) clinical cutoff for low risk category (1.0
mg/L) [7] and should have a C.V.≤ 10%, another should be at a mid-point of the assay range
and the third should be at or near the upper limit of the assay. We recommend that you
describe the following items in your 510(k):
12

•

sample types (e.g., serum, plasma, or whole blood) and preparation, or origin

•

sites at which the protocol was run

•

number of days, runs, and observations

•

target concentrations

•

mean and standard deviations for within-run and total precision

We recommend that you describe which factors (e.g., instrument calibration, reagent lots,
operators) were held constant, and which were varied during the evaluation, as well as the
computational methods, if they are different from that described in CLSI/NCCLS EP5-A2.
Precision studies for a point of care setting should be conducted at three sites by intended
users such as nurses, technicians, doctors, etc.
Precision of Qualitative/Semi Quantitative CRP Assays
For qualitative assays, we recommend you follow “User Protocol for Evaluation of
Qualitative Test Performance”; Approved Guideline (2002), CLSI/NCCLS, EP12-A, to
establish an estimate of precision. You should test negative and positive samples at
concentrations within 20% of the cutoff, since evaluation of low-negative or high-positive
samples would not challenge the assay. We recommend that you test 20 replicates of each
sample and calculate percent agreement for the negative samples and also the positive
samples.
In your 510(k), you should describe your study design, including sample types, study sites,
and factors varied (e.g., days, operators).
Interference
We recommend that you characterize the effects of potential interferents on assay
performance. Examples of experimental designs, including guidelines for selecting
interferents for testing, are described in “Interference Testing in Clinical Chemistry;
Approved Guideline” (2002) CLSI/NCCLS, EP7-A.
Typically, interference studies involve adding the potential interferent to a serum sample and
determining any bias in the recovery of CRP relative to a control sample (to which no
interferent has been added).
We recommend that you describe the following concerning your study design:
•

types and levels of interferents tested

•

a description of the samples tested (e.g., matrix, preparation, origin)

•

concentrations of CRP in the sample

•

definition or method for computing interference (including replicates tested)
13

We recommend that you identify any observed trends in bias (i.e., negative or positive) and
indicate the range of observed recoveries in the presence of the particular interferent. This
approach is more informative than listing average recoveries alone.
We recommend that you state the criteria on which non-interference is determined. For
example: “Inaccuracies due to bilirubin are less than x% at CRP concentrations of 1.0 mg/L”.
You may not need to perform additional interference testing with interferents identified in
literature or by other sources. However, you should identify these interferents in your
instructions for use.
Sensitivity
For CRP assays claiming high sensitivity (hsCRP or cCRP), you should calculate and report
the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the assay, (sometimes also referred to as functional
sensitivity). We use this term to mean the lowest concentration at which assay bias and
precision are within acceptance criteria, under your stated experimental conditions.
Acceptance criteria for precision should be %CV ≤ 20%. The LOQ should be significantly
below the clinical cut-off of the assay (1.0 mg/L in the case of cardiovascular risk assessment
with cCRP tests). In determining the LOQ, we recommend that you follow “Protocols for
determination of Limits of Detection and Limits of Quantitation; Approved Guideline (2004),
CLSI/NCCLS, EP-17A.
You may also wish to report the limit of blank, also discussed in further detail in
CLSI/NCCLS, EP-17A . This is often determined as the highest measurement results likely
to be observed for a blank sample. Typically, manufacturers determine two or more standard
deviations (SD) above the mean of the zero standard or calibrator, by repeated measurements
of one or more blank samples, such as the zero calibrator.
The determination of the limit of the blank for conventional CRP assays may be clinically
irrelevant, if that limit is considerably below the clinical cutoff. In such cases, you may
choose not to state this value in the label. However, you should describe assay performance
(e.g. linearity, precision) at the low end of the claimed assay range or clinical cutoff.
In the description of your sensitivity evaluation, we recommend that you describe your study
design, calculations, and definition of your measures of sensitivity. You should also provide
results, acceptance criteria, and clarification of how measurements below the level of
sensitivity are reported to the user.
Linearity
For quantitative or semi-quantitative tests, we recommend that you characterize the linear
range of the assay by evaluating samples whose concentration levels are known relative to
each other. “Evaluation of the Linearity of Quantitative Measurement Procedures, A
Statistical Approach; Approved Guideline (2003), CLSI/NCCLS, EP6-A describes a protocol
for sample preparation and value assignment as well as a format for stating performance
characteristics.
We recommend that you describe the sample types and preparation, concentrations and
statistical methods or calculations used (including replicates tested). When describing
14

your acceptance criteria or summary data, we recommend that you include the slope and
intercept with confidence intervals, the estimated regression line, the range of linearity
and the degree of deviations (biases) from the estimated line that were observed or that
are considered acceptable for the various concentration levels. We recommend that you
list observed or acceptable values relative to the expected values for each level you
evaluated.
Specimen collection and handling conditions
You should substantiate statements in your labeling about specimen storage and transport by
assessing whether the device can maintain acceptable performance (e.g., precision) over the
storage times and temperatures recommended to users. For example, an appropriate study
may include an analysis of aliquots stored under the conditions of time, temperature, or
allowed number of freeze/thaw cycles. We recommend that you state your criteria for an
acceptable range of recoveries under the recommended storage and handling conditions.
Calibration
We recommend that you provide the following information about the calibrators in the
assay kit:
•

Protocol and acceptance criteria for real-time or accelerated stability studies
for opened and unopened calibrators.

•

Protocol and acceptance criteria for value assignment and validation,
including any specific instrument applications or statistical analyses used.

•

Identification of traceability to a domestic or international standard reference
material. FDA recommends that cCRP assays should be standardized to
IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 470 and hsCRP assay should at a minimum be
traceable this standard.

•

Protocol and acceptance criteria for the transfer of performance of a primary
calibrator to a secondary calibrator.

For information about calibrators marketed separately as class II devices under
862.1150, see the guidance “Abbreviated 510(k) Submissions for In Vitro Diagnostic
Calibrators,” http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/calibrator.html.

Method Comparison

General Recommendations
You should compare results obtained with your device to those obtained with a predicate
device with similar indications for use and similar assay range. Banked (retrospective)
samples may be appropriate for the studies as long as appropriate information concerning
sample characterization is available.
You should evaluate patient samples with CRP concentrations distributed across the
reportable range of the assay. Regardless of whether prospective or retrospectively collected
15

samples are used, we recommend that you provide a clear description of how the samples
were selected, including reasons that samples are excluded. We recommend that you indicate
whether samples are chosen from patients with specific clinical outcome or risk profiles
pertinent to indications for either conventional CRP assays or hsCRP or cCRP assays.
We recommend that you follow guidelines provided in “Method Comparison and Bias
Estimation Using Patient Samples”; Approved guideline (2002) CLSI/NCCLS, EP9-A2,
concerning experimental guidelines and statement of performance characteristics.
Appropriate sample size depends on factors such as precision, interference, range, and other
performance characteristics of the test. We recommend that you provide a statistical
justification to support the study sample size.
Method comparison studies for a point of care setting should be conducted at three sites by
intended users such as nurses, technicians, doctors, etc. At least 40 samples at each site
should be tested with a minimum of 25 percent of the samples having values near the cut-off
concentration. You may be able to pool method comparison results from the individual sites
in the package insert if you demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the results
among sites.
You may contact OIVD for input on your study plan prior to initiating the studies.

Additional considerations for hsCRP and cCRP method comparison
evaluations
For cCRP assays, you should compare your new assay directly to a predicate device for
which clinical studies are available to support clinical utility of the specific device. Results
of your study should support transferability between the assays.
In order to fully evaluate the clinically relevant range for accuracy for a hsCRP assay, your
method comparison to the predicate or reference assay should encompass the entire assay
range starting from less than 1.0 mg/L. The rationale for this is that CRP levels less than 1.0
mg/L are generally considered below the clinical cut-off for hsCRP measurements. (For this
reason, we believe the analytical cutoff should also be significantly less than 1.0 mg/L.) The
evaluation should extend to 5.0 mg/L or greater, but not more than 10.0 mg/L. Patient
samples should be evenly distributed throughout this range. Your study should demonstrate
that the assay can accurately measure values between the LOQ and 5.0 mg/L, in order to
encompass the clinically meaningful stratification values recommended by the AHA/CDC
[7].

Considerations for qualitative conventional CRP assays
Qualitative conventional CRP assays are usually devices with a titration format, e.g., latex
particle agglutination assays. These assays are generally not sensitive in the low range of
measurement, and are not able to differentiate degree of disease state, but are intended to
evaluate qualitatively for disease versus non-disease states. The clinical cut-off for
conventional CRP assays is frequently between 5.0 and 10.0 mg/L. For such tests we
16

recommend that you follow guidelines provided in the document “User Protocol for
Evaluation of Qualitative Test Performance”; Approved Guideline (2002), CLSI/NCCLS,
EP12-A concerning experimental guidelines and statement of performance characteristics.

Presentation of results
We recommend that you conduct a separate analysis of data for each group. Specifically, for
hsCRP, it may be appropriate to separately analyze apparently healthy individuals referred
for risk evaluation for a condition related to inflammation and individuals known to be at risk
or to have inflammatory disorders. For conventional CRP, you should analyze patients with
non-inflammatory processes versus inflammatory processes. When providing the results of
the method comparison study, we recommend that you include the following information:
•

Quantitative or semi-quantitative tests: plots of results from the new assay (y-axis) versus
the reference method (x-axis) or predicate, including all of the data points, the estimated
regression line and the line of identity. Data points should represent individual
measurements. If a predicate device is used for comparison, we recommend that you
employ Deming regression, or another method that accounts for variability in both test
systems. You should provide a description of the analytical method used to fit the
regression line and results of regression analysis, including the slope and intercept with
their 95% confidence limits, the standard error of the estimate (calculated in the y
direction), and a coefficient of determination and an estimate of systematic bias at
medical decision points.

•

Qualitative tests: a 2 X 2 table showing agreement between the new assay (rows) versus
the reference method or predicate device (columns), and calculations of the percent
positive, percent negative, and overall agreement between the methods, including the
95% confidence intervals or other measure of robustness where appropriate.

10. Clinical Information
Based on the studies described above, you should demonstrate transferability of reference
intervals, between the new device and a predicate, for which clinical utility has already been
demonstrated. We recommend using guidelines in “How to Define and Determine Reference
Intervals in the Clinical Laboratory”; Approved Guideline, Second Edition 2000,
CLSI/NCCLS C28-A2. Specifically, if the new test system has similar imprecision and
known interferences, comparable standards and calibrators, and is acceptably comparable in
absolute values to a predicate device previously cleared for the same indication, then the
reference interval can generally be transferred, and further clinical studies will generally not
be needed.
In accordance with the least burdensome provisions, the agency will rely upon well-designed
bench (and/or animal testing) rather than requiring clinical studies for new devices unless
there is a specific justification for asking for clinical information to support a determination
of substantial equivalence. However, we may request clinical studies in the following
instances:
17

•

The indications for use are dissimilar from CRP assays of the same type.

•

The performance of the new CRP assay does not allow for reference interval transfer
previously determined in clinical studies used in support of the indication.

We will consider alternatives to clinical testing when the proposed alternatives are supported
by an adequate scientific rationale.
Data to support clinical utility can be based on clinical studies you conduct. You should
conduct these studies (e.g. method comparison studies, precision studies) in two or more
external sites, in addition to that of the manufacturer. Your support for clinical utility can
also be based on literature, when available, for example, a meta-analysis of information
derived from the literature using the new device. If you are conducting a clinical study to
demonstrate substantial equivalence, refer to Blue Book Memorandum entitled “Significant
Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies” http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/d861.html.

11. Labeling
The premarket notification should include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). Although final labeling is not required for 510(k)
clearance, final labeling must also comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 809.10 before a
medical device is introduced into interstate commerce. The following suggestions are aimed
at assisting you in preparing labeling that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e) and
21 CFR 809.10.
Directions for use
You should include clear and concise instructions that delineate the technological
features of your device and how it is to be used on patients. Instructions should
encourage local/institutional training programs designed to familiarize users with the
features of the device and how to use it in a safe and effective manner.
Intended Use
As discussed above, the intended use should be compatible with the performance
characteristics of the assay. Assays that do not meet high sensitivity performance
criteria, and are not supported by bridging studies or literature should not claim use
for evaluating patients for specific diseases associated with inflammation; rather, the
intended use of such assays should be limited to the general use in the detection and
evaluation of infection, tissue injury, and inflammatory disorders.
Summary and Explanation
You should explain that CRP is an “acute phase” protein and rises non-specifically in
response to inflammation. You should also clarify that intra-individual variation is a
major limitation of the assay when the assay is used for directing therapies and
include recommendations such as the following:
18

•

Intra-individual variations of the CRP levels are from 30 to 60%. Serial
measurements may be required to estimate true mean of CRP depending on
the intended use in any specific individual.

If a claim is made for use in coronary disease evaluation, or for the evaluation of
other inflammatory associated conditions, you should further emphasize the
non-specific nature of CRP and include clear recommendations that CRP values
should not be interpreted without a complete clinical evaluation. Additionally, you
should recommend follow up-testing of patients with elevated values in order to help
rule out a recent response to undetected infection or tissue injury.
Principle of the Method
If you used literature to support clearance of the new device, you should discuss how
your method is traceable to the method used in the supportive literature, as discussed
above. For cCRP, methods should be standardized to IFCC/BCR/CAP CRM 470.
Limitations
You should thoroughly discuss the limitations of the assay. You should also discuss
any recommended practice or other expert recommendations concerning the
limitations of CRP for the intended use.
As an example, an AHA/CDC Scientific Statement, [7] based on investigation of the
use of hsCRP and cardiovascular disease, made several recommendations for
limitations on the use of Cardiac C-Reactive Protein (cCRP). These
recommendations are highlighted below, and should be included in the labeling of all
assays seeking cCRP indications for cardiac risk evaluation:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Screening the entire adult population is not recommended.
CRP is not a substitute for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Acute coronary syndrome management should not depend on CRP measurements.
When being used for risk assessment, patients with persistently unexplained CRP
levels above 10 mg/L should be evaluated for other non-cardiovascular origins.
Testing for any risk assessment should not be performed while there is indication
of infection, systemic inflammation, or trauma.
Secondary prevention measures should be based on global risk assessment and
not depend on CRP.
Serial testing of CRP should not be used to monitor effects of treatment.
The average of CRP results repeated optimally two weeks apart should be used in
performing risk assessment on metabolically stable patients.

Interpretation of Results
You should include the following, with your interpretation of results:
•

Express CRP, hsCRP, and cCRP measurements in mg/L.

19

•
•
•
•

Clarify that results below the lower limit of detection should be reported as less
than that of the value of the lower limit of detection.
Emphasize the need for detailed clinical evaluation and follow-up testing of
elevated hsCRP and cCRP results.
Indicate the imprecision at the 99th percentile of the reference population. This
value should be ≤ 10% C.V.
Intra-individual variations of CRP are significant and should be taken into
account when interpreting values.

Performance Characteristics
You should summarize all study designs and describe performance characteristics as
discussed in Sections 8-9 (and 10, if appropriate) of this document.
Precision
You should describe within-run and total precision, determined at three levels. As
discussed in the precision section above, one level should be at the clinical cutoff of
normal, another should be a mid-point of the assay range from the cutoff and the third
should be at or near the upper limit of the assay.
Sensitivity
For high sensitivity assays, you should report functional sensitivity (limit of
detection), as well as limit of blank. You may also wish to report sensitivity based on
the measurements of blank samples (e.g., zero calibrator). (See the Sensitivity
section, above.)
Assays with multiple ranges
It is possible that a CRP assay may offer two ranges of measurement (full range). In
these instances, performance of the hsCRP or cCRP range of measurement should be
characterized and presented independently from the performance of the conventional
CRP range of measurement.
Method Comparison
You should present the method comparison results evenly distributed across the assay
range appropriate for the intended use of your assay. For example, in cardiovascular
and peripheral vascular disease risk assessment, the clinically relevant range is from
values of < 1.0 mg/L to 5.0 mg/L, but not more than 10 mg/L. You should
summarize the study design and results of your analyses, including the slope and
intercept, with 95% confidence intervals, standard error, and coefficient of
determination. We recommend that you display the data in a scatter plot.
