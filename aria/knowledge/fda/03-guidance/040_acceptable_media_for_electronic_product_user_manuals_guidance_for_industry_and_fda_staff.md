Acceptable Media for Electronic Product
User Manuals
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA
staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to clarify that manufacturers can provide user
manuals accompanying electronic products in either paper or electronic form. This is done to
recognize that electronic media are now being widely used to provide instruction, while at the
same time reducing paper consumption, increasing accessibility and providing rapid means for
editing and updating content.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

User Manuals

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 Part 1002.3 states in part: “The Director… of the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health… may require a manufacturer of a radiation emitting
electronic product to provide to the ultimate purchaser…performance data and other technical data
related to safety of the product…” These data are typically contained in user manuals that
accompany electronic products and historically the media for these manuals has been printed paper.
Specific performance standards in 21 CFR Parts 1020.20(c)(4)(i), 1020.30(h), 1020.40(c)(9),
1030.10(c)(4), 1040.10(h), and 1040.20(e) also contain requirements for providing instructions to
users of electronic products. For example, 21 CFR 1020.30(h) and1040.10(h) specify information
manufacturers must provide to users of diagnostic x-ray and laser products respectively.
With the availability of electronic information storage and display technology, many commercial
product manuals are being provided electronically. Electronic documentation saves storage
space, reduces paper consumption, increases accessibility, and provides rapid means for editing
and updating of content.

For these reasons, manufacturers can provide the required user information in PDF format.
Manufacturers may provide the required information as a web site download, on a compact disc (CD)
or on other storage media in common use (e.g., USB external drive), so long as it is made available
directly to the purchaser of the product. If the product purchaser is unable to access the electronic
version provided, the manufacturer must make the required documentation available in hard copy
(e.g., printed paper) at no additional cost. The manuals in whatever form provided should be in the
English language.

Impact on Required Reports

Radiation safety reports (including user manuals) required by 21 CFR 1002.10 through 1002.13
may be submitted to FDA in one of the following ways:
1) All Radiation Safety reports may be submitted to CDRH by email to the
RadHealthCustomerService@fda.hhs.gov mailbox. This includes all report types, such as
product reports, annual reports, and supplemental reports of all types, and all communications
such as notifications of defect/failure to comply, corrective action plan (CAP) proposals, and
accidental radiation occurrences (AROs). Reports should be submitted in PDF format, or
packaged by the eSubmitter packaging procedures, and attached to your email. eSubmissions
no longer need to be transferred to a physical medium and mailed to the CDRH Document
Control Center. An eSubmitter user does not need to acquire an FDA Electronic Submissions
Gateway account.
2) Electronically using FDA’s eSubmitter software which can be downloaded at no cost from
https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-esubmitter. Documents prepared using eSubmitter may be
sent directly to CDRH via FDA’s Electronic Submissions Gateway (ESG).
3) On CD using FDA’s eSubmitter software. Documents prepared using eSubmitter may be
loaded on a CD and mailed to CDRH for processing, or
4) In hard copy, paper documentation may be mailed to the following address:
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Center for Devices and Radiological Health
Document Control Center - WO66-G609
10903 New Hampshire Avenue
Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002

Note: If electronic versions of user manuals are submitted, the required radiation safety report should
also be submitted electronically.
