Guidance for Resorbable Adhesion Barrier
Devices for Use in Abdominal and/or Pelvic
Surgery; Guidance for Industry
This document is intended to provide guidance. It represents the Agency’s current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the public. An
alternative approach may be used if such approach satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statute and regulations.
BACKGROUND
This guidance document discusses the development of preclinical and clinical information for an
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), Premarket Approval (PMA), or Product Development
Protocol (PDP) application for a resorbable adhesion barrier product for use in the abdominal
and/or pelvic cavity. This document provides guidance for the preparation of an IDE application
and for the development of valid scientific evidence to support PMA applications for adhesion
barriers that are resorbed within 30 days of placement into the peritoneal/pelvic cavity.
FDA has determined that the resorbable adhesion barrier is a significant risk device as defined in
21 CFR 812.3(m)(4). The resorbable adhesion barrier is a class III device which is subject to
premarket approval in accordance with section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics
(FD&C) Act.
This guidance document is based upon FDA’s analysis of published scientific information,
interaction with manufacturers, and input from FDA’s Medical Device Advisory Committees
(General and Plastic Surgery Devices Panel and the Obstetrics and Gynecologic Devices Panel).
It is the product of a collaborative effort between the Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Devices
Branch (PRSB) in the Division of General Restorative and Neurological Devices (DGRND), and
the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Branch (OGDB) in the Division of Reproductive,
Abdominal, and Radiological Devices (DRARD). We encourage you to submit comments at any
time. Please see the Preface of this document for instructions on submitting your comments.
Applications with primarily gynecologic indication(s) will be reviewed primarily by OGDB.
Applications with more general abdominal indication(s) will be reviewed primarily by PRSB.
Regardless which branch takes the lead role, there will be collaboration and consultation between
the two branches. Appropriate reviewers from the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Office of
Science and Technology (OST), Office of Surveillance and Biometrics (OSB), and Office of
Compliance (OC) will participate in the review. Consultation from the Center for Drug
Evaluation and Research (CDER) and/or the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER) and appropriate device advisory panel members may be necessary depending on the
product, indication(s) for use, conditions of use, and surgical models.
This guidance document provides a framewo rk specific to the development of preclinical and
clinical information for these devices. It is designed to be used in conjunction with other FDA
1

publications on IDE, PMA, and PDP applications. We cannot anticipate all of the issues related
to individual products in a guidance document. Therefore, we encourage you to consult with
FDA as early as possible in planning your product development.
The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those issues that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully considered
the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision- making. We also considered the burden that may
be incurred in your attempt to comply with the guidance and address the issues we have identified.
We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to resolving the issues presented
in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there is a less burdensome way to address
the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving
Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is available on our Center web page at:
http://www.fda.fgov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html. You may send your written comments to
the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the CDRH Ombudsman.
Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways to contact him, can be found
on the Internet at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/resolvingdisputes/ombudsman.html.
GENERAL IDE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADHESION BARRIERS (21 CFR 812)
FDA has determined this device is a significant risk device as defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m)(4)
and, therefore, studies involving these devices do not qualify for the abbreviated IDE
requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b). In addition to the requirement of having an FDA-approved
IDE, sponsors of such trials must comply with the regulations governing institutional review
boards (21 CFR 56) and informed consent (21 CFR 50).
Clinical evaluation of significant risk devices requires an approved Investigational Device
Exemption (IDE) application in addition to IRB approval. The FD&C Act authorizes the FDA to
exempt these devices from certain requirements of the Act that would apply to devices in
commercial distribution. The exemption allows devices intended solely for investigational use to
be shipped for use on human subjects during a clinical study.
An IDE application must, at a minimum, include the following elements:
•
•
•
•
•

•

name of the device
device description
intended use
report of prior investigations
preclinical safety and effectiveness information
§ chemistry
§ animal testing for safety and effectiveness
§ physical, mechanical, and reliability testing
§ manufacturing
clinical plan
§ purpose and objectives
§ study hypothesis

other, e.g., case report forms
labeling.

See 21 CFR 812 for these and additional IDE requirements.
GENERAL PMA REQUIREMENTS FOR ADHESION BARRIERS (21 CFR 814)
A PMA application must contain the following basic elements:
•
•
•

•

PRECLINICAL DATA
I. DEVICE DESCRIPTION
This section should identify the essential physical characteristic of the subject device, e.g., film,
gel, solution. You should provide a detailed description of all features of the device, including
the name of the device; physical dimensions (describe all sizes if applicable); all components;
physical, chemical, and biologic properties; the mechanism(s) of action; and information
regarding resorption and/or metabolism. You should also include a discussion of the scientific
basis (physical/biologic plausibility), which supports the development of this product for this
indication, with relevant scientific literature.
II. CHEMISTRY
A. You should describe all material components of the device. Such information should
identify the source and purity of each component. You may supply the information
by reference to a Master File(s), if you include the appropriate letter of crossreference. Submission of a Certificate(s) of Analysis and/or a Materials Safety Data
Sheet(s) (MSDS) can also greatly simplify review of components not commonly used
in medical devices.
B. If collagen or other animal material is a device component, the application should
identify the species and tissue from which the animal material was derived and the
specific type of collagen or other material. See also the sterilization section below, on
materials from animal sources, and the guidance document “Medical Devices
Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources (Except for In Vitro Diagnostic
Devices) at: http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/88.html.
C. You should submit the following information for each material/component in the
device:
•

chemical name, chemical abstracts service number

•

trade name

•

structural formula and molecular weight

•

if the material is polymeric, you should provide the molecular formula, a
measure of the average molecular weight, and the molecular weight distribution.
FDA recommends measurement by gel permeation chromatography, but other
techniques may be used

•

if the product is solid, you should provide weight and dimensions per product
unit

•

if the product is liquid, you should provide weight, viscosity, color, and pH.

D. You should perform chemical characterization of each material to assess incoming
material characteristics. The quality of the materials should be monitored for
appearance, viscosity, average molecular weight, pH, organic volatile impurities, and
4

particulate matter as appropriate. You should list the incoming raw material
specifications along with the test methods and appropriate limits of acceptance.
E. You should present the chemical formulation and manufacturing information in a
step-by-step process, from the starting materials to final products. This should
include all non-reactants and reactants (including catalysts, curing agents, and
intermediate precursors) for all device components. You should include analyses of
the copolymer content, when applicable, to establish the consistency of the product.
F. You should describe the finished sterilized device including the components and
composition. You should document analytical tests and acceptance specifications
with data from at least three lots compared and reported to demonstrate control over
the manufacturing process.
G. Residual chemicals are a concern whether they are present as raw materials, as
processed products of raw materials, or are introduced in any way during the
manufacturing process. To address this concern, you should extract the final
formulated sterilized product in both polar and non-polar solvents. You should
measure potential toxic contaminants by a sufficiently sensitive method, such as High
Performance Liquid Chromatography. You should also measure volatile and nonvolatile residuals.
H. You should describe any unique characteristics of the device in sufficient detail using
objective (quantitative) measures that will allow the reviewer a clear understanding of
these unique characteristics.
III. ANIMAL TESTING
A.

Toxicology/Biocompatibility Studies

The preclinical toxicology/biocompatibility studies should follow the ISO 10993-1:
1992 Guidelines, “Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices- Part 1: Evaluation and
Testing,” that recommends the six standard tests listed below for implanted devices that
contact tissue for 24 h to 30 days with blood contact.
1. cytotoxicity
2. sensitization
3. irritation or intracutaneous reactivity
4. systemic toxicity
5. genotoxicity (ames reverse mutation, chromosomal aberration, and mouse
lymphoma forward mutation)
6. subchronic implantation and toxicity
The subchronic implantation study duration should mimic the proposed use of the material.
You should design the study with the characteristics of the product in mind; i.e., studies
5

should be carried out beyond the point of detectable levels of the product in the body. The
test material should be implanted at or near the proposed site of use and should be assessed
until after the material has been resorbed by the body. You should monitor the animals for
systemic toxicity, as well as for local effects at the implantation site. You should also
include macroscopic pathology and histopathology.
If the contact is longer than 30 days, we recommend chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity
studies (i.e., 2-year rat implantation) as well.
General considerations for adhesion barriers
Safety margin -- In all biocompatibility and toxicity testing, the dose of the product
used should reflect a reasonable safety margin compared to the doses proposed for
use in humans. Generally, you should test a range of doses, up to ten times the
highest dose to be used in humans, or provide a justification for a smaller safety
margin. You should justify a human exposure larger than one-tenth of the no adverse
effect level observed in animals.
Assessing biocompatibility of adhesion barriers -- The tests needed for assessing
biocompatibility of adhesion barriers varies. For some materials, some tests may not
be necessary, if you provide adequate justification. For other materials, additional
tests may be necessary due to the nature of the material.
Preclinical testing -- You should complete all preclinical testing, with the possible
exceptions of the carcinogenicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity
testing, at the time you submit the IDE, prior to clinical use of the product. The
exceptions will depend upon the results of the genotoxicity testing; the likelihood of
reproductive or developmental effects; and the intended use of the device. Informed
consent forms should disclose any safety studies that are pending. If the intended use
is to improve fertility, the reproductive toxicology testing should be complete before
patients are exposed to the barrier. As with the other aspects of this guidance
document, you should direct specific questions to the appropriate reviewing division
and branch.
Special considerations for adhesion barriers
Testing for Delay of or Prevention of Healing -- Inflammation and the replacement
of soft tissue with fibrous tissue is an expected outcome of the normal healing
process. Reducing the formation of adhesions may also delay or prevent healing.
This should be tested in animal studies. Adhesion barriers placed at suture lines or at
anastomotic sites should not reduce tissue-holding strength after suture removal.
Infectivity Testing – You should test enhancement of sepsis following challenge
with a bacterial inoculum. This may result, for example, from the stimulation of
bacterial growth, from the inhibition of antibiotic diffusion to the infection site, from
a device-related increase in the entrance of infecting organisms into the systemic
circulation from the surgical site, or from unknown mechanisms. You should
challenge animals with a mixture of gut organisms in the presence and absence of the
6

adhesion barrier, and score for mortality and abscess formation. You should conduct
studies with the appropriate sample size and design so as to be statistically valid.
Reproductive/Toxicology Studies – You should perform
reproductive/developmental (teratology) toxicology studies using two species and
evaluate the potential effects of the device on ovulation/spermiogenesis, conception,
embryo- fetal toxicity, and teratological effects. You should design
reproductive/developmental toxicity studies so that the maximum exposure of the
product based on its ADME (see pharmacokinetics, below) occurs at the time of
interest (ovulation/conception, early and late gestation).
Carcinogenesis/Metastasis Effects -- Device materials may have both local or
systemic effects on the growth and/or metastasis of malignancies. FDA believes
special testing is needed if the components of the barrier do not have a wellestablished history of implantation in the abdomen and pelvis, or if there is reason to
suspect that one of the material components may effect the growth or metastasis of
malignant cells. If the device is intended to be used in cancer patients, the preclinical
testing should be followed by an oncology trial. Otherwise, the device should be
contraindicated for patients with known or suspected malignancies.
B.

Pharmacokinetics Studies

You should conduct pharmacokinetics studies to determine the absorption, distribution,
metabolism and excretion (ADME) route(s), mechanism(s), and timeline of excretion of
the product. If the product is metabolized or otherwise converted into molecular entities
that may result in toxicity, the pharmacokinetics studies should address the fate of each
of the toxic components over time. The studies should be carried out to time points at
which there is no detectable level of the product. The studies should clearly address the
fate of any toxic components identified in the chemistry section. Before the device is
tested in humans, the pharmacokinetics or other data should demonstrate that any
potential toxins do not pose a safety concern.
C.

Effectiveness Studies

You should conduct effectiveness studies in appropriate animal model(s) to provide
“proof of concept;” that is, these studies should suggest that there is a reasonable
premise for efficacy in the human. Animal studies may also suggest better designs for
the clinical studies to follow. The se studies should represent, insofar as possible, the
surgical approach (laparotomy versus laparoscopy), the specific surgical site(s) (e.g.,
between viscera and body wall, around loops of bowel), the types of adhesions (e.g., de
novo adhesion formation versus reformation of existing adhesions), the method of
adhesion evaluation (e.g., score, incidence, extent, severity), and the method of
application that will be used in human studies.
They should also be well-designed and controlled to show statistically significant
differences between group treated with the product and the control group. You should
compare doses of the product to those proposed for use in humans. You should also
include a brief discussion of the rationale for and the limitations of the animal model
7

used.
IV. PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL TESTING
You should conduct bench testing of the physical/mechanical properties of the product and
submit this information in the IDE application. The key physical properties of the device
should be characterized. The actual testing will depend on the nature of the device. Solid, gel,
and liquid barriers might be characterized by tear strength, cohesivity, or viscosity,
respectively. At least one physical parameter should be used as a specification for the release
of product.
V. MANUFACTURING
A.

Product Characterization

Information about the product composition and structure is critical in precisely defining
the device subjected to preclinical and clinical testing. Therefore you should include a
full description of the device, including the physical dimensions, materials and properties
of the product. Information similar to that discussed above in the chemistry section (i.e.,
reagent source, purity, certificate(s) of analysis, and/or MSDS) may be helpful in
determining final product specifications.
You should identify each of the manufacturing, processing and packaging steps. You
should present them in flow sheet form. Accompanying text should identify the purpose of
each step, the components and materials used in each, as well as the quality control
procedures and facilities used.
B.

Final Product Specification

You should provide information about all in-process and final product tests. You should
identify the product release specifications, test methods, sampling plans (including
definitions of batch or lot), and acceptable quality levels.
You should select the final product release specifications to ensure that the product will
perform safely and effectively. You should provide the rationale for the specifications.
Examples of final product release specifications include the following:
•

device dimensions

•

composition of selected components

•

mechanical properties

•

residual levels of manufacturing reagents

•

residual levels of heavy metals

•

pyrogen levels

•

sterility.
8

C.

Product Expiration Dating

You should submit data supporting the expiration dating for the product. Stability studies
should monitor the critical parameters of a device that are required to ensure the device
will perform safely and effectively during its entire shelf- life, as described above under
Final Product Specification (Section V. B.). You should provide justification for the
tests selected. Studies should also demonstrate that sterility can be maintained over the
shelf life of the device, either through sterility testing or package integrity testing.
You should collect the devices used for shelf life testing from at least three successive
product lots; devices from each product lot should be evenly distributed among the
groups of devices used for the various tests. The expiration date supported by the data
should be the time at which there is at least a 95 percent probability that the selected
parameter will be within the acceptance limit on the expiration date.
When accelerated aging studies are used to support shelf life, you should provide
justification for the accelerated stress conditions. For example, decomposition mechanisms
may show equivalence at both the standard and elevated temperatures, i.e., the slope of the
Arrhenius curve is constant with changes in temperature. In cases where equivalence
cannot be demonstrated, e.g., device failure occurs by different mechanisms at different
temperatures, you should submit an additional justification.
You should verify the results of accelerated studies with real time test data.
D.

Device Applicator

If a device applicator is used to apply the device, you should include a description of its
design, function, and performance. If the applicator is cleared by 510(k), a brief
description along with identification of the 510(k) are sufficient.
If the applicator is not cleared by 510(k), but is provided and designed exclusively for
your adhesion barrier, then a more complete description is needed. If the applicator is
reusable, see the guidance document, “Labeling Reusable Medical Devices Reprocessing in
Health Care Facilities: FDA Reviewer Guidance” (April 1996),
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/198.pdf. You may also obtain this guidance from the
Division of Small Manufacturers, International and Consumer Assistance (DSMICA).
E.

Sterilization

You should include the following information about product sterilization:
•

the method of sterilization (e.g., ethylene oxide, irradiation)

•

the validation method for the sterilization cyc le

•

the sterility assurance level (SAL) achieved (In general, a SAL of 10-6 is needed
for all sterile devices, unless there is substantial justification for not being able to
achieve this level.)
9

•

the method for monitoring the sterility of each production lot

•

a complete description of the packaging including the method of sealing the
device.

If the method of sterilization is radiation, you should specify the dose. If the method of
sterilization is ethylene oxide (EtO), you should identify the maximum leve ls of ethylene
oxide and ethylene chlorohydrin residues that remain on the device. Residual levels of
ethylene oxide and ethylene chlorohydrin that remain on the device following EtO
sterilization should conform to the maximum limits for residual materials recommended in
ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-7:1995, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices - Part 7:
Ethylene Oxide Sterilization Residuals (Sterility) (revised 8/20 1998) or to comparable
methodology. The ANSI/AAMI/ISO document should be used with the accompanying
AAMI Technical Information Report (TIR) No. 19:1998.
You should describe the aeration conditions and the time necessary for the product to reach
the specified residual levels. You should also include a dissipation curve for the residual
levels of ethylene oxide and ethylene chlorohydrin.
The document should also contain a complete description of the analytical methods that
were used to qualify and validate the sterilization cycle for a disposable applicator and for
the adhesion barrier itself. You should include copies of all protocols and raw data that
support the validation of the sterilization cycle, including all calculations regarding the
sterility assurance level.
You should identify the device bioburden and provide data to support the control of this
bioburden during the production of the device. You should include copies of all protocols
and raw data including identification of the portion of the device sampled for the testing.
The application should also contain the results of bioburden resistance testing or a
justification for why this is unnecessary. This testing should include devices tested from
at least three manufacturing lots.
You should identify the time of routine revalidation and the circumstances (bioburden in
excess of an established limit, or a change to the product, or packaging) that would
necessitate revalidation of the sterilization cycle.
Materials from Animal Sources
For devices derived from animal material, FDA believes you need to demonstrate that
the processing methods and sterilization techniques are sufficient to produce a SAL of
10-6 . The application should identify the species and tissue from which the material
was derived. You should consult the CDRH Guidance, “Medical Devices
Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources (except for in vitro diagnostic
devices): Guidance for Reviewers and Industry,”
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/88.html, for applicable information. For guidance on
the viral safety of such products, see the “International Conference on
Harmonization; Guidance on the Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products
Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin.” This document can be
10

obtained from the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at 1-888CBER-FAX.
F.

Pyrogenicity Testing

Pyrogenicity testing will help define limits to protect patients from the risk of febrile
reaction. A febrile reaction to a pyrogenic substance may have the potential to
increase the rate of adhesions. Testing by an established USP pyrogenicity assay
such as the Bacterial Endotoxins Test (Monograph 85) using Limulus Amebocyte
Lysate (LAL) or Rabbit Pyrogen Assay (Monograph 151) method ensures that the
adhesion barrier device coming into contact with a patient has been tested for levels
of gram- negative bacterial endotoxin present in the product.
You should identify the method of pyrogenicity testing, as well as information about
how the assay was performed and the assay results. Because there is no "gold
standard" in the medical community for what the upper limit of acceptability of
endotoxin levels is for an adhesion barrier, it is important that you establish
specification limits and manufacturing action levels and perform an established USP
endotoxin test such as the Bacterial Endotoxin Test by LAL or Rabbit Pyrogen assay
on any implanted device.
CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
I.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides points to consider when designing clinical protocols to support a PMA or
PDP application for a resorbable adhesion barrier to be used in the peritoneal/pelvic cavity(s).
While there is no consensus on a standardized clinical trial design for all of these devices, there
are certain principles that FDA believes are essential for providing the valid scientific evidence
needed to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and bring these products to
market. A clinical protocol for an adhesion barrier should include:
•

clear statement of device’s intended use

•

clinical deve lopment plan designed to develop the data needed to support the intended
use

•

study hypothesis(es)

•

study endpoints for safety and effectiveness

•

plan for assessing safety in which all adverse events are identified and analyzed

•

plan for assessing safety and effectiveness on the basis of an intent to treat population
as well as an evaluable population

•

assessment tools (e.g., adhesions scoring systems, planned second- look procedure,
video, functional testing)

•

study design with inclusion and exclusion criteria
11

•

case report forms

•

statistical methods

•

risk/benefit analysis

•

informed consent

•

balance of premarket and post-approval data development

•

labeling which accurately presents study data.

Note: We encourage you to work closely with FDA when developing study pla ns and protocols
for these devices.
II.

INTENDED USE

You should identify, as clearly and precisely as possible, the intended use of the adhesion
barrier. The specific indications should include the following:
•

adhesion type, i.e., de novo, reformed, surgical site, non-surgical site

•

target population

•

conditions for use

•

anatomical site(s) of application

•

expected outcomes.

These indications are commonly refined, as clinical experience from feasibility studies is
analyzed. At the pivotal trial stage of product development, intended use, and indications
should be in reasonably sharp focus.
The intended use determines the objectives of the clinical trial, which are generally to
demonstrate the safety (i.e., associated morbidity and mortality) and effectiveness (i.e.,
associated patient benefit) of the device for a defined clinical benefit in a target population,
under specific conditions of use.
The intended use should be clearly supported by data and be presented in the proposed labeling.
Labeling in the clinical protocol should accurately present the data that have been collected on
the device. One of the most difficult issues for adhesion barrier devices is how broad or narrow
the indications should be, i.e., how much can the data from the clinical trials be extrapolated to
broader or related uses. Part of the answer to this question depends on the selection of the
surgical model(s) used in the trial and the ability of the sponsor or applicant to provide a sound
scientific justification that the data support clinical benefit and safety in broader applications.
III.

FEASIBILITY STUDIES

The purpose of feasibility (pre-pivotal) studies is to test the study methodology and to obtain
preliminary clinical assessments of the safety and effectiveness of the device. These small,
usually non-randomized, one or two center studies are intended to evaluate the procedures
12

that you will use in the pivotal study, refine the design of the device, refine the instructions
for use, and provide initial experience to potential investigators. The data derived from
feasibility studies are used to design the pivotal trial, estimating the treatment effect and
sample size for the pivotal safety and effectiveness study.
Specific adhesion barrier device-related issues that you should address in pre-pivotal studies
include:
•

method of delivery and placement

•

resorption and elimination in humans, if applicable

•

site-to-site variability in the human body, if applicable

•

effectiveness for various types of adhesions

•

handling characteristics of the device

•

target population

•

conditions of use

•

preliminary safety: morbidity and mortality effects; signs of increased infectivity and
altered wound-healing

•

sensitivity and specificity of assessment tools for detecting study endpoints and
clinical benefit.

You should analyze the results of feasibility studies in a supplement to the IDE application
before initiating the pivotal trial. We encourage you to schedule pre-pivotal meeting(s) with
the FDA to present and discuss the results of these feasibility stud ies.
IV.

PIVOTAL STUDIES
A.

Purpose of Study

The purpose of a pivotal study is to develop the safety and effectiveness data to support
the intended use, and therefore justify the indication(s) for use. The study purpose
should clearly identify elements of the intended use: intent, target population, and
conditions of use. Compound (multiple) intended uses should be addressed in separate
statements for clarity. The broader the study is, the broader the eventual labeled
indication for use may be.
B.

Study Hypothesis

While the objective(s) provides a focus for the trial, the hypothesis is the basis for the
statistical analysis. An effective and efficient clinical trial will have one or more
objectives and corresponding hypotheses that are very specific and unamb iguous. These
objectives will answer a number of detailed questions about why the trial is being
conducted including the following.

13

•

Is the trial to show that a new device is as effective as, or better than another
intervention or treatment? In other words, is the trial intended to support a claim
of equivalence (non- inferiority) or superiority?

•

How will effectiveness be judged?

•

With respect to safety, is the trial intended to show that the new device is safer
than, or as safe as, another treatment; and how will safety be evaluated?

•

For which patients and condition will the device be used?

Answering these questions generally will provide the basis for the entire trial, as well as
for labeling later. It is important you base testing of any statistical hypothesis(es) on
clinically meaningful difference(s).
C.

Endpoints

Based on the definition of effectiveness (21 CFR 860.7), the most direct method of
providing valid scientific evidence of effectiveness is to select an appropriate clinical
outcome and design a study to evaluate a statistically significant and clinically
meaningful effect on a recognized adhesion-related morbidity. However, some clinical
outcomes that result from adhesions may be difficult or impractical to evaluate in the
premarket phase due to, for example, the multi- factorial nature of clinical outcomes such
as live births or post-operative pain, or the overall low and time-dependent incidence of
bowel obstruction due to post-operative adhesions. The clinical outcomes associated
with adhesions may be reasonably assessed by parameters which are more immediately
measurable and potentially less confounded.
In any case, clinical study outcomes endpoints should be:
•

objective

•

reproducible

•

clinically reasonable/biologically plausible measures of clinical benefit for the
target population.

Examples of clinically reasonable/biologically plausible measures are:
•

validated multi- factorial scoring systems

•

clinically meaningful incidence

•

extent and severity of post-treatment adhesions in patients without adhesions at
baseline

•

clinically meaningful reduction in adhesion numbers

•

extent and/or severity of post-treatment adhesions in patients with adhesions at
baseline.
14

You may report incidence of observed adhesions in a number of ways, e.g., as the
percentage of patients with no adhesions, or as the number of pre-designated surgical
sites with adhesions. Extent and severity are also scored and reported in a variety of
ways using a variety of different nomenclatures. Standardized composite scores of
adhesions of predetermined grade at predetermined sites are being developed and utilized
with increased frequency and should lead to greater reproducibility within and between
studies.1,2,3,6,7,9 For any scoring system, you should clearly define which anatomic sites
are being scored. You should also define the following methods, if used in your scoring
system:
•

methods of evaluating extent of adhesions, i.e., direct measure with a centimeter
marked ruler versus estimation of the percentage of organ covered;

•

methods of evaluating the severity of adhesions; and

•

methods of combining incidence, severity and extent scores into meaningful
composite scores.

Currently, there is no consensus on the levels of adhesion reduction that are clinically
significant. In addition, there is little information on the clinical significance of
adhesion reduction at specific anatomical sites, or reduction of adhesion extent or
severity. 4,5,11,12,14 You should carefully consider all of these parameters (level and sites
of adhesion reduction) when designing a clinical trial. You should discuss clinical
relevance of the extent of adhesion reduction indicated by your endpoints.
Post-approval studies are a reasonable method of further understanding the clinical
relevance of the chosen endpoints. Post-approval studies are discussed below in section
K.
D.

Assessment Tools

The following tools for assessing adhesion reduction are being used now or, with
some further development and testing, may be used in the future. We recognize that
various tools have advantages and disadvantages. When choosing a method, the
sponsor should discuss why this tool is appropriate for the study.
1. Second look surgery
Second look via laparotomy or laparoscopy is currently the primary modality for
assessing adhesion formation/reduction in the abdomen and pelvis. It has the
advantage of direct visual inspection; surgical manipulation to fully explore the
cavity(s) and assess severity, e.g., filmy, firm, concrete; and provides an

15

opportunity for simultaneous therapeutic intervention. Issues that need to be
addressed when second look is used include the following:
•

the potential morbidity of a second surgical procedure unless planned in
standard care;

•

ethical issues regarding the potential benefit (or lack thereof) of such
procedures to individual subjects;

•

masking issues; and
issues related to investigator bias.

•

2. Video recording
Video recording is frequently added to the second look assessment to provide a
permanent record of the procedures and to provide a mechanism for masking by
allowing for independent third party reviews. As with other technological
advances, the utility of this methodology is highly dependent on the quality and
reliability of the recording. Recordings should be complete and of sufficient
optical quality to allow for accurate assessment of the quantity and quality of
adhesions as well as an assessment of how those adhesions may be affected by
the surgical exploration, itself. An important consideration when using video
recording is that the method of evaluating the abdomen be consistent among
patients (e.g., assessing surgical sites in the same order and for the same amount
of time), in order to reduce potential bias.
3. Imaging studies
With additional technology development, imaging studies might be used in the
assessment of adhesion barriers. Thus far, they do not provide enough detail to
be used effectively in the abdomino-pelvic cavity.
4. Functional testing
Functional testing has shown great potential for assessing the impact of adhesion
reduction in musculoskeletal applications; however, the present utility is less
apparent for abdomino-pelvic applications. Newer methods for measuring
intestinal motility and other methods of testing the function of gastrointestinal
and gynecologic organ systems may be developed in the future to provide a
useful, non- invasive alternative to surgically mediated anatomic assessment.
These methods will require further research and validation.
E.

Important Assessment Considerations

Because a consistent method of assessing adhesion reduction has not been established,
you should include detailed information about the following in your clinical protocol:
•

anatomic sites to be evaluated;

•

the time during surgical procedure at which adhesion scoring will be done
(beginning or end or both in case of partial or selective adhesiolysis);
16

F.

•

adhesion characteristics to be measured (incidence, severity, extent) and methods
of grading or measuring each characteristic;

•

method of assessing each component of the score at each anatomic site, e.g.,
laparoscopic, open laparotomy, videotaping;

•

method of counting an anatomic site that is to be evaluated but is anatomically not
present or not assessable in a specific patient;

•

methods of combining the adhesion characteristics per anatomic site, per patient,
or per treatment group; and

•

methods for establishing that the composite score (when used) is a valid and
reliable tool for assessing adhesions or the morbidity resulting from adhesions.
Study Design

1. Control
FDA recommends randomized, concurrently-controlled, pivotal trials, given the
absence of well-defined historical controls or other appropriate control methods.
You should justify your choice of control with the most recently available, peerreviewed literature.
2. Randomization
Randomization should occur immediately prior to device application, after a patient
has been evaluated and found to satisfy pre-operative, as well as intra-operative
inclusion / exclusion criteria. The time of randomization should be documented on
the case report form.
3. Masking
You should address, to the greatest extent possible, the potential for investigator
and, to a lesser degree, patient bias. Investigator masking is problematic for
adhesion barrier trials that use either placebo or active controls, since differences
between the test and control subjects are usually readily apparent and it is normally
preferable, from a patient care perspective for the same surgeon to perform the
initial and second look procedures. You may use one of several alternative methods
for controlling bias including video recording with masked independent review or
application of the device/control by an assistant who will not participate in adhesion
scoring. You should assess these or other methodologies during the feasibility (prepivotal) phase of development.
4. Patient Selection Criteria
The target population should consist of patients who are expected to benefit from
device use under specified conditions of use. The inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the clinical study should identify significant patient variables that characterize
the target population, such as:

17

•

age

•

sex

•

fertility status

•

pregnancy history

•

history of abdomino-pelvic disease due to adhesions, e.g., recurrent bowel
obstruction, infertility, pain

•

adhesion burden at baseline, e.g., none, mild, moderate, severe with objective
and definition of mild, moderate, severe

•

surgical history

•

history of inflammatory disease

•

history of major organ dysfunction

•

surgical wound classification10 : clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, or
dirty.

You should identify intraoperative inclusion/exclusion criteria prospectively. Some
exclusions, such as active pelvic infection, fecal contamination, unexpected
malignancy, and extent of adhesions, may not be known until the time of surgery.
You should consider excluding patients undergoing certain unanticipated surgical
procedures, such as the removal of a fallopian tube or ovary, because such
procedures may complicate the adhesion count. Randomization should not occur
until the time the device or control is placed.
5. Procedure
You should include information about the following in your description of the
clinical procedure in which the adhesion barrier device is used:
•

when, where, and how the device is used

•

minimum and maximum dosage per patient

•

length of procedure

•

method of lysis

•

possible covariates, e.g., blood loss, glove use.

6. Follow-up
You should prospectively define the period of follow-up and frequency/content of
evaluations. These should be appropriate for the device, procedure, and the endpoint
you are evaluating. Please see the discussion of post-approval studies in section K,
below for further information.
G. Statistical Methods
18

You should provide a comprehensive statistical plan. It should include prospectively
defined methods of addressing each of the following:
•

study hypothesis

•

sample size calculation

•

number of study centers

•

success/failure criteria

•

effectiveness patient populations (intent-to-treat, evaluable, etc.)

•

pooling of data

•

covariates

•

stratification

•

protocol deviations

•

drop-outs

•

analysis plan and statistical methods

•

data auditing.

1. Analysis Cohorts
The “Intent-to-Treat” population, which is defined to be the cohort of all enrolled
and treated patients, is the preferred population for study outcome analysis. Intent to
Treat analysis allows for the evaluation of all patients who enroll in the study, even
though some may not complete the study, e.g., patients who are, for any reason, lost
to follow- up, drop-outs, or terminated by investigator. You should prospectively
specify the analysis plans that will account for patients who do not complete the
study. You should also present analysis of the “Evaluable” patient cohort, i.e.,
patients who enter and complete the study, recognizing such analyses are subject to
bias. Comparison of outcomes on the basis of Intent to Treat and Evaluable patients
allows assessment of outcome robustness. Analysis details should be prospectively
agreed upon by the sponsor and FDA.
2. Data Poolability
Most clinical trials are conducted at more than one study site, but the sample size for
the study assumes that results from all the study sites may be combined or pooled.
Many times, this assumption is warranted. However, sometimes it is not. Thus,
investigating whether study results may be pooled across study sites will be a key
element of the analysis.
Poolability is both a clinical and a statistical issue. If there are clinically important
differences in the way the trial was done at different sites, then instead of a single
trial at multiple sites, there is actually a series of single center trials that need to be
assessed and presented separately. In the same way, statistically significant
differences in results at study sites indicate that there is an important inconsistency
19

among the study sites that should be investigated, and not lost in an overall finding.
Differences among sites may be important indicators of critical issues in device
performance. For example, exploring the reasons for observed differences may
uncover training, learning curve issues, or special labeling concerns.
A simple approach to investigating poolability has three steps.
1. A clinical assessment of the way the trials were done at the study sites.
Clinically meaningful differences here may preclude pooling.
2. A statistical/clinical assessment to evaluate the similarity of patient
characteristics and baseline measurements. Differences here may indicate
poolability problems. At the very least, these differences will indicate the
need for a more complex statistical analysis.
3. A statistical analysis testing the consistency of results across study centers.
Again, differences here may indicate poolability problems or the need for a
more complex statistical analysis.
When testing for differences among sites, the absence of statististically significant
differences does not indicate that data can be pooled, because most trials are sized
for an assessment over all sites. For this reason, clinically meaningful differences
(even statistically non-significant ones) should not be ignored, but instead should be
investigated.
One approach to investigating statistical variation among sites is to use a statistical
model that includes site, along with other factors. If the analysis confirms that site is
important, results should be presented by site. If a statistically significant interaction
between site and treatment occurs, it indicates a major inconsistency among the sites,
which should be investigated.
3. Covariates
Covariates, or potentially confounding variables, may significantly compromise the
ability of the sponsor and the agency to adequately analyze the data from clinical
trials. You should avoid procedural variations, such as the use of different doses,
different methods of application, different surgical tools, different gloves, etc.,
whenever possible. You should accurately record all variables, such as whether
Lactated Ringer’s or other instillates were left in the abdomen or completely or
partially removed.
You should address major differences in surgical approach, such as laparotomy vs.
laparoscopy and the inclusion of multiple surgical procedures with vastly different
adhesiogenic potential, in separate studies or by prospectively designed stratification
plans.

20

You should identify and control for co- morbidities that may confound evaluation of
device effect. Inclusion/exclusion criteria should address the presence or absence of
diseases (e.g., active pelvic infection), the severity of the diseases, and historical
information. Patients excluded from the study will, in general, also be excluded in
the labeling for the approved product.
You should control for other variables known or suspected to be confounding, e.g.,
the use of anti- inflammatory medications, by appropriate randomization,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, by evaluation in separate study arms, by stratification, or
by a prospectively designed covariate analysis.
4. Additional Information
Additional information on study design and statistical analysis issues are
available from CDRH, in the guidance document entitled, “Statistical Guidance for
Clinical Trials of Non-Diagnostic Medical Devices,”
www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/ot476.html. The Center’s Division of Biostatistics prepared
this guidance with input from ODE, academia, and the medical device community.
H. Case Report Forms
You should design case report forms to capture all pertinent information at each point in
the study from patient screening, through patient enrollment, the initial treatment period,
assessment of adhesions, and all other patient follow-up. You should maintain a
screening log for both the pilot and pivotal studies to allow assessment of reasons for
non-enrollment of patients considered for the trial.
For operative procedures the case report forms should record variables (covariates) that
could potentially confound the endpoints, such as:
• the presence of foreign bodies resulting from powder from unwashed gloves,
gauze, or paper towels
• procedure duration
• estimated blood loss
• the number and locations of adhesions lysed
• the types of adhesion, e.g., de novo or reformed
• Surgical Wound Classification10 : clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated, dirty.
I.

Device Applicators

You should describe any device applicator used with the adhesion barrier product in the
clinical protocol, and provide information about the training investigators and
practitioners receive. If the applicator is not cleared by 510(k), and it is provided with
and designed exclusively for your adhesion barrier, then FDA may consider the
21

applicator part of the device, and include it in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
the device.
J.

Informed Consent

The requirements for all patients for informed consent, adequate monitoring, and
necessary records and reports are given in 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 812. Patients
should be clearly informed of, among other things, the following:
•

the safety and effectiveness of the new device has not been established

•

adhesions may actually worsen with treatment

•

adhesions may cause or worsen morbidity such as female infertility or pain

•

adhesions may prevent or reduce morbidity such as obstructive anastomotic leak

•

the incidence of small bowel obstruction due to post- laparotomy adhesions is
approximately 5%.

Women who desire fertility, should be excluded from feasiblity studies or warned that
the effects of the device on fertility have not been defined.
K. Post-approval Studies
There are several reasons why you may conduct a post-approval study. In some cases,
FDA may require you to conduct a post-approval study as a condition of PMA approval.
FDA might require a post-approval study to follow up on unresolved safety issues, such
as infection rates, where incidence rates are too low for the pivotal study to accurately
predict. Or, FDA might require a post-approval study to provide further understanding of
a finding from the pivotal study that is not completely explained by the available data.
FDA typically relies on input from the advisory panel when requiring a post-approval
study.
Moreover, you may choose to conduct additional studies on your approved device in
order to address limitations in the approved labeling, to provide additional information
for interested clinical users of the device, or to provide additional information to third
party payers.
L.

Special Considerations
1. Laparotomy versus Laparoscopy
Generally, you should evaluate adhesion barriers separately in laparotomy and
laparoscopic surgical models.8,13 Data derived from laparotomy studies may not
accurately predict efficacy when extrapolated to a laparoscopic model, because
significant quantitative and qualitative differences may occur in adhesion formation
depending on whether the surgery is done by laparoscopy or laparotomy.
22

2. Malignancy
For adhesion barrier devices intended to be used in the presence of known or newly
discovered malignancy, you should anticipate the need for additional preclinical and
clinical testing focused on the issues of accelerated tumor growth and impact on
clinical progression of primary and metastatic disease. You should discuss specific
protocols with the reviewing division before initiating one of these trials.
V.

RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS

Reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness is based upon a scientific analysis of
risk/benefit. In order to perform such an analysis it is critical, as discussed above, that you
collect complete, objective, and unbiased data for both safety and effectiveness for FDA’s
review. FDA and its advisory panels will perform its own independent risk/benefit analyses.
We encourage you to provide, both in the IDE and PMA, risk/benefit analyses that accurately
characterizes your product in a way that would allow prospective users to make an informed
decision regarding its use. The risk/benefit analysis for the PMA will be more definitive,
because it will include the results of the clinical trial(s). The risk/benefit analysis should be
based on your in-depth knowledge of your device, data, and the science of adhesion
formation and prevention. It is important that this analysis be as data-based and objective as
possible.
The risk analysis should identify all of the known and potential risks of the use of the device.
It should include risks attendant to the procedure(s) involved in the trials, as well those risks
directly attributable to the use of the product. These risks should be analyzed separately and
in combination. You should also describe your plans to recognize, understand, and minimize
the risks.
The benefits analysis should identify potential benefits to the patient. It should include any
information available about likely differences in benefits to different patient populations.
VI.

LABELING

Investigational devices must be labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 812.5 and in accordance
with 21 CFR 812.5, they must state: “CAUTION – Investigational Device. Limited by
Federal (or United States) law to investigational use.”
In the PMA, the final marketing labeling should contain the following basic elements:
•

brief device description

•

indications for use

•

contraindications

•

warnings/precautions

•

adverse events

•

clinical studies
23

•

patient information (as needed)

•

instructions for use.

A.

Indications for Use

Labeling should accurately represent the data that has been collected on the device. The
label indication should be based on the stud ies conducted to support that indication.
You should prospectively define the expected indications as clearly and specifically as
possible. The indications will depend upon the selection of the surgical model(s) used in
the trial. See also the section entitled Clinical Investigational Plan, II. Intended Use.
B.

Contraindications

This section should list those circumstances under which the device should never be
used. For example, if an adhesion barrier was known, based on animal or human data,
to increase infectivity, it would be contraindicated in the presence of active infection or
enteral contamination.
C.

Warnings/Precautions

When increased risk or decreased benefit is anticipated based on available information
or not adequately evaluated based on study design (inclusion/exclusion criteria), such
factors should be listed in this section. Examples include:

D.

•

Decreased effectiveness should be expected in the presence of less than
meticulous hemostasis.

•

The safety and effectiveness of this product has no t been evaluated during
pregnancy.

•

The safety and effectiveness of this product with respect to its effect on the ability
to conceive has not been evaluated.
Adverse Events

You should clearly present all adverse events recorded in the clinical trials in tabular
form, including numbers and percents. You should list adverse events in a meaningful
sequence based upon incidence rates, severity, or another relevant paradigm. You
should describe deaths and other significant adverse events in both text and tabular form.

24

E.

Clinical Studies

Clinical studies on which safety and effectiveness are based should be summarized in
tables of data that include the following:
•

patient accountability

•

demographics

•

procedure variables

•

baseline evaluation of effectiveness endpoints

•

follow-up evaluation of effectiveness endpoints

•

follow-up evaluation of safety endpoints

Conclusions and interpretations should be objective.
F.

Instructions for Use

You should provide detailed instructions that reflect the experience gained in preclinical
and clinical studies. These instructions should include:
•

device preparation

•

patient preparation

•

device delivery

•

device application

•

dosing recommendations

•

operative technique

•

post-operative care

•

retreatment (if applicable).
