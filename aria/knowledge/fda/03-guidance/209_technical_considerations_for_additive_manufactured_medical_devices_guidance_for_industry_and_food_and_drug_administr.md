On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Technical Considerations for
Additive Manufactured Medical
Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction and Scope

FDA has developed this guidance to provide the Agency’s initial thinking on technical
considerations specific to devices using additive manufacturing, the broad category of
manufacturing encompassing 3-dimensional (3D) printing. Additive manufacturing (AM) is
a process that builds an object by sequentially building 2-dimensional (2D) layers and joining
each to the layer below, allowing device manufacturers to rapidly produce alternative designs
without the need for retooling and to create complex devices built as a single piece. Rapid
technological advancements and increased availability of AM fabrication equipment are
encouraging increased investment in the technology and its increased use by the medical
device industry. The purpose of this guidance is to outline technical considerations
associated with AM processes, and recommendations for testing and characterization for
devices that include at least one additively manufactured component or additively fabricated
step.
This guidance is broadly organized into two topic areas: Design and Manufacturing
Considerations (Section V) and Device Testing Considerations (Section VI). The Design and
Manufacturing Considerations section provides technical considerations that should be
addressed as part of fulfilling Quality System (QS) requirements for your device, as
determined by the regulatory classification of your device and/or regulation to which your
device is subject, if applicable. While this guidance includes manufacturing considerations,
it is not intended to comprehensively address all considerations or regulatory requirements to
establish a quality system for the manufacturing of your device. The Device Testing
Consideration section describes the type of information that should be provided in premarket
1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
notification submissions (510(k)), premarket approval (PMA) applications, humanitarian
device exemption (HDE) applications, De Novo requests and investigational device
exemption (IDE) applications for an AM device. The type of premarket submission that is
required for your AM device is determined by the regulatory classification of your device.
Questions regarding the regulatory status or requirements for specific devices, products, or
entities should be addressed to the appropriate review branches through the Division for
Industry and Consumer Education (DICE@fda.hhs.gov).
For devices manufactured using AM, the recommendations in this guidance supplement any
device-specific recommendations outlined in existing guidance documents or applicable
FDA-recognized consensus standards. Point-of-care device manufacturing may raise
additional technical considerations that are not addressed in this document. In addition, this
guidance does not address the use or incorporation of biological, cellular, or tissue-based
products in AM. Biological, cellular or tissue-based products manufactured using AM
technology may necessitate additional regulatory and manufacturing process considerations
and/or different regulatory pathways. Therefore, AM questions pertaining to biologics, cells
or tissue products should be directed to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER). Specific questions regarding jurisdiction over a combination product should be
directed to the Office of Combination Products (OCP) at 301-427-1934 or
combination@fda.gov.
This guidance is a leapfrog guidance, a type of guidance that serves as a mechanism by
which the Agency can share initial thoughts regarding emerging technologies that are likely
to be of public health importance early in product development. This leapfrog guidance
represents the Agency's initial thinking and our recommendations may change as more
information becomes available. The Agency encourages manufacturers to engage with the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) or CBER through the Pre-Submission
process to obtain more detailed feedback for Additively Manufactured medical devices. For
more information on Pre-Submissions, please see “Requests for Feedback on Medical Device
Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with FDA Staff - Guidance for
Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.”1
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standards referenced in this document, see the
FDA-Recognized Consensus Standards Database Website.2
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
AM is a rapidly growing technology that is frequently used for product research and
development in many industries, and for commercial production in some industries (e.g.,
aerospace, medical devices). While many AM technologies exist, at the time of publication
of this guidance, the most commonly used technologies in medical devices are powder bed
fusion, stereolithography, fused filament fabrication, and liquid-based extrusion. Powder bed
fusion systems rely on an energy source (laser or electron beam) to selectively melt or sinter
a layer of powder, either a metal or polymer, which is then refreshed to create the next layer.
Stereolithography systems use a vat of liquid material that is selectively cured using light,
either through a laser or projection system, and create new layers by moving the build
surface. Fused filament fabrication systems melt a solid filament at the point of deposition,
after which the material solidifies in place, and new layers are created by moving the build
surface away from the heat source. Liquid-based extrusion systems eject a liquid, which then
solidifies (method of solidification could include light exposure, solvent evaporation, or other
chemical process), and new layers are created by moving the build platform away from the
deposition tip.
For medical devices, AM has the advantage of facilitating the creation of anatomicallymatched devices and surgical instrumentation (called patient-matched devices) by using a
patient’s own medical imaging. Another advantage is the ease in fabricating complex
geometric structures, allowing the creation of engineered porous structures, tortuous internal
channels, and internal support structures that would not be easily possible using traditional
(non-additive) manufacturing approaches. However, the unique aspects of the AM process,
such as the layer-wise fabrication process, and relative lack of experience and clinical history
of with respect to devices manufactured using AM techniques, pose challenges in
determining optimal characterization and assessment methods for the final finished device, as
well as optimal process validation and acceptance methods for these devices. The FDA held
a public workshop entitled “Additive Manufacturing of Medical Devices: An Interactive
Discussion on the Technical Considerations of 3D Printing” on October 8-9, 2014, to discuss
these challenges and obtain initial stakeholder input. 3
The workshop provided a forum for medical device manufacturers, AM companies, and
academia to discuss technical considerations for AM medical devices. It focused on five
broad themes: (1) materials; (2) design, printing, and post-printing validation; (3) printing
characteristics and parameters; (4) physical and mechanical assessment of final devices; and
(5) biological considerations of final devices, including cleaning, sterility, and
biocompatibility. A variety of different types of materials can be used in additive
manufacturing. Workshop participants noted that material control is an important aspect to
ensure successful fabrication, and that final device performance is tied to the material,

machine, and post-printing processes. The interaction between the material and machine was
also discussed in the process validation session, and the need for a robust process validation
and acceptance protocol appropriate to the risk profile of the final device was identified. AM
design procedures were also discussed, and the importance of having a good understanding
of the processes and limits in the design phase was identified. There was general agreement
that printing and process parameters should be captured and validated, which can include
individual machine validations. The discussion on the physical and mechanical assessment
focused heavily on the validation of the process and the acceptance criteria for devices and
components after post-processing. The discussion on the biological considerations revealed
that there is a concern across the community regarding how to achieve adequate cleaning,
sterility, and biocompatibility of an AM device. Specifically, the challenge of assessing and
verifying these issues in porous or internally complex devices was discussed. The feedback
obtained at the workshop served as the basis for this guidance.

III. Overview
The information, characterization, and testing necessary for a device made through AM may
depend on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, whether it is an implant, an
instrument, single-use versus reusable, load-bearing, and/or available in pre-specified
standard sizes or is patient-matched. This guidance outlines technical aspects of an AM
device that should be considered through the phases of design development, production
process, process validation, semi-finished and final finished device testing. Not all
considerations described will be applicable to every device, given the variety of AM
technologies, materials, and devices made with additive manufacturing. You should
determine and justify which considerations are appropriate for your device based on the
material and technology being used and the intended use of the device. For example, a
device made via powder bed fusion from titanium would not need to address liquid material
or polymer considerations.
Similarly, not all considerations are expected to be addressed in premarket submissions of
AM devices. It is anticipated that AM devices will generally follow the same regulatory
requirements and submission expectations as the classification and/or regulation to which a
non-AM device of the same type is subject. In rare cases, AM may raise different questions
of safety and/or effectiveness. In addition, this guidance only addresses manufacturing
considerations related to the AM process. If it is unclear what technical information should
be provided in a premarket submission for an AM device, we strongly encourage
manufacturers to engage with CDRH or CBER through the Pre-Submission process to obtain
more detailed feedback. For more information on Pre-Submissions, please see “Requests for
Feedback on Medical Device Submissions: The Pre-Submission Program and Meetings with
FDA Staff - Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff.”4

The overall AM process and the related sections in this guidance are shown in the flow chart
below (Figure 1). The first step is the design process, which can include a standard design
with discrete pre-specified sizes and models, or a patient-matched device designed from a
patient’s own medical images. Once the device design is converted to a digital file, the
software workflow phase begins, and that file is further processed to prepare it for printing.
Printing parameters are optimized, and the build file is converted into a machine-ready
format. Concurrently with this step, material controls are established for materials used in
the printing of the device. After printing is complete, post-processing of the built device or
component (e.g., cleaning, annealing, post-printing machining, sterilization, packing and
labeling) takes place. After post-processing, the final finished device is ready for testing and
characterization. Your quality system should be applied across all of these processes.

V.

Design and Manufacturing Process Considerations

This section highlights technical considerations that should be addressed as part of fulfilling
Quality System (QS) requirements for a regulated device made in whole or in part by AM.
However, this guidance is not intended to comprehensively address all regulatory
requirements for a quality system. For class II and class III devices and select class I
devices, manufacturers must establish and maintain procedures to control the design of the
device in order to ensure that specified design requirements are met per 21 CFR 820.30
Design Controls. Manufacturers must also establish and maintain procedures for monitoring
and control of process parameters for validated processes to ensure that the specified
requirements continue to be met.9 Where the results of a process cannot be fully verified by
subsequent inspection and test, the process must be validated with a high degree of assurance
and approved according to established procedures.10 FDA interprets these regulations to
require manufacturers to establish procedures including validation of the manufacturing
process of AM devices to ensure that the device can perform as intended. Please note that
exemption from the requirement to submit a premarket notification (510(k)) does not mean a
device is exempt from compliance with QS requirements.
There are some devices that are specifically exempted by regulation from most QS
requirements. Manufacturers should refer to applicable regulations for their specific device
type to determine what QS requirements apply. In this section, the use of the terms
“document,” “describe,” and “identify” refers to documentation requirements according to
the QS regulation and premarket submission requirements for manufacturing information
determined by the regulation for a specific device type or classification, regardless of the
method of manufacture. Not all considerations described will be applicable to an individual
device, given the variety of AM technologies available. Similarly, a premarket submission
for a specific device may not need to address all considerations. It is anticipated that AM
devices will generally follow the same regulatory requirements as the classification and/or
regulation to which a non-AM device of the same type is subject.

There are several AM technologies and different combinations of processing steps that can
be used with each technology to build a device. Therefore, it is important to clearly identify
each step in the printing process. A production flow diagram that identifies the steps
involved in the manufacturing of the device, from the initial device design to the postprocessing of the final device, can help ensure the elements of product quality are addressed
during production. In addition, a high-level summary of each critical manufacturing process
step may be helpful in documenting the AM process used. The characterization of each
process step should include, but need not be limited to, a description of the process, and
identification of the process parameters and output specifications. Since processes that
optimize one design parameter may influence another, information on processing steps
should demonstrate your understanding of these trade-offs and how they affect design
outputs that are essential to the proper functioning of the device. Additionally, the
cumulative effects of prior processes on the final finished device or component should be
incorporated into the development of each process step and documented. The effects of the
different steps in the AM processes can be seen in final device testing; however, determining
the root cause of failures from manufacturing defects can be very difficult without a clear
understanding of each step. For example, in a powder bed fusion machine, the ratio of
reused to virgin powder can affect melting properties, which affects the energy needed to
create consistent bonding between layers, which in turn affects final mechanical properties.
Similarly, risks identified for each step of the manufacturing process, as well as mitigations
of these risks, should be documented. Each AM process may have different critical steps and
identified risks. It is important to use all reasonably obtainable knowledge about your
specific machine’s capabilities to ensure the manufacturing process outputs meet defined
requirements.11 Quantitative knowledge of the machine’s capabilities and limitations can be
gained through test builds, worst-case builds, or process validation (See Section V.F Process
Validation and Acceptance Activities and Section VI.B Mechanical Testing for more
information).
As with traditional manufacturing methods, design requirements drive the processes that can
be used to reliably produce the device. It is therefore important to clearly identify key design
parameters for your device, including, but not limited to, size range and available design or
configuration options (e.g., range of angles between the trunnion and stem of the femoral
component of a hip arthroplasty device).
While this section includes manufacturing considerations, it is not intended to
comprehensively address all considerations or regulatory requirements for establishing a
quality system for the manufacturing of your device. Aspects of the “Global Harmonization
Task Force Process Validation Guidance”12 may be helpful in developing process validation
procedures. Additional information on design controls can be found in the “Design Control

DICE@fda.hhs.gov.

A.

Overall Device Design
The innovative potential of AM may introduce variability into the manufacturing
process that would not be present when using other manufacturing techniques.
Specifically, we recommend that you compare the desired feature sizes of your final
finished device to the minimum possible feature size of your AM technique and the
manufacturing tolerances of the individual machine, given the build parameters and
conditions under which the final device is expected to be made. This is to ensure that
devices and components of the desired dimensional specifications can be reliably
built using the chosen additive technology. Dimensional specifications for the final
device or component, as well as manufacturing tolerances of the machine, should be
documented. Pixelation of features, where smooth surfaces become stepped, can lead
to rougher surface finishes than expected. Surface finish requirements should be
outlined in the product specification.

B.

Patient-Matched Device Design
Patient-matched devices (PMD) can be produced in many ways, some additive and
some traditional. AM is particularly suited to making PMD; consequently, this
guidance attempts to address some of the considerations relevant to AM. However, it
does not provide an exhaustive list of considerations for a general patient-matching
process. All AM devices, including PMD, will share the considerations described in
Section V.A. Some PMD are based on a standard-sized template model that is
matched to a patient’s anatomy. With or without a standard-sized template, PMD
may be produced within a defined design or performance envelope. This
performance envelope is determined before patient-matching can be initiated and
describes the minimum and maximum dimensions, mechanical performance limits,
and other clinically relevant factors. Patient-matching can be accomplished by
techniques such as scaling of the device using one or more anatomic references, or by
using the full anatomic features from patient imaging. Note that while patientmatched or patient-specific devices are sometimes colloquially referred to as
“customized” devices, they are not custom devices meeting the FD&C Act custom
device exemption requirements unless they comply with all of the criteria of section
520(b). Most PMD will fall within the existing regulatory pathway for that particular

device type. For further information on custom device exemptions, please refer to
the Custom Device Exemptions Guidance.14
Patient-matched device designs may be modified either directly by clinical staff, the
device manufacturer, or a third party in response to clinical inputs. These inputs may
be acquired from individual measurements, clinical assessments, patient imaging, or a
combination thereof. Alterations to the final device, and the methods used to make
the alterations, may have direct consequences to the patient. Therefore, you should
clearly identify clinically relevant design parameters, the pre-determined range
(min/max) for these parameters, and which of these parameters can be modified for
patient-matching.
Considerations for standard-sized devices should be applied to PMD as well. In
addition, for patient-matched AM devices, we recommend that you address the
following, if applicable:

(1)

Effects of imaging

Many AM devices and components incorporate medical imaging data. Every
medical device will not need the same level of anatomic matching or imaging
accuracy for optimal device performance. Several factors may affect the fit of
AM devices that use patient imaging to precisely control their size or shape,
including, but not limited to:
·
·
·
·

the minimum image feature quality and resolution used for matching,
any smoothing or image processing algorithms that may alter the
dimensions of the final device when compared to the reference anatomy,
the rigidity of the anatomic structures being imaged, and
the clarity of anatomic landmarks used to match the device to the patient’s
anatomy.

If the device relies on anatomic features that are not accurately imaged or are not
consistent over time, then the final device may not fit the patient. However, small
changes in size or geometry may be difficult to identify during visual inspection
of the device or through evaluation of patient imaging, and the mismatch may
only be identified during device use. Process validation (see Section V.FI.A(1))
is especially important to prevent these situations. In addition, for devices
intended to be fitted to or matched to soft tissues and non-rigid structures, it is
important to note the range of changes that may be experienced by the soft tissue
at the target location, such as deformation, when compared to the reference
image. You should employ a risk-based approach, taking into consideration

14

5799.pdf

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
intended use of the device and design methodologies, to assess the scenarios that
may yield a worst-case match.
Many implantable devices and their patient-matched accessories depend on the
patient’s anatomy to be clinically accurate representations of the recorded images
in order for the device to function as intended. Specifically, when the device is
intended to match a patient’s anatomy, and that anatomy can change over time
(e.g., with disease progression), the time that can elapse between when the patient
is imaged and when the final device is used may need to be reflected in the
expiration date of the device (see Section VII Labeling). You should consider
such potential time constraints associated with producing an AM device based on
the intended use of your device.

(2)

Interacting with design models

Patient-matched devices are often made by altering the features of a standardsized device for each patient within a pre-determined range of device designs and
size limits. This is typically accomplished through the use of anatomical
matching or design manipulation software that may be developed specifically for
the AM device, or through other third party software. Patient-matching may also
be accomplished by manual methods using specific measurements on radiographs
or key anatomic landmark measurements. Any software or procedure used to
make modifications to the device design based on clinical input should include
internal checks that prevent the operator from exceeding the pre-established
device specifications documented in the device master record. We recommend
that the design manipulation software or procedure used to make modifications to
the device design identify the iteration of the design being changed by the
operator. You should also identify all medical devices and accessories that the
design manipulation software is validated to work with.

(3)

Complex design files

Patient-matched devices that follow the patient anatomy precisely are especially
vulnerable to errors in file conversion because anatomic curves are typically
geometrically or mathematically complex, which can create difficulties when
calculating conversions. Additionally, for patient-matched devices, all of the file
conversion steps are typically performed every time a device is built, whereas for
a standard-sized device, most of the file conversion steps would be performed
once during the design phase. We recommend following the considerations in
Section V.C.I.A(1) on maintaining data integrity throughout file conversions.

(4)

Cybersecurity and Personally Identifiable Information

Proper management and care of personally identifiable information (PII) and
protected health information (PHI) is essential in any clinical application. For
more information on protecting PII and PHI, please refer to the HHS Guidance on
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Significant Aspects of the Privacy Rule.15 We also recommend that device
designers who include interactive steps in their patient matching workflow be
familiar with implementing the FDA's Guidance on the “Content of Premarket
Submissions for Management of Cybersecurity in Medical Devices”16 It is beyond
the scope of this document to provide a full discussion of how these aspects are
integrated into patient matching.

C. Software Workflow
The following sections highlight considerations that are especially important in the
AM process.

(1)

File Format Conversions

AM typically involves interaction between several software packages, often from
different manufacturers, which requires files to be compatible across the different
software applications used. Patient images, design manipulation software for
patient-matching, digital point clouds and meshes, and machine-readable files
each have their own standards, coordinate systems, and default parameters.
Additionally, each software package has different ways of interpreting those file
specifications. Errors in file conversion can negatively impact final finished
device and component properties, such as dimensions and geometry. Therefore,
we recommend that you verify the critical attributes and performance criteria of
your final products as part of the software workflow validation to ensure expected
performance, especially for patient-matched devices. Factors that may cause
unexpected conversion failures, such as changes to the software used, may trigger
the need for revalidation (see Section V.F.I.A(2) Revalidation).
When possible, final device files for printing should be maintained and archived
or referenced in robust, standardized formats that are able to store AM-specific
information so that the information can be retrieved when needed. For instance,
one option is the Additive Manufacturing File format (AMF) described in the
ISO/ASTM 52915 Standard specification for additive manufacturing file format
(AMF). This, or a comparable file format or document control system, should
include material information and the location of objects in a build volume and
have high geometric fidelity (e.g., curved patches).

Digital Device Design to Physical Device

When a digital device design is finalized, additional preparatory processes are
needed before the device can be additively manufactured. This is commonly
accomplished using build preparation software. These processes can be generally
divided into four steps: 1) build volume placement, 2) addition of support
material, 3) slicing, and 4) creating build paths.
i.

Build Volume Placement

Placement, orientation, and packing density of devices or components within
the build volume may be integral to individual device or component quality.
The distance between each device or component, and whether they are
identical or different designs, can affect the material properties, surface finish,
and ease of post-processing. Build orientation of each device or component
can also impact its functional performance by affecting the anisotropic
properties of the device or component. Similarly, many machines have areas
of the build volume where they function optimally and areas where they do
not. For example, printing may be sub-optimal in the regions near the outer
edge of the build volume and optimal at the center. The affected region may
be different for every machine, even between machines of the same model.
Operation Qualification (OQ) of the printing process should include, but not
be limited to, challenging the build volume placement to establish control
limits which result in product that meets all predetermined requirements.
These control limits may include acceptable placement regions, part
proximity, and other parametric considerations. Software tools are available
to trace how devices are placed and oriented. Process validation based on the
risk profile of the device is preferable to a one-size-fits-all approach.
ii.

Addition of Support Material

Some types of AM require temporary support structures for certain design
features during printing due to the layer-by-layer printing process. The
location, type, and number of supports can affect the geometric accuracy and
mechanical properties of the final finished device or component. Each AM
technology has different needs for support material use to ensure the
successful printing of a device. For example, the critical overhang angle may
be different for a stereolithography machine, an extrusion-based machine, and
a metal powder bed fusion machine. Automated algorithms are often used to
choose the location and number of supports. However, geometric
complexities or printing limits often necessitate further manual intervention.
Therefore, if your AM process requires support material, we recommend that
you analyze the geometry and other requirements that could be affected by
adding supports. Some common structures that may need support are:

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·
·
·
·

overhangs,
high aspect ratio features that protrude from the main body of the
device or component,
internal features (e.g., voids, channels), and
thin features prone to warping.

Support material can be removed physically or by chemical means. Removal
of support material may cause surface marks or leave residues on or in the
device. Manufacturing material removal processes (cleaning) should ensure
that residues are removed to the level where they do not impact the safety or
effectiveness of the product (see Section VI.E Removing Manufacturing
Material Residues and Sterilization). The complete description of the support
material geometry and the removal process method should be included in the
Device Master Record (DMR).
iii.

Slicing

Most AM techniques use a layer-by-layer printing process to fabricate
components. This necessitates slicing the models into layers. Nominal layer
thickness is determined by the machine specification and software
capabilities, and an evaluation of the raw material. However, technical
characteristics of the machine and physical properties of the material may
influence the achievable layer thickness. The surface texture of a device or
component, bonding between and curing of each layer, and sensitivity to
power fluctuations can all be affected by the choice of layer thickness. For
example, the depth of material cured in a stereolithography system is
primarily controlled by the energy density and additives in the liquid polymer.
If the energy density is changed to reduce layer thickness and the additives are
not adjusted properly, the layers may not cure or bond together completely.
For systems where layers are created by melting the material, the layer
thickness can similarly influence the energy needed to create a uniform melt
pool to enable bonding to the layer below.
Your choice of layer thickness should be documented, and reflect a balance
between the above-mentioned effects, accuracy, quality, and printing speed.
iv.

Build Paths

The build path, the path traced by the energy or material delivery system (e.g.,
laser or extruder), can impact the quality of the final finished device or
component. For example, if the delivery system sweeps from left to right on
the build volume, then makes the next pass from right to left, one side of the
device or component has more time to cool or harden. Similarly, the space
between each line of the build path and the path speed will change the amount
of melting and re-melting that the boundaries of each line of material will
experience. In addition, the build path may result in an orientation or
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
anisotropy in the device or component. We recommend that you assess
whether differences in the build path significantly affect the performance of
each component or device. If so, it is important to maintain consistency of the
build path between identical devices and components. If more than one build
path is used, each build path should be evaluated and documented.
Some machines may allow portions of a device or component to have
different energy delivery or build path specifications that do not change the
geometry of the component or device but may influence the final device
performance. Other machines may allow the fill density of a component to be
specified separately from patterns in the component’s geometry. For example,
if the geometry shows a solid wall, it is possible to fill that solid space with a
sparse honeycomb instead. These voids are easily formed with an extrusionbased machine. The fill density and fill pattern of parts that are not fully
dense (i.e., not a solid) should be documented. If a non-solid fill density is
used, we recommend that you identify whether internal voids are externally
accessible or if they are sealed. If the voids are sealed but may be
compromised during the course of the intended clinical use, you should
identify the fluid or gas that fills the voids. The risk associated with patient
exposure to the materials in the voids should also be assessed.
v.

Machine Parameters and Environmental Conditions

Each AM technology and machine model has a unique set of parameters and
settings that can be modified by the device manufacturer and those that are
configured at the time of calibration (typically by the machine manufacturer).
Maintaining proper calibration and performing preventative maintenance have
been identified as key factors to achieve low rejection rates of devices and
components from an individual machine.
Environmental conditions within the build volume can also affect quality of
the part. For machines without a self-contained, well-controlled build
volume, the ambient temperature, atmospheric composition and flow patterns
can impact solidification/polymerization rate, layer bonding, and the final
mechanical properties of the component. Therefore, it is critical to establish
and maintain procedures to adequately control environmental conditions
within the build volume.
Optimal settings and parameters for a single model of a machine can vary
greatly when printing different devices or components. Furthermore, optimal
settings and parameters can vary between machines of the same model even
when printing the same devices or components. Some parameters that can be
modified by the device manufacturer and may have a significant impact on the
device or component quality include, but are not limited to:

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

·
·
·
·

instantaneous power of the energy delivery system (e.g., temperature
gradients of deposition nozzle for fused filament systems, energy
density of laser or electron beam for powder bed fusion or
stereolithography),
build speed or beam speed,
build path,
total energy density, and
focal point or nozzle diameter.

Machine parameters should be documented, and the machine should be
qualified for use in its installation location. Aspects of the “Global
Harmonization Task Force Process Validation Guidance”17 also address
Installation Qualification.

Validating and Automating Software Processes

If you use a workflow that automates one or more software steps, you should refer
to FDA Guidance on “General Principles of Software Validation18. For more
information on validating the manufacturing process, please refer to Section V.F
Validation and Acceptance Activities.

D. Material Controls
(1)

Starting Material

In the AM process, the starting material may undergo significant physical and/or
chemical changes. As such, the starting material can have a significant effect on
the success of the build cycle, as well as on the properties of the final finished
device. Therefore, to ensure the consistency of the incoming raw material and the
final product, the following information regarding each starting material used, as
well as any processing aids, additives, and cross-linkers used, should be
documented:
·

·

the identity of the material or chemical by common name, chemical name,
trade names, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number, or recognized
consensus material standard,
material supplier,

17

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

incoming material specifications and material certificates of analysis
(COAs), with the test methods used for the COAs. Applicable materials
standards and test methods (e.g. ISO or ASTM) should be referenced.

The specifications for incoming materials and test methods should be based on the
AM technology used (e.g., material specifications will be different for powder
based vs. stereolithography machines), the intended use of the final medical
product, and the information available. The specifications of the incoming
materials (e.g., powders, liquid monomer/polymer systems) may be different from
the properties of the finished devices.
Examples of specifications for commonly used material types and machine
technologies may include, but are not limited to:
·

·
·

·
·
·

·

if the material is a solid: particle size and distribution and relevant
rheological performance for powders, or filament diameter and diametric
tolerances for filaments,
if the material is a fluid: viscosity or viscoelasticity, and pot life,
if the material is a polymer or monomer mixture: composition, purity,
water content, molecular formula, chemical structure, molecular weight,
molecular weight distribution, glass transition temperatures, melting and
crystallization point temperatures, purity information (e.g., purity of
polymer/monomer and identification and quantity of relevant impurities,
both inorganic and organic, as applicable),
if the material is metal, metal alloy, or ceramic: chemical composition and
purity,
if materials of animal origin are used, refer to: “Medical Devices
Containing Materials Derived from Animal Sources (Except for In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices,”19 and
if the material is a composite, the mix ratio with specifications provided
for each component.

In addition, when any material specification is changed, the effect on the build
process and the final device should be well-understood and documented.

(2)

Material Reuse

Some AM approaches (e.g., powder bed fusion, stereolithography) allow efficient
use of raw material by reusing the material that is not incorporated into the device

19

http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm073
816.pdf

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(e.g., unsintered powder or uncured resin). However, the reused material could be
exposed to conditions (e.g., heat, oxygen, humidity, ultraviolet energy) that may
alter it from the virgin state. Therefore, we recommend that you describe the
material reuse process, which may include, but not be limited to, a description of
processes such as filtering reused material, a limit on the percent of reused
material, or monitoring for changes in chemistry, oxygen, or water content. We
also recommend that you document evidence or provide a rationale that material
reuse does not adversely affect the final device. This may include an assessment
of the reuse protocol by conducting studies on the effect of material reuse on the
properties of the final finished device (see Section V.F.I.A(1) Validation).

E. Post-Processing
Final device performance and material properties can be affected by post-processing
steps of AM (i.e., manufacturing steps occurring after the printing process). These
steps could include removing manufacturing residues from the device, heat treatments
of the device to relieve residual stress, and final machining. All post-processing steps
should be documented and include a discussion of the effects of post-processing on
the materials used and the final device. As stated previously, manufacturers must
establish and maintain procedures for monitoring and control of process parameters
for validated processes to ensure that the specified requirements continue to be met.20
The broad utility and ability to make multiple devices at once through AM means that
some post-processing may be documented for a design, a device, or a build. We
recommend that you identify any potentially detrimental effects of post-processing
and describe mitigations implemented. For example, one common heat treatment
method for metal devices is Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). This process can reduce
residual porosity and increase fatigue life but has also been shown to reduce the
modulus and yield strength of the material. Therefore, care should be taken to ensure
both the AM and HIP processes maintain device performance.
Devices that are intended for applications where fatigue is a factor may require
minimum surface finish or roughness specification to reduce the chance of failure.
The desired surface roughness can often be achieved through various post-processing
steps (e.g., mechanical polishing); however, hard-to-reach spaces may remain in the
as-built state. These spaces should be assessed for their effects on mechanical
performance (including fatigue) of the device or component. See Section VI for
Device Testing Considerations.

F. Process Validation and Acceptance Activities

21 CFR 820.75(b)

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(1)

Process Validation

Device quality, such as feature geometry, overall dimensions, material
characteristics, and mechanical properties, are impacted by AM process
parameters, process steps, and raw material properties, as described in the sections
above. In addition, for an identical device or component, quality may vary when
built using different AM machines, even when the same machine model,
parameters, process steps, and raw materials are used. Therefore, knowledge of
how the variability of each input parameter and processing step affects the final
finished device or component is critical to ensuring part quality. Where the
results of a process cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and testing,
the process must be validated with a high degree of assurance and approved
according to established procedures.21 In addition all documentation must
conform to the existing guidelines in the Quality System regulation for device
validation. Process validation must be performed to ensure and maintain quality
for all devices and components built in a single build cycle, between build cycles,
and between machines, where the results of a process (i.e., output specifications)
cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test.22 Software also must
be validated for its intended use according to an established protocol23 (i.e.,
software workflow).
For validated processes, the monitoring and control methods and data must be
documented.24 This section provides some examples of methods for ensuring the
consistency of quality. The list is meant to be representational of the type of
factors to consider when performing process validation. It can be used as a
reference point but is not exhaustive. The following examples may have the
greatest applicability to powder bed fusion technologies, which comprise a large
portion of AM medical devices. Methods could include:
·

in-process monitoring of parameters such as:
o temperature at the beam focus,
o melt pool data,
o build-space environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, pressure,
humidity),
o power of the energy delivery system (e.g., laser, electron beam,
extruder), and
o status of mechanical elements of the printing system (e.g., recoater,
gantry)
In-process monitoring may also be helpful for processes that are not
validated, but is not required.

manual or automated visual inspection with defined acceptance criteria,
non-destructive evaluation (see Section V.E.3 Verification), and
test coupon evaluation (see Section V.E.4 Test Coupons).

Not every AM system will be able to perform all these measurements, either
because the process does not use them or because of technological limitations.
Test methods used for process monitoring and control must be validated.25 For
example, analysis should be conducted to confirm that test coupons used are
representative of the final finished device or component and representative of a
certain area within the build volume.
A single failed component or device in a build cycle may not necessitate the
rejection of all other devices or components within that build cycle. The criteria
for determining whether to reject a single device or component, or the entire
build, should be established before testing.

(2)

Revalidation

Changes to the device, manufacturing process, or process deviations should be
identified and analyzed for the potential risks they introduce. Based on this
assessment, the change or deviation may trigger the need for revalidation of the
process.26 Manufacturers should rely on existing FDA Guidance for their
regulatory pathway27,28,29,30 when considering a change to a previously cleared or
approved device that uses AM. Some examples of triggers for revalidation
specific to AM are:
·
·
·
·
·

25

software changes (e.g., change or update of build preparation software),
changes in material (e.g., supplier, incoming material specification, reused
powder, new formulation) or material handling,
change in the spacing or orientation of devices or components in the build
volume,
changes to the software workflow (see Section V.B.2 Digital Device
Design to Physical Device),
physically moving the machine to a new location, and

changes to post-processing steps or parameters.

Acceptance Activities

Acceptance activities are integral to process control. Many AM technologies can
produce more than one device or component simultaneously at different locations
in the build volume. Each of these devices or components can be copies of a
single design or different designs. This makes it more challenging to ensure
repeatability and consistency within a build cycle and across lots.
Some acceptance activities for individual devices or components can be
performed through non-destructive evaluation (NDE). Specifically, NDE
techniques can be used for the verification of geometry, morphology, and some
performance characteristics. Techniques include, but are not limited to:
·
·
·
·
·
·

ultrasound,
computed tomography (CT) or micro-CT,
x-ray (in cases with simple geometry),
dye penetration,
confocal microscopy, and
hyperspectral imaging.

Some techniques are not suitable for some materials, designs, or intended uses.
General NDE testing protocols can be found from the ASTM and ISO
Committees on Nondestructive Testing. Protocols specific to AM can be found
from the ISO/ASTM Committee on Additive Manufacturing Technologies.31 If
an NDE technique is used in your process validation or acceptance activities, the
choice of technique used should be discussed and documented.

(4)

Test Coupons

A test coupon is a representative test sample of the device or component. The
design of test coupons and placement within the build volume can be especially
important for AM. Coupons can be simple shapes suitable for destructive
mechanical testing, or they may contain one or more structural features (e.g.,
surface porosity, internal channels) representative of the component or device that
can be assessed using destructive techniques. We recommend that coupons be
used to help with your process validation and to identify worst-case conditions in
your manufacturing process (e.g., worst-case orientation and location in build
volume). Test coupons can also be used for in-process monitoring by placing
them in build volume locations that are known to have the worst-case outputs.
However, test coupons may not be needed if the process is validated per Quality
31

http://www.astm.org/COMMIT/SUBCOMMIT/F42.htm

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
System requirements and coupon testing is not a process monitoring activity
defined in your quality system. These test coupons can confirm that the build
cycle has met its performance specification for that portion of the build volume if
the test coupons meet the performance specifications. For example, test coupons
may be placed at the edges of the build volume if edges are known to have less
optimal build quality. They may also be placed randomly in between components
or devices to produce a sampling of the build quality. Data to demonstrate that
test coupons are representative of the components, in-process devices, or finished
devices should be documented. Many factors can alter how well a test coupon
represents any given part in the build space. When coupons are used, they should
be validated to accurately and reproducibly represent the one or more printed
parts within a specific build volume.

G. Quality Data
The analysis of sources of quality data to identify existing and potential causes of
nonconforming product, or other quality problems is an essential part of any quality
system. For devices produced by AM, it is important to consider whether it is
necessary to keep track of the location in the build volume where a device or
component was built. This will depend on information obtained during process
validation activities and design specifications. For example, if process validation
demonstrated that quality is not affected by location in the build volume, it may not
be necessary to be able to keep track of the build volume location for each device.
This level of specificity is important in identifying possible causes of failure when
multiple different components or devices are made in the same build volume at the
same time. Therefore, you should ensure that quality data such as build volume
location can be analyzed to enable proper identification of quality problems and
investigation of the cause of nonconformities.

VI. Device Testing Considerations
The following section contains a description of the type of information that we recommend
that you include in a premarket submission of a device made using AM. The type and
amount of data to support a substantial equivalence determination or approval will vary
depending on the intended use, risk profile, and classification and/or regulation for the device
type. In addition, the type of information needed for a device made through AM may also
depend on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, whether it is an implant, load
bearing, and/or available in pre-specified standard sizes or is patient-matched. Not all
considerations described will be applicable to a single device, given the variety of devices
that can be made by AM and AM technologies available. In general, if the type of
characterization or performance testing outlined in each of the sub-sections below is needed
for a device made using non-AM techniques, the information should also be provided for an
AM device of the same device type. If you have specific questions regarding the information
to support a premarket submission for an AM device, please contact the relevant review
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
division in CDRH or contact CBER for products containing biologics, cells or tissues.
Specific questions regarding jurisdiction over a combination product should be directed to
the Office of Combination Products (OCP) at 301-427-1934 or combination@fda.gov.

A. Device Description
AM facilitates the creation of intermediate and customized device sizes. Patientmatched devices are a good example of this application. Since these devices may not
have discrete sizes, such as small, medium, and large, we recommend that you
identify the range of dimensions for your device. In addition, you should describe
any design variations, for example, amount of anatomical coverage for a cranioplasty
plate. Any critical dimensions or features that are intended to be altered to match a
patient should also be clearly identified, and the range of allowable values for these
parameters should also be identified. Since each type of AM technology has different
technical considerations, you should describe the type of AM technology used to
build your device. In addition, because AM use for medical devices is relatively new,
we recommend that you include a flow chart describing your AM process, including
post-processing, in order to help determine if additional assessments are needed.
Due to the generally complex geometry of AM devices, we recommend that critical
features of the device be clearly described in the device description and identified in
technical drawings. For example, the location and thickness of porous scaffolding
should be described, as these features may have reduced mechanical properties in
comparison to a solid material. In the technical drawings of your device we
recommend that you identify components made using AM.

B. Mechanical Testing
The type of performance testing that should be conducted on a device made using
AM is generally the same as if the device was manufactured using a traditional
manufacturing method. Depending on the device type, these may include material
property testing such as modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength,
creep/viscoelasticity, fatigue, or abrasive wear. Performance testing should be
conducted on final finished devices subjected to all post-processing, cleaning, and
sterilization steps. As with any recommended testing, the final finished device should
be used or a rationale should be provided explaining why the test coupon used was
representative of the final finished device. In addition, the worst-case combinations
of dimensions and features (e.g., holes, supports, porous regions) should be
considered when determining the worst-case devices for performance testing. You
should also provide a discussion of how the worst-case devices were selected for each
performance test conducted.
Due to the nature of AM, devices will likely have an orientation (i.e., anisotropy)
relative to the build direction and location within the build space. The orientation and
build location can affect the final properties and should be considered when
22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
conducting device mechanical testing. Specifically, the build orientation (including
worst-case orientation) of devices or components should be identified for each
performance test. If the orientation changes with device size or design, the worstcase orientation should be identified for each configuration. Since the effect of
orientation can vary based on the manufacturing technology used, a baseline study of
the machine/material combination used may be helpful in determining the degree to
which the build orientation will affect mechanical properties. Coupons may be used
for material property assessments if there is adequate justification provided for why
the coupon is representative of the final device. This justification should consider
critical design elements, post-printing processes, cleaning, disinfection and/or
sterilization as they relate to each type of testing. This information can be used to aid
in the selection of worst-case samples with respect to orientation.
In addition, for some AM machines, the location within the build space can have an
effect on mechanical properties.32 For example, for powder bed systems, the
difference in distance from the energy source to different locations in the build space
(e.g., center vs. corner) could lead to variability in the mechanical properties of
devices built in those locations. To determine whether build location has a significant
effect on device characteristics or performance (including fatigue strength), we
recommend that you perform a baseline study of your machine/material combination
(see Section V.E.1 Validation). The use of coupons for your baseline study is
recommended. If there is a significant effect, build location should be considered in
the identification of worst-case samples for mechanical testing.
Since mechanical properties of the device may be impacted by orientation and
location, it is important to ensure that production processes are properly developed,
conducted, controlled, and monitored in order to ensure that devices or components
are not adversely affected by fabrication orientation. The process validation
described in Section V.F. Process Validation and Acceptance Activities may be used
to address the impact of orientation and location.

C. Dimensional Measurements
Similar to mechanical properties, device dimensions may be affected by orientation
and location within the build space. Therefore, we recommend that you specify the
dimensional tolerances and perform dimensional measurements for the worst case
additively manufactured devices and/or components. Samples selected for the
assessment of dimensional measurements should address variability due to orientation
and build location if baseline studies show a dependence on these parameters. To
demonstrate consistency and reproducibility between build cycles, dimensional

32

ASTM F3122 “Standard Guide for Evaluating Mechanical Properties of Metal Materials Made via Additive
Manufacturing Processes”

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
measurements should be made on samples from multiple build cycles, and a
justification should be provided on the sampling scheme used. Alternatively, you
may use process validation information to demonstrate that there is negligible
variability between build cycles.
While we are aware of the potential effects of orientation and build location on
mechanical properties and dimensional tolerances, there may be other properties that
could be affected based on the intended use and technological characteristics of the
device.

D. Material Characterization
(1)

Material Chemistry

Since the AM process creates the final material or alters the starting material
during the process, all materials involved in the manufacturing of the device
should be identified. As noted in Section V.C Material Controls, this information
should include the source and purity of each material used. Certificates of
Analysis and/or Materials Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) can facilitate the review of
each material. The Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number, if available, of
each chemical component should be provided. If material chemistry information
in a device master file (MAF) will be referenced, you should include a right to
reference letter from the MAF holder in your premarket submission.33 You
should also document the material composition of the final finished device.
Given the iterative nature of AM, the starting material can be exposed to partial
re-melting and solidification processes multiple times, which may result in
unexpected or undesired material chemistries for some polymer systems.
Therefore, if biocompatibility is not evaluated as described in the guidance “Use
of International Standard ISO-10993, "Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices
Part 1: Evaluation and Testing within a Risk Management Process”34 or if
biocompatibility testing identifies a concern, additional material chemistry
information may be needed. For example, a description of all material chemistry
changes expected during the manufacturing of your device may be needed. In
addition, based on this description and the material/machine type used, it may also
be necessary to provide additional information or testing for polymers to ensure
that there are no unintentionally formed chemical entities that could pose a risk to
patient health.

Material Physical Properties

Inter-layer bonding (adhesion/cohesion) is unique to AM and determines the
ultimate structural integrity of the final finished device. As such, material
properties known to affect interlayer bonding should be characterized. This
information should be representative of the final finished device (subjected to all
post-processing, cleaning, and sterilization steps). Material properties can be
determined from the final device or using coupons. If coupons are used, a
description of the coupon and a justification for why coupon testing is
representative of the final device should be provided.
If your device is additively manufactured using metal or ceramic, we recommend
that you characterize the microstructure, which may include but is not limited to
grain size, orientation, and phase composition. Existing consensus standards for
materials can be used for comparison. If the AM process results in structural
inhomogeneity, microstructural voids, incomplete consolidation, or other
microstructural issues, additional mechanical testing may be needed to show that
these issues do not affect device performance.
If your device is additively manufactured using polymers, we recommend that
you ensure the AM process is consistently creating a device or component that
has properties that meet your specifications. For example, in situ crosslinked
devices may have crosslink density gradients across the build. For AM processes
that use polymer crosslinking, the percent crosslinking and degree of curing
should be evaluated to ensure that the AM process results in a material that is
fully cured and within specifications. For systems using a crystalline or semi
crystalline material, crystallinity and crystalline morphology should be
characterized to ensure that the AM process is not adversely altering the polymer
structure and subsequently altering the performance (e.g., creep, material
transparency) of the final device. For hydrogel materials, the percent water
swelling or water content of the material should be reported to ensure that that the
AM process has not adversely affected the materials’ ability to uptake water.
If your device is additively manufactured using an absorbable material, we
recommend that you perform in vitro degradation testing using final finished
devices or coupons. If coupons are used, they should be representative of your
final finished device in terms of both processing and properties (e.g., surface-tovolume ratio, crystallinity). This will establish whether AM has an adverse effect
on the degradation profile of the material.

E. Removing Manufacturing Material Residues and
Sterilization
AM facilitates the creation of devices with complex geometries, such as engineered
porosity, honeycomb structures, channels, and internal voids or cavities that cannot be
produced by traditional manufacturing methods. Such complex geometries in
25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
additively manufactured devices are expected to increase the difficulty in removing
manufacturing material residues (cleaning) and in sterilization due to the likelihood of
increased surface area, generation of extensive tortuous pathways, and creation of
internal voids with limited or no access. Additionally, AM allows porous structures
to be produced earlier in the manufacturing process than many traditional methods,
which could result in greater soiling by the manufacturing material of those porous
structures throughout the rest of the process. Therefore, validation of the reduction of
the manufacturing material residue to levels that do not adversely affect the device’s
quality and sterilization process validation should account for the complex geometry
of your device under worst-case conditions (e.g., greatest amount of residual
manufacturing materials, and a combination of largest surface area, greatest porosity,
and most internal voids for sterilization validation).
Manufacturing material means any material or substance used in or used to facilitate
the manufacturing process, a concomitant constituent, or a byproduct constituent
produced during the manufacturing process, which is present in or on the final
finished device as a residue or impurity not by design or intent of the manufacturer.35
There is also an increased risk of residual manufacturing material, such as excess
starting material or support material, remaining on the final finished device. Since
residual manufacturing material may negatively affect the performance of the device,
you should describe the process used to ensure removal of residual manufacturing
materials to a level where they do not affect the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Note that for complex geometries and trapped volumes, destructive testing may be
needed to properly validate the removal of the manufacturing material.

When a manufacturing material could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
effect on device quality, the manufacturer must establish and maintain procedures for
the use and removal of such residual manufacturing material to ensure that it is
removed or limited to an amount that does not adversely affect the device's quality. 36
It is important to note that many end user facilities may not have routine access to the
equipment or materials needed to implement cleaning procedures that are designed to
remove residual manufacturing materials and that personnel are likely not adequately
trained to perform such cleaning procedures. Therefore, only devices that are
sufficiently cleaned of residual manufacturing materials should be provided to the end
user. While engineered porosity and complex geometries are generally an advantage
of additive manufacturing, highly porous regions are expected to be difficult to clean
in comparison to devices made with other manufacturing methods, and can also
greatly increase the surface area of the device. Therefore, we also recommend that you
include an overview or summary of manufacturing residue removal process and
information (e.g., testing procedure and data) in your premarket submission to

demonstrate that your device is cleaned of manufacturing residues before being provided
to the end user.

The extent to which manufacturing material residue must be reduced is determined on
case-by-case basis considering characteristics such as: manufacturing processes,
intended use, materials, type and duration of exposure, intended anatomical location,
and type of device. In addition, we recommend using final finished devices after they
have undergone all other processing for assessment of manufacturing material
removal and validation of the sterilization process. For additional information on
sterilization and validation, see “Submission and Review of Sterility Information in
Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile.”37
If additively manufacturing a reusable medical device that involves reprocessing or a
device intended for end-user sterilization in health care facilities, we recommend the
inclusion of reprocessing instructions in your device labeling. Please refer to the
guidance, “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation
Methods and.”38

F. Biocompatibility
We recommend that you evaluate the biocompatibility of the final finished device as
described in the guidance “Use of International Standard ISO-10993, "Biological
Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing within a Risk
Management Process.”39 If chemical additives with known toxicities are used (e.g.,
certain additives, catalysts, binding and curing agents, uncured monomers,
plasticizers), additional information, as outlined in the guidance,40 may be necessary.

VII. Labeling
Device labeling should be developed in accordance with applicable regulations,
device-specific guidance documents, and consensus standards.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Since clinical staff, device manufacturers, or a designated third party might modify
the design of a PMD, additional labeling information is recommended for AM
devices that are patient-matched. We recommend that each AM PMD be marked or
have accompanying healthcare practitioner labeling included in the packaging to
identify:
·
·
·

patient identifier,
use (e.g., left distal femoral surgical guide), and
final design iteration or version used to produce the device.

The expiration date for a patient-matched device may be driven by the patient
imaging date or the design finalization date rather than the standard methods of
determining device shelf life (see Section V.B.(1)). In addition, it is possible that the
patient may have experienced events between the time of imaging and surgery (e.g.
additional trauma), which could impact performance of the device. Therefore, we
recommend that you include a precaution in your labeling that the patient should be
surveyed for potential anatomical changes prior to the procedure.
