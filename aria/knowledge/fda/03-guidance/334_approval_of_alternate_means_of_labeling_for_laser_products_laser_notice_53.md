Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Approval of Alternate Means of Labeling
for Laser Products
(Laser Notice 53)
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
Under current radiological health regulations, the Center for Devices and Radiological
Health (CDRH) may approve alternate means for manufacturers of laser products to provide
required certification, identification, and warning labeling in cases where it is not feasible to
provide the labeling as specified in the regulations (21 CFR 1010.2, 1010.3, 1040.10(g)).
CDRH may approve alternate means of providing the certification and identification upon
the manufacturer’s application (21 CFR 1010.2(d), 1010.3(b)). CDRH on its own initiative or
in response to a manufacturer’s written application may approve either alternate means of
providing the labels or alternate wording for the warning labeling required under 1040.10(g).
CDRH is issuing this guidance to inform manufacturers that the FDA intends to exercise
enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances described later, as to its current
regulations governing the provision of certification, identification, and warning labeling for
laser products and obtaining approval of alternate means of providing this information.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
and electronic product regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant
scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to
comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would
be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send
your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the
CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways
to contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

1. Issue
The applicable regulations in 21 CFR 1010.2, 1010.3, and 1040.10(g) require that
manufacturers provide certification, identification, and warning labeling in a specified
manner. However, the regulations contain provisions for CDRH to approve alternate means
of providing the required labeling in cases where it is not feasible to provide the labeling as
specified in the regulation, often due to size. Alternate means may be approved by CDRH
upon application by the manufacturer (21 CFR 1010.2, 1010.3, and 1040.10(g)). However,
due to the increasing numbers of laser products of small size and the overall increase in the
number of manufacturers and minimal risk to public health, CDRH intends to exercise
enforcement discretion, under certain circumstances, and permit manufacturers of laser
products to use alternate means of providing the required information without applying to
and receiving approval from CDRH.

2. Guidance
Under what circumstances may manufacturers use alternate means of providing the
required certification, identification, or warning labeling, without applying to and
receiving approval from CDRH?
Alternate means of labeling may be used without applying to and receiving approval
from CDRH when
• size
• configuration
• design
• function
• sterilization
or other considerations make the placement of the labels as required by the
regulations and performance standard impractical.

What are some examples of alternate means of providing required labeling?

Examples of alternate means of providing required labeling include
• Placement of labels on packaging
• Placement of labels in user instructions
• Placement of labels on alternate portions of the product
What should manufacturers do if using alternate means without applying to and
receiving approval from CDRH?
As is currently the case, manufacturers who use alternate means—whether they applied for
and received approval for the alternate means from CDRH or based on this guidance--should
document this in the product report and retain in-house the justification for use of alternate
means for review upon CDRH request.
If, in its review of a manufacturer’s product report, CDRH believes a particular laser product
should have been labeled in accordance with the regulations, CDRH may notify the
manufacturer and require recall of the product for relabeling or a change in the labeling in
future production in accordance with 21 CFR 1003 and 1004.
Manufacturers also may contact CDRH to discussion whether this guidance applies to their
product. Please note, however, that CDRH does not act as an intermediary between
manufacturers and testing laboratories from which the manufacturer may have sought
independent certification of conformance.
