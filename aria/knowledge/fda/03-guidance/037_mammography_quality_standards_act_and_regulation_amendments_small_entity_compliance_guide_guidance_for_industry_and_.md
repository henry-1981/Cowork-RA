Mammography Quality Standards
Act and Regulation Amendments:
Small Entity Compliance Guide
Guidance for Industry and Food
and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

On March 10, 2023, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule1 (“2023 MQSA
Rule”) to update the mammography regulations in part 900 of subchapter I of title 21 of the Code
of Regulations (“MQSA regulations” or “implementing regulations”) that were issued under the
Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 (MQSA) and the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). FDA has prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in
accordance with section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public
Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law 110-28) to assist small entities to comply with these
changes in the MQSA regulations, which become effective September 10, 2024.
Mammography is an x-ray imaging examination used to identify signs of breast cancer. For
patients to receive the full benefit of mammography, the service must be of high quality,
including performance of the examination by qualified technologists, using equipment that is
tested and properly functioning; interpretation by qualified physicians; and clear and prompt
communication of results to patients and their referring healthcare providers. The MQSA
establishes uniform baseline Federal standards designed to ensure, among other things, that all
patients nationwide have access to quality mammography services. The MQSA implementing
regulations address, among other things, standards for accreditation bodies and certifying
agencies, as well as mammography quality standards for facilities, such as qualifications of
personnel at mammography facilities, standards for mammography equipment, the content and
terminology for mammography reports, the requirement to establish a quality assurance program,
standards and timing for quality assurance testing, standards for clinical image quality,
1

88 FR 15126 (March 10, 2023).

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
recordkeeping, communication of results, and clinical image review by the facility’s accrediting
body (AB). Based on technology changes in mammography and our experience with the
administration of the MQSA program, FDA has modernized and updated the regulations as well
as improved the information, including breast density information, required to be provided by
mammography facilities to patients and their healthcare providers. The 2023 MQSA Rule
requires that the summary of the mammography report written in lay terms (“lay summary”) that
is provided to patients identifies whether the patient has dense or non-dense breast tissue and
includes a prescribed paragraph on the significance of breast density. The 2023 MQSA Rule also
establishes four categories for reporting breast tissue density in the mammography report that is
provided to the patient’s referring healthcare provider.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II.

Questions and Answers on the MQSA and Implementing
Regulations
The 2023 MQSA Rule updating the MQSA regulations renumbered and added certain
provisions to the regulations. Throughout this guidance document, where FDA intends to cite
a portion of the MQSA regulations that has been renumbered or added to the regulations by
the 2023 MQSA Rule, that citation is in italics. Where the citation is in plain text, the citation
remains unchanged in the 2023 MQSA Rule.

A.

GENERAL BACKGROUND
1. What is a mammography facility?
A mammography facility is a hospital, outpatient department, clinic, radiology
practice, mobile unit, office of a physician, or other facility that conducts
mammography activities, including the following: Operation of equipment to
produce a mammogram, processing of the mammogram, initial interpretation of the
mammogram, and maintaining viewing conditions for that interpretation. This term
does not include a facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs. (42 U.S.C.
263b(a)(3), 21 CFR 900.2(q)).

2.

What do the MQSA and its implementing regulations address?
The MQSA and its implementing regulations address, among other things, standards
for ABs and certifying agencies, as well as mammography quality standards for
facilities, such as qualifications of personnel at mammography facilities, standards
for mammography equipment, the content and terminology for mammography
reports, the requirement to establish a quality assurance program, standards and
timing for quality assurance testing, standards for clinical image quality,
2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
recordkeeping, communication of results, and clinical image review by the facility's
AB.

3.

What specific areas do the MQSA and its implementing regulations NOT
address?
The MQSA and its implementing regulations do not contain clinical practice
guidelines, including on topics such as the age range or time interval for screening
mammography. The interpretation of the imaging findings is the responsibility of
the qualified interpreting physician. The MQSA and its implementing regulations do
not take a position on any other clinical standards of care, which are more
appropriately considered during the clinical decision-making by the interpreting
physician, the referring healthcare provider, and the patient. Computed tomography
of the breast is not regulated under the MQSA regulations. (21 CFR 900.2(aa)(3)).
Additionally, the regulations generally do not apply to radiography of the breast
performed during invasive interventions for localization or biopsy procedures or
performed with an investigational mammography device as part of a study
conducted in accordance with FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption regulations
found in 21 CFR part 812. (See 21 CFR 900.2(aa)(1)-(2)). FDA does not typically
review clinical images for quality, as this is generally performed by the ABs. (See
21 CFR 900.4(c), 900.12(i), and 900.12(j)).

B.

CERTIFICATION
1.

What does certification mean?
Certification means the process of approval of a facility by FDA or by a State that
has received FDA approval as a certifier (“State Certification Agency,” “State as
Certifier” or “SAC”) to provide mammography services. (21 CFR 900.2(i)). In other
words, a mammography facility that receives MQSA certification has shown it is
capable of providing quality mammography. Certification is issued by the FDA or,
for facilities located in the States in which the State is an SAC (found here:
https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/facility-certification-andinspection-mqsa/mqsa-accreditation-bodies https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/mammography-quality-standards-act-and-program/facility-accreditationand-certification), by that SAC. A facility that is certified has completed a rigorous
review of its practices by an FDA-approved AB, and FDA or the SAC has
determined that the facility has satisfied the requirements for certification (21 CFR
900.11(a) and (b)(1); 900.20). A facility that has been provisionally certified is
undergoing the process of accreditation with an FDA-approved AB, and FDA or the
SAC has determined the facility has submitted the required information to the AB.
(21 CFR 900.11(b)(2); 900.20).

2.

What is the difference between full certification vs. provisional certification?
Full Certification: A fully certified facility has completed the accreditation review
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
process and has been issued an MQSA certificate that is valid for three years. (42
U.S.C. 263b(c)(1); 21 CFR 900.11(b)(1)).
Provisional Certification: A provisionally certified facility has had its application
accepted by an FDA-approved AB, the AB has decided that the facility has
submitted the required information, and FDA or an SAC has issued a provisional
certificate to enable the facility to perform mammography and to obtain the clinical
images needed to complete the accreditation process (see 21 CFR 900.11(b)(2)). A
provisional certificate is valid for up to six months. During the six-month
provisional period, the facility must collect clinical images and other data needed for
completion of the accreditation process (within the AB required timeframes) and
adhere to all requirements of the AB (21 CFR 900.11(b)(2)(ii)). If the facility has
not completed the accreditation process prior to the expiration of the provisional
MQSA certificate, it must cease performing mammography (see 21 CFR 900.11(a)).
A facility may apply for and receive reinstatement of the facility’s MQSA certificate
(21 CFR 900.11(c)). Alternatively, a facility that meets certain criteria2 may qualify
for a one-time 90-day extension of the provisional MQSA certificate. (21 CFR
900.11(b)(3)).

3.

Can a facility get certification from the State?
Yes. FDA may delegate certain aspects of the MQSA certification program to
qualified States that have applied for and that have received FDA approval as a
certifying agency. (42 U.S.C. 263b(q); 21 CFR 900.21(d)). A State as Certifier, or
SAC, may perform several functions, including:
·
·

Issuance, renewal, denial, suspension, and revocation of certificates to
mammography facilities within the State.3
Annual facility inspections of facilities.4

The current list of approved SACs is available at: https://www.fda.gov/radiationemitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-and-program/facilityaccreditation-and-certification.
FDA generally does not certify facilities located in States that have an FDAapproved SAC. (See 21 CFR 900.20).

4.

Are all facilities practicing mammography required to be certified?
To perform mammography, all “facilities” that are subject to the MQSA5 must be
either provisionally certified while they undergo accreditation review or certified. If
a facility is not certified or provisionally certified, it must stop providing

2

42 U.S.C. 263b(c)(4) describes the criteria for FDA to issue a 90-day extension.
Under 21 CFR 900.21(d), FDA may limit the scope of certification authority delegated to the State in accordance with
MQSA. To date, FDA has not granted certification authority to a State for Federal facilities.

As defined in the MQSA, "facility" does not include a facility of the Department of Veterans Affairs (42 U.S.C.
263b(a)(3)(A).)

mammography services. (21 CFR 900.11).

5.

What is a 90-day extension?
If the accreditation process is not completed within the six-month provisional
period, a facility may apply to FDA or the SAC, through its AB, for a 90-day
extension. To be eligible for a 90-day extension, a facility must describe the steps
being taken to qualify the facility for certification and provide evidence that there
would be a significant adverse impact on access to mammography in the geographic
area served if such facility did not obtain an extension. (21 CFR 900.11(b)(3)).
To apply for a 90-day extension, a facility must contact its AB or other entity
designated by FDA. (21 CFR 900.11(b)(3)(i)).

6.

Is there a list of MQSA-Certified Facilities?
FDA’s publicly available database can be checked to confirm the certification status
of all mammography facilities.

7.

Does Medicaid or Medicare pay for mammography services performed at
facilities that are not MQSA-certified?
No facility subject to the MQSA may conduct a mammography examination or
procedure unless the facility obtains a certificate, or a temporary renewal certificate,
or provisional certificate. (42 U.S.C. 263b(b)(1)). The Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations govern the amount and frequency of Medicaid
or Medicare reimbursement. (See 42 CFR subchapters B and C of chapter IV). For
information or questions regarding Medicare or Medicaid contact CMS.

C.

ACCREDITATION
1.

What is accreditation?
Accreditation is the process by which an FDA-approved AB accredits
mammography facilities to be eligible to obtain certification to perform
mammography services. For a facility to obtain accreditation and qualify for a
certificate, a facility must apply to an FDA-approved AB, and the AB must decide
to accredit the facility. The facility must submit to the AB the information required
by 21 CFR 900.11(b)(1), (2), or (3), as applicable. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(d)(1)(A)(iv)
and 21 CFR 900.11(a)). The AB reviews the facility’s accreditation application
materials in accordance with established requirements and standards for
accreditation in the MQSA regulations and FDA-approved AB policies and
evaluates the facility for compliance with national quality standards. (See 21 CFR
900.1, 900.3, 900.4, and 900.12).

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

2.

Where can a facility apply for accreditation?
FDA has approved a private non-profit organization, the American College of
Radiology (ACR), which serves as a nationwide AB, and some State agencies to
serve as ABs for facilities in their respective States, for 7-year terms. (See 21 CFR
900.3(g)). The list of current ABs can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/radiationemitting-products/mammography-quality-standards-act-and-program/facilityaccreditation-and-certification.

3.

Do all FDA-approved ABs have the same requirements for mammography
quality?
Yes. All mammography facilities accredited by any FDA-approved AB are held to
the same federal quality standards. The MQSA regulations require the AB to review
a mammography facility's equipment, personnel (interpreting physicians, radiologic
technologists, and medical physicists), clinical image quality, and practices. The AB
will accredit the facility if its review establishes that the mammography facility
meets the federal quality standards established under the MQSA and its
implementing regulations. (21 CFR 900.4). There may be specific State
requirements independent of the MQSA requirements that are applicable to a
facility.

4.

How does a facility know which accreditation body it should apply to?
To be accredited by a State, a facility must be located in that AB's State. Under the
MQSA, a facility located in a State with an FDA-approved AB may be accredited
either by the State or by the ACR. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(e) and 21 CFR 900.3(a)).
Currently, the ACR can accredit any facility in the United States.

5.

What is the cost for accreditation?
Each AB has its own fee schedule. You should contact your AB for more
information related to the cost of accreditation. (21 CFR 900.4(i)).

6.

How long is accreditation valid?
Accreditation is valid for up to three years. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(c)(1); 21 CFR
900.4(c)(1) & (d)(1)). Facilities with a lapse in accreditation or that have not been
reaccredited will not be able to obtain new or renewed MQSA certificates until
accreditation or reaccreditation occurs. (21 CFR 900.11(b)(1)). Further, without an
MQSA certificate that is in effect, the facility cannot lawfully operate. (21 CFR
900.11(a)). Accordingly, facilities should ensure they allow sufficient time to
complete the reaccreditation process before their MQSA certificate expires.

7.

When a certified facility purchases a new mammography unit, what steps must
the facility take before the unit can be used for mammography?
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In an already-certified facility, a newly-installed mammography unit can be used
only after:
·

·

A mammography equipment evaluation (MEE) has been conducted by a
qualified medical physicist within the six months prior to submitting a unit
accreditation application; and
Each mammography equipment unit undergoes accreditation by the
facility’s AB.

See 21 CFR 900.4(e) and 900.12(e)(10). Please note that after the initial MEE is
conducted by a medical physicist, subsequent MEEs may be performed by a medical
physicist or under the direct supervision of a medical physicist. (21 CFR 900.4(e)
and 900.12(e)(10)).
As part of the facility’s record-keeping requirement, a facility must have
documentation showing that it has passed an MEE before a new unit may be used on
patients. (See 21 CFR 900.12(d)(2) and 900.12(e)(10)). Before using a new unit, a
facility should also have documentation showing that it has received confirmation
that the accreditation application for the new unit has been accepted and is under
review by its AB. FDA generally considers a new unit to be undergoing
accreditation when the facility has submitted the initial part of the application for
accreditation to its AB and has received confirmation that the application is under
review. A facility should then follow its AB’s guidelines for newly installed
mammography units. (21 CFR 900.4(e) and 900.12(e)(10)).

8.

As of September 10, 2024, what are the facility’s updated responsibilities when
a mammography unit is converted from one modality to another?
An MEE is required prior to clinical use when a mammography unit is converted
from one modality to another modality. The MEE must demonstrate compliance
with applicable requirements. In addition, the AB’s procedures must be followed for
applying for accreditation of that unit. (21 CFR 900.12(b)(2)(ii), 21 CFR 21 CFR
900.4(e), 900.12(e)(10)).

9.

If a facility failed the 2D portion of unit accreditation but passed the 3D
portion, can the unit be used for acquiring 3D images only?
A facility may perform mammography using the 3D mode only if it is a separately
accredited modality. However, a unit that takes both 2D and 3D images during one
exposure (i.e., combination mode) and the 2D portion of the unit is unaccredited, it
would not comply with applicable MQSA requirements. (21 CFR 900.4(e), 21 CFR
900.12(b)(2)(ii), 21 CFR 900.12(e)(10)).

10.

Are mobile mammography facilities required to meet the same standards as
stationary facilities?
Yes. The MQSA regulations apply to all mammography facilities as defined in 21
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
CFR 900.2(q), including mobile units. The same standards for image quality apply
to all facilities, whether stationary or mobile. Mobile facilities, similar to other
facilities, must prominently display an MQSA certificate issued by FDA or the SAC
for that facility. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(b)(1)(A)(iii)).

11.

Beginning September 10, 2024, what are the consequences if a facility fails to
become accredited after three consecutive attempts?
A facility that fails to become accredited after three consecutive attempts must wait
1 year from the date of the most recent accreditation failure before applying to any
AB. (21 CFR 900.4(a)(6)(ii)).

D.

INSPECTIONS
1.

During an annual inspection, what will inspectors review?
Each facility location must be inspected at least annually by a certified MQSA
inspector for the following:
· Equipment performance
· Quality Assurance (QA) records
· Quality Control (QC) records to include:
- Technologist tests
- Medical physicist's annual survey report
- Mammography equipment evaluations, if any
· Personnel qualification records
· Medical records (mammography reports) and lay summaries
· Medical audit and outcome analysis records

See 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1)(E); 21 CFR 900.12(a)(4), 900.12(c)(4), 900.12(d)(2), and
900.12(f)(4).
Annual inspections are generally conducted by FDA, or a State or local agency
acting on behalf of FDA, and typically do not include a review of clinical image
interpretations or quality, which the AB reviews separately according to its FDAapproved timeframe, or as specified by FDA (see 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1), 21 CFR
900.4(c)(1), and 900.12(j)). This means that even if the annual inspection does not
identify any adverse observations, a facility could have mammography image
quality issues.
Concurrent with the MQSA annual inspection, States may also inspect for some
items that are required by their laws and regulations but are independent of MQSA
requirements. However, these items generally do not affect the facility's compliance
with MQSA or the associated MQSA inspection fee. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)).

2.

What documentation will the inspector review during each annual MQSA
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
inspection?
During the annual MQSA inspection, inspectors will review documentation that
relates to whether the facility is meeting the requirements of the MQSA. This may
include, but is not limited to:
· accreditation and certification documentation;
· licensure, board certification, training letters and certificates, and experience
records of mammography personnel;
· the medical physicist survey, or MEE reports, the quality control records and
images documenting the results of periodic quality control tests
recommended by the manufacturer of the equipment or under an alternative
standard;
· to assess equipment performance, an inspector typically requests the facility
perform a phantom image from each mammography unit during the
inspection;
· a sample of medical reports issued for mammographic examinations
performed at the facility;
· a sample of the lay summary letters issued to mammography patients whose
mammograms were performed at the facility;
· and any other documentation required of the facility under the MQSA. (42
U.S.C. 263b(g), 21 CFR 900.12(d)(2)).

3.

How is the scheduling of the inspection coordinated? Is it an unannounced
inspection?
Normally, the inspector will provide the facility with advance notice of at least five
business days before an inspection. The inspector will generally work with the
facility in scheduling the inspection to minimize any inconvenience to the facility.
(See 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(4)).

4.

How long do inspections last?
Based on national data, the average on-site inspection of a facility with a single
mammography unit could take between five and six hours. During a typical
inspection, the inspector ordinarily observes the technologist take a phantom image
and will score the phantom image either at the acquisition workstation or at the
radiologist review workstation. To help minimize disruption to the facility's
activities, as well as to reduce the inspection time, FDA recommends that the facility
organize and consolidate all records the inspector will need and have them readily
available on the day of the inspection. While not intended to disrupt facility
personnel from conducting their usual duties during the inspection, such personnel
should be available if the inspector has questions or needs assistance.

5.

How are inspection results communicated to the facility?
After the MQSA inspection, inspectors will generally meet with representatives of
the facility to discuss the inspection and any noncompliance(s) that was observed, as
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
well as timeframes to submit any pending documentation and/or corrective action.
FDA recommends that the lead interpreting physician, inspection contact, quality
control technologist, radiology manager, and if possible, the facility’s designated
most responsible individual attend the closeout discussion, which could take
approximately 15-20 minutes. Typically, the inspector will provide the facility with
a copy of an inspection closeout document, “Important Information About Your
MQSA Inspection,” and discuss how the facility would like to receive the PostInspection Report (e.g., e-mail, postal mail).

6.

What information is contained in the Post-Inspection Report?
The Post-Inspection Report (PIR) identifies the key facility contacts for the facility’s
mammography program, identifies the mammography units in use at the facility,
documents the phantom image score obtained by the inspector for each
mammography unit, provides the inspector’s inspection observations identified by
the level of noncompliance and any relevant inspector remarks intended to assist the
facility in addressing corrective actions for adverse inspection observations. Adverse
inspection observations are generally placed into a category level based on the
FDA’s assessment of how the observation may affect the quality of mammography.
The category level is also used to determine how the facility should respond to the
observation. Identical observations found during two consecutive inspections are
identified as repeats.
The two6 possible levels of noncompliance resulting from an MQSA inspection are:
·

·

7.

Level 1: Indicates that the inspector found one or more deviations from key
MQSA requirements that may compromise the quality of mammography
performed at the facility. Level 1 noncompliances are the most severe findings.
Level 2: Indicates that the facility meets key MQSA requirements, however the
inspector found that the facility failed to meet one or more significant
mammography quality items. The PIR is provided to the facility. The inspector
will generally aim to send the final inspection report within five business days
of the date of the on-site inspection (or within five business days of receipt of
any pending documentation submitted by the facility to the inspector to resolve
pending inspection items).

How should a facility address inspectional observations?
Facilities should address any noncompliance noted on the PIR, including any
inspectional observations noted in printable remarks, in its written response to the
FDA compliance officer. If the facility’s response to the inspection’s observations
appears adequate, FDA may decide that no further action is needed and will notify
the facility that the matter is closed.

6

FDA has previously described three possible levels of noncompliance (see, e.g., “MQSA Inspection Procedures”);
however, FDA generally classifies observations into one of two levels (see, e.g., FDA website, “Follow Up for Inspection
Violations”).

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If the facility’s written response to the inspection observations is not sufficient or the
facility fails to respond, FDA may need to re-inspect the facility to verify that it has
corrected all of the problems. The current cost of this inspection may be found on
FDA’s website. FDA may also decide to issue a Warning Letter, and/or take other
regulatory action, such as requiring an Additional Mammography Review (AMR),
imposing sanctions such as a Directed Plan of Correction or Civil Money Penalties,
or ordering Suspension or Revocation of an MQSA certificate. (42 U.S.C. 263b(h)
and (i)).
Repeat Level 2 observations associated with the Enhancing Quality Using the
Inspection Program (EQUIP) initiative may result in the facility undergoing an
AMR performed by the facility’s AB. Additionally, based on observations identified
during an inspection, a facility may undergo an AMR when FDA or SAC has reason
to believe that mammography quality has been compromised and may present a
serious/significant risk to human health, regardless of whether a facility has taken
corrective action(s) and submitted its response to FDA. (42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(4)).

8.

Will the State regulatory agency or the FDA inspect the facility?
FDA contracts with State regulatory agencies and trains their personnel to conduct
MQSA inspections. (42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1)(D)). If a State is not under contract to
conduct MQSA inspections on behalf of FDA, then FDA inspectors perform the
inspections. Veterans Affairs facilities are outside the scope of the MQSA but are
inspected by FDA employees through an Inter-Agency Agreement (IAA) with
FDA.7 Mammography facilities located on U.S. military facilities or within federal
agencies are inspected by FDA employees.8

9.

Will a new MQSA certificate be issued to a facility after its annual inspection?
No. Following the initial MQSA certification, the issued certificate is effective for
up to three years. The effective dates start from the time of initial issuance of the
certificate as opposed to the time of inspection. Facilities that wish to continue to
lawfully provide mammography services must be reaccredited and obtain renewed
MQSA certification before the current MQSA certificate expires. (42 U.S.C.
263b(c)(1); 21 CFR 900.11).

10.

What are the fees for annual inspections?
The current FDA MQSA inspection fees can be found at
https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/inspectionresources/mammography-facility-inspection-fees. Facilities in certifying States
should contact their SAC to determine the fees that apply to them. The current FDA
portion of the fee for facilities within States that have an SAC can be found at
https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/inspectionresources/mammography-facility-inspection-fees. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(r)(1)(A)).

11.

How will we receive our bill for the inspection?
The MQSA User Fee Program sends inspection fee invoices via email to
mammography facilities after their annual inspection. MQSA inspectors will
generally collect each facility’s billing contact information, which includes the
billing contact’s name and email address, during each annual inspection. Facilities
with inspection fee or billing questions can e-mail the MQSA User Fee program at
MQSAUserFeeSupport@fda.hhs.gov.

12.

Can the inspection fee be waived?
Yes, if your facility is deemed a governmental entity (GE). A governmental entity is
a mammography facility subject to inspection under section 354(g)(1) of the PHS
Act, 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1) when it meets either of the following criteria, as identified
by FDA in the Federal Register Notice of July 6, 2007 (72 FR 37027), consistent
with 42 U.S.C. 263b(r)(1)(A):
(1) The facility is operated by any federal department, State, district, territory,
possession, federally recognized Indian tribe, city, county, town, village, municipal
corporation or similar political organization or subpart thereof. The entire salary of
all on-site personnel of the mammography facility must be directly paid by a
particular form of government as listed above. All the facility’s mammography
equipment must be owned, rented by, or leased by a particular form of government
as listed above. The facility’s ultimate authority to make day-to-day decisions
concerning the management and operation of the mammography facility must come
from a particular form of government as listed above. All these requirements must
be met in order for a facility to be considered a governmental entity. The particular
form of government also must be listed on the Governmental Entity Declaration
form (FDA Form 3422) in the space provided. FDA does not recognize a facility
providing Medicare/Medicaid services without meeting the governmental entity
criteria described above; or
(2) The facility provides services under the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) grant supporting the Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality
Prevention Act of 1990 and at least 50% of the mammography screening
examinations provided during the preceding 12 months were funded under that
statute. The FDA does not recognize other breast cancer or mammography
programs/grants under the governmental entity exemption.
Following the closure of the FDA MQSA inspection, the FDA issues an invoice and
includes the GE Declaration form mentioned above (FDA Form 3422). If your
facility fulfills the GE criteria, you can complete the form and should return within
30 days of receipt of your MQSA inspectional invoice to the following email
address: MQSAUserFeeSupport@fda.hhs.gov.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If the FDA determines your facility is a governmental entity, additional fee
statements concerning the inspection will not be sent. If you continue to receive fee
statements, however, you should contact the MQSA Hotline to discuss the status of
your claim.
Facilities claiming governmental entity status should submit a governmental entity
form each year. The FDA conducts a Governmental Entity Audit periodically. Your
facility could be selected as part of an audit sample. If your facility is selected to
participate in the audit, your facility could be notified and asked to provide
additional information substantiating your GE claim. Additional information can be
found on FDA’s website at page titled Mammography Facility Inspection Fees.

E.

GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES OF A FACILITY TO
PATIENTS
1.

What mammogram results will a facility be required to communicate to
patients as of September 10, 2024? When must this be done?
A mammography facility must provide each patient with a written summary of the
results of the exam. The summary must be in lay terms or words a patient can easily
understand. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)). As of September 10, 2024, the summary must
include, at a minimum, the name of the patient, the name, address, and telephone
number of the facility performing the mammographic exam, an overall final
assessment of the findings, an overall assessment of the patient’s breast tissue
density, additional information regarding breast density based on the assessment,
and any recommendations made to the healthcare provider (if needed). (21 CFR
900.12(c)(2)). This summary can be handed to the patient at the time of the exam,
mailed, or be provided by electronic means (e.g., patient portal, e-mail), and must be
sent to the patient within 30 calendar days after the exam. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)).
However, if the assessment of the mammography report is “Suspicious” or “Highly
Suggestive of Malignancy,” the summary must be provided within 7 calendar days
of the final interpretation of the exam. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2) & (c)(2)(i)). The
patient’s doctor or healthcare provider must be sent the more technical report of the
exam results (see 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1) and 900.12(c)(3)) unless the patient does not
name a healthcare provider to receive the report. In that case, the report must be sent
to the patient. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(i)).

2.

Are facilities required to send reminder notices to patients to schedule their
routine screening or diagnostic/follow-up imaging?
No. Facilities are required to provide each patient with a written summary of the
mammography report written in lay terms for every mammography exam
performed. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)). There is no MQSA requirement that reminder
notices be provided to patients for routine screening or diagnostic/follow-up
imaging.
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

3.

What are the facility’s updated responsibilities to patients who do not have a
healthcare provider as of September 10, 2024?
A mammography facility must provide a patient with a summary of the results
written in lay language regardless of whether the patient names a healthcare provider
to receive the more technical mammography report. For patients who do not name a
healthcare provider to receive the mammography report, the patient must be sent the
more technical mammography report within 30 days of the exam. If the assessment
of the mammography report is “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,”
the facility must send the mammography report and lay summary to the patient
within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the exam. Facilities must have a
system for referring such patients to a healthcare provider when clinically indicated,
including when the assessment is either “Probably Benign,” “Suspicious,” or
“Highly Suggestive of Malignancy.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii)).

4.

Must a facility provide the patient with a written lay summary even if the
results are incomplete and additional imaging is needed?
Yes. Even if the facility verbally transmits the results to the patient, and those results
are incomplete and additional imaging is needed, the facility must provide, within 30
calendar days of the examination, a written lay summary of the mammography
report, which should indicate that additional imaging is needed.
If the results of the follow-up examination are available within 30 calendar days of
the initial examination, the facility might combine the results into one lay summary
(rather than providing two lay summaries). If one combined lay summary is
provided, it should indicate that it refers to both the initial and the follow-up
examinations. If the results of the follow-up examination are not available within 30
calendar days of the initial examination, the facility must provide two lay
summaries, one for the initial examination and one for the follow-up. Each must be
provided within 30 calendar days of the examination it covers. (21 CFR
900.12(c)(2)).

5.

Are there updated special considerations for reporting results to patients when
the assessment of the mammography report is “Suspicious” or “Highly
Suggestive of Malignancy”?
Yes. As of September 10, 2024, in these cases, the facility must provide the written
lay summary to the patient within seven calendar days after the mammogram is
interpreted. If the patient does not have a referring provider, the facility must also
provide the patient with the more technical report to the patient within seven
calendar days after the mammogram is interpreted. Even if the results are given to
the patient verbally, where the assessment is “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive of
Malignancy,” the facility must send the patient the written lay summary within
seven calendar days of the interpretation. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)).

6.

What is the difference between self-referred and self-requesting patients, and
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
how will this affect what types of reports these patients receive?
For purposes of this document, self-referred patients are those who come for
mammography, but have no healthcare provider, or who decline a healthcare
provider, or for whom the provider declines responsibility. Facilities must provide
such patients with the written mammography report, in addition to a summary of the
report written in lay terms. This would enable self-referred patients to give their new
provider their latest mammogram results when they acquire a healthcare provider.
Effective September 10, 2024, facilities must have a system for referring such
patients to a healthcare provider when clinically indicated, including when the
assessment is either “Probably Benign,” “Suspicious,” or “Highly Suggestive of
Malignancy.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(i)).
For purposes of this document, self-requesting patients are those who come for
mammography on their own initiative but can name a healthcare provider (or accept
a healthcare provider offered by the facility) who accepts responsibility for that
patient’s clinical breast care. Such patients must be provided the same
communication of results as referred patients. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(i) & (ii)).

7.

What are a facility’s responsibilities to patients who request their “original”
mammographic images as of the effective date of the 2023 MQSA Rule?
Effective September 10, 2024, facilities are required to maintain the original
mammograms and mammography reports in a permanent medical record of the
patient for the longest of the following: a period of not less than 5 years, a period of
not less than 10 years if no additional mammograms of the patient are performed at
the facility, or a period, if any, mandated by State or local law. The originals must be
able to be retrieved in the same form of mammographic modality in which they were
initially produced. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(i)).
Original mammograms were especially important when the mammogram was
performed using screen-film technology. Today, however, almost all mammograms
are performed using digital technologies (Full-Field Digital Mammography (FFDM)
and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT)), not screen-film. For these digital
technologies, identical copies can be provided, while the original images are kept by
the performing facility, so digital originals are usually not transferred.
If patients request original screen-film mammograms, they can ask -- or have
someone else ask -- the facility for their original mammograms and a copy of the
medical report. Upon such request, the facility must transfer the mammograms and
mammogram reports within 15 calendar days of receiving the request. They can ask
the facility to send the original mammograms either temporarily or permanently to
another medical facility, to their doctor, or to the patient. The facility may ask the
patient to fill out a form to release the medical records. If the facility charges a fee
for this service, the fee must not be more than it costs them (i.e., the documented
costs) to provide this service. (See 21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(ii), (iii), & (iv)).
For example, patients who had a screen-film mammogram may request their original
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
mammogram if they:
· change mammography facilities,
· make an appointment for a second mammographic opinion,
· make an appointment for a stereotactic breast biopsy,
· make an appointment with a surgeon, oncologist, or radiation therapist, or
· need earlier mammograms to compare with current ones.

8.

What are appropriate charges for the transfer of mammography records, and
can the facility charge the cost of making copies of the images to the patient?
Appropriate charges for the transfer of mammography records could include: 1)
administrative costs incurred in logging in the request, 2) retrieving the appropriate
images and reports, 3) having the patient sign a release (if not already done), 4)
packaging and mailing charges for the materials, 5) and photocopying costs incurred
in making copies of the report(s).
When transferring original screen-film mammograms, facilities may, but are not
required to, make copies of the mammography films. If these copies are requested
by the patient or are mandated by State or local law, then the cost of making the
copies can be charged to the patient. If the facility elects to keep copies for other
reasons, the cost should not be charged to the patient.
Facilities must not charge patients a fee exceeding the documented costs associated
with this service. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(iv)).

9.

What is a facility’s responsibility to address patient complaints?
Under the MQSA regulations, all facilities are required to establish a written and
documented system for collecting and resolving consumer complaints. (21 CFR
900.12(h)(1)). The regulations also require the facility to give consumers with
serious unresolved complaints directions for filing such complaints with the
facility’s AB. (21 CFR 900.12(h)(3)). Examples of serious complaints that fall under
MQSA regulations include the following: the use of unqualified personnel, and
failure to send mammography reports or patient lay summaries within 30 days. (See
21 CFR 900.2(c)(2) & (3)). Facilities must report unresolved serious complaints to
the AB in a manner and timeframe specified by the AB. (21 CFR 900.12(h)(4)).

F.

BREAST DENSITY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
1.

What are the requirements for mammography reports and lay summaries?
In addition to the information required to be included in mammography reports to
referring healthcare providers and lay summaries to patients under the MQSA
regulations prior to September 10, 2024, the 2023 MQSA Rule (effective September
10, 2024) requires facilities to include the facility name and location (at a minimum,
16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the city, State, ZIP code, and telephone number) on mammography reports (21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(ii)); and the facility name, address, and telephone number on patient
lay summaries. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)).
There is a new Federal breast density notification requirement as of September 10,
2024, independent of any applicable State or local requirements. The FDA requires
that the specific breast density assessments and notification statements below be
included in every report to the referring healthcare provider and every lay summary
to the patient, respectively. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(vi), (2)(iii), and (2)(iv)).
Mammography Report to Referring Healthcare Providers or Patients Without
a Named Healthcare Provider
The mammography report must include an overall assessment of breast density,
classified in one of the following categories:
·
·
·
·

“The breasts are almost entirely fatty.”
“There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.”
“The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses.”
“The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of
mammography.”
(21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(vi)).
Lay Summary to Patients
If the mammography report identifies the patient’s breast density as “The breasts are
almost entirely fatty” or “There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density,” the
lay summary must include the statement, “Breast tissue can be either dense or not
dense. Dense tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also
raises the risk of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is not dense. Talk to
your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your
individual situation.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(iii)).
If the mammography report identifies the breast density as “The breasts are
heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses” or “The breasts are
extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography,” the lay summary
must include the statement, “Breast tissue can be either dense or not dense. Dense
tissue makes it harder to find breast cancer on a mammogram and also raises the risk
of developing breast cancer. Your breast tissue is dense. In some people with dense
tissue, other imaging tests in addition to a mammogram may help find cancers. Talk
to your healthcare provider about breast density, risks for breast cancer, and your
individual situation.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)(iv)).
The required breast density notification language in the 2023 MQSA Rule (effective
September 10, 2024) is intended to provide a uniform density notification for all
patients nationwide to receive a baseline, consistent set of key density
information. The 2023 MQSA Rule does not prohibit facilities from providing
patients with additional information, including information that may be required by
any applicable State breast density reporting requirements. However, any additional
information given to patients should be separate and distinct from the required
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Federal breast density notification statements.

2.

Do the mammography reports need to include the ACR BI-RADS breast
density letter category along with the overall breast density assessment?
No. The breast density letter categories used by ACR are not required to be included
in the mammography report. (See 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)). The MQSA regulations do
not prohibit facilities from adding a letter category for breast tissue density, although
the letter category alone will not satisfy the FDA reporting or notification
requirements. One of the specific Federal breast density assessments must be
included in the mammography report to the referring healthcare provider.

3.

Can additional information be added to the patient lay summary, such as the
patient’s specific breast density category? For example, can we edit the Federal
language from “Your breast tissue is dense” to “Your breast tissue is extremely
dense”?
One of the Federal breast density notification statements must be included in the lay
summary as described in 21 CFR 900.12(c)(iii) and (iv). The MQSA regulations do
not prohibit facilities and practitioners from providing additional information to
patients. However, any additional information given to patients should generally be
separate and distinct from the required Federal breast density notification statement
to help to ensure that patients receive consistent baseline breast density information
in easily understandable language.

4.

Must the breast density assessment appear on the mammography report, and
the breast density notification statement appear on the lay summary, for both
screening and diagnostic mammograms?
Yes, as of the effective date of September 10, 2024. The current (and amended)
MQSA regulations require that facilities send a medical report and patient lay
summary for each mammographic examination performed under its certificate; there
is no differentiation between screening and diagnostic mammograms. (See 21 CFR
900.2(aa) and 900.12(c)).

5.

Must the breast density assessment appear on mammography reports, and the
breast density notification statement appear on lay summaries, for both male
and female patients?
Yes. Prior to and following the updated MQSA regulations, a patient continues to be
defined as “any individual who undergoes a mammography evaluation in a
facility…”, and therefore the breast density assessment and notification statement
requirements apply to mammograms performed on patients of any sex. (21 CFR
900.2(ii); 21 CFR 900.2(ii); 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(vi) and (2)(iii)-(iv)).

6.

Must the breast density assessment appear on mammography reports, and the
18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
breast density notification statement appear on lay summaries, for both
unilateral and bilateral mammograms?
Yes. As of the effective date of September 10, 2024, the amended MQSA
regulations require that facilities include a breast density assessment in the
mammography report, and a breast density notification statement in the patient lay
summary, for each mammographic examination performed under its certificate;
there is no differentiation between unilateral and bilateral mammograms. (21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(vi) and (c)(2)(iii)-(iv)).

7.

Can the breast density assessment be edited for unilateral mammograms? For
example, can we edit the Federal language from “The breasts are almost entirely
fatty” to “The breast is almost entirely fatty”?
One of the breast density assessments in 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(vi) must be included
in the mammography report. The required density notification language is aimed at
providing patients nationwide consistent baseline breast density information in
easily understandable language.

8.

Can facilities send the breast density notification to patients as an attachment
to the lay summary?
While there is no specific format requirement for patient lay summaries, they are
required to include certain elements, including the name of the patient; the name,
address, and telephone number of the facility performing the mammographic
examination; and one of the two FDA required breast density notification
statements. All these required elements must appear within the same lay summary.
(21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)).

9.

Can a facility use software to assign a density category?
FDA acknowledges that there are various methods for the assessment of breast
density, which may include automated processes such as FDA-cleared density
assessment software devices used as an aid to physician interpretation. However, the
assessment of breast density is part of the interpretation of the mammogram, which
must be performed by a physician who meets the qualifications set forth in 21 CFR
900.12(a)(1).

G. MAMMOGRAPHY REPORT REQUIREMENTS
1.

What information must be included in the mammography report?
As of September 10, 2024, the mammography report must include the following
information: the name of the patient and an additional patient identifier; date of
examination; facility name, and location (at a minimum, the city, State, ZIP code,
and telephone number of the facility where the mammogram was performed); the
19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
name of the interpreting physician who interpreted the mammogram; overall final
assessment of findings, an overall assessment of breast density; and
recommendations to the healthcare provider about what additional actions, if any,
should be taken (all clinical questions raised by the referring healthcare provider
shall be addressed in the report to the extent possible, even if the assessment is
negative or benign). (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)).

2.

What are the categories that must be included in mammography reports for
final assessment of findings, once the amended regulations are effective?
As of September 10, 2024, an overall final assessment of findings must be classified
in one of the following categories: “Negative,” “Benign,” “Probably Benign,”
“Suspicious,” “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy,” “Known-Biopsy-Proven
Malignancy,” or “Post-Procedure Mammogram for Marker Placement.” (21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(iv)).
In cases where no final assessment category can be assigned due to incomplete
work-up, one of the following classification statements shall be assigned as an
assessment and reasons why no final assessment can be made shall be stated by the
interpreting physician: “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation” (reserved
for exams where additional imaging needs to be performed before an assessment
category can be given); or “Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison”
(reserved for examinations where comparison with prior mammograms should be
performed before an assessment category can be given). (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(v)).
If this latter assessment category is used, a follow up report with a final overall
assessment category must be issued within 30 calendar days of the initial report
whether or not comparison views can be obtained. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(v)(B)).

3.

Are facilities required to include the explanatory language on mammography
reports?
For each assessment category, the required assessment statement is only the word or
phrase in quotation marks (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(iv)). As in the regulations prior to
September 10, 2024, each assessment statement, identified in quotation marks, is
followed by explanatory language, which is not in quotation marks; this explanatory
language not in quotation marks is intended to provide an explanation of the
assessment category in order to promote its consistent use, but it is not part of the
assessment statement, and is not required to be included in the mammography report
to the referring healthcare provider.

4.

What changes were made in the explanatory language for the “Negative” and
“Benign” assessment categories under the amended regulations?
Prior to September 10, 2024, the explanatory language for the negative assessment
stated, “Nothing to comment upon (if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical
findings or symptoms, despite the negative assessment, these shall be explained);”
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
and for the benign assessment it stated, “Also a negative assessment.” (21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) & (B)).
As of September 10, 2024, the explanatory language for the negative assessment
states, “Nothing to comment upon (if the interpreting physician is aware of clinical
findings or symptoms, despite the negative assessment, these shall be documented
and addressed).” As of September 10, 2024, the explanatory language for the benign
assessment category states, “Also a normal result, with benign findings present, but
no evidence of malignancy (If the interpreting physician is aware of clinical findings
or symptoms, despite the benign assessment, these shall be documented and
addressed).” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) and (B)).

5.

What are FDA’s policies if a facility uses certain variations to the final
assessment category wording?
FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion regarding the final assessment
category wording where the variation in wording does not change the meaning of
the assessment category, and FDA intends to continue such a practice. For example,
FDA has considered the following statements to be close variants to the wording
listed in the regulations and has generally not objected to their use:
Negative
Negative Mammogram
Benign
Benign Finding, Benign Findings, Benign Abnormality, Benign Abnormalities,
Benign Mammogram
Probably Benign
Probably Benign Finding, Probably Benign Findings, Probably Benign Abnormality,
Probably Benign Abnormalities, Probably Benign - Short Interval Followup
Suggested, Probably Benign Finding - Short Interval Follow-up Suggested, Probably
Benign Mammogram
Suspicious
Suspicious Finding, Suspicious Findings, Suspicious Abnormality, Suspicious
Abnormalities, Suspicious for Malignancy, Suspicious of Malignancy, Suspicious
Abnormality - Biopsy Should Be Considered, Suspicious Finding - Biopsy Should
Be Considered, Suspicious Mammogram
Highly Suggestive of Malignancy
Highly Suggestive for Malignancy, Highly Suggestive of Malignancy - Appropriate
Action Should Be Taken
Incomplete: Need Additional Imaging Evaluation
Incomplete: Needs Additional Imaging Evaluation, Incomplete: Additional Imaging
Evaluation Needed, Need Additional Imaging Evaluation (the term “Incomplete”
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
can be inferred in this example), Incomplete Mammogram: Need Additional
Imaging Evaluation
Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison
Incomplete: Needs Prior Mammograms for Comparison, Incomplete: Comparison
with Prior Mammograms Needed, Need Prior Mammograms for Comparison (the
term “Incomplete” can be inferred in this example), Incomplete Mammogram: Need
Prior Mammogram for Comparison
Known Biopsy Proven Malignancy
Known Biopsy Proven Cancer, Known Malignancy, Known Cancer

6.

As of September 10, 2024, are there any special considerations for sending
mammography reports when examinations are assessed as “Incomplete: Need
prior mammograms for comparison”?
When the assessment category “Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for
comparison” is used, a follow-up report with an assessment category identified in 21
CFR 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) through (E) must be issued within 30 calendar days of the
initial report, whether or not comparison views can be obtained. (21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(v)(B)).

7.

Is there a new specific report format required?
There is no explicit requirement for the formatting of the mammography report.
There are multiple elements that must be included in the contents of the report (see
21 CFR 900.12(c)). As of September 10, 2024, these required elements include two
overall assessments – the overall assessment of the findings and the overall
assessment of breast density. Since these two elements refer to the examination
overall, and since they should also be readily verifiable by an MQSA inspector,
these assessments should each be placed in a way that is distinct and identifiable.

8.

What is the difference between the updated assessments “Incomplete: Need
additional imaging evaluation” and “Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for
comparison”?
Additional imaging may be necessary to evaluate an area of abnormality on the
mammogram, or an area of the breast that was not adequately or optimally
visualized, or an area where the patient has physical signs or symptoms concerning
breast cancer. In such circumstances, an assessment of “Incomplete: Need additional
imaging evaluation” may be appropriate. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(v)). As of
September 10, 2024, the amended regulations include the same assessment
“Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(v)(A)). If
an area of possible abnormality is visualized on the mammogram, but it is important
to determine whether this area is stable or has changed, then it may be necessary to
request prior mammograms for comparison, using the added assessment
“Incomplete: Need prior mammograms for comparison.” (21 CFR
22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
900.12(c)(1)(v)(B)).

9.

May our facility continue to use the combined assessment, “Incomplete: Need
additional imaging evaluation and/or prior mammograms for comparison”
after September 10, 2024?
The assessment statement “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation and/or
prior mammograms for comparison” does not appear in either the existing or the
amended MQSA regulations, but was approved on August 29, 2003, as part of
MQSA Alternative Standard #11, “Modifications in the Assessment Categories
Used in Medical Reports.” However, as provided in the Federal Register, FDA is
withdrawing Alternative Standard #11 upon the effective date of the final rule, after
which the assessment statement found in that standard may no longer be used.
Under the amended regulations, there are two Incomplete assessment statements,
“Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation” and “Incomplete: Need prior
mammograms for comparison.” These statements reflect FDA’s recognition that
some mammograms require comparison for interpretation, while some
mammograms require additional imaging to reach a final interpretation.
Additionally, the two Incomplete assessment categories have different reporting
requirements. When the assessment category “Incomplete: Need prior mammograms
for comparison” is used, a follow-up report to the mammographic examination with
an assessment category identified in 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(iv)(A) through (E)
[“Negative,” “Benign,” “Probably Benign,” “Suspicious,” or “Highly Suggestive of
Malignancy,”] must be issued within 30 calendar days of the initial report whether
or not comparison views can be obtained. Whereas the assessment category
“Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation” does not require a follow-up
report to the mammographic examination be issued within a specified time frame.
Therefore, facilities must use the two separate Incomplete assessment categories, as
applicable, after the September 10, 2024, effective date of the 2023 MQSA Rule.
(21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(v)).

10.

What are the new deadlines for sending mammography reports to referring
healthcare providers?
Prior to and after September 10, 2024, the effective date of the 2023 MQSA Rule,
facilities must provide a written mammography report of the mammography
examination to the patient’s referring healthcare provider as soon as possible, but no
later than 30 days from the date of the mammography examination. (21 CFR
900.12(c)(3)(i)).
As of September 10, 2024, if the assessment is “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive
of Malignancy,” the facility must provide a written mammography report of the
mammographic examination to the referring healthcare provider, or if the referring
healthcare provider is unavailable, to a responsible designee of the referring
healthcare provider, within 7 calendar days of the final interpretation of the
23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
mammograms. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(3)(ii)).

11.

Is it necessary to include an assessment number or letter code, in addition to
the overall final assessment category, on mammography reports?
No. There is no requirement that any assessment number or letter code be included
on the mammography report, nor is it prohibited.

12.

What facility name/location must appear on the mammography report to the
healthcare provider and lay summary to the patient for large healthcare
networks with multiple certified MQSA facilities? What about mobile units
that travel to different locations?
The facility identification information in the mammography report to the healthcare
provider and the lay summary sent to the patient must be unique to the actual facility
where the mammogram was performed and must include the name under which the
facility is accredited and certified. The FDA distinguishes each mammography
facility based on its physical location. Healthcare networks that offer mammography
services at several locations are required to apply for accreditation and certification
of each of those locations as a separate facility. The name recognized by FDA for a
facility is the name under which the facility is accredited by its AB. Similarly, for
mammograms performed on a mobile unit that travels to different locations, the
facility identification information in the mammography report to the referring
healthcare provider and the lay summary sent to the patient must include the name
under which the facility is accredited and certified. (See 21 CFR 900.2(q),
900.11(b), 900.12(c)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)).
The mammography report to the healthcare provider must include the facility name
and location. At a minimum, the location shall include the city, State, ZIP code, and
telephone number of the facility (see 21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(ii)). The lay summary to
the patient must include the name, address, and telephone number of the facility
performing the mammographic examination (see 21 CFR 900.12(c)(2)). Sometimes,
a facility chooses to include additional information about a healthcare network or
affiliated site on its medical reports and lay summaries.

13.

If a facility performs a mammogram following a biopsy to confirm the
deployment and position of a breast tissue marker, is the facility required to
issue a mammography report to the referring healthcare provider, or lay
summary to the patient?
Yes, where the post-procedure mammogram is a separately logged examination
(rather than part of the interventional procedure), the mammogram is subject to all
MQSA quality standard requirements, including a report to the referring healthcare
provider and a summary of the report in lay language to the patient. (See 21 CFR
900.12(c)(1)(iv)(G)). The lay summary must be specific to the examination and
report. For example, if the assessment statement in the report states that an
examination was a post-procedure mammogram for marker placement, then the lay
24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
summary of that report should likewise mention the procedure or the marker
placement; however, it would not be appropriate to state that the mammogram
results were abnormal, worrisome, suspicious for cancer, etc., so as not to
misconstrue the assessment as a new or additional abnormality. If a facility makes
the post-procedure examination part of the interventional procedure instead of a
separately logged examination, then the examination is not subject to the MQSA
quality standard requirement and need not receive an assessment or any report
separate from the report of the interventional procedure.

14.

Can facilities use one of the following three subcategories (derived from ACR’s
Breast Imaging—Reporting and Data System (BI–RADS)) for a category 4
“Suspicious” assessment as the overall assessment in its mammography
reports: 4A – Low Suspicion for Malignancy, 4B- Intermediate Suspicious for
Malignancy, or 4C- Moderate Concern but not Classic for Malignancy?
While the facility has the option of using one of the three BI-RADS subcategories of
category 4, “Suspicious”, in addition to a final assessment category, as identified in
21 CFR 900.12(c)(1)(iv), the BI-RADS subcategories are not a replacement for a
required final assessment category, such as “Suspicious,” in the mammography
report.

H. MEDICAL OUTCOMES AUDIT
1.

Under the amended regulations, what items need to be included in the medical
outcomes audit?
Facilities are required to establish a system to collect and review outcome data for
all mammographic examinations performed, including followup on the disposition
of all positive mammograms (those with an assessment of Suspicious or Highly
Suggestive of Malignancy9), as well as any cases of breast cancer among patients
imaged at the facility that subsequently become known to the facility. In this audit,
facilities must correlate the pathology results with the mammography report, and as
of September 10, 2024, at a minimum, three metrics must be included in the medical
outcomes audit: the positive predictive value, cancer detection rate, and recall rate.
(21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)).

2.

Will facilities be required to include both screening and diagnostic
mammograms in the medical outcomes audit under the amended regulations?
Yes. For the purposes of the audit requirements, a mammographic examination
consisting of routine views of an asymptomatic patient is termed a screening
mammogram, while a mammographic examination consisting of individualized

9

See 21 CFR 900.2(mm) (Positive mammogram means a mammogram that has an overall assessment of findings that are
either “suspicious” or “highly suggestive of malignancy”).

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
views of a patient with breast symptoms, physical signs of breast disease, or
abnormal findings on a screening mammogram is termed a diagnostic mammogram.
The medical outcomes audit requires facilities to collect and review outcome data
for all mammographic examinations performed. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)).

3.

Will facilities be required to include mammograms with the assessment
category, “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation” in the medical
outcomes audit under the amended regulations?
Yes. As of September 10, 2024, the calculation of two of the three metrics required
to be included in the medical outcomes audit – cancer detection rate and recall rate –
incorporates mammograms that received an assessment of “Incomplete: Need
additional imaging evaluation.” (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)(ii-iii)).

4.

Will facilities that do not have any positive mammography examinations (e.g.,
screening-only facilities) be required to perform a medical outcomes audit
under the amended regulations?
Yes. As of September 10, 2024, the outcomes audit must include, at a minimum, the
calculation of the following three metrics: positive predictive value, cancer detection
rate, and recall rate. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)). One of these metrics, the recall rate, is
calculated as the percentage of screening mammograms given an assessment of
“Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation,” and can be calculated even in the
absence of any positive mammograms. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)(iii)). Since the cancer
detection rate depends in part on the subsequent diagnoses of cancer in patients
whose mammograms were initially classified as “Incomplete: Need additional
imaging evaluation” (see 21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)(ii)), a facility that classifies some
mammograms as “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation” should have a
system in place to obtain, or attempt to obtain, the subsequent pathology results for
those patients who received that assessment and subsequently underwent biopsy.
Facilities that have not had any positive examinations and have been unable to
obtain any pathology results should calculate the recall rate and provide written
documentation describing how the facility's medical audit system would: (1) followup on positive cases (and any cases of breast cancer among patients imaged at the
facility that subsequently became known to the facility), (2) correlate pathology
results with the interpreting physician's findings, and (3) perform the appropriate
analyses annually.

5.

Under the new requirements found in the amended regulations, how should the
minimum required metrics be calculated?
For positive predictive value (PPV), the minimum requirement is to calculate this
metric as the percent of patients with positive mammograms (those with an

26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
assessment of either “Suspicious” or “Highly Suggestive of Malignancy”10) who are
diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year of the date of the mammographic
examination. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)(i)). In addition to performing the calculation in
this required manner, some facilities also choose to use other methods for
calculating PPV.
For cancer detection rate (CDR), the minimum required calculation is a single
calculation for CDR for screening mammograms, which must be calculated as
follows: out of the patients initially examined with screening mammograms who
receive an assessment of “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation,”
“Suspicious,” or “Highly suggestive of malignancy” on the screening mammogram
or on a subsequent diagnostic mammogram, the number of patients who are
diagnosed with breast cancer within 1 year of the date of the initial screening
mammogram, expressed arithmetically as a ratio per 1,000 patients. (21 CFR
900.12(f)(1)(ii)). It can be noted that the PPV calculation requirement is essentially
equivalent to a CDR calculation for diagnostic mammograms.
For recall rate, this must be calculated as the percentage of screening mammograms
given an assessment of “Incomplete: Need additional imaging evaluation.” (21 CFR
900.12(f)(1)(iii)).

6.

Will the minimum required metrics for the medical outcomes audit need to be
calculated for each interpreting physician or collectively for all interpreting
physicians at a facility under the amended regulations?
The medical outcomes audit must include calculations of the minimum required
metrics for each individual interpreting physician and also collectively for all
interpreting physicians at a facility. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)).

7.

Will the specific results of the medical outcomes audit be recorded during the
annual MQSA inspection after the effective date of September 10, 2024?
During the annual MQSA inspection, the inspector will generally assess whether the
minimum required metrics have been performed for each interpreting physician and
collectively for all interpreting physicians at the facility during the time period for
which the inspector is evaluating the facility. It is not anticipated that the inspector
will document the specific numerical values for the metrics. If the inspection occurs
during the first 2 years of a facility’s operation, the inspector will generally verify
that the facility has established the required audit procedures and designated an audit
interpreting physician (i.e., an “audit IP”). (21 CFR 900.12(f)).

8.
10

Is a facility required to have a designated audit interpreting physician (IP)?

See 21 CFR 900.2(mm).

27

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Yes, a facility is required to have a designated audit interpreting physician (“audit
IP”), who is responsible for notifying each IP at the facility of their respective
individual audit results and of the facility’s aggregate audit results. The audit IP is
also responsible for documenting any follow-up actions taken. (21 CFR
900.12(f)(3)).

9.

Should mammograms that receive an overall assessment of “Post-Procedure
Mammogram for Marker Placement” or “Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy”
be included in the medical outcomes audit calculations required by the
amended regulations?
No, those mammograms should not be included in the calculations for the minimum
required metrics for the medical outcomes audit so as not to count the finding as a
new or additional abnormality. Only a mammogram that receives an overall
assessment of either “suspicious” or “highly suggestive of malignancy” is defined as
a positive mammogram subject to followup and correlation of pathology results. As
of September 10, 2024, the calculation of two of the three metrics required to be
included in the medical outcomes audit – cancer detection rate and recall rate – also
incorporates mammograms that received an assessment of “Incomplete: Need
additional imaging evaluation.” (21 CFR 900.12(f)(1)(ii) and (iii); 900.2(mm)).
However, the calculation of the required metrics does not involve mammograms that
receive an assessment of “post-procedure mammogram for marker placement” or
“known biopsy-proven malignancy.”

10.

How long should my facility keep the results of the medical outcomes audit
required by the amended regulations?
As of September 10, 2024, at a minimum, a facility is required to retain its medical
outcomes audit data until the MQSA annual inspection following the facility’s
analysis of that information, although the facility and the audit IP can choose a
longer retention period if preferred. (21 CFR 900.12(f)(4)).

11.

Does a medical outcomes audit that includes mammograms performed before
September 10, 2024, have to include the three metrics of positive predictive
value, cancer detection rate, and recall rate?
As of September 10, 2024, a facility must have designated an audit interpreting
physician (or “audit IP”), and must have established the required audit procedures,
including the procedures for calculating the three required metrics (i.e., PPV, CDR,
and recall rate). For an audit that includes some mammograms performed before the
effective date, the facility might choose to perform the calculations where the
necessary outcomes data are available. Alternatively, the facility might report one or
more of the three metrics (i.e., PPV, CDR, and recall rate) as “Not Applicable.” For
an audit that covers only mammograms performed on or after September 10, 2024,
all three metrics (i.e., PPV, CDR, and recall rate) must be calculated, as applicable
28

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(e.g., screening-only facilities or facilities with no positive exams might report some
metrics as “Not Applicable”). (21 CFR 900.12(f)).

I.

RECORDKEEPING/TRANSFER OF RECORDS
1.

As of September 10, 2024, how long must a facility maintain the original
mammograms and mammography reports?
Facilities must maintain the original mammograms and mammography reports in a
permanent medical record of the patient for the longest of the following: a period of
not less than 5 years, a period of not less than 10 years if no additional
mammograms of the patient are performed at the facility, or a period, if any,
mandated by State or local law. Effective September 10, 2024, facilities shall
implement policies and procedures to minimize the possibility of loss of these
records. FFDM and DBT mammographic images must be retained in their original
mammographic modality. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(i)).

2.

What are the facility’s updated responsibilities for providing patient records?
Upon request by, or on behalf of, the patient, the facility must provide copies of
mammograms and copies of mammography reports to a medical institution, a
physician or healthcare provider of the patient, or to the patient directly within 15
calendar days of the facility receiving such request. For digital mammograms or
DBT, if the copies are being released for final interpretation purposes, the facility
must be able to provide the recipient with digital images electronically. (21 CFR
900.12(c)(4)(iii)).

3.

Can facilities store or transfer digital mammographic images using lossy
compression as of the effective date of the regulations?
No. Images that have undergone lossy compression, which does not maintain all the
data related to the mammogram image files, would not be considered as being in
their “original mammographic modality.” (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)).

4.

Can digital images be stored with computer-aided detection (CAD) markings as
of the effective date of the regulations?
A facility can choose to retain a set of the images with permanent CAD marks, but
this set of images alone would not meet the retention requirement. The facility must
retain images that are capable of being displayed without the CAD marks as any
CAD markings placed by computer software after the mammographic images are
obtained typically overlie and obscure portions of the image. (See 21
900.12(c)(4)(i)).

29

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

5.

What is a facility’s responsibility as of September 10, 2024, when another
facility requests copies of mammograms on behalf of the patient for
comparison?
Facilities must provide a copy of the mammograms and mammography reports
within 15 calendar days of receiving the request. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(iii)).

6.

What methods can facilities use to transfer or release digital mammographic
images to another facility?
The technical methods of either transfer or release of digital images are not
prescribed by the 2023 MQSA Rule, and could include, but are not limited to, the
following: direct electronic transmission of digital mammogram files that is
arranged between two facilities utilizing Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)-compliant and appropriate practices for
privacy and data security; providing the requesting facility with HIPAA-compliant
remote electronic access to the images in the picture archiving and communication
system (PACS) of the originating facility; the viewing of digital mammogram
images located on a physical storage medium such as a CD; or the uploading of
such images from a digital storage medium to a receiving facility’s PACS.

7.

What are a facility’s responsibilities as of September 10, 2024, for patient
records and images when it closes or ceases to provide mammography services?
Effective September 10, 2024, before a facility closes or ceases to provide
mammography services, it must make arrangements for access by patients and
healthcare providers to their mammographic records. This access may be provided
by the permanent transfer of mammographic records to the patient or the patient’s
healthcare provider or the transfer of the mammographic records to a facility or
other entity that will provide access to patients and healthcare providers. Access to
the records must be provided by such other facility or entity for the remainder of the
required recordkeeping time periods. If a facility ceases to perform mammography
but continues to operate as a medical entity and is able to satisfy the recordkeeping
requirements, it may choose to continue to retain the medical records rather than
transfer them to another facility, unless such a transfer is requested by, or on behalf
of, the patient. The facility must notify its AB and certification agency in writing of
the arrangements it has made and must make reasonable efforts to notify all affected
patients. (21 CFR 900.12(c)(4)(v)).

J.

GENERAL PERSONNEL RECORD REQUIREMENTS
1.

What specific records must be maintained for personnel?
Facilities must maintain records of training and experience relevant to their
qualification under MQSA for personnel who work or have worked at the facility as
30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
interpreting physicians, radiologic technologists, or medical physicists. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(4)).

2.

How long must a facility maintain personnel records for interpreting
physicians, radiologic technologists, and medical physicists that are no longer
employed by the facility?
A facility must maintain records of personnel no longer employed by the facility. As
of September 10, 2024, the facility must also make these records available for
inspection for no less than 24 months from the date an employee departs the facility.
If current interpreting physicians, radiologic technologists, and medical physicists
request such records, the facility must provide copies. Facilities must also provide
personnel records to former employees if the former employees request their records
within 24 months of the date of their departure. If it has been more than 24 months
since the employee departed the facility, and the facility has maintained those
records, the facility must provide those records to former employees upon request.
Before a facility closes or ceases to provide mammography services, it must make
arrangements to give current and former personnel access to their MQSA personnel
records. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(4)).

3.

What is a facility’s responsibility to interpreting physicians, radiologic
technologists, and medical physicists who request their personnel records?
Facilities must provide copies of personnel records to current interpreting
physicians, radiologic technologists, and medical physicists upon their request.
Facilities must provide personnel records to former employees if the former
employees communicate their request within 24 months of the date of their
departure or if it has been more than 24 months and the facility has maintained those
records. Additionally, before a facility closes or ceases to provide mammography
services, it must make arrangements for access by current and former personnel to
their MQSA personnel records. This access may be provided by the permanent
transfer of these records to the personnel or to a facility or other entity that will
provide access to these records for no less than 24 months from the date of facility
closure or cessation of mammography services. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(4)).

4.

Are there consequences if a facility refuses to provide copies of personnel
records upon request of a current or former employee?
FDA (or the SAC for that facility) may take action as appropriate, including but not
limited to, suspension or revocation of the facility's mammography certificate when
a facility fails to comply with requests of current or former facility personnel for
records of their training or experience relevant to their qualification under the
MQSA. (21 CFR 900.14(a)(7)).

K. INTERPRETING PHYSICIAN REQUIREMENTS
31

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

1.

What are the qualifications an interpreting physician must meet under the
MQSA regulations in order to independently interpret mammograms?
Prior to independently interpreting mammograms, an interpreting physician must
complete all of the following requirements:
· Have a valid State license to practice medicine (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(i)(A));
· Be Board Certified in an appropriate specialty area by a body11 determined by
FDA to have adequate procedures and requirements for interpreting
radiological procedures, or have 3 months of documented formal training in the
interpretation of mammograms, which must be under the direct supervision of a
physician who already meets the MQSA requirements to be an interpreting
physician, and in topics related to mammography to include instruction in
radiation physics specific to mammography, radiation effects, and radiation
protection (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(i)(B));
· Complete a minimum of 60 hours of documented medical education in
mammography, which shall include instruction in the interpretation of
mammograms and education in basic breast anatomy, pathology, physiology,
technical aspects of mammography, and quality assurance and quality control
in mammography. All 60 of these hours shall be category I with at least 15
obtained in the 3 years immediately prior to qualifying as an interpreting
physician. Hours that are specifically devoted to mammography spent in a
residency program accredited by a body12 determined by FDA to have adequate
procedures and requirements to accredit graduate medical education programs
are generally considered as equivalent to category I continuing medical
education credits and will generally be accepted where documented in writing
by the appropriate representative of the training institution (21 CFR
900.12(a)(1)(i)(C)); and
· Have interpreted or multi-read 240 mammographic examinations under direct
supervision of an interpreting physician in the 6 months immediately prior to
qualifying as an interpreting physician OR if the physician becomes
appropriately board certified in diagnostic radiology at the first allowable time
(as defined by an eligible certifying body), the 6-month period could have been
anytime in the last two years of the diagnostic radiology residency program (21
CFR 900.12(a)(1)(i)(D), 21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(iii)(B)).
Before an interpreting physician may begin independently interpreting
mammograms produced by a new mammographic modality, interpreting physicians
must also have 8 hours of training in the mammographic modality in which the
physician has not previously been trained. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(C)).
Mammographic modality means a technology, within the scope of 42 U.S.C. 263b,
for radiography of the breast. Examples are screen-film mammography, FFDM, and

11

The FDA has determined that the following organizations are bodies with adequate procedures and requirements to
ensure that the interpreting physicians they certify with specialties in radiology and diagnostic radiology are competent to
interpret radiological procedure, including mammography: American Board of Radiology (ABR), American Osteopathic
Board of Radiology (AOBR), Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC).
12
The FDA has determined that the following organizations are bodies with adequate procedures and requirements to
accredit graduate medical education programs: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)
American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and Canadian Residency Accreditation Consortium (CanRAC).

32

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
DBT.13 Interpreting physicians who completed their initial training on a certain
modality are not required to complete or document an additional 8 hours of training
on that modality.
After meeting all the initial requirements, interpreting physicians must:
·
·

2.

Maintain continuing education (15 category I continuing medical education
(CME) hours/36 months14) (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(B)); and
Maintain continuing experience (interpreted or multi-read at least 960
examinations/24months) (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(A)).

Where can I find a template of a residency letter?
A template of a residency letter can be found at the following link:
https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/inspection-resources/preparinginspection.

3.

Can category 1 CME hours/credits in breast ultrasound or breast MRI be used
to meet the continuing education requirement for interpreting physicians?
Yes. All Category 1 CME hours/credits related to the diagnosis or treatment of
breast disease, or to other areas that aid facility personnel in improving the quality of
mammography, should qualify for credit toward the continuing education
requirement (see 21 CFR 900.2(l), (m), and (n); 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(B)).

4.

Can the American Board of Radiology (ABR) examination be used to meet the
continuing education requirement for interpreting physicians?
No. The ABR does not award Category I continuing medical education units for
passing the ABR initial certification or recertification exam. To find out about
receiving continuing medical education, the physician can contact an organization
that grants Category 1 CME units to inquire whether the organization will grant
Category 1 CME units specific to mammography. Mammography personnel might
get a letter, certificate, or other documentation from the authorized organization
stating how many and what type of CME units were awarded and the date the credit

13

See 21 CFR 900.2(z).
In light of recommendations from the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee and the Institute
of Medicine stating that the general requirement of obtaining 15 hours of continuing education in mammography every
three years provides adequate assurance that personnel receive appropriate updated information about all mammographic
modalities in a timely fashion, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion regarding the CME credits required
for each specific modality used by the interpreting physician in his or her practice, and intends to continue such a practice
(see 21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(B) (“This training shall include at least six category I continuing medical education credits in
each mammographic modality used by the interpreting physician in his or her practice”)). For example, FDA generally
still intends to not object to an interpreting physician who does not document six category I CME credits in screen-film
mammography as part of the 15 general mammography CME credits where the facility uses only that one type of
mammographic modality.

was given.

5.

What are the consequences of an interpreting physician failing to meet the
continuing experience requirement?
If during an inspection, the inspector determines that an interpreting physician has
failed to meet the continuing experience requirement (e.g., interpreting at least 960
mammography exams in the previous 24 months), including that the physician has
not started reestablishing the qualification process before the inspection, the
inspector could make that observation in the inspection report (see 42 U.S.C.
263b(g)(1)(A) & (C); 21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(iv)).
The interpreting physician may not interpret mammograms independently until the
interpreting physician re-qualifies to do so. The interpreting physician can re-qualify
by interpreting under direct supervision, within a 6-month period, either 240
mammograms or the balance needed to bring the total to 960, whichever is less (see
21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(iv)(A)).
When a facility is inspected within the 6-month period following the date the
interpreting physician last re-qualified, FDA generally does not intend to object if
the re-qualified interpreting physician has not interpreted 960 mammogram exams in
the previous 24 months. This may help facilitate the interpreting physician having
sufficient time to complete the required continuing experience by the end of this 6month timeframe. (See 21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(iv)(A)).
Note that FDA or an SAC can take action against a facility where the training and
qualification requirements under 21 CFR 900.12(a) have not been met, including
seeking civil money penalties, or suspension or revocation of the facility’s MQSA
certificate. (42 U.S.C. 263b(h)(3); 21 CFR 900.14(a)(2)).

6.

What is required for an interpreting physician who completed the initial
qualification requirements in the past, has not worked in the field of
mammography for an extended period, but would now like to independently
interpret mammography exams?
The interpreting physician must:
·

·
·

Document that the physician has met the initial training and experience
requirements to be an interpreting physician (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(i)(B),
(C), and (D)),
Document that the physician holds a valid State license to practice medicine
(21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(i)(A)), and
Complete 15 continuing medical education units in mammography in the
previous 36 months (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(B) and (a)(1)(iv)(B)).

If the interpreting physician has not interpreted at least 960 mammographic exams in
the previous 24 months (see 21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(ii)(A)), the interpreting physician
34

900.12(a)(1)(iv)(A)(1)), or
A sufficient number of mammographic exams to bring the total up to 960 for
the prior 24 months, whichever is less (21 CFR 900.12(a)(1)(iv)(A)(2)).

Additionally, if the interpreting physician will be using a mammographic modality
other than one for which the physician was initially trained, the interpreting
physician must complete at least 8 hours of training in the new modality. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(1)(ii)(C)).

7.

What does direct supervision of an interpreting physician mean?
Direct supervision of an interpreting physician means that during joint interpretation
of mammograms, the supervising interpreting physician reviews, discusses, and
confirms the diagnosis of the physician being supervised and signs the resulting
report before it is entered into the patient’s records. (21 CFR 900.2(o)(1)). This
means that, if the supervising interpreting physician is not present when the
physician being supervised makes his or her initial interpretation, the supervising
physician must be present to review and, if necessary, correct the final interpretation
before it is given to the patient or the patient’s healthcare provider.
When the physician being supervised reads previously interpreted mammographic
examinations, these interpretations should still be reviewed, discussed, and
confirmed or corrected by a supervising interpreting physician. This should be done
even if the supervised physician’s interpretation agrees with the previous
interpretation and/or the interpretation of the supervising interpreting physician.
Where mammographic examinations are being read retrospectively under direct
supervision, FDA generally has not enforced and does not intend to enforce the
requirement that the multi-reading be done before the patient receives their results.

8.

Can an interpreting physician count multi-reads toward meeting the initial,
continuing, or requalification requirements?
Yes. Multi-reading means two or more physicians, at least one of whom is an
interpreting physician, interpreting the same mammogram. (21 CFR 900.2(hh)).
This applies when reading and interpreting current examinations or previously
interpreted examinations. FDA generally considers re-interpretation of a previously
interpreted mammographic examination to count towards meeting the applicable
MQSA requirements, where the interpreting physician did not do the initial
interpretation. In other words, multi-reading of mammograms by interpreting
physicians could be used to meet the initial qualifications (21 CFR
900.12(a)(1)(i)(D)), continuing experience and education (21 CFR 900.12(a)(ii)(A)),
or reestablishing qualifications (21 CFR 900.12(a)(iv)(A)) requirements.
Multi-readings should be documented by the same method(s) as are used for original

interpretations, including letters and logs/charts maintained by the facility or
interpreting physician (which should be confirmed by the facility). The
documentation should be either computerized or handwritten.

L.

RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGIST REQUIREMENTS
1.

What are the initial training requirements for radiologic technologists under
the MQSA regulations?
Prior to independently performing mammographic examinations, a radiologic
technologist must complete all the following requirements:
· Be State licensed to perform general radiographic procedures, or have
certification as a radiographer from one of the bodies15 determined by FDA to
have adequate procedures and requirements to perform radiologic examinations
(21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(i));
· Have, prior to April 28, 1999, qualified as a radiologic technologist under the
interim regulations of December 21, 1993; or completed 40 contact hours of
documented training specific to mammography under the supervision of a
qualified instructor. The 40 hours of documented training shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to:
· Training in breast anatomy and physiology, positioning and
compression, quality assurance/quality control techniques, and imaging
of patients with breast implants;
· The performance of a minimum of 25 mammography examinations
under the direct supervision of a radiologic technologist qualified under
21 CFR 900.12(a)(2) (generally, time spent performing the 25 exams
under direct supervision should be no more than 12.5 hours16 of the 40
contact hours of training requirement); and
· At least 8 hours of training in each mammographic modality to be used
by the technologist. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(ii)).
After meeting all the initial requirements, radiologic technologists must:
· Maintain continuing education (15 continuing education units (CEU)/36
months) (21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(A)).17

15

The FDA has determined that the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) and the American Registry
of Clinical Radiography Technologists (ARCRT) are bodies with adequate procedures and requirements to ensure that the
radiologic technologists they certify are competent to perform radiologic examinations.
16
This is the amount of time credited by ARRT for 25 exams, a standard which is based on ARRT’s experience in issuing
certifications.
17
In light of recommendations from the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee and the Institute
of Medicine stating that the general requirement of obtaining 15 hours of continuing education in mammography every
three years provides adequate assurance that personnel receive appropriate updated information about all mammographic
modalities in a timely fashion, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion regarding the CE units required for
each specified modality used by the radiologic technologist in his or her practice, and intends to continue such a practice
(see 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(C) (“at least 6 of the continuing education units required . . . shall be related to each
mammographic modality used by the technologist”)). For example, FDA generally still intends to not object to a
radiologic technologist who does not document six continuing education units in screen-film mammography as part of the
15 CEUs in mammography where the radiologic technologist uses only that one type of mammographic modality.

36

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

2.

Maintain continuing experience (200 examinations/24months) (21 CFR
900.12(a)(2)(iv)(A)).

Can the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) advanced
certificate in mammography (ARRT)(M) be used to meet the initial training in
mammography requirement?
Yes, but it depends on when the ARRT(M) certificate was issued. Documentation of
passing the ARRT(M) prior to 04/28/1999 or after 01/01/2001 may be used to meet
the initial training requirement. If the ARRT(M) was awarded between 04/29/1999
and 12/31/2000, documentation of passing it counts as 24 hours of the 40-hour
initial training requirement (includes necessary subject areas), but the technologist
would also need to show documentation of completing 25 mammography exams
under the direct supervision of a qualified radiologic technologist, as required by 21
CFR 900.12(a)(2)(ii)(B).

3.

Can a technologist count the performance of 25 mammography examinations
under direct supervision toward the 8-hour new modality training
requirement?
No. The performance of a mammography examination under direct supervision does
not qualify as continuing education units for new modality training. New
mammographic modality training requires 8 hours of continuing education units, as
described in 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(E), and can be in many forms, including, but
not limited to, professional training, special training courses, continuing medical
education, and training provided by the manufacturer.

4.

What is required for a radiologic technologist who completed the initial
qualification requirements in the past, has not worked in the field of
mammography for an extended period, but would like to independently
perform mammography?
As an initial matter, the radiologic technologist seeking requalification after not
working in the field for an extended period must have originally met the
qualification requirements outlined in 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(i) and (ii). The
radiologic technologist must also still hold a current State license to perform general
radiographic procedures or a general certification from a body determined by FDA
to have adequate procedures and requirements for performing radiologic
examinations.18 (21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(i)). The radiologic technologist must also
complete the requalification requirements for both continuing education and
continuing experience, which are found in 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(D) and (iv)(B),
respectively, before the radiologic technologist can resume performing unsupervised

18

The FDA has determined that the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) and the American Registry
of Clinical Radiography Technologists (ARCRT) are bodies with adequate procedures and requirements to ensure that the
radiologic technologists they certify are competent to perform radiologic examinations.

37

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
mammography examinations.
To meet the requalification requirements for continuing education, the radiologic
technologist must obtain a sufficient number of continuing education units to bring
their total up to at least 15 in the previous 36 months. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(2)(iii)(D)).19 For requalification of continuing experience, if the radiologic
technologist has not performed at least 200 mammograms in the previous 24
months, the technologist must re-qualify by performing 25 mammograms under the
direct supervision of a qualified radiologic technologist. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(2)(iv)(B)). Additionally, if the radiologic technologist will be using a
mammographic modality other than one for which the technologist was initially
trained, the radiologic technologist must complete at least 8 hours of continuing
education units in the new modality. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(E)).

5.

Can passing either the ARRT(M) or ARRT Breast Sonography (BS) exam be
used to meet the MQSA continuing education requirement?
Yes. Passing the ARRT(M) and/or the ARRT(BS) examination would count as
meeting the entire continuing education requirement for 36 months from the date of
obtaining the ARRT(M) or ARRT(BS) certification. FDA generally accepts CEUs
related to the diagnosis or treatment of breast disease, and both the ARRT(M) and
ARRT(BS) examinations require the technologist to complete greater than 15 hours
of structured education in mammography or breast sonography. Inspectors therefore
can accept the passing of the ARRT(M) and ARRT(BS) as meeting the CEU
requirement for 36 months from the date of obtaining the certification.

6.

What are the consequences of a radiologic technologist failing to meet the
continuing experience requirement at the time of the annual MQSA inspection?
An observation could be cited in the inspection report to the facility when an
inspection reveals that a radiologic technologist has failed to meet the continuing
experience requirement (i.e., performing 200 mammograms in the previous 24
months) including when the radiologic technologist has not started the
requalification process before the inspection. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1)(A) & (C);
21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iv)). The technologist must not perform mammograms
independently until the technologist re-qualifies by performing 25 mammograms
under direct supervision of a MQSA-qualified radiologic technologist. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(2)(iv)(B)).

19

In light of recommendations from the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee and the Institute
of Medicine stating that the general requirement of obtaining 15 hours of continuing education in mammography every
three years provides adequate assurance that personnel receive appropriate updated information about all mammographic
modalities in a timely fashion, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion regarding the CE units required for
each specified modality used by the radiologic technologist in his or her practice, and intends to continue such a practice
(see 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iii)(C) (“at least 6 of the continuing education units required . . . shall be related to each
mammographic modality used by the technologist”)). For example, FDA generally still intends to not object to a
radiologic technologist who does not document six continuing education units in screen-film mammography as part of the
15 CEUs in mammography where the radiologic technologist uses only that one type of mammographic modality.

38

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Consistent with existing practice, when a facility is inspected within the 6-month
period following the documented requalification date, FDA generally does not
intend to object to the radiologic technologist not complying with the continuing
experience requirements under 21 CFR 900.12(a)(2)(iv)(A) or (B). This may help
facilitate the radiologic technologist having sufficient time to complete the required
continuing experience by the end of this 6-month timeframe or to restart the
requalification process by performing 25 mammographic examinations under direct
supervision.
Facilities must maintain written documentation of all radiologic technologist
qualifications. (See 21 CFR 900.12(d)(2)). This should include documentation of
each requalification cycle, including the dates the radiologic technologist performed
mammography under direct supervision to meet the requalification requirement and
the qualification documentation for the radiologic technologist who provided direct
supervision. The requalification documentation should be made available during
inspection. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(g)(1)(A) & (C)).
Note that FDA or an SAC can take action against a facility where the training and
qualification requirements under 21 CFR 900.12(a) have not been met, including
seeking civil money penalties, or suspension or revocation of the facility’s MQSA
certificate. (42 U.S.C. 263b(h)(3); 21 CFR 900.14(a)(2)).

M. MEDICAL PHYSICIST REQUIREMENTS
1.

What are the initial training requirements for medical physicists under the
MQSA regulations?
Prior to independently conducting surveys of mammography facilities and providing
oversight of a facility’s equipment-related quality assurance program, a medical
physicist must complete all of the following requirements:
· Be State licensed or approved, or have certification with a specialty in
diagnostic radiological physics, radiological physics, or diagnostic imaging
physics by a body20 determined by FDA to have adequate procedures and
requirements to perform physics survey; (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(A));
· Have a master’s degree or higher in a physical science21 from an accredited
institution, with no less than 20 semester hours or equivalent (e.g., 30 quarter
hours) in college undergraduate or graduate level physics; (21 CFR
900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(1));
· Have 20 contact hours of documented specialized training in conducting
mammography facility surveys; (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(2)); and

20

The FDA has determined that the American Board of Radiology (ABR) or the American Board of Medical Physics
(ABMP) are bodies with adequate procedures and requirements to ensure that the medical physicists they certify are
competent to perform physics surveys.
21
See 21 CFR 900.2(ll) (Physical science means physics, chemistry, radiation science (including medical physics and
health physics), and engineering).

39

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

Have experience of conducting surveys of at least 1 mammography facility and
a total of at least 10 mammography units. No more than one survey of a
specific unit within a period of 60 days can be counted towards the total
mammography unit survey requirement. After April 28, 1999, experience
conducting surveys must be acquired under the direct supervision of a medical
physicist who meets all the requirements of 21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i) and (iii).
(21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(3)).

Medical physicists must document 8 hours of training in each mammographic
modality in which the medical physicist has not previously been trained prior to
independently performing surveys units of that mammographic modality. Examples
of mammographic modalities include FFDM and DBT. Medical physicists who
completed their initial training on a certain modality are not required to complete or
document an additional 8 hours of training on that modality. (21 CFR
900.12(a)(3)(iii)(C)).
After meeting all the initial requirements, interpreting physicians must:
· Maintain continuing education (15 continuing education units22 (CEUs)/36
months) (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii)(A)); and
· Maintain continuing experience (2 mammography facilities and 6
mammography units/24months) (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii)(B)).

2.

What does it mean to be under “direct supervision” of a Medical Physicist?
“Direct Supervision” means that during the performance of a mammography
examination or survey of the facility’s equipment and quality assurance program, the
supervisor is present to observe and correct, as needed, the performance of the
individual being supervised. (21 CFR 900.2(o)(2)). For the physics survey and/or
mammography equipment evaluation, direct supervision means that the supervising
medical physicist must have qualified under the Master’s or higher pathway and
meet all continuing qualifications (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(1) and (3)) and be
present to observe and correct, as needed, the performance of the supervisee. FDA
has generally considered the supervisor’s physical presence in the room with the
supervisee during the performance of the individual equipment tests to satisfy this
requirement. The supervisor should review any calculations made from, and any
conclusions drawn from the test results, before those results are provided to the
facility.
Furthermore, when conducting a physics survey, the supervisor and supervisee

22

In light of recommendations from the National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee and the Institute
of Medicine stating that the general requirement of obtaining 15 hours of continuing education in mammography every
three years provides adequate assurance that personnel receive appropriate updated information about all mammographic
modalities in a timely fashion, FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion regarding the CEU credits required for
each specific modality used by the medical physicist in his or her practice, and intends to continue such a practice (see 21
CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii)(A) (“This continuing education shall include hours of training appropriate to each mammographic
modality evaluated by the medical physicist during his or her surveys or oversight of quality assurance programs”). For
example, FDA generally still intends to not object to a medical physicist who does not document CEU credits in screenfilm mammography as part of the 15 general mammography CEU credits where the facility uses only that one type of
mammographic modality.

40

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
should generally jointly review the QC program records to ensure the supervisor can
correct any potential mistakes made by the supervisee. (See 21 CFR
900.12(a)(3)(i)). Consistent with past practice, FDA generally does not intend to
enforce the requirement that the supervisor be present when the supervisee initially
reviews the QC program records where the supervisor reviews, discusses, confirms,
and if necessary, corrects the findings made by the supervisee prior to either the
initial or final survey report being issued. (See 21 CFR 900.12(e)(9)).
The goal of direct supervision is to provide reasonable assurance that any mistakes
made by the supervisee are corrected before the QC program review or tests are
completed.

3.

Can a letter issued by the FDA or a State confirming the initial qualification
requirements were met under the MQSA be used to document that a medical
physicist has met all the initial qualification requirements?
In 2016, the FDA stopped issuing letters to medical physicists confirming initial
qualification requirements were met under the MQSA; however, these letters can
still be used to document the medical physicist’s initial qualification requirements
under 21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i). The medical physicist must maintain a valid State
license, State approval, or certification as well as meet the continuing education and
experience qualifications stated in 21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii)(A) and (B). FDA has
reviewed information in State issued letters that indicate a physicist met State
licensure/approval, as required under 900.12(a)(3)(i)(A), to determine whether part
of the initial qualification requirements are met; specifically, that the medical
physicist be State licensed or approved.

4.

Does a degree in a physical science obtained at a non-US institution qualify for
meeting the degree requirement?
A degree from a non-US institution can be used to meet the degree requirement
where the physicist can provide information showing that his or her foreign degree
is accepted by an accredited institution. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)). FDA has
recognized accredited institutions as including accredited US institutions, the
Committee on Accreditation of Medical Physicists Education Programs (CAMPEP),
World Education Testing, or by the ABR or ABMP.

5.

Can the performance of facility and unit surveys under direct supervision of a
qualified instructor count toward the 20 contact hours of specialized training in
conducting mammography surveys?
Yes. However, it is recommended that no more than four hours for each facility
survey and two hours for each unit survey should be counted toward the required
total hours of training. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(2)).

6.

If a medical physicist performed their initial experience under direct
41

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
supervision on full field digital mammography (FFDM) units is any additional
documentation needed for modality training?
Medical physicists who completed their initial training (10 mammography unit
surveys under direct supervision, see 21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(i)(B)(3)) on FFDM units
are initially trained in FFDM. They therefore would not need to provide any
additional statement or documentation that they have completed at least 8 hours of
additional FFDM training where the initial training documentation identifies FFDM
as the modality used during the training, or the coversheets for each survey
performed during the training is included in the initial training documentation such
that it demonstrates the training was completed on FFDM units.
However, the medical physicist would be required to complete 8 hours of new
modality training in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) prior to independently
performing DBT unit surveys. (21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii)(C)). This must be
accomplished by performing at least 8 FFDM/DBT unit surveys (each of which
provides1 hour of FFDM training and 1 hour of DBT training) under direct
supervision of an MQSA-qualified medical physicist or by completing at least 8
hours of training or continuing education courses in conducting DBT unit surveys.

7.

What are recommended methods for documenting medical physicist initial
and/or continuing experience?
Although the survey reports themselves (original, copy or coversheet from the
report) can be used as documentation, in general, a summary document, such as a
letter or memorandum from the facility where the survey was performed or from the
physics company providing the service, should be sufficient. The letter should be on
official facility or company letterhead and should indicate the number of facility
and/or unit surveys performed, the dates on which they were performed, and be
signed by either a responsible official of the facility or physics company providing
the service, or by the person providing the direct supervision.
This assumes that the summary documentation is based upon the survey reports and
that these could be examined if needed.

8.

What are recommended continuing education topics for medical physicists?
All continuing education units related to the diagnosis or treatment of breast disease
or to other areas that aid facility personnel in improving the quality of
mammography should qualify for credit toward meeting the continuing education
requirement, which can be found at 21 CFR 900.12(a)(3)(iii). (See also 21 CFR
900.2(l), (m), and (n)).
Additionally, some general diagnostic medical physics courses not directly related to
mammography could qualify for meeting the continuing education requirement
where those credits are anticipated to help the individual in their role as a medical
physicist for a mammography facility.

N.

MAMMOGRAPHY EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
1.

What does the regulation found at 21 CFR Part 900.12(b)(2)(i) mean by “all
devices used in mammography must have met the applicable FDA premarket
authorization requirements for medical devices of that type with that intended
use”?
The FDA classifies a device based on its intended use (IU), including indications for
use (IFU), technological characteristics, and the level of risk that the device poses to
the patient and/or the user. Before a medical device, such as a mammography unit or
a display monitor for primary image interpretation, can be marketed in the United
States, it must meet any applicable FDA premarket authorization requirements. If a
display device for primary image interpretation or mammography unit is cleared,
granted, or approved by the FDA for use in mammography, this will be stated in the
IFU of the cleared/granted/approved device.

2.

How does a facility know if its display device for primary image interpretation
is approved, granted, or cleared for mammography use?
For a 510(k)-cleared device, if it is unclear whether a facility’s display device for
primary image interpretation is intended for mammography, it is recommended that
the facility request a copy of the 510(k) Summary with the Indications for Use (IFU)
statement from the manufacturer of the display device to verify/ensure it is intended
for use in displaying mammographic images for primary image interpretation.
Facilities can also look up its display device’s 510(k) status at
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm. For granted or
approved devices, the marketing status can be searched at
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/denovo.cfm and
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMA/pma.cfm, respectively.

O. QUALITY CONTROL
1.

If a facility recently had a software upgrade and now the facility’s full field
digital mammography (FFDM) unit can be used in the digital breast
tomosynthesis mode (DBT), can the facility immediately begin imaging patients
in the DBT mode?
No. Due to the differences in technology between FFDM and DBT, FDA currently
considers each imaging modality to be a separate unit. (21 CFR 900.12(b)(2)(ii)). A
single mammography system designed to provide imaging in two modalities must be
accredited as two separate units. Each mammography equipment unit must be
accredited by the facility’s AB, which in turn requires completing a mammography
equipment evaluation (MEE) within the six months prior to submitting a unit
accreditation application. (21 CFR 900.4(e)(1)(i) and 900.12(b)(2)(ii)). As part of
43

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the facility’s record-keeping requirement, a facility must have documentation
showing that it has passed an MEE prior to use on patients. (21 CFR 900.12(d)(2)).
Before using a new unit, a facility should also have documentation showing that it
has received confirmation that the accreditation application for the new unit has
been accepted and is under review by its AB. FDA generally considers a new unit to
be undergoing accreditation when the facility has submitted the initial part of the
application for accreditation submission to its AB and has received confirmation that
the application submission is under review. (21 CFR 900.4(e)(1) and 21 CFR
900.12(e)(10)).
After the AB confirms that the new mammography unit meets all the requirements
and, if applicable, all problems are corrected, it may be used on patients and to
obtain the clinical images needed for review by the AB to complete its accreditation
evaluation. (21 CFR 900.4(e) and 900.12(e)(10)).

2.

Who is responsible for the quality control of remote review workstations?
Where procedures such as the interpretation of the mammogram are performed in a location
different from where the mammogram is performed, the facility performing the
mammogram is responsible for meeting the quality standards, including the establishment
and maintenance of a quality assurance and quality control program. (42 U.S.C.
263b(a)(3)(B)).

3.

What are the Mammography Equipment Evaluation (MEE), annual survey,
and routine quality control requirements for remote review workstations?
For systems with image receptor modalities other than screen-film, the quality
assurance program shall be substantially the same as the quality assurance program
recommended by the image receptor manufacturer (21 CFR 900.12(e)(6)).
Therefore, all review workstations, whether located on-site or at a remote location,
are required to be evaluated by a quality assurance program that is substantially the
same as the quality assurance program recommended by the image receptor
manufacturer, except that the maximum allowable dose shall not exceed the
maximum allowable dose for screen-film systems which is defined in 21 CFR
900.12(e)(5)(vi). That provision indicates that the average glandular dose delivered
during a single cranio-caudal view of an FDA-accepted phantom simulating a
standard breast shall not exceed 3.0 milligray (mGy) (0.3 rad) per exposure.
Remote review workstations, just like on-site workstations, shall also undergo an
annual survey performed by an MQSA-qualified medical physicist or by an
individual under the direct supervision of an MQSA-qualified medical physicist. (21
CFR 900.12(e)(9)). Additionally, remote review workstations, just like on-site
workstations, shall conduct an MEE when it is installed, when it is disassembled and
reassembled at the same or a different location, and when there is a change or repair
of a major component. (See 21 CFR 900.12(e)(10)). When the image receptor
manufacturer does not identify specific quality control tests for the review
workstations, you should refer to the manufacturer of the review workstation for
44

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
quality control testing. These evaluations are used to determine whether the new or
repaired review workstation is performing properly before it is placed into service
for the final interpretation of mammograms.
If the image receptor manufacturer and the review workstation manufacturer have
not identified quality control tests, we recommend the facility, in conjunction with
the medical physicist, seek information and guidance from a standards body or
organization with experience in the evaluation of display devices used in the
interpretation of mammograms.

4.

Can facilities use the ACR Digital Mammography Quality Control Manual for
Full-Field Digital Mammography Systems and Supplement for Digital Breast
Tomosynthesis Mammography Systems instead of the mammography unit’s
quality control manual from the manufacturer?
Yes. The ACR Digital Mammography Quality Control Manual for Full-Field Digital
Mammography Systems and Supplement for Digital Breast Tomosynthesis
Mammography Systems was approved by the FDA as Alternative Standard #2423 on
July 13, 2018. It was approved as an alternative to the quality assurance program
recommended by the image receptor manufacturer as defined in the original
standard at 21 CFR 900.12(e)(6). Alternative Standard #24 has no time limit. Any
facility may avail itself of the approved alternative standard. You may visit the ACR
Mammography Accreditation website at https://www.acraccreditation.org//media/ACRAccreditation/Documents/Resources/DMQC/DMQCFAQs.pdf for the
latest information and instructions for implementation of the ACR manual.

5.

Are facilities required to print quality control (QC) logs from the
mammography unit or review workstation software in addition to completing
the QC forms provided by the manufacturer?
If it is possible for the inspector to review test data or documentation electronically
at your facility, then it is generally not necessary to print QC logs. However,
inspectors will generally request a copy of documentation that could support any
noncompliance(s) found during the inspection process. Although QC forms
provided by the manufacturer can be used to handwrite QC test results, inspectors
might use any additional tools available such as internal review workstation (RWS)
display reports or test data stored in the mammography unit (or PACS) to verify the
accuracy and results of any QC test performed.

6.

Should facilities record the actual numerical result of the QC test (e.g.,
compression, signal-to-noise ratio) or just whether it passes or fails?

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The lead interpreting physician, quality control technologist, and medical physicist
shall ensure that records concerning mammography quality control (including
monitoring data, problems detected by analysis of that data, corrective actions, and
the effectiveness of the correction actions) are properly maintained and updated.
Quality control records shall be kept for each test specified in 21 CFR 900.12(e) and
(f) until the next annual inspection has been completed and FDA has determined that
the facility is in compliance with the quality assurance requirements or until the test
has been performed two additional times at the required frequency, whichever is
longer. (21 CFR 900.12(d)(2)).
Accordingly, QC records should show the numerical results of those QC tests for
which numbers are a natural by-product of the test. These numerical results will
indicate whether the QC tests are within the required action or control limits.
However, for tests such as artifact evaluation, where no meaningful quantitative test
results are produced, FDA generally considers a pass/fail indication to be
appropriate and sufficient.

7.

When a facility uses a hardcopy print of digital images, are there any new
requirements for the type of film the facility can use to create those hardcopy
images?
Effective September 10, 2024, for facilities using hardcopy prints of digital images
for transfer, retention, or final interpretation purposes, the facility shall use a type of
film designated by the film manufacturer as appropriate for these purposes and
compatible with the printer being used. (21 CFR 900.12(b)(11)).

8.

Which quality standards will now be required for systems with image receptor
modalities other than screen-film?
Systems with image receptor modalities other than screen-film shall demonstrate
compliance with quality standards by successful results of quality assurance testing
as specified under 21 CFR 900.12(e)(6). (21 CFR 900.12(b)(16)).

9.

A facility recently had a part repaired/replaced on their mammography unit
(and/or display device) and is not sure if it’s a major component that would
require an MEE. What does FDA recommend in this situation?
Facilities with digital mammography units must follow a quality assurance program
that is substantially the same as the quality assurance program recommended by the
image receptor manufacturer (mammography unit), except that the maximum
allowable dose shall not exceed the maximum allowable dose for screen-film
systems in 21 CFR 900.12(e)(5)(vi). (21 CFR 900.12(e)(6)). If it is unclear whether
an MEE is indicated under the image receptor manufacturer’s recommended quality
assurance program for an adjustment, change, or repair of a digital mammography
unit (or display device), the FDA recommends that the facility or its medical
46

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
physicist contact the mammography unit (or display device) manufacturer for
clarification. If an MEE is not indicated, FDA recommends that the mammography
unit (or display device) manufacturer provide the facility with a written statement of
such for its records. These recommendations also apply to software upgrades to
mammography units and/or display devices.

P.

COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
1.

What is an Additional Mammography Review (AMR)?
Under an AMR, a facility shall provide clinical images and other relevant
information, as specified by FDA or the SAC, for review by the AB or the SAC if
FDA or the SAC believes that mammographic quality at a facility has been
compromised and, before September 10, 2024, may present a serious risk to human
health, and, on or after September 10, 2024, may present a significant risk to human
health. The AMR review will help FDA or the SAC determine whether the facility is
in compliance with the quality standards,24 including the standards for clinical image
quality established by the facility’s AB (see 21 CFR 900.12(i)), and if not, whether
there is a need to notify affected patients, their referring physicians or other
healthcare providers, and/or the public, that there is a serious/significant risk to
human health. (21 CFR 900.12(j) and 21 CFR 900.12(j)).

2.

How are AMRs different from the reviews that are performed for
accreditation, reaccreditation, or a random clinical image review?
AMRs are performed in cases where FDA or the SAC believes that mammographic
quality at a facility has been compromised and, before September 10, 2024, may
present a serious risk to human health, and, on or after September 10, 2024, may
present a significant risk to human health. (21 CFR 900.12(j) and 21 CFR
900.12(j)). An example of such a circumstance might be the observation of a Level 1
phantom image failure during an inspection. Accreditation bodies do not use the
clinical image reviews (CIRs) performed during accreditation, re-accreditation, and
random clinical image review to investigate possible problems at facilities.
Accreditation bodies use these types of CIRs to evaluate the ongoing quality of
mammography at all facilities.

3.

Are there any options available to facilities that disagree with an accreditation
body’s adverse accreditation or reaccreditation decision?
When an AB denies accreditation or reaccreditation (i.e., revocation of
accreditation) to a facility, the AB will notify the facility in writing and explain the
bases for its decision. The notification will also describe the appeals process

24

As described in 21 CFR 900.12, as amended on September 10, 2024.

47

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
available from the AB for the facility to contest the decision. (21 CFR
900.4(a)(6)(i)).
If a facility appeals an adverse decision through the appeals process provided by the
AB and still cannot achieve a satisfactory resolution, the facility may request
reconsideration, or further appeal, of the adverse decision from the Director of
FDA’s Division of Mammography Quality Standards. (See 21 CFR 900.7(b) and
(c)). It is important to note that a facility cannot appeal the adverse accreditation
decision to FDA without first availing themselves of the accreditation body’s
appeals process. (21 CFR 900.15(c)). Facilities should refer to FDA’s guidance,
“Appeal Options Available to Mammography Facilities Concerning Adverse
Accreditation Decisions, Suspension/Revocation of Certificates, or Patient and
Physician Orders” for more information.

4.

What is a Patient and Provider Notification (PPN)?
FDA or the SAC may require a facility to perform a PPN. This means, among other
things, that the facility must send notification letters to patients and providers to
notify them that the quality of mammography did not meet the Federal standards and
it posed a significant risk to human health. (See 42 U.S.C. 263b(h)(2)); 21 CFR
900.12(j)(2)). Based on the results of an AMR, the facility’s failure to comply with
terms of an AMR, or other information, FDA or the SAC may determine that the
quality of mammography performed by a facility, whether or not certified under §
900.11, was so inconsistent with the quality standards established in 21 CFR 900.12,
as to present a significant risk to human health. FDA or the SAC may require such a
facility to notify all patients who received mammograms at the facility or those
patients who are determined to be at risk due to the quality of their mammography,
and their referring physicians or other healthcare providers, of the deficiencies and
resulting potential harm, appropriate remedial measures, and such other relevant
information as FDA or the SAC may require. Such notification shall occur within a
timeframe and in a manner specified by FDA or the SAC. (21 CFR 900.12(j)(2)).

5.

Are there any options available to facilities to appeal the order to perform a
PPN?
In accordance with 21 CFR 10.75, a facility receiving a PPN order can appeal the
order to the next level supervisor of the official who signed the PPN order. Facilities
should refer to FDA’s guidance, “Appeal Options Available to Mammography
Facilities Concerning Adverse Accreditation Decisions, Suspension/Revocation of
Certificates, or Patient and Physician Orders” for more information.

6.

What are the consequences if a facility is unable or unwilling to perform a PPN
once the amended regulations take effect?
If a facility is unable or unwilling to perform a PPN, the FDA or the SAC may
notify patients and their referring physicians or other healthcare providers
48

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
individually or through the mass media. (21 CFR 900.12(j)(2)).
The FDA generally intends to post a Public Safety Notice of the facility’s
noncompliance and image quality issues as indicated by the AB.25 (See 21 CFR
900.12(j)(2)). An AB is not likely to accept any future re-accreditation application
until, at the least, pending compliance actions are resolved. (See 21 CFR
900.4(a)(1), 900.4(b), and 900.4(a)(6)(ii)). In addition, civil money penalties may be
assessed, including for each failure to notify a patient of risk. (42 U.S.C.
263b(h)(3)).

7.

Under what circumstances can FDA suspend or revoke a facility’s MQSA
certificate?
FDA may suspend or revoke a certificate after providing the owner or operator of
the facility with notice and opportunity for an informal hearing when the facility,
owner, operator, or any employee of the facility:
· Has been guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining the certificate;
· Has failed to comply with the quality standards of 21 CFR 900.12;
· Has failed to comply with reasonable requests of FDA, SAC or the AB for
records, information, reports, or materials, including clinical images for an
AMR, that are necessary to determine continued eligibility of the facility for a
certificate or continued compliance with the quality standards of 21 CFR
900.12;
· Has refused a reasonable request of a FDA or State inspector, or AB
representative for permission to inspect the facility or the operations and
pertinent records of the facility;
· Has violated or aided and abetted in the violation of any provision of the
MQSA or its implementing regulations;
· On or after September 10, 2024, has failed to comply with prior sanctions
imposed by FDA or the SAC under 42 U.S.C. 263b(h), including a directed
plan of correction or a PPN; or
· On or after September 10, 2024, has failed to comply with requests of current
or former facility personnel for records of their training or experience relevant
to their qualification under MQSA. (42 U.S.C. 263b(i)(1); 21 CFR
900.14(a)(1)-(6) and 21 CFR 900.14(a)(1)-(7)).
FDA may suspend the MQSA certificate of a facility before holding a hearing if
FDA makes a finding described above and also determines that the failure to comply
with required standards presents a serious risk to human health, the refusal to permit
inspection makes immediate suspension necessary, or there is reason to believe that
the violation or aiding and abetting of the violation was intentional or associated
with fraud. (42 U.S.C. 263b(i)(2); 21 CFR 900.14(b)(1)-(3)). If the FDA suspends a
certificate before holding a hearing, the FDA shall provide the facility with an

25

opportunity for an informal hearing not later than 60 days from the effective date of
the suspension. (21 CFR 900.14(c)).

What is The National Mammography Quality Assurance Advisory Committee
(NMQAAC)?
The NMQAAC, mandated by Congress, consists of between 13 and 19 members.
(42 U.S.C. 263b(n)). These include physicians, practitioners, other health
professionals, consumer, and industry representatives – all whose clinical practice,
research specialization, or professional expertise include a significant focus on
mammography.
The functions of this committee are to advise FDA on:
A. Developing appropriate quality standards and regulations for mammography
facilities;
B. Developing appropriate standards and regulations for bodies accrediting
mammography facilities under this program;
C. Developing regulations with respect to sanctions;
D. Developing procedures for monitoring compliance with quality standards
under 42 U.S.C. 263b(f) (as promulgated under 21 CFR 900.12);
E. Establishing a mechanism to investigate consumer complaints;
F. Reporting new developments concerning breast imaging that should be
considered in the oversight of mammography facilities;
G. Determining whether there exists a shortage of mammography facilities in
rural and health professional shortage areas and determining the effects of
personnel or other quality requirements under 42 U.S.C. 263b(f) on access to
the services of such facilities in such areas;
H. Determining whether there will exist a sufficient number of medical
physicists after October 1, 1999, to assure compliance with 42 U.S.C.
263b(f)(1)(E); and
I. Determining the costs and benefits of compliance with these requirements.
