  title: Master Files Part III - Guidance on Scientific and Technical Information
---

This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA's 
Good Guidance Practices, GGP's. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person 
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if 
such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or borh. 
This guidance will be updated in the next revision to include the standard elemnts of GGP's.

Introdaction to Master Piles for Devices (MAFs) 
A premarket approval application (PMA) or an investigational device exemption 
application (IDE) usually contains data and other information that the applicant has 
developed and regards as trade secret or confidential commercial/financial information. 
Often the applicant needs to use another party's product (e.g., ingredient, subassembly, 
or accessory) or facility in the manufacture of the device. In order that a sound scien- 
tific evaluation may be made of the PMA, IDE, or other device submission, the review 
of data and other information related to the other party's product, facility, or manu- 
facturing procedures is required. The other party, while willing to allow FDA's confi- 
dential review of this information, may not want the IDE or PMA applicant to have 
direct access to the information. To help preserve the trade secrets of the ancillary 
medical device industry and at the same time facilitate the sound scientific evaluation 
of medical devices, FDA established the device master file system. 
This guideline only applies to the master files (MAFs) submitted to the Center for . - 
Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). 
Master files in support of other products 
regulated by FDA, even though they may contain information previously submitted in an 
MAP, are to be submitted to the appropriate FDA center(& The content and the way 
the master file is used may vary among FDA centers. 
Other master files submitted for review in support of documents filed with FDA are: 
Biologics Master Files supporting Notices of Claimed Investigational Exemption 
for a New Drug (INDs) for biologics and biologic licenses. 
Drug Master Files (DMFs) supporting Investigational New Drug Applications 
(INDs), New Drug Applications (NDAs), and .Abbreviated New Drug Applications 
(ANDAs). 
a Food Master Files (PMFs) supporting Pood Additive and Color Additive Petitions. 
Veterinary Medicine Master Files supporting Investigational New Animal 
Exemptions (INADs) and New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs).

The following are commonly used terms relating to MAFs for devices and the 
documents referring to them: 
a*- An "MAP holdern is an organization or person filing an MAF. 
a An napplicant" is an organization or person filing a PMA. 
a A nsponsor" is an organization or person filing an IDE. 
a An "agent or representative for an MAF holdern is a person or organization 
authorized to represent the MAP holder before FDA concerning the contents of 
the MAP. 
Types of MAFs and Their Punctione 
, 
I 
MAFs are only accepted from those organizations or persons who have not submitted 
or will not directly submit the information in a PMA, IDE, premarket notification 
(510(k)) or other device-related submission to FDA. MAPS may be submitted for various 
functions. These functions have been grouped by the folIowing types: 
facilities and manufacturing procedures and controls; 
1 
synthesis, formulation, purification and specifications for chemicals, materials 
(e.g., an alloy, plastic, etc.) or subassemblies for a device; 
packaging materials, 
contract packaging and other manufacturing (e.g., sterilization); 
noncllnical study data; and 
clinical study data. 


The Format and Arrangement of an BfAF 
An MAP is a working document retained in the PMA Document Mail Center until 
referred to in a PMA, IDE, or other type of submission. To assure its convenient use, 
maintenance and storage, CDRH has established the following suggestions for its format 
and arrangement. 
Submit two complete and identical paper copies. 
In lieu of two paper copies, 
CDRH will accept one paper copy and a copy on microfiche. 
If paper, collate both copies. 
Number each volume and each page within each volume. 
Standard page dimensions for FDA files. Measurements are in inches, 


In the first volume of each copy include a signed and dated cover letter 
identifying the submission as a device master file (MAP) and briefly describe the 
subject of the submission. 
U.S. standard size and weight bond paper (8* inches x 11 inches) is preferred. 
Page sizes should not exceed 11 inches in length and 8f inches in width. 
FDA's system for storing MAFs requires that the volume be bound on the left side 
of the page using the U.S. standard size loose leaf page. 
Should it be necessary to use individual pages larger than the U.S. standard page 
size to present a floor diagram, device design, electrical diagram, etc., those 
pages should be mounted to allow the page to be opened for review and folded 
without damage when the volume is shelved. 
Allow a left margin of at least 3/4 inch to assure that the text is clear of binding. 
Individual volumes should not exceed 2 inches in thickness. 
DO NOT BIND volumes in book form or with plastic or metal spirals. 
The Content of an MAP 
A submission will not be accepted as an MAF if it is not substantive in nature and 
does not contain information that may reasonably be regarded as trade secret or confi- 
dential commercial or financial information. 
The submission must include a cover letter, preferably bearing company letterhead, 
signed by a responsible official (e.g., 
Director of Regulatory Affairs or another 
manager). The letter should identify the submission as an MAF, and a contact person at 
the company or designated agent should be listed. 
An MAP must be in the English language or be accompanied by accurate English 
translations of any of the documents that are in a language other than English.

Amending an MAP 
After submission of an MAP, its information may need to be updated as a result of 
additional testing, additional applications of the MAF information or modification of the 
product that is the subject of the MAP. 
Changes made in product or manufacturing operations can affect a client's medical 
device and possibly result in the client marketing a device differing from that originally 
approved by FDA. This can also have an effect on product liability obligations and a 
client's compliance with applicable FDA laws and regulations. 
It is, therefore, nec- 
essary to notify a client before proposed changes are made in your operations or 
product. 


Authorization to an MAP 
Information in an MAP may be incorporated by reference in a client's PMA, IDE, or 
other submissions to FDA. Their use of information in an MAF can only be authorized 
by the MAF holder or by a designated agent if so authorized. This authorization must be 
on company letterhead or that of the agent or representative. After FDA has referred 
to an MAF and the client's application has been approved, authorization cannot be 
withdrawn, 
An MAP holder should provide a letter of authorization directly to a client with 
instructions that: (1) the original of the authorization letter be included in the original 
copy of the client's submission and (2) a copy be placed in each subsequent copy of the 
client's submission. An authorization letter should not be sent directly to CDRH for 
inclusion in the MAF or the client's submission. 
Below is the format for a sample authorization letter. 
[Use company letterhead stationery giving company name, address, and telephone 
number.] 
[Dat el 
[Client% name] 
[Mailing address including City, State and Zip Code] 
Dear [Person responsible for filing the client's application]: 
This letter authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to include by reference 
information in our device master file, MAP #[%pecify the C O l ~ 8 c t  MAF nwnber] for 
[specify the subject of the MAF, e.g., PMA, IDE or 510Q1 in [specify the client's device 
by generic or trade name]. [ Y w  may add further restricting wording if you desire].

Sincerely yours, 
[Name and title of the person respon- 
sible for M A F  authorizations] 


Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations for Medical Devices 
Organizations or persons who submit IDEs, PMAs, or other device-related sub- 
missions to FDA may utilize contract manufacturers, sterilizers, packagers, etc. in the 
manufacture of their devices. The latter, for trade secret or confidentiality purposes, 
may submit a description of its facilities, manufacturing procedures and processes, and 
quality control procedures in an MAP rather than provide this information directly to 
the client for inclusion in Its submission. 
In its evaluation of the client's submission, FDA may inspect the MAF holder's 
facilities and manufacturing operations. When the MAP holder's operation is subject to 
the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations for medical devices (21 CFR 820), 
the MAP must address all appropriate GMP requirements applicable to the MAF holder's 
operation. A client's submission may be adversely affected if the MAP is incomplete or 
inaccurate. 
This is especially true in the case of a PMA because of the statutory 
requirement that a PMA contain a full description of the methods used in, and the 
facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, and when relevant, packing 
and installation of the device. 
Representing an HAP 
If an MAF submitter is a foreign company, FDA recommends that it retain an agent 
or representative in the United States. This will usually facilitate any clarification or 
correction of deficiencies in the MAF information. Identify any agent by name, address, 
and telephone number and specify any limitations in the authority of the agent or repre- 
sentative. If limitations are not specified, FDA will assume that all information in the 
MAF may be discussed with the agent or representative. 
A designated agent or 
representative can be added or removed only by amending the MAP. 
Where to Submit an MAF 
An MAF and all amendments should be submitted to: 
Food and Drug Administration 
Center for Devices and Radiological ~ e a i t h  
PMA Document Mail Center (HFZ-401) 
1390 Piccard Drive 
Roekville, MD 20850 
SPECIAL NOTE: 
FDA will not pay any shipping or C.O.D. charges for incoming 
submissions or pick-up MAPS from the carrier. It is the submitter's responsibility to 
assure prepaid delivery to the above address. 
Receipt will be acknowledged by letter of all new MAP submissions. FDA's acknowl- 
edgment letter of the original MAF will include the FDA assigned MAF reference 
number which must be included in all amendments to the MAF, 
Freedom of Information Act and an MAP 
Under the Freedom of Information Act (POI), information in 510(k)s, IDEs, PMAs and 
other device-related submissions is subject to public disclosure unless determined by 
FDA to be trade secret or confidential commercial or financial information within the 


meaning of 21 CFR 20.61 or otherwise prohibited from public disclosure. In the case of 
PMAs, FDA is required to make publicly available a detailed summary of safety and 
effectiveness fnforrnation which is the basis for the FDA decision to approve, or deny 
approval of, the PMA. Information in such summaries cannot be used to establish the 
safety or effectiveness for another device by any person other than the one who sub- 
mitted the information. 
FOI public disclosure provisions apply whether or not the information in the 510(k), 
IDE, PMA, or other device-related submission was submitted by the applicant or is 
included by authorized reference to an MAF. 
MAF holders should identify information in their MAFs which they consider to be 
trade secret or confidential commercial/ffnancial Information within the meaning of 21 
CFR 20.61. MAF information already in the public domain is subject to disclosure (e.g., 
any published literature, catalog, or product specification sheets distributed by the MAP 
holder to potential customers).
