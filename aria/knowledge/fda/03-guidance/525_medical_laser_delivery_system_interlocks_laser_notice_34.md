TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF MEDICAL,

LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Delivery System Interlocks for Medical Laser Products

BACKGROUND: Medical laser products deliver laser radiation to patients
through a wide variety of means. These include various sizes and lengths
of fiber optic cables, bare fibers, and multi-mirrored articulating arms.
These may in turn be attached to accessories such as hand pieces, operating
microscopes, slitlamps, etc. The bare fibers may also be used by insertion
into endoscopes for treatment internal to the body. Many circumstances
during a surgical procedure may require that the physician exchange or
request exchange of accessories or of the delivery system as a whole.
Clearly, any such exchange involves removal of a part of the protective
housing, since any accessory is protective housing when in place. A
question has been raised concerning the need for a safety interlock to
prevent access to radiation when such protective housing (beam delivery
accessory) is removed during operation or maintenance.

DISCUSSION: It has been the policy of CDRH to require safety interlocks at
the laser console-delivery system connection point, if the delivery system
as a whole may be removed during operation or maintenance. An example of
such a situation is the fiber delivery system on a surgical Nd:YAG laser
for which the fiber may often be exchanged during a procedure. In this
case, safety is enhanced by the interlock since the point of laser
radiation delivery and the point of disconnection may be physically
separate, presenting the possibility of accidental exposure due to
communication errors between the surgeon and attendants. However, the
presence of safety interlocks for passive accessories attached to the
distal end of the delivery system and immediate to the surgeon and the
point of delivery would not significantly enhance safety, providing that
the surgeon has control of emission by means of a foot switch or other
control. There should then be little risk of accidental exposure. In
addition, these accessories may be supplied by other than the laser
manufacturers so that there is a question of the practicality of universal
interlock devices.

POLICY: CDRH will not object to the absence of a safety interlock in a
user removable beam delivery accessory attached to the distal end of its
delivery system provided the laser product incorporates a means to allow
the user to positively control and terminate laser radiation emission from
a point in close proximity to such accessory.

INVITATION TO COMMENT: We encourage submission of comments on this policy
from manufacturers and users of medical laser products. In the meantime,
we also encourage the use of additional safety mechanisms for all laser
accessories, including the use of "smart" accessories which can disable the
laser if detached or if a new calibration of the delivered output is

necessary in order to camply with the requirements of 21 CFR 1040.11(a)(1)
and (2).
