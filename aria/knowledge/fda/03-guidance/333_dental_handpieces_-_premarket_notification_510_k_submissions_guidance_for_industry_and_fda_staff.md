Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Dental Handpieces - Premarket
Notification [510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket
notification submissions (510(k)s) for dental handpieces intended to prepare dental
cavities for restorations, such as fillings, and for cleaning teeth. (21 CFR 872.4200). This
guidance supersedes the document entitled, Guidance Document on Dental Handpieces
issued July 1995. It updates the references and clarifies the recommendations.

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to
be addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we
carefully considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We
also considered the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance
and address the issues we have identified. We believe that we have considered the
least burdensome approach to resolving the issues presented in the guidance
document. If, however, you believe that there is a less burdensome way to address the
issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach to
Resolving Least Burdensome Issues” document. It is available on our Center web
page at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2. Background
A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type must conform to the
general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), including the
premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a
substantial equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also
21 CFR 807.81 and 807.87).
This guidance document identifies the classification regulations and product codes for
dental handpieces (refer to Section 4. Scope). In addition, other sections of this
guidance document provide additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks
related to these devices in premarket notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content
requirements of a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR
807.87, the guidance, Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s 1 and the section
of CDRH’s Device Advice, How to Prepare a 510(k) Submission. 2
Under The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications; Final Guidance, 3 a
manufacturer may submit a Traditional 510(k) or has the option of submitting either an
Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k). FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides
the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device,
particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing that device.
Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen
the regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

3. The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission
An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21
CFR 807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the
device, its intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA
may consider the contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within
the meaning of 21 CFR 807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a
summary report. The report should describe how this guidance document was used
during the device development and testing and should briefly describe the methods or
tests used. We recommend that you also include a summary of the test data or
description of the acceptance criteria applied to address the risks identified in this
document, as well as any additional risks specific to your device. This section suggests
information to fulfill some of the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87, as well as some other
items that we recommend you include in an Abbreviated 510(k).

A. Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k)
and cite the title of this guidance document.

B. Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Please refer to Section 10. Labeling for specific information
that should be included in the labeling for devices of the types covered by this
guidance document.)

C. Summary report
We recommend that the summary report contain:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the performance specifications and, when
appropriate, include detailed, labeled drawings of the device. (Please refer to
Section 5. Device Description for specific information that we recommend you
include in the device description for devices of the types covered by this guidance
document.) You should also submit an “indications for use” enclosure. 4
Description of device design
We recommend that you include a brief description of the device design
requirements.
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess
the risk profile, in general, as well as the specific device’s design and the results
of this analysis. (Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health for the risks to health
generally associated with the use of this device that FDA has identified.)
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks
identified in this guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in
your risk analysis.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have
used or intend to use to address each performance aspect identified in Sections 810 of this guidance document. If you follow a suggested test method, you may
cite the method rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method,
you may cite the method but should provide sufficient information to explain the
nature of and reason for the modification. For each test, you may either (1)
briefly present the data resulting from the test in clear and concise form, such as a
table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that you will apply to your test
results. 5
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or testing,
you may include either:
•

a statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

a declaration of conformity to the standard. 6

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe
you cannot properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed
the testing which the standard describes. For more information, please refer to
section 514(c)(1)(B) of the Act and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in
Substantial Equivalence Determinations. 7
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks
identified through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about
aspects of the device’s performance characteristics. We may also request additional
information if we need it to assess the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. (Under 21
CFR 807.87(l), we may request any additional information that is necessary to reach a
determination regarding substantial equivalence.)

5

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the
subject device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being
introduced into interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance
criteria and, thus, differs from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA
recommends that submitters apply the same criteria used to assess modifications to
legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to determine whether marketing of the
finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional
510(k) that provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and
described in this guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods,
data, acceptance criteria, and conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain
modifications to their own cleared devices should consider submitting Special 510(k)s.
In general, the discussion above applies to any 510(k). The following is a specific
discussion of how you should apply this guidance document to a premarket notification
submission for dental handpieces.

4. Scope

If your dental handpiece is controlled by computer software, we recommend that you
submit the information for software-controlled devices described in Guidance for the
Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices. 8
The information we recommend you submit is determined by the “level of concern,”
which is related to the risks associated with software failure. The level of concern for a
device may be minor, moderate, or major.
We recommend you demonstrate that the use of your device does not present a thermal
hazard to the patient or the operator and describe the handpiece maintenance procedures
to prevent overheating of the handpiece. For example, you may wish to demonstrate that
patient contacting portions of the device do not present a thermal hazard.

8. Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility
We recommend you demonstrate the electrical safety of your device by following the
FDA-recognized standard below or equivalent methods:
•

IEC 60601-1:1988, Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 1: General requirements
for safety

We recommend you demonstrate the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of your
device by following the recommendation of the FDA-recognized standard below or
equivalent methods:

requirements for safety – 2. Collateral Standard: Electromagnetic compatibility –
Requirements and test.

9. Biocompatibility
FDA recommends that you conduct biocompatibility testing as described in the FDAmodified Use of International Standard ISO-10993, Biological Evaluation of Medical
Devices Part-1: Evaluation and Testing, 9 for limited contact with mucosal tissue. We
recommend that you select biocompatibility tests appropriate for the duration and level of
patient contact with your device. For some devices, ISO 7405:1997, Dentistry –
Preclinical Evaluation of Biocompatibility of Medical Devices Used in Dentistry –
Test Methods for Dental Materials, 10 may contain appropriate test methods. If
identical materials and identical material processing are used in a predicate device with
the same type and duration of patient contact, you may identify the predicate device in
lieu of providing biocompatibility testing.

10. Labeling
The premarket notification must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you
in preparing labeling that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 11 We
recommend labeling include:
•

maximum speed in rotations per minute (rpm)

•

types of connectors

•

type of chuck

•

warnings about thermal hazards

•

maintenance requirements

•

warnings about lubricant hazards (spray can labeling and packaging should
comply with other Federal requirements for transport and use).

•

operative speeds with gear reduction ratios.

Dental handpieces are generally provided to the user as nonsterile devices. Dental
handpieces, including the micromotors, should be sterilized before the first use and
between each patient use. We recommend that you provide instructions for the user on
how to sterilize the handpiece. The instructions should include the method of
sterilization and the cycle parameters, including the time, temperature and pressure. We
