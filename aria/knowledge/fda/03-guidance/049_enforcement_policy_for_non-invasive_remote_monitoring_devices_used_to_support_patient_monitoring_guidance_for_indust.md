Enforcement Policy for Non-Invasive
Remote Monitoring Devices Used to
Support Patient Monitoring
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency) plays a critical role in protecting the
United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and public health emergencies (PHEs).
Following the emergence of COVID-19, FDA first issued this guidance in March 2020 to
provide a policy to help expand the availability and capability of non-invasive remote monitoring
devices to address the PHE. At the time, FDA stated that the policy described in this guidance
was intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency related to
COVID-19 declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in accordance with
section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). On March 13, 2023, FDA announced in
the Federal Register notice “Guidance Documents Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19),”1 that this guidance document was being revised to continue in effect for 180 days
after the COVID-19 PHE declaration expires, and that, during that time, FDA intends to further
revise the guidance.
Non-invasive remote monitoring devices are used to acquire patient physiological data without
the need for in-clinic visits and facilitate patient management by healthcare providers while
reducing the need for in-office or in-hospital services. The policy set forth in this guidance was
initially intended to facilitate patient monitoring while reducing patient and healthcare provider

contact and exposure to COVID-19 by helping to expand the availability and capability of noninvasive remote monitoring devices during the COVID-19 PHE. Since first issuing the
Enforcement Policy for Non-Invasive Remote Monitoring Devices Used to Support Patient
Monitoring During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency
guidance in March 2020, FDA’s experience has demonstrated that the public health equities
weigh in favor of exercising certain enforcement policies for these devices beyond the expiration
of the COVID-19 PHE (which expired on May 11, 2023) and the 180-day period announced in
the March 13, 2023 Federal Register notice. More specifically, FDA has evaluated the benefits
and risks to patients and healthcare providers of exercising certain enforcement policies,
including identifying certain device types for which enforcement policies might be appropriate,
and assessing other lessons learned from implementation of COVID-19-related enforcement
policies for certain device types. Although this guidance has been revised to remove any
expiration date for the enforcement policy, among other things, FDA intends to continue to
monitor the situation and may make further revisions to the guidance, withdraw the guidance, or
pursue other regulatory actions, as appropriate.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standards referenced in this document,
see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 If submitting a Declaration of
Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, refer to the FDA guidance titled Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.3
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

Some devices with the product codes listed in Table 1 are exempt from premarket notification requirements in
section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (see 21 CFR 807.81), subject to the limitations in 21 CFR 874.9 and 882.9.
However, FDA believes that some modifications to these devices to facilitate remote patient monitoring would
trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a premarket notification because such modifications would
exceed the limitations of the exemption as identified in 21 CFR 874.9 and 882.9.

While audiometers, if in compliance with American National Standard Institute S3.6-1996, "Specification for
Audiometers,” are generally exempt from premarket notification requirements in section 510(k) of the FD&C Act
(see 21 CFR 807.81), subject to the limitations in 21 CFR 874.9, otoacoustic emission devices are not so exempt. 21
CFR 874.1050(b). Both the 510(k)-exempt and non-exempt devices described in 21 CFR 874.1050 are within the
scope of this guidance.
11
Although devices with this product code are class I and generally 510(k) exempt, many otoscopes have been
cleared through the premarket notification process because they have exceeded the limitations of exemption
identified in 874.9. FDA believes that modifications to existing otoscopes to allow for increased remote monitoring
capability may similarly trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a premarket notification; therefore, this
product code has been included within the scope of this guidance.
12
Devices in this classification regulation are subject to special controls. See 21 CFR 882.1470.
13
Except when the computerized cognitive assessment aid is intended for diagnostic assessment of specific diseases
or conditions and relies on inputs from visual cues, auditory cues, and/or functional use of the hand, a computerized
cognitive assessment aid is exempt from premarket notification requirements in section 510(k) of the FD&C Act
(see 21 CFR 807.81) subject to the limitations in 21 CFR 882.9. See 21 CFR 882.1470(b).

Devices in this classification regulation are subject to special controls. See 21 CFR 882.1580.
15
Unclassified devices are preamendments devices for which FDA has not yet promulgated a classification
regulation. Until the unclassified device type has been classified through regulation, marketing of new devices
within this device type requires submission of a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.

These non-invasive monitoring devices have the potential to be connected to a wireless network
through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection to transmit a patient’s measurements directly to
their healthcare provider or other monitoring entity.
The Oximeter (21 CFR 870.2700) and Clinical electronic thermometer (21 CFR 880.2910)
device types have been removed from Table 1 compared to the prior versions of FDA’s guidance
“Enforcement Policy for Non-Invasive Remote Monitoring Devices Used to Support Patient
Monitoring During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency.”

III. Policy
Manufacturers of the non-invasive remote monitoring devices listed in Table 1 are required to
submit a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act to FDA and receive FDA
clearance prior to marketing these devices in the United States, to the extent the devices are not
510(k) exempt, as well as comply with post-marketing requirements.
At this time, based on our current understanding of the risks of these devices, FDA does not
intend to object to limited modifications to the indications, functionality, or hardware or software
of certain non-invasive remote monitoring devices that are used to support patient monitoring
(hereinafter referred to as “subject devices”) without prior submission of a premarket notification
(“510(k)”) under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act (see 21 CFR 807.81) where such submission
would be required16,17 when the modification does not create undue risk and does not directly
affect the physiological parameter measurement algorithm. Examples of such modifications
include:
·
·

For subject devices previously marketed only for use in hospitals or other healthcare
facilities, a change to the indications regarding use in the home setting; and
Hardware or software changes to allow for increased remote monitoring capability.

In developing this policy, FDA’s intent is to foster the availability of certain non-invasive remote
monitoring devices that can help eliminate unnecessary patient contact and ease burdens on
hospitals, other health care facilities, and health care professionals, which are experiencing high
demands. Additionally, this policy is consistent with CDRH’s 2022-2025 strategic priorities18
focusing on advancing health equity, which includes increasing access to digital health
technologies that can advance better care, quality of life, and wellness of diverse populations.
16

For further guidance on modifications that trigger the requirement that a manufacturer submit a new 510(k) to
FDA, refer to the FDA guidances Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device, available
at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-changeexisting-device, and Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Software Change to an Existing Device, available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/deciding-when-submit-510k-softwarechange-existing-device.
17
Certain modifications to the indications, functionality, or hardware or software of 510(k)-exempt devices in Table
1 may require premarket notification if they exceed the limitations of the exemption under 21 CFR 874.9 and 21
CFR 882.9, respectively.

This policy supports this strategic priority and is intended to lessen the burden on both
manufacturers and FDA by reducing the number of 510(k) submissions caused by certain
modifications to allow for remote monitoring. As always, FDA may make case-by-case decisions
regarding the enforcement of legal requirements in response to particular circumstances and
questions that arise regarding a specific device or device type. FDA notes that the enforcement
policy in this guidance does not address any legal requirements other than premarket notification.

A.

Modifications to Indications or Functionality

At this time, FDA does not intend to object to limited modifications to the indications or
functionality of the subject devices that allow for increased remote monitoring capability without
prior submission of a 510(k) where the modification does not create undue risk and does not
directly affect the physiological parameter measurement algorithm. FDA generally believes such
a modification to the indications to allow for use in the home setting does not create such undue
risk and does not affect the physiological parameter measurement algorithm.
In contrast, modifications to the indications or functionality that could create such undue risk or
that could affect the physiological parameter measurement algorithm would not be within the
scope of this policy and would generally require submission of a 510(k).19 For example,
modifications to add new indications or device software functions20 to allow for remote
programming of the device, remote control of the device, generation of new alarms,
measurement of new physiological parameters, or a change from prescription to over-the-counter
use would not be within the scope of this policy.
FDA is also providing recommendations regarding labeling21 relevant to the enforcement policy
set forth above. FDA recommends that the subject devices use labeling that helps users better
understand the device. FDA recommends that the labeling include the following elements:
1) A clear description of the available data on the device’s new indications or functions,
including:
a. Device performance; and
b. Potential risks.

19

21 CFR 807.81(a)(3).
For purposes of this guidance, for any given product, the term “function” is a distinct purpose of the product,
which could be the intended use or a subset of the intended use of the product. For purposes of this guidance, a
“device software function” is a software function that meets the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the
FD&C Act. For details, see FDA’s guidance Multiple Function Device Products: Policy and Considerations,
available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/multiple-function-deviceproducts-policy-and-considerations.
21
Unless exempt from the requirement of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act (see 21 CFR Part 801, subpart D), a
device whose labeling does not bear adequate directions for use is misbranded. FD&C Act sec. 502(f)(1). 21 CFR
801.5 describes a number of reasons why directions for use may be inadequate. Prescription devices are exempt
from the requirement of section 502(f)(1) if all of the conditions identified in 21 CFR 801.109(a)-(e)—which govern
the device’s labeling, among other things—are met. See 21 CFR 801.109. Devices within the scope of this guidance
must follow applicable labeling requirements.
20

2) Information on use conditions, in particular, whether the device is intended for spotchecking, trend monitoring, or continuous monitoring.
3) For devices previously marketed for use only in a hospital or other healthcare facility and
for which the environment of use has been expanded to include in-home use, adequate
instructions for use in the home setting with appropriate lay terminology.

B. Modifications to Hardware or Software Intended to
Increase Remote Monitoring Availability or Capability
As described above, at this time, FDA does not intend to object to limited hardware or software
architecture modifications to subject devices that allow for increased remote monitoring
capability without prior submission of a 510(k) when the modification does not create undue risk
and where the modifications do not directly affect the physiological parameter measurement
algorithm. The manufacturer should also consider the recommendations in Section III.A, as such
hardware or software architecture modifications made to support patient monitoring may also
affect the device’s indications and functionality.
FDA expects that these types of modifications generally include device connectivity
modifications (e.g., the addition of wireless and/or Bluetooth capability), which may warrant
accompanying non-device22 and device hardware or software architecture modifications. Such
modifications generally do not create undue risk when the applicable FDA-recognized standards
and guidances are followed, and generally do not affect the physiological parameter
measurement algorithm; therefore, such a change would generally be within the scope of this
policy. To address any unique considerations or modifications beyond those described above,
manufacturers may wish to initiate discussions with FDA by contacting RPG@fda.hhs.gov or
through the Q-Submission Program.23
FDA recommends any such changes be designed, evaluated, and validated in accordance with
current FDA-recognized standards, including (as applicable):

Under the quality system (QS) regulation, “[e]ach manufacturer shall establish and maintain procedures for the
identification, documentation, validation or where appropriate verification, review, and approval of design changes
before their implementation.” 21 CFR 820.30(i). On February 23, 2022, FDA proposed to amend the device current
good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements of the QS regulation, 21 CFR part 820, to align more closely
with the international consensus standard for devices by converging with the quality management system (QMS)
requirements used by other regulatory authorities from other jurisdictions (i.e., other countries) (87 FR 10119;
available at https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/02/23/2022-03227/medical-devices-quality-systemregulation-amendments). Specifically, FDA proposed to amend the current part 820 by withdrawing the majority of
the requirements for establishing and maintaining a QS and instead incorporate by reference the 2016 edition of the
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485, Medical devices—Quality management systems—
Requirements for regulatory purposes, in part 820. As stated in that proposed rule, the requirements in ISO 13485
are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the current part 820, providing a similar level
of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to consistently manufacture devices that are safe and
effective and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. FDA will update references to provisions in 21 CFR part
820 in guidance documents as appropriate for consistency with revised regulations.
