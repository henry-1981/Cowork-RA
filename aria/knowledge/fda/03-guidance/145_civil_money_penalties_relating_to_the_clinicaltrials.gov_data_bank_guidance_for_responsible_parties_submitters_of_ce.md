Civil Money Penalties Relating to the ClinicalTrials.gov Data Bank
Guidance for Responsible Parties, Submitters of Certain
Applications and Submissions to FDA, and FDA Staff 1

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. This guidance does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of
the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the
appropriate FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate
FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the second title page of this guidance.

INTRODUCTION
This guidance document is intended to describe the current thinking of FDA’s Center for
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER), and Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) (hereafter, “Center” or
collectively, “the Centers”), regarding civil money penalties under section 303(f)(3) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). 2 That section authorizes FDA to
assess civil money penalties against responsible parties and/or submitters of certain
applications and submissions to FDA regarding drug products, biological products, and
device products (hereafter, “submitters”) who violate applicable FD&C Act prohibitions
relating to requirements under section 402(j) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS
Act), 3 including its implementing regulations in 42 CFR part 11, to submit clinical trial
registration and/or results information to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank and/or certain
certifications to FDA.
The guidance document addresses the following questions:
•

How do the Centers intend to identify whether responsible parties have failed to submit
required clinical trial registration and/or results information to the ClinicalTrials.gov data
bank or submitted false or misleading information to the data bank, or whether submitters

certification to FDA?

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II.

BACKGROUND

Section 801 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA)
amended section 402(j) of the PHS Act 5 to require that a “responsible party” submit
clinical trial registration and results information to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank for
certain “applicable clinical trials.” The section also requires a submitter to certify to FDA
that all requirements of section 402(j) have been met when submitting certain applications
and submissions to FDA regarding drug products, biological products, and device
products. FDAAA also directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary)
to promulgate regulations expanding the requirements for submission of clinical trial
registration and results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank. On September 21, 2016, the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services published the Final Rule for
Clinical Trials Registration and Results Information Submission, 81 Fed. Reg. 64,982
(Sept. 21, 2016), 6 which implements the provisions of section 402(j) of the PHS Act by
clarifying and expanding the clinical trial registration and results information
requirements. The regulations are codified at 42 CFR part 11 and were effective January
18, 2017, with a compliance date of April 18, 2017.
FDAAA also amended the FD&C Act to add section 301(jj), 7 which includes the
following prohibited acts:
1. Failing to submit or knowingly submitting a false certification to FDA under
section 402(j)(5)(B) of the PHS Act;

PHS Act; and
3. Submitting clinical trial information under section 402(j) to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank that is false or misleading under 402(j)(5)(D).
FDAAA further amended section 303(f)(3) of the FD&C Act 8 to authorize FDA to assess
civil money penalties against a person that commits these prohibited acts. The maximum
penalty amounts and factors considered when seeking civil money penalties are discussed
in Section III.E.

III.

DISCUSSION
A.

Definitions

The Centers intend to use the following definitions in implementing the FD&C Act’s civil
money penalty provisions relating to the submission of registration and results information
to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank and certain certifications to FDA.
1. Civil money penalty or civil monetary penalty: The terms “civil money
penalty” and “civil monetary penalty” are used interchangeably and mean
a monetary penalty assessed under section 303(f)(3) of the FD&C Act 9 for
prohibited acts (found in section 301(jj) of the FD&C Act10) relating to the
submission of clinical trial registration and results information to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank and certain certifications to FDA.
2. Applicable clinical trial: The term “applicable clinical trial” refers to an
applicable device clinical trial or an applicable drug clinical trial as
defined in 42 CFR 11.10(a).
3. Responsible party: The term “responsible party” means the individual or
entity required to submit clinical trial information for an applicable clinical
trial, as defined in 42 CFR 11.10(a).
4. Clinical trial information: The term “clinical trial information” means the
clinical trial registration and/or results information required to be submitted
to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank for an applicable clinical trial, as
defined in 42 CFR 11.10(a).

5. Certification to FDA: The phrase “certification to FDA” means the
certification required under section 402(j)(5)(B) of the PHS Act 11 that must
accompany an application or submission under sections 505, 510(k), 515, and
520(m) of the FD&C Act 12 and section 351 of the PHS Act. 13 Form FDA
3674 is used to certify that all applicable requirements of section 402(j) of the
PHS Act, including its implementing regulations in 42 CFR part 11, have
been met for all of the applicable clinical trials included in, relied upon, or
otherwise referred to in the application or submission. 14
6. Submitter: The term “submitter” means the individual or entity that submits
certain applications and submissions to FDA regarding drug products,
biological products, and device products and who provides a certification to
FDA under section 402(j)(5)(B) of the PHS Act. 15 In some cases, the
submitter may be someone other than the responsible party for an applicable
clinical trial identified in the certification.
B.

How do the Centers intend to identify whether someone has: failed to
submit required clinical trial registration and/or results information to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank; submitted false or misleading information to
the data bank; or failed to submit or knowingly submitted a false
certification to FDA?
The Centers generally intend to identify violations of the FD&C Act’s requirements
relating to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank through evidence collected during
inspections conducted as part of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program (BIMO).
How FDA will collect information to assess compliance with these requirements is
described in FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Compliance Program for Sponsors,
Contract Research Organizations and Monitors.16
In general, the Centers may also identify violations based on the evaluation of
complaints received by the Agency. The Centers intend to handle complaints in
accordance with their existing processes for handling complaints about potential
violations of FDA requirements. In evaluating complaints, the Centers may
review any public and non-public information available to FDA, including, but
not limited to, information submitted to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank and to
FDA.

C.

Under what circumstances may a Center decide to seek civil money penalties?
When a Center believes that a responsible party for an applicable clinical trial may have
committed a prohibited act under section 301(jj) of the FD&C Act 17 by failing to comply
with the PHS Act’s clinical trial registration and results information submission
requirements, including the regulations found in 42 CFR part 11, the Center generally
intends to send the responsible party a Preliminary Notice of Noncompliance (Pre-Notice)
Letter, which describes the potential violation and requests that the responsible party take any
necessary actions to address the potential violation within 30 calendar days after receiving the
letter. The Centers also generally intend to send a Pre-Notice Letter to submitters who may
have violated FDAAA’s certification requirements in section 402(j)(5)(B) of the PHS
Act. 18 Pre-Notice Letters notify the recipient that, beginning 30 calendar days after the date
a Pre-Notice Letter is received, FDA will conduct a further review and assessment of the
clinical trial information submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov and any other relevant
information available to FDA and that failure to comply with the requirements relating to
applicable clinical trials may result in further FDA regulatory action, including the
issuance of a Notice of Noncompliance, civil money penalties, injunction, and/or criminal
prosecution.
As discussed above, the Centers intend to identify potential violations of the FD&C Act’s
requirements relating to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank in part through evidence
collected during inspections conducted as part of FDA’s BIMO program. 19 Generally,
FDA’s BIMO activities are associated with the submission of a research or marketing
application or are a part of the Agency’s investigation of a complaint. When evaluating
potential violations identified during these activities, FDA intends to utilize a risk-based
approach to determine the situations in which Pre-Notice Letters will be issued, consistent
with FDA’s public health mission and how the Agency approaches its other compliance
programs. In applying this risk-based approach to evaluating potential violations of the
FD&C Act’s requirements relating to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank, the Centers intend
to focus their enforcement and regulatory attention in the following areas:
•

Responsible parties who have failed to submit required clinical trial registration
and/or results information under section 402(j) of the PHS Act, including its
implementing regulations in 42 CFR part 11, for applicable clinical trials of
products that potentially may pose a higher risk to human subjects or applicable
clinical trials of products intended to address significant public health need.
Examples may include, but are not limited to, applicable clinical trials of a drug

17

21 U.S.C. 331(jj).
42 U.S.C. 282(j)(5)(B).
19
Because investigators may not be able to assess whether required clinical trial information has been submitted to
the ClinicalTrials.gov databank at the time of an inspection, FDA does not intend to include on Forms FDA 483 any
observations regarding potential violations of requirements relating to the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank; however,
information that is collected by an investigator regarding potential violations of such requirements will be included
in the Establishment Inspection Report and provided to the relevant Center for further evaluation.

product, biological product, or device product that has not previously been
approved, licensed, or cleared by FDA and is intended to treat a serious and/or lifethreatening disease or condition and applicable clinical trials involving vulnerable
populations (such as pediatrics), rare diseases, or emergency research conducted
without informed consent under 21 CFR 50.24.
•

Responsible parties or submitters who have had a pattern of previous
noncompliance with the requirements to submit clinical trial information and/or
certifications under section 402(j) of the PHS Act, including its implementing
regulations in 42 CFR part 11.

•

Applicable clinical trials for which noncompliance with the requirements under
section 402(j) of the PHS Act, including its implementing regulations in 42 CFR
part 11, exists in conjunction with noncompliance with other statutory and/or
regulatory requirements pertaining to the conduct of the trial, for example the
failure to retain clinical trial records or the failure to obtain informed consent.

Pre-Notice Letters will be sent by certified mail, registered mail, mail delivery service, or
personal delivery to the responsible party for the applicable clinical trial at the address
specified in the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS), or to
the submitter at the address specified in the FDA application/submission. If a Center
cannot reach the entity or its agent at the address to which the Pre-Notice Letter is sent,
the Center intends to attempt to reach the entity or its agent through other means, for
example, through other addresses otherwise identified by the Center in applications or
submissions provided to the Agency. Pre-Notice Letters will include an FDA contact to
whom a response may be submitted and who can address any questions or concerns of the
responsible party/submitter.
After a Pre-Notice Letter has been received and the 30 calendar day period for any
necessary action has passed, the Center intends to review the information submitted to
the ClinicalTrials.gov data bank for that applicable clinical trial, the
application/submission in FDA files, and/or any other information available to the
Agency, to determine whether a violation exists. If the Center determines that a
responsible party failed to submit any required clinical trial information to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank and/or submitted information that is false or misleading in
any particular, the Agency will issue the responsible party a Notice of Noncompliance
under section 402(j)(5)(C)(ii) of the PHS Act. 20 If the Center determines that a submitter
failed to submit the required certification to FDA or knowingly submitted a false
certification, the Agency intends to issue a Notice of Noncompliance to the submitter. A
Notice of Noncompliance will notify the recipient of the Center’s determination and give
the recipient an opportunity to remedy noncompliance not later than 30 calendar days after
the notification. FDA intends to post the Notice of Noncompliance on the Agency’s
20

42 U.S.C. 282(j)(5)(C)(ii). The Secretary delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs the authority to issue
Notices of Noncompliance under this section. See https:/www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-09-26/pdf/201223598.pdf.

website and to transmit the Notice of Noncompliance to NIH so it can include the notice
regarding noncompliance required under section 402(j)(5)(E) of the PHS Act 21 in the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank.
In determining whether to seek civil money penalties, FDA intends to take into
consideration any corrective action taken by a responsible party or submitter after
receiving a Notice of Noncompliance. If a responsible party or submitter does not remedy
noncompliance within 30 calendar days after receiving a Notice of Noncompliance, the
Center generally intends to seek civil money penalties, taking into account the type of
noncompliance and the circumstances associated with the lack of remediation.
D.

What procedures apply when a Center seeks civil money penalties?
FDA regulations governing civil monetary penalty proceedings are found at 21 CFR part
17. Civil money penalty actions are initiated when the Center with principal jurisdiction over
the matter involved files a Complaint with FDA’s Division of Dockets Management and
serves the Complaint on the respondent (in this case, the responsible party or submitter).
The Complaint will be signed by the FDA Office of Chief Counsel attorney for the Center
and include allegations of liability against the respondent, the violations that are the basis
for the alleged liability, the reasons that the respondent is responsible for the violations, and
the amount of penalties and assessments that the Center is seeking. Additionally, the
Complaint will include instructions for filing an Answer to request a hearing and will warn
that failure to file an Answer within 30 days of service of the Complaint will result in the
imposition of the proposed amount of penalties and assessments, as provided in 21 CFR
17.11. 22
Upon being served, the respondent generally responds by: (1) either paying the penalty
sought in the Complaint; or (2) filing an Answer with the Division of Dockets Management
and contesting some or all of the Center’s allegations.23
If a respondent chooses to contest the matter, it must file an Answer to the Complaint
within 30 days after the date of service of the Complaint. 24 The Answer must admit or
deny each of the allegations made in the Complaint, and include any and all defenses to the
action and all reasons or explanations why the penalty and assessment should be less than
the amount requested in the Complaint. 25 If the respondent files an Answer within the time
prescribed, the respondent is entitled to a hearing according to the procedures established
in FDA’s regulations governing civil money penalty proceedings, codified in 21 CFR part
17.

After submitting an Answer, a respondent and its representatives may engage in
settlement discussions with the Center regarding the civil money penalty. 26 Respondents
may present relevant mitigating factors or arguments for the Center to consider reducing
the penalty amount. The parties may at any time before a decision on appeal agree to
settle all or part of the matter. After the respondent pays any agreed-upon penalty
amount and the parties sign a settlement agreement that is filed in the docket for the
matter, the case will be completely or partially resolved as designated by the settlement
agreement. 27
Cases that are not settled will be decided by a presiding officer, 28 either after an
administrative hearing or after a party files a motion for summary decision pursuant to 21
CFR 17.17 and briefing is completed. Upon request, for appropriate cause, the presiding
officer may expedite the schedule for various aspects of the hearing.
In advance of a hearing, parties are required to exchange exhibits and written
testimony. 29 Parties can choose to “rest” after the exchange of exhibits and written
testimony, or request an opportunity to cross-examine the opposing party at an oral
hearing and/or submit legal briefs. After resting, or after an oral hearing and/or further
briefing, the presiding officer will render an initial decision based on the administrative
record. The initial decision shall contain findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the
amount of any penalties and assessments imposed. 30
Under section 303(f)(6) of the FD&C Act, 31 after the presiding officer renders an initial
decision, either party can appeal to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Departmental Appeals Board (DAB). 32 The respondent may appeal an adverse DAB
decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia or any other circuit in
which the respondent resides or transacts business.
E.

What civil money penalty amounts may be assessed?
Civil money penalties may be assessed under section 301(jj) of the FD&C Act 33 for (1)
failing to submit required clinical trial registration and/or results information to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank, (2) submitting false or misleading information to the
ClinicalTrials.gov data bank, (3) failing to submit the required certification to FDA, or
(4) knowingly submitting a false certification to FDA.

The statutory maximum penalties under section 303(f)(3)(A) of the FD&C Act 34 for
committing these prohibited acts are not more than $10,000 for all violations adjudicated
in a single proceeding and, if a violation is not corrected within 30 days following
notification of such violation, section 303(f)(3)(B) of the FD&C Act 35 provides for an
additional civil money penalty of not more than $10,000 for each day that the violation
continues after such period until the violation is corrected. 36
Pursuant to section 303(f)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act, 37 in determining the amount of civil
money penalty under the relevant statutory limits, the following factors are considered:
the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation(s) and, with respect to the
violator, ability to pay, effect on ability to continue to do business, any history of prior
such violations, the degree of culpability and such other matters as justice may require.
