On November 26, 2024, FDA issued a guidance titled “Transitional Enforcement Policy for Ethylene
Oxide Sterilization Facility Changes for Class III Devices.” This Ethylene Oxide Sterilization guidance
provides information regarding FDA recommendations and general principles PMA and HDE holders of
Class III devices sterilized by ethylene oxide (EtO) whose products are affected by the potential, actual,
or temporary operation reductions at a sterilization facility may reference if they wish to have FDA
consider whether the exercise of enforcement discretion relating to the implementation of certain types
of sterilization site changes is appropriate.

On November 2, 2023, FDA issued a guidance titled “Enforcement Policy for Certain Supplements for
Approved Premarket Approval (PMA) or Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Submissions.” This
guidance provides clarification on FDA’s policies and regulatory review expectations for certain limited
modifications affecting the safety and effectiveness of a device required to have an approved PMA or
the safety and probable benefit of a device required to have an approved HDE at the conclusion of the
COVID-19 public health emergency.

Modifications to Devices Subject to
Premarket Approval (PMA) - The
PMA Supplement Decision-Making
Process
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document has been developed to provide the underlying principles and examples
to establish a clear and consistent way to approach the decision-making process you follow to
determine the type of regulatory submission, if any, that may be required when you modify your
lawfully marketed PMA device.
This guidance applies to class III devices that are subject to premarket approval application
(PMA) requirements of section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21
U.S.C. 360e). This guidance provides the criteria for industry and Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) staff to use in determining the type of PMA submission (i.e., traditional
PMAs, panel track supplements, 180-day supplements, real-time supplements, Special PMA
Supplements-Changes Being Effected, 30-day notices, manufacturing site change supplements,
or periodic reports) that you should submit to FDA when you modify the design or labeling of
your PMA device; its manufacturing process; or the location of manufacturing, processing, or
packaging. The guidance also provides examples of various types of device modifications,
describes the types of testing that were performed to support the safety and effectiveness for each
device modification, and the type of PMA submission that was submitted. It does not address
how to test a specific device to determine the effects of modifications.
This guidance applies to PMAs reviewed by CDRH and CBER. This guidance also applies if you
5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
modify your PMA device in response to a recall or field corrective action to assure the continued
safety and/or effectiveness of the device.
This guidance is not intended to replace existing, device-specific guidance or other guidance
documents related to the PMA program.1

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant scientific and legal
requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to comply with those
requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would be less burdensome,
please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send your written comments
to the contacts listed in the preface to this guidance or to the Ombudsman of CDRH and, where
relevant, CBER. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman and CBER Ombudsman,
including contact information, can be found on the Internet at CDRH Ombudsman and CBER
Ombudsman, respectively.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
The “PMA regulation” (21 CFR Part 814) sets forth general criteria for determining when you
must submit a PMA supplement or a 30-day notice for a device modification or manufacturing
change (21 CFR 814.39). Subpart B “Premarket Approval Application” of the PMA regulation
in Part 814 describes PMA amendments and supplements. Subpart E -“Post Approval
Requirements” describes requirements for continuing evaluation (post-approval studies),
periodic reporting, and other requirements related to the continued reasonable assurance of safety
and effectiveness of an approved PMA device. The Act defines different types of PMA
supplements that are used to request approval of a change to a device that has an approved PMA
(see section 737(4) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)) for definitions of 180-day supplements, realtime supplements, panel-track supplements). These definitions form the basis for the
recommendations provided in this guidance document.
The draft version of this guidance document, which was issued on March 9, 2007, was the result
of an extensive effort by a working group consisting of regulatory and scientific experts from
CDRH and CBER. That March 2007 draft guidance replaced the August 6, 1998 draft guidance
titled “Modifications To Devices Subject to Premarket Approval – The PMA Supplement

Decision Making Process.”2 Comments by the industry on the August 1998 draft and comments
we received at subsequent meetings on this issue were considered by FDA during the
development of the March 2007 draft guidance document.
In response to the comment period for the March 2007 draft guidance, FDA received the
following five general categories of comments from industry. Each category of comment, below,
is followed by FDA’s response.
·

·

·

·

·

Industry requested clearer interpretation of the PMA regulation as to when a supplement
is necessary (i.e., when a change to a device impacts or could impact safety and/or
effectiveness). Our response to this is included in Sections III and IV below.
Industry requested a detailed flowchart that would identify the type of supplement to be
submitted based on any specific change for any device. FDA understands that there is a
general desire among PMA applicants for such a detailed flowchart or easy-to-use
paradigm. However, FDA believes the complexity and variability of class III devices
makes it unfeasible to develop such a flowchart.
Industry requested specific definitions for some terms, such as “substantial clinical data,”
“significant change,” and “limited confirmatory clinical data.” Where possible, FDA
provided additional clarity for some terminology. Again, because of the complexity and
variability of class III devices, we do not believe it is feasible to provide detailed
definitions for certain terms and instead use examples to help illustrate the meaning of
these terms.
Industry requested that the guidance address 30-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(e)).
However, FDA has chosen not to include 30-day supplements within the scope of the
guidance document, in part, because we have not identified cases for which this provision
can be effectively applied.
Industry requested the addition of examples to illustrate the various supplement types as
well as periodic reports. While industry provided a number of examples, many such
examples did not contain sufficient details for inclusion in this guidance document.
However, examples that provided further clarification on the underlying principles were
added. In addition, the periodic report section was significantly increased in detail and
includes examples.

III. General Requirements for When a PMA Supplement is
Needed
Examples of the types of modifications that require a PMA supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)), if
such changes affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, include, but are not limited to, the
following:
·

new indications for use of the device;

2

The 1998 guidance titled “Modifications To Devices Subject to Premarket Approval – The PMA Supplement
Decision Making Process” was withdrawn on January 5, 2005 (70 FR 824) because of amendments made to the
Act after 1998 that affected our recommendations (i.e., the amendments made by the Medical Device User Fee
and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA) (Pub. L. 107-250), which added specific definitions for 180-day
supplement, real-time supplement, and panel-track supplement (section 737(4) of the Act)).

labeling changes;
the use of a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the
device;
changes in sterilization procedures;
changes in packaging;
changes in the performance or design specifications, circuits, components, ingredients,
principle of operation, or physical layout of the device; and
extension of the expiration date of the device based on data obtained under a new or
revised shelf life testing protocol that has not been approved by FDA. If FDA has
approved your protocol, the change should be reported in a periodic report (21 CFR
814.39(b)).

Under 21 CFR 814.39(f), you may submit, instead of a PMA supplement, a 30-day notice for
changes to manufacturing procedures or methods of manufacture that affect the safety and
effectiveness of your device. We recommend that you carefully assess whether a PMA
supplement (21 CFR 814.39(a)) or a 30-day notice (21 CFR 814.39(f)) is appropriate for any
modification you plan to undertake. The Quality System (QS) regulation (21 CFR Part 820)
requires that you have in place a system to document and assess design changes (21 CFR
820.30). Part of the assessment for all changes should include a risk analysis and validation (or,
where appropriate, verification) of the changes to the design or manufacturing process and
subsequent assessment of the need for regulatory submission. (More information regarding 30day notices is provided in Section F of this guidance document.)

IV. Determining the Type of PMA Submission
A primary indicator of what type of PMA submission is needed is the nature of the data, if any,
that is needed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the modified device. Each of the
following sections describes one of the various types of PMA submissions that may be submitted
to FDA (traditional PMA, a panel-track supplement, a 180-day supplement, a real-time
supplement, a Special PMA Supplement – Changes Being Effected, 30-day notice, and
manufacturing site change supplement). For each type of PMA submission, we discuss the kinds
of changes we would consider to be appropriate for the type of submission, the general nature of
test data we believe are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of such changes, and
criteria we may use when determining whether that type of submission should be submitted.
We also provide, in each section, examples of device modifications submitted to CDRH/Office
of Device Evaluation (ODE), CDRH/Office of In Vitro Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety
(OIVD), and CBER to illustrate what we believe are appropriate submissions for the type of
PMA submission discussed in that section. For each example, we provide the specific changes
that were made to the approved device, the impact that changes had on the intended patients or
on the use of the device, and the test data that FDA believes are needed to demonstrate that the
modified device remains safe and effective.
The examples below illustrate how FDA determines which particular supplement type is
warranted. These examples are straightforward in nature to demonstrate the underlying
principles. We expect that there may be more complex situations. If you need additional input
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
from FDA to determine the appropriate supplement type, please contact the appropriate review
branch or division.
Figure 1 at the end of this guidance document illustrates the steps we recommend you follow in
selecting the appropriate regulatory path for a modification to your PMA device.

A.

When to Submit a Traditional PMA

In general, a traditional PMA (rather than a PMA supplement) is appropriate when the
modifications you make to your approved PMA device result in a new device. We would
consider a new device to be one where a modification results in a device design so different from
the original version that the preclinical3 (“analytical” for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs)) and clinical
data4 you previously submitted on your original device are not applicable (i.e., not supportive)
for the specific change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of
the modified device.
In deciding whether to submit a supplement to your approved traditional PMA or to submit a
new traditional PMA5 for a modified device, we recommend you first ascertain whether, and to
what extent, you can rely on the preclinical testing and clinical data submitted in your traditional
PMA to support the safety and effectiveness of your modified device. If you need to conduct
both new preclinical testing and new clinical testing to demonstrate reasonable assurance of
safety and effectiveness of the modified device, you should assume that this is a new device that
will require a submission of a new traditional PMA.6
The examples below illustrate when FDA has considered a traditional PMA to be appropriate for
a device modification based on the types of changes made and the testing that was necessary to
demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Each example describes a device
reviewed in ODE, unless indicated as reviewed in OIVD or CBER.

(1)

Modified Device for a New Indication for Use

FDA approved a PMA for the TransMyocardial Revascularization (TMR) holmium laser for
surgical treatment of stable patients with angina that is refractory to medical treatment and not
amenable to direct coronary revascularization. In this procedure, the chest is opened by surgical
incision. Once the heart is exposed, the surgeon places the end of a fiber light guide onto the
surface of the epicardium and the laser is activated making a hole through the ventricular wall,
penetrating entirely through the wall into the ventricular cavity. This is repeated at several
3

For purposes of this guidance document, the term “preclinical testing” refers to non-clinical testing that is used
to characterize a device (e.g., animal, bench, biocompatibility, electrical safety, software, reproducibility,
reliability, accuracy, limit of detection, analytical testing).
4
For purposes of this guidance document, the term “clinical data” refers to data derived from a study using a patient
population with a defined clinical condition to determine the safety and effectiveness of the device, including
clinical performance characteristics (e.g., clinical specificity, clinical sensitivity). Clinical data are not limited to data
obtained from an investigational device exemption (IDE) study and could include foreign data and literature.
5
In lieu of a traditional PMA, you may submit a modular PMA. The criteria and process for the modular review
program are discussed in FDA guidance document titled “Premarket Approval Application Modular Review”.
6
For the purposes of this guidance document, new preclinical or clinical data are those collected in accordance
with an existing or different protocol.

locations in the region to be treated.
The PMA applicant modified its laser system by incorporating it into a fiber optic guide to make
it suitable for percutaneous use. The PMA applicant also modified the indication for use to
include percutaneous myocardial revascularization (PMR), a non-surgical procedure. In PMR,
the surgeon percutaneously places a catheter containing a fiber optic light guide into the left
ventricle and uses the laser to make several gouges in the endocardium (inside) ventricular wall.
The TMR device creates a hole that penetrates the inside ventricular wall and the PMR device
creates a gouge that scoops out tissue, but does not penetrate through the ventricular wall (i.e.,
the injury to the myocardial tissue is different). To assess the impact of this change, new
preclinical testing was necessary to demonstrate that the performance of the device, such as
maneuverability, and reliable deployment and retraction, were adequate for percutaneous use.
New clinical data were also necessary because of the possibility of differences in the clinical
outcome that could result from the differences in the indication for use of the devices (TMR vs.
PMR), as well as to assess the difference in risk between an open surgical procedure and a
percutaneous procedure.
Because new preclinical and clinical data were necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance
of safety and effectiveness for the modification, FDA determined that the changes resulted in a
new device and as such, a submission of a traditional PMA was appropriate for this modification.

(2)

Modified Device with New Clinical Effects

FDA approved a PMA for an implantable cardiac pacemaker system consisting of a pulse
generator and a lead. The system is indicated for patients who have bradyarrhythmias or other
cardiac conduction abnormalities. The PMA applicant modified the lead by adding a steroid
eluting piece to the distal lead tip to reduce the inflammatory process (where the lead comes in
contact with the endocardial tissue) and the impedance between the lead and the tissue. As a
result, the amount of energy (the stimulation threshold) needed to achieve heart pacing was
reduced, and the battery life was improved. The indication for use for the modified device
remained the same as the original device.
The modified lead design raised questions related to device performance such as longer battery
life and lower stimulation threshold, as well as questions of clinical safety and effectiveness. To
adequately assess these changes, it was necessary for the PMA applicant to conduct new
preclinical testing to characterize the electrical performance and biocompatibility of the modified
lead, as well as animal studies to demonstrate the in vivo effect of the steroid on pacing
stimulation thresholds. New clinical data were also needed to demonstrate that the steroideluting lead remained as safe and effective as the approved non-steroid lead. Because new
preclinical and clinical data were needed to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness of the modified design, FDA determined that this change resulted in a new device
and as such, a submission of a traditional PMA was appropriate for this modification.

(3)

Modified Analyte and Indication/Patient Population (OIVD)

FDA approved a PMA for an in vitro diagnostic immunoassay for the detection of total prostatespecific antigen (total PSA) in serum to aid in detection of prostate cancer in conjunction with

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the digital rectal exam (DRE). Free prostate-specific antigen (free PSA) is a component of the
total PSA. The PMA applicant modified the device to detect free PSA in serum, which was
considered a new analyte, and added a new indication, to distinguish prostate cancer from benign
prostate disease. The PMA applicant also intended that the device be used in a new patient
population with defined total PSA levels and specific DRE characteristics. Consequently, the
original preclinical and clinical data were no longer adequate to support a finding of safety and
effectiveness of the modified device. The analytical performance characteristics, (e.g., precision,
reproducibility, and sensitivity) of the two assays differ. In addition, the clinical performance
characteristics (e.g., clinical sensitivity and specificity) also differ.
To demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the modified device in the
new patient population, new analytical (i.e., preclinical testing) and clinical data were necessary.
Therefore, FDA determined that a traditional PMA was appropriate for this modification.

(4)

Significant Modification of Technology (OIVD)

FDA approved a PMA for the in vitro detection of bladder cancer in urine that used microwell
enzyme immunoassay (EIA) technology (i.e., the reagents and analyte react in solution). The
PMA applicant modified the technology to a membrane-bound EIA (i.e., the reagents are bound
to a membrane and the urine specimen is applied to the membrane). Because of the differences
in the two technologies, the analytical performance characteristics (e.g., precision,
reproducibility, and sensitivity) and the clinical performance characteristics (e.g., clinical
sensitivity and specificity) of the two assays differ. Therefore, to demonstrate a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for this new technology, new analytical and clinical data
were necessary. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a traditional PMA was
appropriate for this modification.

B.

When to Submit a Panel­Track Supplement7

The FDA regulation 21 CFR 814.39(c) refers to any type of PMA supplement. However,
specific types of PMA supplements are defined under the Act. The term "panel-track
supplement" is defined in section 737(4)(B) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)(B)), (added by
MDUFMA, as amended by the Medical Devices Technical Corrections Act (MDTCA) (Pub. L.
108-214 (2004))), as:
“a supplement to an approved premarket application or premarket report under section
515 that requests a significant change in design or performance of the device, or a new
indication for use of the device, and for which substantial clinical8 data are necessary to
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.”

7

21 CFR 814.44 describes when a Panel meeting may be held. Not all panel-track supplements require a Panel
meeting or input. For more guidance on Panel meetings, please refer to the FDA guidance document titled
“Procedures for Meetings of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee”.
8
For the purposes of this guidance only, FDA considers the term "substantial clinical data" in the definition of
panel-track supplement to refer to a new clinical data set that is intended to provide valid scientific evidence
necessary to support the safety and effectiveness of the modified device (i.e., the clinical data provided in support of
the original device approval is no longer applicable in supporting the approval of the modified device). Human
factors data are not considered substantial clinical data because they are specifically focused on evaluating the
interaction between the device and the user and not to answer whether the device does what it is intended to do.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We consider panel-track supplements to be the most appropriate supplement type for changes in
the indication for use requiring substantial clinical data (i.e., new clinical data), with or without
limited new preclinical testing. A change in the indication for use may incorporate a change to
the intended patient population, disease state, or to other clinical aspects of the device use, such
as duration of use, anatomical site, or surgical procedure. Changes in these clinical aspects
would generally require significant labeling changes for which new clinical data are generally
needed to support those changes. We also consider a panel-track supplement to be the most
appropriate supplement type for a change to, or removal of, a contraindication.9
A panel-track supplement, therefore, should be submitted for a change in indication for use or a
change to (or removal of) a contraindication of the device because:
· substantial clinical data (i.e., new clinical data) are necessary to provide reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness for that change; and
· indication or contraindication changes generally either do not require or require very
limited new preclinical testing (i.e., all or most of the preclinical data previously
submitted and reviewed in the traditional PMA are still applicable for the change in
indication).
The following examples illustrate when FDA has considered a panel-track supplement to be
appropriate for a modification based on the types of changes made and the testing that was
necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

(1)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Patient Population

FDA approved a PMA for a ventricular assist device (VAD) indicated for the temporary,
mechanical circulatory support of nonreversible left ventricular failure in patients awaiting
cardiac transplant (as a temporary bridge to transplantation). The PMA applicant modified the
indication for use to include patients not eligible for cardiac transplantation (i.e., “destination
therapy”). No modifications were made to the device itself. In destination therapy, the VAD is
permanently implanted.
There are significant differences in the clinical conditions of these two patient populations. For
example, destination therapy patients are precluded from a transplant because they do not meet
the age requirement or they have one or more co-morbid conditions (e.g., diabetes). The PMA
applicant conducted clinical studies for the proposed change to the indication for use to
demonstrate safety and effectiveness in this new patient population.
In addition, destination therapy patients will use the device for a much longer period (years)
compared to patients who use it as a temporary bridge to transplantation where the device may
be used only for a few weeks or months, and rarely longer than 1 year. New clinical data were
needed to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for longer term
implantation. Although the device itself was not modified, the new conditions of use raise a new
preclinical concern regarding device reliability. Therefore, the reliability test that was conducted
for the original PMA had to be repeated to support the safety and effectiveness for use in the new
patient population. The test conditions were modified to reflect the new clinical use conditions.
9

For example, the original contraindication specified all pediatric patients, but the applicant wants to modify the
contraindication so that only neonate patients are contraindicated.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA determined that a panel-track supplement was appropriate for this modification because
new clinical data were needed to support the safety and effectiveness of the device and, although
some additional preclinical testing was needed to address the new conditions of use, the full
battery of preclinical testing was not needed because the device itself was not modified.

(2)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Patient Population

FDA approved a PMA for a urethral stent indicated to relieve urinary obstruction secondary to
recurrent bulbar urethral strictures. The PMA applicant requested FDA’s approval to market the
identical device for the treatment of urinary obstruction secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia
(BPH). In the original indication for urethral strictures, the device is inserted into the bulbar
urethra in order to improve urine flow and prevent recurrence of strictures. In the new indication
for BPH, the urethral stent compresses the enlarged prostatic tissue widening the urinary tract
within the prostatic urethra in order to relieve urinary symptoms. The use of the permanent stent
in this new urethral location (i.e., the prostate) introduces different safety concerns as compared
to the traditional indication because the new target patient population has different risks related
to age, overall health and anatomical location where the device is to be used. Strictures typically
occur in younger healthy men, whereas patients with BPH are generally men greater than 60
years of age and who may have more health problems. The different anatomical location also
presents new risks (e.g., adverse tissue response due to the presence of the stent in hyperplastic
tissue, ejaculatory impairment, and associated reduced fertility).
Because of the clinical differences related to age, overall health, and anatomical location where
the device is to be used between the new and traditional patient populations, new clinical data
were needed to support the safety and effectiveness of the new indication for use. No new
preclinical data were needed because the device was not modified and the conditions of use (e.g.,
implant duration) were similar. Therefore, FDA determined that a panel-track supplement was
appropriate for this modification.

(3)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Patient Population

FDA approved a PMA for a high frequency oscillatory ventilator (HFOV) indicated for
ventilatory support and treatment of respiratory failure and barotrauma in low birth weight
neonates. The PMA applicant modified the indication to include ventilatory support and
treatment in adult patients with (adult) respiratory distress syndrome. The device itself was not
modified. The patients in the original PMA consisted of infants with respiratory failure
associated with lung immaturity, or other causes of respiratory failure in newborns. The new
indication was for adults with adult respiratory distress syndrome, which is a condition
associated with trauma and sepsis. Although both groups suffered from respiratory failure, the
underlying lung pathology, the cause of the lung pathology, and the potential clinical outcomes
for the two populations are different. Because of these clinical differences between these two
patient populations, new clinical data were needed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
device in the new population. Since the device and the conditions of use remained the same, no
new preclinical testing was necessary. Therefore, FDA determined that a panel-track supplement
was appropriate for this modification.

(4)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Patient Population
(OIVD)

FDA approved a PMA for a glucose monitoring system for detecting trends and tracking patterns
in glucose levels in adults with diabetes. The PMA applicant modified the indication for use to
add pediatric patients. The differences between adults and children, in body surface area, daily
activities, physiology, and underlying disease may affect clinical outcomes in the two patient
populations. For this reason, it was necessary to conduct new clinical testing to demonstrate that
the device provided reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the new pediatric patient
population. Since the device and the conditions of use remained the same, no new preclinical
testing was necessary. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a new panel-track
supplement was appropriate for this modification.

(5)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Surgical Procedure

FDA approved a PMA for an excimer laser system for photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for
the reduction or elimination of myopia (nearsightedness). The PMA applicant modified the
indication to add laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), a different procedure, for the
reduction or elimination of myopia using the identical laser system. PRK uses laser ablation on
the surface of the cornea to reshape it, whereas LASIK involves cutting a flap in the cornea and
using laser ablation underneath the flap. The new indication involves a more invasive procedure
with different risks associated with the creation, replacement, and maintenance of the flap.
There were also new risks and clinical effectiveness concerns associated with the intrastomal
ablation used in the new indication. These concerns include a different healing response, longer
recovery times, different ablation profiles and deeper ablation into the cornea, potentially leaving
it thinner, which may affect the physical integrity of the eye. Therefore, new clinical data were
needed to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the new indication
for use. No preclinical testing was necessary because the device was not modified and the
conditions of use remained the same. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a
panel-track supplement was appropriate for this modification.

(6)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Conditions of Use

FDA approved a PMA for a soft silicone hydrogel extended wear (1 to 7 days) contact lens
indicated for the correction of myopia or hyperopia. The PMA applicant modified the indication
to include extended wear up to 30 days. The device remained unchanged and the intended
patient population remained the same; however, the conditions of use changed. The extended
time of wear raised new safety concerns including increased risk of ocular adverse events, such
as corneal microbial keratitis, and corneal infiltrated lesions. To evaluate the risks associated
with extended wear from 7 days to up to 30 days, substantial clinical data were necessary to
demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. No new preclinical testing was
needed because the testing previously performed adequately addressed the new conditions of
use. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a panel-track supplement was
appropriate for this modification.

(7)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Specimen (Sample)
Type (CBER)

FDA approved a PMA for an HIV diagnostic (whole blood specimens). The PMA applicant
modified the indication to oral fluid specimens without any modification to the device itself, i.e.,
a new sample type only. The characteristics of oral fluid specimens are different from that of
whole blood specimens. Therefore, clinical data were necessary to determine the safety and
effectiveness of the device. However, while the specimen matrix changed, the actual analyte
(HIV antibodies) did not. In this case, limited analytical studies were sufficient to examine
specimen matrix effects. A panel-track supplement would be appropriate for this modification
because only new clinical data and limited additional analytical data would be needed to support
the safety and effectiveness of the device.

(8)

Change in Indication for Use - Different Physiological
Location

FDA approved a PMA for a prosthetic heart valve for use in the aortic position. The PMA
applicant modified the indication to include the mitral position. No changes were made to the
device itself. In the mitral position, the valve is subjected to different physiological conditions,
such as valve closing pressures and flow rates, from the aortic position. These conditions can
affect the performance of the valve by affecting the hemodynamics (e.g., forward flow pressure
drop (gradient) and regurgitation). These conditions can also affect the complication rates for
thrombosis, thromboembolism, and hemolysis. The physiological and potential performance
differences between the two positions may significantly impact clinical outcome. Therefore, new
clinical data were needed to ensure that the heart valve remained safe and effective when
implanted in the new location. Additional preclinical testing was not needed because the test
data provided in the original PMA to support the valve for use in the aortic position were
sufficient to support the valve for use in the mitral position. Therefore, FDA determined that the
submission of a panel-track supplement was appropriate for this change.

When to Submit a 180­Day Supplement

According to section 737(4)(C) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)(C)), "180-day supplement" is
defined as:
“a supplement to an approved premarket application or premarket report under section
515 that is not a panel-track supplement and requests a significant change in components,
materials, design, specification, software, color additives, or labeling.”
Submission of a 180-day supplement is required for certain types of significant changes to the
approved device that affect safety or effectiveness of the device. In general, for a change to be
submitted as a 180-day supplement, the clinical data provided in support of the traditional device
approval should still be applicable in supporting the approval of the modified device.
In most cases, for such modifications, only new preclinical testing is needed to demonstrate
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the modified device. In some instances,
however, additional limited confirmatory clinical data may be necessary to provide a bridge
between the clinical data set for the original device and the expected clinical performance of the
modified device. Confirmatory clinical data typically involve a limited number of patients,

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
shorter study duration, and/or a subset of endpoints as compared to the clinical data set for a
traditional PMA. In these situations, FDA believes that a 180-day supplement, rather than a
panel-track supplement, is appropriate because of the limited nature of the supplementary clinical
data.
The applicant should submit a 180-day supplement for certain significant changes, including the
following changes:
·
·
·
·
·

the principle of operation;
the control mechanism;
the device design or performance;
the labeling; and
new testing requirements or acceptance criteria.

Below are examples illustrating when FDA has considered a 180-day supplement to be
appropriate for a device modification, based on the types of changes made and the testing that
was necessary to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.

(1)

Design Change

FDA approved a ventricular assist device (VAD) intended as temporary mechanical circulatory
support for patients awaiting a cardiac transplant. The applicant changed the design of the
percutaneous ventricular lead in order to improve the interaction between the lead and the patient
by making the lead more flexible and smaller in diameter. This design change was intended to
reduce the physical damage to the lead at the site where it exits the patient. No change was made
to the indication for use and the patient population. To demonstrate that the modified device
remained safe and effective, only mechanical tests, such as pull/bend/twist testing were needed.
Since FDA determined that this change could be evaluated with mechanical tests and no new
clinical data were needed, the submission of a 180-day supplement was appropriate for this
change.

(2)

New Device Feature

FDA approved a PMA for an excimer laser system indicated for wavefront-guided LASIK to
reduce or eliminate myopia and astigmatism. The PMA applicant added an iris identification and
registration system to the device to control for torsional movement of the eye. No changes were
made to the indication for use, the intended patient population, the ablation characteristics of the
excimer laser, or the intended clinical outcome. For this change, FDA determined that
preclinical testing such as engineering tests, visual optics evaluation, and software validation
along with the revised labeling were adequate to demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety
and effectiveness of the modification. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a 180day supplement was appropriate.

(3)

Modified Chemical Formulation

FDA approved a PMA for a hydrophilic contact lens. The PMA applicant modified the chemical
formulation of the lens by adding an ultraviolet (UV) light blocking material and also modified
the manufacturing process. For this change, FDA determined that preclinical testing to assess
the modified manufacturing processes, biocompatibility, shelf-life, UV light transmission, and

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
materials characterization, including an assessment of leachability, was sufficient to demonstrate
a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of this modification. Therefore, FDA
determined that the submission of a 180-day supplement was appropriate for this change.

(4)

Hardware and Software Modifications

FDA approved a PMA for a transurethral microwave system that is indicated to relieve
symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The PMA applicant modified
several critical components of the system, including the computer motherboard, computer
operating system, and software for the user interface screens. To demonstrate that the modified
device met the specifications of the original device (and remained safe and effective),
comparative bench testing was needed, including software, electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC), electrical safety, shock, vibration, and functional testing. The treatment parameters and
algorithm remained unchanged such that clinical data were not needed to evaluate the
performance of the modified device. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a 180day supplement was appropriate for this change.

(5)

New Analyzer – Assay Unchanged (OIVD)

FDA approved a PMA for a total prostate-specific antigen (total PSA) immunoassay using an
automated analyzer. The PMA applicant developed a new automated analyzer to perform the
total PSA assay. The indications for use and the technology of the total PSA assay remained
unchanged, and no new clinical data were warranted. The PMA applicant conducted new
analytical performance testing at internal and external sites to demonstrate that the new analyzer
does not alter the performance of the assay. Therefore, FDA determined that a submission of a
180-day supplement was appropriate for this change.

(6)

Design and Software Modification

FDA approved a PMA for a bone growth stimulator for use as an adjunct to primary lumbar
spinal fusion surgery. The PMA applicant changed the type of battery used and modified the
LCD display, which required modifications to the housing, the printed circuit board, and the
software. Because these changes impacted the electrical characteristics of the device, it was
necessary to conduct preclinical testing, including EMC, electrical safety, shock and vibration,
battery life, software and functionality to verify that the modified device operated within the
original device’s specifications. Clinical data were not necessary to support the safety and
effectiveness of the modified device. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a 180day supplement was appropriate for this change.

(7)

Modified Physical Characteristics

FDA approved a PMA for an endovascular stent graft system for the treatment of infra- renal
abdominal aortic or aorto-iliac vessels. The PMA applicant modified the physical characteristics
of the material used in the manufacture of the stent graft. The modified material had the same
chemical composition as the original material; however, the weaving process was different. The
new graft was woven into a denser weave configuration, which was intended to enhance the
robustness of the graft material. Bench testing (e.g., dimension verification, joint strength, burst
strength, tensile strength, fatigue, and water permeability) was needed to demonstrate that the
new weaving process did not adversely affect the physical performance properties of the device.
Animal testing was also needed to compare the vessel healing and patency of the new material

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
with the material used in the original device. Preclinical testing, including animal testing, was
adequate to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a 180-day supplement was appropriate for this
change.

(8)

New Device Feature

FDA approved a PMA for a cardiac radiofrequency (RF) ablation system. The PMA applicant
modified the system by adding a feature that allows the physician to visualize catheter navigation
during the procedure. The modification did not change the delivery of RF energy to the tissue,
and therefore, the clinical performance of the device was not impacted by this modification.
Consequently, clinical data were not necessary to support this change. However, verification and
validation testing were needed to assess the performance of the modified device. This
assessment consisted of bench testing including functionality, EMC, lesion qualification,
compatibility testing (between the generator, which has the new feature, and the approved
catheters) and animal testing. Bench testing and animal testing were adequate to demonstrate a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the modified device. Therefore, FDA
determined that the submission of a 180-day supplement was appropriate for this change.

(9)

Design Change

FDA approved a PMA for a pneumatic ventricular assist device (VAD) intended as temporary
mechanical circulatory support for patients with heart failure awaiting a cardiac transplant. The
PMA applicant modified the system from a pneumatically driven system to an electrically driven
one by replacing the original controller with a new device controller. The PMA applicant was
asked to conduct bench testing to demonstrate the similarities and differences between the
performance characteristics (e.g., flow pattern, pressures, alarm functions) of the new controller
and the original controller. A limited confirmatory clinical study was also needed to confirm that
the modification did not raise new safety and effectiveness questions. The new bench testing and
the limited confirmatory clinical study of the modified device, along with the original clinical
data set, were sufficient to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the
modified device. Therefore, FDA determined that the submission of a 180-day supplement was
appropriate for this change.

(10) New Specimen (Sample) Type (CBER)
FDA approved a PMA for an HIV diagnostic intended for fingerstick, whole blood specimens.
The PMA applicant modified the device for use with venipuncture, whole blood specimens.
Specimen characteristics of venipuncture blood and fingerstick blood are not significantly
different. The PMA applicant conducted analytical (e.g., reproducibility) and limited clinical
data (e.g., clinical sensitivity and specificity) to confirm adequate performance of the
modification to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for the
modification. The clinical data necessary to support this modification was limited. Therefore,
FDA determined that the submission of a 180-day supplement was appropriate for the change.

D.

When to Submit a Real­Time Supplement

According to section 737(4)(D) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379i(4)(D)) (added by MDUFMA, as
amended by MDTCA), a "real-time supplement" is defined as:
“a supplement to an approved premarket application or premarket report under section
18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
515 that requests a minor change to the device, such as a minor change to the design of
the device, software, sterilization, or labeling, and for which the applicant has requested
and the agency has granted a meeting or similar forum to jointly review and determine
the status of the supplement.”
For additional information about the type of changes that qualify for a real-time supplement, as
well as the process for the real-time review program, please refer to the FDA guidance document
titled “Real-Time Premarket Approval Application (PMA) Supplements.”
The following examples illustrate when FDA has considered a real-time PMA supplement to be
appropriate, based on the types of changes made, the testing that was necessary to demonstrate a
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, and other applicable criteria. Please note that
FDA is not aware of a situation in which a real-time supplement would be appropriate for
changes that affect an indication for use; therefore, there are no discussions of changes to
indications in the examples below.

(1)

Minor Modification to Correct Battery Failures

The PMA applicant made minor modifications to the circuitry associated with the battery
supervisor chip in the portable driver used with its ventricular assist device (VAD). The
modification was intended to correct a battery failure problem. The bench testing was conducted
using a test method that was previously accepted by FDA and was sufficient to support the
change to the device. In addition, the supporting test data for this change were within the single
scientific discipline of electrical engineering. Therefore, FDA determined that a real-time
supplement was appropriate for this change.

(2)

Alternative Sterilization Method

The PMA applicant employed an alternative sterilization method for its cardiac ablation catheter.
The sterilization method used was a method that was previously reviewed and approved by FDA
for this type of device. Validation testing alone was sufficient to ensure the alternative method
adequately sterilized the ablation catheter. In addition, the supporting test data for this change
were within the single scientific discipline of sterilization. Therefore, FDA determined that a
real-time supplement was appropriate for this change.10

(3)

Storage Temperature Change

The PMA applicant increased the upper limit for the storage temperature from 25°C to 30°C for
its bone graft (i.e., recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein). This is a minor change to
the storage condition and device labeling. Stability data at the new higher temperature was
sufficient to support the change and was conducted using an accepted test method. In addition,
the supporting data for this change were within the single scientific discipline of materials
engineering. Therefore, FDA determined that a real-time supplement was appropriate for this
change.

10

Changes in sterilization method (e.g., dry heat sterilization to gamma radiation) should not be reviewed under the
30-day notice program because a change in sterilization method could impact the device specifications and/or
performance.

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(4)

Extended Shelf Life

The PMA applicant modified the labeling of its injectable gel for facial wrinkles and folds to
extend the shelf life from 24 months to 36 months. Accelerated and long-term testing was
performed to evaluate the physical, chemical, and biological stability of the device during
storage. This is a minor change to the labeling and the stability studies are well understood and
have a well defined protocol. In addition, the supporting data for this change were within the
single scientific discipline of microbiology. Therefore, FDA determined that a real-time
supplement was appropriate for this change.11

(5)

Component Offered as Stand Alone System

The PMA applicant proposed to modify an excimer laser system by offering the wavefront
system and the surgery planning software included in the original system as a stand-alone system
to allow the surgeon to prepare for surgical cases in advance. There were no actual changes to
the wavefront system or the surgery planning software, and both were included in the original
PMA. Verification and validation of data transfer from the excimer laser system to the standalone system was sufficient to support this minor change. In addition, the supporting data for
this change were within the single scientific discipline of electrical engineering. Therefore, FDA
determined that a real-time supplement was appropriate for this change.

(6)

Alternate Wet Shipping Solution

The PMA applicant proposed to use an alternate wet shipping solution for its permeable
extended wear contact lenses. This solution was one that was previously approved by the FDA
for other contact lenses. The concerns with this type of change included biocompatibility of the
new solution, compatibility with the contact lens, adequate preservative efficacy (i.e., ability to
maintain low bioburden), and adequate labeling (identification of solution and preservative).
The supporting data for this change were within the single scientific discipline of microbiology.
Therefore, FDA determined that a real-time supplement was appropriate for this change.

(7)

Modified Bonding Method

The PMA applicant modified the method of bonding the retention balloon to the catheter in its
transurethral microwave system to enhance balloon reliability. This was a minor change,
adequately supported by bench testing using the test method previously described in the original
approved PMA. In addition, the supporting data for this change were within the single scientific
discipline of mechanical engineering. (Note that it was also determined that this particular
change in bonding method could impact the device specifications and/or performance.12)
Therefore, FDA determined that a real-time supplement was appropriate for this change.

11

If a shelf life protocol was approved for extended shelf life testing in an approval order for a traditional PMA
(or an approval order for a subsequent supplement), then the shelf life testing results can be reported as part of the
annual report.
12
If the change in bonding method had no potential impact on the device specifications and/or performance,
then this type of change may be appropriate for review under the 30-day notice program.

E. When to Submit a Special PMA Supplement – Changes
Being Effected13
Sections 21 CFR 814.39(d)(1) and (d)(2) provide that certain labeling and manufacturing
changes that enhance the safety of the device or the safety in the use of the device may be
submitted as a supplement marked “Special PMA Supplement – Changes Being Effected.” The
Special PMA Supplement is a narrow exception to the general rule that prior FDA approval of
changes to a PMA, including the labeling for a device, is a condition of lawful distribution and,
therefore, may only be utilized when (1) the applicant has newly acquired safety-related
information; (2) the information in question was not previously submitted to the FDA; and (3)
the information involves labeling changes that add or strengthen a contraindication, warning,
precaution, or information about an adverse reaction for which there is reasonable evidence of a
causal association.
Prior to approving a PMA, the FDA undertakes a detailed review of the proposed labeling,
allowing only those safety-related warnings for which there is reasonable evidence of a causal
association. Allowing the applicant to add a safety-related warning using a Special PMA
Supplement based on information that was known to the FDA during the rigorous PMA review
process would undermine that important process. For the same reason, the applicant may not add
a safety-related warning to avoid potential liability under state tort law if there is not reasonable
evidence of a causal association for the new warning. Instead, the applicant may utilize the
limited Special PMA Supplement only when it possesses new information that provides a
scientifically legitimate foundation for modifying the FDA-approved labeling. For these types of
changes, the applicant may place the change in effect prior to receipt of a written FDA order
approving the supplement, provided that the following exist:
· the PMA supplement and its mailing cover are plainly marked “Special PMA Supplement
– Changes Being Effected;”
· the PMA supplement provides a full explanation of the basis for the changes;
· the applicant has received acknowledgement from FDA of receipt of the supplement; and
· the PMA supplement specifically identifies the date that such changes are being effected.
Although the applicant may place a change into effect prior to the receipt of a written FDA order
approving the change, any such change should be considered temporary while FDA reviews the
supplement, including the basis for how the change enhances the safety of the device or the
safety in the use of the device. Design changes are not considered appropriate for a Special
PMA Supplement. For example, if the applicant attempted to change the design of an
implantable cardiac device so that it can be more securely held in place inside the patient's chest
cavity, such a change would be inappropriate for a Special PMA Supplement.
Although the regulation allows both labeling and manufacturing changes that enhance the safety
of the device or the safety in the use of the device to be submitted as a Special PMA Supplement,
13

FDA recently published a final rule entitled, “Supplemental Applications Proposing Labeling Changes for
Approved Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices” (73 Fed. Reg. 49603, August 22, 2008,
https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2008/08/22/E8-19572/supplemental-applications-proposinglabeling-changes-for-approved-drugs-biologics-and-medical). This final rule, in part, amends 21 CFR
§§ 814.3, 814.39(d)(1) and (2). The recommendations in this guidance are consistent with the final rule.

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA believes that labeling changes (as described in 21 CFR 814.39(d)(2)) are most appropriate
for a Special PMA Supplement. However, changes to the quality control or manufacturing
process may fall under the scope of this provision. The manufacturing changes that may be
reviewed as a Special PMA Supplement are generally those that add a step to the quality control
or manufacturing processes to enhance safety but not to impact effectiveness.
If the quality control or manufacturing process modification enhances safety and also impacts
effectiveness, then we believe that change is not appropriate for a Special PMA Supplement and,
instead, a 30-day notice is more appropriate. However, a PMA supplement (e.g., real-time
supplement, 180-day supplement) may be more appropriate if the quality control or
manufacturing process change impacts the device specifications and/or performance of the
device.
Below we provide examples to illustrate when FDA has considered a Special PMA Supplement
to be appropriate, based on the types of labeling and manufacturing changes made.

(1)

New Warning Added

The PMA applicant made a labeling change in the technical manual for its neurological
implantable programmer, by adding a warning against using the device in the presence of any
flammable anesthetic mixture in conformance with the FDA-recognized standard (i.e.,
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 60601-1 Medical Electrical Equipment - Part 1:
General Requirements for Safety). Because this modification to the warning of the labeling
enhanced safety with no impact on effectiveness, a Special PMA Supplement was appropriate.

(2)

Manufacturing Process Change

The PMA applicant made a modification to its manufacturing process for the source wire
component of its intravascular brachytherapy system, by adding a secondary wipe station to the
manufacturing process. The PMA applicant made this change as a result of detecting incidental
radioactive contamination during routine cartridge exchanges. This change was made to provide
an additional safeguard to ensure effective removal of contaminants from the wire surface prior
to transfer in a production cartridge. Because this modification enhanced safety with no impact
on effectiveness, a Special PMA Supplement was appropriate.

(3)

Improved Instructions

The PMA applicant made a labeling change to its urethral stent to improve the instructions for
device removal after urothelial coverage. Because this modification enhanced safety with no
impact on effectiveness, a Special PMA Supplement was appropriate.

(4)

Additional Inspection Step in the Manufacturing Process

The PMA applicant added an additional incoming inspection step (i.e., measuring the outer
diameter of the distal end of the stopcock) to the manufacturing process of a duett sealing device
(sealing femoral arterial puncture site). The purpose of this step was to ensure that there was a
tight fit between the two mating parts: the distal end of the stopcock and the proximal end of the
hub sleeve knob. This change enhanced the reliability of the catheter by more reliably ensuring a
proper fit when the user attached these two components together. Since the change enhanced the
safety in the use of the device with no impact on effectiveness, a Special PMA Supplement was

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
appropriate.

(5)

Additional Inspection Step in the Manufacturing Process

The PMA applicant added an additional inspection step to the manufacturing process for its bone
growth stimulator as a result of observing an increased frequency of a particular error message.
A greater than normal air gap between two inductors on one of the circuit boards was the source
of the error. The process was modified to assess the air gap between the conductors, thereby
better ensuring the reliability of the device. Since the change enhanced the safety of the device
and did not impact effectiveness, a Special PMA Supplement was appropriate.

F.

When to Submit a 30­Day Notice

Section 515(d) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 360e), as amended by the Food and Drug Administration
Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA)(Pub. L. 105-115), permits a PMA applicant to submit
written notification to the agency of a modification to the manufacturing procedure or method of
manufacture affecting the safety and effectiveness of the device rather than submitting such
change as a PMA supplement. The applicant may distribute the device 30 days after the date on
which FDA receives the notice, unless FDA finds such information in the 30-day notice is not
adequate, notifies the applicant that the submission has been converted to a 135-day supplement
(21 CFR 814.39(f)), and describes further information or action that is required for acceptance of
the modification. For additional information about the type of changes that qualify for a 30-day
notice and for information on when FDA may convert a 30-day notice to a 135-day supplement,
refer to the FDA guidance document titled “30-Day Notices, 135-Day Premarket Approval (PMA)
Supplements and 75-Day Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Supplements for Manufacturing
Method or Process Changes”.
Below, we provide examples of the types of changes that FDA has considered to be appropriate
for the submission of a 30-day notice. In some cases, the 30-day notice was converted to a 135day supplement because the supporting information was inadequate. For those cases, we have
included an explanation for the conversion.

(1)

Manual to Automated Process

The PMA applicant has a specified manufacturing process for a cardiac resynchronization
therapy pacemaker (CRT-P). As part of its manufacturing process, there is a manual process for
applying medical adhesive. The PMA applicant made a change that involved automating the
process of applying the medical adhesive to the device header and affixing the header to the
device case. Adequate information was submitted to support the 30-day notice for the
manufacturing change.

(2)

Alternate Qualified Supplier of Critical Component (OIVD)

The PMA applicant has a qualified supplier for the manufacture of a critical component used in
the calibrator of its Hepatitis B surface antigen assay. The change in manufacturing process
involved identifying a different qualified supplier for this component that met the same
specifications. Adequate information was submitted to support the 30-day notice for the change
in supplier. This included, but was not limited to, specifications for the raw material, supplier
evaluation procedures, and a description of the type and extent of control over the raw
material/supplier for the old and new material/supplier.
23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(3)

Alternate Qualified Supplier of Critical Material

The PMA applicant has a qualified supplier for polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) material, a
critical material used in the manufacture of a single-piece intra-ocular lens. The PMA applicant
submitted a 30-day notice identifying a different qualified supplier for the PMMA material that
met the same specifications. This 30-day notice was converted to a 135-day supplement because
the submission did not contain all the tests necessary to qualify the new supplier, such as optic
tilt test and axial displacement test.

(4)

In-Process Quality Control Step Change

The PMA applicant has numerous quality control steps for the manufacture of an inflatable
penile prosthesis. An in-process quality control monitoring step for endotoxin testing is part of
the manufacturing process. The PMA applicant made a change that included moving the inprocess quality control monitoring step for endotoxin to a different location in the process flow.
The PMA applicant provided adequate documentation in the 30-day notice to support this change
in the manufacturing process of the prosthesis.

(5)

Manual to Automated Process Conversion

The PMA applicant submitted a change to the manufacturing process for forming and folding the
balloon wings of an Over-the-Wire Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTCA) catheter
from a manual process to an automated process. This 30-day notice was converted to a 135-day
supplement because the submission did not contain all of the appropriate testing (e.g., balloon
fatigue test, rated burst pressure test, and validation data) to support the change.

(6)

Modified In-Process Test

The PMA applicant of a vascular closure device submitted a 30-day notice to incorporate an
alternate backup deployment test methodology in its manufacturing process. The notice was
converted to a 135-day supplement because the test methods and acceptance criteria used to
support this change were either not clearly explained or not provided in the submission.

(7)

Modified Sterilization Process Parameters

The PMA applicant submitted a change to allow sterile product release based on demonstration
of conformity to pre-defined sterilization parameters (parametric release) rather than release
based on demonstrating no growth of biological indicators (conventional release). The PMA
applicant provided adequate documentation in the 30-day notice to support this change in the
sterilization process.

G. When to Submit a Manufacturing Site Change
Supplement
After approval of a PMA, an applicant shall submit a PMA supplement for review and approval
by FDA before making a change that affects the safety or effectiveness of the device, including a
change that uses a different facility or establishment to manufacture, process, or package the
device.14 Such a PMA supplement for a move to a different facility or establishment is called a
14

“manufacturing site change supplement.”
Manufacturing site change supplements are 180-day supplements (21 CFR 814.39(c) and
814.40) that are reviewed by CDRH’s Office of Compliance (CDRH/OC) or OIVD (for in vitro
diagnostic devices).15 Manufacturing site change supplements include those that require preapproval inspection, as well as those that do not.16 CDRH intends to issue a separate guidance
document for manufacturing site change supplements that describes the criteria for
manufacturing site change supplements and when an inspection would likely occur. Accordingly,
this information is not included in this guidance document. Applicants should contact
CDRH/OC or OIVD in advance of the submission to discuss what information should be
provided.

V.

Periodic Reports

In accordance with 21 CFR 814.82(a)(7), FDA may require as a condition of approval
submission to FDA at intervals specified in the approval order of periodic reports containing the
information required by 21 CFR 814.84(b). In most cases, after the PMA is approved, the PMA
applicant is required to submit reports to FDA annually unless a different time frame is specified
in the approval order. Accordingly, periodic reports are typically referred to by FDA and
industry as “annual reports.”
For changes that do not require the submission of a traditional PMA or a PMA supplement, you
should provide this information as part of your annual report.17 However, it should be noted that
simple changes related to the device documentation or manufacturing process documentation,
such as rewording or expanding for clarification, translating from one language to another,
correcting typographical errors, and moving component characteristics from an engineering
drawing note to a different document (e.g., standard operating procedure), do not need to be
reported in the annual report.
Below, we provide examples of the types of changes that FDA has considered to be appropriate
to be submitted as part of an annual report because the Agency did not believe that these impact
safety or effectiveness.

Extension of the expiration date of the device based on data obtained under an approved
protocol, as specified in an approval order.
Lowered the clean room temperature shutdown limit to provide a comfortable
environment for personnel per environmental, health, and safety requirements. Reducing

If the applicant submits a supplement that includes both a design change and a manufacturing site change, then
ODE or OIVD will be the lead review office and will consult with OC.
16
In previous guidance to industry, FDA described “express supplements” as manufacturing site change
supplements that did not require pre-approval inspection. However, FDA no longer uses the “express
supplement” terminology to distinguish these supplements from the other types of manufacturing site change
supplements. Nevertheless, the expectation is that for a manufacturing site change supplement that does not
require a pre-approval inspection, the review process is shorter.

(PMA)” for more details.

a maximum temperature specification does not impact the safety and effectiveness of the
device.
Increased the number of products sampled for release testing. Increasing the number
better assures that product released meets the specifications.
Tightened the allowed viscosity range for the balloon dipping process from 27.0 – 157.0
to 78 – 82. The larger range is acceptable, but the restricted range is optimal for low
processing times and high yields.
Changed the in-process testing data collection form to record actual resistance readings
for the continuity failure test rather than recording pass/fail.
Added a clarification to include a minimum cure time to the manufacturing instructions
for the boot adhesive step. The prior manufacturing instructions contained no minimum
cure time.
Updated the processing instructions to incorporate an alert limit (±0.2°C) and tolerance
limit (±0.4°C) around the processing temperature (35°C). Although the processing
temperature is unchanged, these limits are new. Per industry standards, the limits are
based on the calibration tolerance of the thermocouple used to control this process. The
alert and tolerance limits provide additional assurance of device quality, and were set
using industry standards.
Updated the in-process test procedures to re-implement a back-up method for testing
poppet pressure and pump flow rate. The primary test method uses an automated test
procedure. This specific change re-implements the non-automated (mechanical) test
method, to be used as an alternate method in the event that the automated method is offline. The non-automated test evaluates the same performance characteristics as the
automated test. Also, since the non-automated test was previously validated and
incorporated in the pump manufacturing process, re-implementation of this change
restores the manufacturing procedures to their previous state.
