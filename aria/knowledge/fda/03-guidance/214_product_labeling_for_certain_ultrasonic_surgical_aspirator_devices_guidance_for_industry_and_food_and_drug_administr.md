Product Labeling for Certain
Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator Devices
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is issuing this guidance to recommend the addition of
a specific safety statement to the product labeling of certain ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices.
Ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices are surgical tools intended to fragment, emulsify and
aspirate hard and soft tissue. These devices can be used in many different surgical specialties for
a wide range of procedures, including the debulking of malignant tumors. Ultrasonic surgical
aspirators cause tissue fragmentation through the delivery of ultrasound energy to target tissue
through an oscillating tip. Tissue fragments are aspirated through the inner lumen of the device.
This mechanism of action creates the potential for tissue dissemination. The incorporation of
suction/aspiration reduces but cannot eliminate this potential.
In light of the risk of tissue dissemination from use of these devices, the FDA is providing a
specific labeling recommendation in this guidance to promote the safe and effective use of
ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices may be indicated for use in a wide range of surgical
applications, including but not limited to neurosurgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery,
orthopedic surgery, laparoscopic surgery, open surgery, and gynecologic surgery. Because
ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices use an oscillating tip to cause tissue fragmentation through

the delivery of ultrasound energy to target tissue, there is the potential for tissue dissemination
that is mitigated but not completely eliminated by the use of suction/aspiration.
FDA is aware that ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices are sometimes used to treat advanced
malignancy through cytoreduction (also known as debulking). In these cases, the device is used
to remove a portion of a malignant tumor that cannot be completely excised, in an effort to
enhance the effectiveness of ancillary treatments (such as radiation or chemotherapy). When
used in advanced cancers, the risk of adverse clinical effects from tissue dissemination may be
small compared to the device’s potential benefits, such as more extensive tumor debulking,
no/minimal collateral thermal damage, and the ability to avoid resection/removal of organs.
However, in certain clinical circumstances, the unintended dissemination of cancerous cells may
have a significant adverse effect that outweighs any demonstrated benefits. FDA is aware that
labeling of certain ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices allows for use in the removal of uterine
fibroids, although this use may not be explicitly stated in the labeling and FDA is not aware of
these devices being used for this purpose.1 There are currently no reliable preoperative screening
procedures to detect uterine sarcoma in women with presumed benign fibroids. Use of an
ultrasonic surgical aspirator during treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids on a woman with
an occult uterine sarcoma could result in dissemination of this cancer. This risk of cancer
dissemination outweighs any potential benefits in this patient population, particularly since there
are alternative treatment options available.
For these reasons, FDA recommends that the labeling of certain ultrasonic surgical aspirator
devices include a contraindication against use of the devices for removal of uterine fibroids.

III. Scope
Ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices may have general indications for use (e.g., laparoscopic
surgery, open surgery) or specific indications for use (e.g., gynecologic surgery). This guidance,
and the labeling recommendation below, applies to ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices with
indications for use in laparoscopic surgery, open surgery, or gynecologic surgery as such
surgeries can include gynecologic procedures. These devices are regulated under several
different product codes, including LFL (Instrument, Ultrasonic Surgical) and NLQ (Scalpel,
Ultrasonic, Reprocessed). Some devices regulated under these product codes may utilize
different technology (e.g., they do not aspirate), and would not fall within the scope of this
guidance.

On November 25, 2014, FDA issued the “Immediately in Effect Guidance Document: Product Labeling for
Laparoscopic Power Morcellators”
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/UCM424123.
pdf) to address new scientific information that represents a significant change to the benefit/risk profile for
laparoscopic power morcellators (LPM). Specifically, FDA reviewed scientific information that suggests that the use
of LPMs contributes to the dissemination and upstaging of an occult uterine malignancy in women undergoing
laparoscopic gynecologic surgery for presumed fibroids. FDA is generally not aware of reports of dissemination or
upstaging of occult uterine malignancies related to ultrasonic surgical aspirators at this time. FDA is recommending
the contraindication in this guidance, rather than the contraindication in the LPM guidance, in light of the fact that
ultrasonic surgical aspirators are generally not intended nor used for the removal of uterine fibroids.

This guidance does not apply to ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices with an indication for use
only for other surgical subspecialties, e.g., gastrointestinal and affiliated organ surgery,
urological surgery, neurosurgery. For example, this guidance would not apply to devices
indicated only for neurosurgical fragmentation and aspiration.

IV. Recommended Labeling Statement
FDA recommends that manufacturers of ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices with indications for
use in laparoscopic surgery, open surgery, or gynecologic surgery prominently include the
following Contraindication in their product labeling:
CONTRAINDICATION: This ultrasonic surgical aspirator device is not indicated for
and should not be used for the fragmentation, emulsification, and aspiration of uterine
fibroids.
In addition to including the above Contraindication in the product labeling, we recommend
manufacturers review and update other portions of their labeling to be consistent with this
Contraindication. For example, a manufacturer may revise the list of procedures in the labeling
for which the ultrasonic surgical aspirator can be utilized.
FDA believes accurate product labeling is important to make health care providers and patients
aware of situations when these devices should not be used. FDA believes that the
Contraindication is important for the safe and effective use of these ultrasonic surgical aspirator
devices.
Within 120 days of the publication of this guidance, a manufacturer with an existing 510(k)
clearance should: 1) add the Contraindication to its labeling; 2) submit both the current labeling
and revised labeling to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH); and 3) provide
updated labeling to purchasers of these ultrasonic surgical aspirator devices that have already
been distributed.2
If a manufacturer with an existing 510(k) clearance adds the Contraindication listed above, FDA
does not intend to object if such labeling changes are submitted as an amendment (“add to file”)
to the existing 510(k) rather than as a new 510(k). We recommend that manufacturers bundle
510(k) amendments for these labeling changes as appropriate.
In addition, manufacturers submitting a new 510(k) for a new or significantly modified device
should include these labeling recommendations in the submission.

2

FDA recommends that a manufacturer provide updated labeling in a way to help ensure purchasers are aware of it,
such as posting the updated labeling on the manufacturer’s website and notifying purchasers that they can access the
updated labeling on that website.
