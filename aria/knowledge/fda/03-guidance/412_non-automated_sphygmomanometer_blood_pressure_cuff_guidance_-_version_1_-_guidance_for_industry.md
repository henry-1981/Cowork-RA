Non-automated Sphygmomanometer
(Blood Pressure Cuff) Guidance1
1.

Scope
This guidance in intended to aid in the preparation or review of premarket notification
(510(k)) applications for some of the devices regulated under:
CFR Section:
Class:
Panel:
Product Code:

21 CFR §870.1120, Blood Pressure Cuff
II
Circulatory System Devices Panel (74)
DXQ

This guidance applies to blood pressure cuffs covered by the ANSI/AAMI SP9-1994
standard for non-automated sphygmomanometers (SP9 standard). Included in the SP9
standard are non-automated sphygmomanometers that use (1) an occluding cuff, (2) either
an aneroid or mercury gravity sphygmomanometer to measure pressure, and (3) a
stethescope or other manual system for detecting Korotkoff sounds.
This guidance does not apply to any automated non-invasive blood pressure monitors, whether
using the oscillometric method or any other method, nor does it apply to direct or invasive blood
pressure monitoring systems. These devices are classified elsewhere.
This guidance is complementary to the requirements of 21 CFR § 807.87. Other
information not identified in this guidance may be required in a 510(k) application. This
guidance is subordinate to all other applicable statutes, regulations, and policies.

2.

Regulatory Requirements
a.

A "Statement of Intended Use," an explicit description of all clinical functions
performed by the device, e.g., measures systolic and diastolic blood pressures, etc.;

b.

An "Indications for Use Statement," according to Office of Device Evaluation
policy. Indications for use should include the intended patient population and
contraindications (when the device is or is not to be clinically used);

c.

In vitro Performance Testing
Substantial equivalence can be demonstrated by showing either (1) sufficient
comparison testing with a legally-marketed predicate device, (2) conformance to
the SP9 standard, or (3) conformance to any foreign or domestic standard which
meets or exceeds the requirements of the SP9 standard.
i.
Comparison Testing
It is strongly recommended that substantial equivalence be demonstrated by
showing conformance to the SP9 standard. However, if the manufacturer
chooses to provide comparative testing, the provided data should meet the
Suggested Format for Test Reports (listed below) and account for the
following:
(1)
The manufacturer should identify all of the safety and effectiveness
issues for their device. These issues can be identified independently
or in parallel with the SP9 standard, i.e., a testing issue identified in
the SP9 standard is usually (but not always) relevant to the safety
and effectiveness of a device. The SP9 standard may not be
sufficient, however, for every device;
(2)
There should be sufficient comparison testing provided to
encompass every safety and effectiveness issue related to the
device. Usually, a test will be necessary if it is capable of evaluating
a failure mode, functional limitation, or a labeling claim for the
device;
(3)
All testing should evaluate the device in worst case and normal
operating conditions. The worst case scenario should be justified
and based on the clinical or actual use of the device;
(4)
The comparison testing should be scientifically sound and have a
statistically valid sample size. Since this usually results in a large
sample size, most manufacturers rely on the smaller sample size
required by the SP9 standard;
(5)
The pass/fail criteria of the SP9 and other standards cannot be used.
Rather, the new device should show better or equal performance as
compared to the predicate device.
ii.

SP9 Standard Testing
To show conformance to the SP9 standard, the manufacturer should list each
of the requirements of the standard and describe how the device conforms to
each requirement.2 For in vitro testing, the test protocol, test data and
results, and analysis should be provided and clearly identified. The
appropriate detail for each element of a test report is described below in
Suggested Format for Test Reports. For devices with unique features or
intended uses, additional testing beyond the SP9 standard may be necessary.

2 If SP9 becomes a “Recognized Standard,” it will not be necessary to submit the test report. Instead, a “Declaration of
Conformity” should be submitted (see the “Guidance on the Recognition and Use of Consensus Standards”). Refer to
the CDRH Web page for the most recent list of Recognized Standards.

If the SP9 standard is chosen by the manufacturer, conformance to the
entire standard should be demonstrated. Conformance to portions of
the standard is usually insufficient to permit the standard’s use or to allow a
labeling claim to that effect. Therefore, if only part of the standard is met,
the manufacturer should refer to the Comparison Testing section of this
guidance.
iii.

Foreign Standards
If the manufacturer chooses to conform to a standard other than the SP9,
list each requirement of the SP9 standard, compare the foreign standard to
the SP9 requirements, and clearly identify where the foreign standard does
not meet the requirements of the SP9 standard (if at all). Justification for
any differences should be based on valid scientific or statistical analyses and
supported by testing if necessary.

c.

Additional Testing
In addition to the testing described above, the manufacturer should evaluate the
intra-device variability among a minimum of three devices.

d.

Suggested Format for Test Reports
In general, any in vitro test report should include the following:
i.
Test Protocol
The test protocol should include:
(1)
the purpose of the test;
(2)
a clear description (with schematics) of the test set-up and any
device modifications;
(3)
identification and precision of equipment used;
(4)
step-by-step descriptions of the data collection methods used;
(5)
derivation of any formulae used;
(6)
justification for the testing parameters (e.g., testing temperature,
length of test, the selection of device modes, etc.) and the pass/fail
criteria. The testing parameters and pass/fail criteria should be
conservative and based on the extreme clinical use of the device,
according to the intended use or applicable standard. Depending on
the test, it may be appropriate to base the testing parameters on the
normal use of the device. However, if an extreme exists, it should
be explored.
ii.

Test Data and Results
The test data and results should include:
(1)
clearly labeled data with appropriate units;
(2)
data that is easily associated with the methods described in the
protocol;
(3)
if graphs are present, a table listing each data point shown on the
graph;

if calculated values are present, a section showing how the values
were calculated according to formulae presented in the protocol;

Analysis
An analysis should include:
(1)
an evaluation of the test data according to the pass/fail criteria and
purpose defined in the test protocol;
(2)
identification of the inadequacies and accuracy of the test;
(3)
evaluation of any need for additional testing;
(4)
a clear conclusion within the scope of the particular test.

In Vitro Safety Testing
a.

Biocompatibility
The manufacturer should identify all patient and operator contacting materials and
conform to the International Standard ISO-10993, “Biological Evaluation of
Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing.” For materials that are widely
used in the same or similar applications, supportive information demonstrating the
material’s use in other medical devices or products may be acceptable in
establishing biocompatibility. However, any references should be to the same
vendor and material, and account for any changes to the material due to
subsequent processes or manufacturing (e.g., sterilization, forming, melting).

b.

Sterilization
Blood pressure cuffs usually have no sterile components; however, if sterile
components are identified, refer to the 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance #K90-1
(February 1990) or the most recent sterilization policy or guidance.

c.

Shelf Life
Usually a shelf life is not applicable to blood pressure cuffs. However, if the
device contains any sterile or degradable components, shelf life data may be
necessary.
