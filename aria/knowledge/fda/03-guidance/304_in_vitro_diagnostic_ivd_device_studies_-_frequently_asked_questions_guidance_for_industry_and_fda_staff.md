In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) Device Studies  
Frequently Asked Questions 
 
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current 
thinking on this topic.  It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and 
does not operate to bind FDA or the public.  You can use an alternative approach if the 
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.  If you 
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for 
implementing this guidance.  If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the 
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.  
 
 
I. Background 
 
The Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR) Part 812, sets forth regulatory requirements for studies of 
investigational devices.  Certain investigational IVD device studies (see the Glossary), 
however, are exempt from most of the provisions of 21 CFR Part 812 (21 CFR 
812.2(c)(3)).1  This guidance document, written in question and answer format, is 
intended to assist you2 (the manufacturer, sponsor, applicant, investigator and the IVD 
device industry in general) in the development of IVD studies, particularly those exempt 
from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation and to provide you with a broad 
view of the regulatory framework pertaining to the development phase of IVD devices. 
The information in this guidance document is also pertinent to investigators who 
participate in IVD studies and to institutional review boards (IRB) that review and 
approve such studies. The document is intended to facilitate the movement of new IVD 
technology from the investigational stage to the marketing stage.  
 
1 As explained below, even if a particular IVD study is exempt from most requirements of 21 CFR Part 
812, studies that will support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (Disqualification of a 
Clinical Investigator), 21 CFR Part 50 (Informed Consent), and 21 CFR Part 56 (Institutional Review 
Boards). 
 
2 For the purpose of this document, “you” refers to the manufacturer, sponsor, applicant, investigator and 
the IVD device industry in general. If the text refers only to one or some of these entities, the appropriate 
entity is referenced 
by its name.

This guidance document outlines FDA regulations applicable to studies for 
investigational IVD devices, including those regulations related to human subject 
protection. The guidance also explains data considerations that ultimately will affect the 
quality of the premarket submission. This document includes a glossary, a reference list 
with related web addresses, and a quick-reference table. 
 
The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research (CBER) each have regulatory responsibilities for IVD devices; 
information included in this document applies to Class I, II, and III IVD devices 
regulated by either Center. 
 
Note: Some devices used to test blood donor suitability, and blood donor and 
recipient compatibility are licensed as biological products under Section 351 of 
the Public Health Service Act and are subject to the applicable regulations in 21 
CFR Parts 600-680 . Examples of licensed biologics devices include blood donor 
screening tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C 
tests intended for blood screening and reagents used in blood grouping, antibody 
detection and identification, and crossmatching for pre-transfusion compatibility 
testing. This guidance is written to address only IVD devices that are approved or 
cleared under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and Part 800 of 
the device regulations, regardless of which Center reviews the submission. If you 
have questions about a device licensed by CBER, you may go to the CBER 
website for published guidance 
(http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInf
ormation/default.htm) or contact CBER for further information on applicable 
guidance and regulations. (See Introduction, Section II, question # 4, of this 
guidance for a listing of CBER contact numbers).  
 
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable 
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and 
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory 
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that 
something is suggested or recommended, but not required. 
 
II. Introduction 
1. What is the purpose of this guidance document and how does it differ from other 
guidance documents related to IVD products? 
 
FDA prepared this comprehensive document as a resource for you and for its own 
staff to address issues concerning IVD studies. This guidance document contains 
information relevant to studies conducted during the development of a new IVD 
product, as well as other general considerations about applicable requirements and 
marketing of the new device. It addresses particularly those investigational studies 
that are exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR Part 812. IVD 
study investigators and members of IRBs who review and approve such studies

may also find it helpful. There are also device-specific guidance documents 
available for specific IVD products that can be found at 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfggp/search.cfm.  The use of 
investigational IVD devices in clinical studies designed to evaluate new drug 
products falls outside the scope of this guidance. 
 
2. Why are in vitro diagnostics considered devices? 
 
In vitro diagnostics (IVDs) meet the definition of a device under the Act. Section 
201(h) of the Act defines a device as: 
“an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in 
vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, 
part, or accessory, which is— 
(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United 
States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them, 
(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, 
or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in 
man or other animals, or 
(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of 
man or other animals, and 
which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical 
action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not 
dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary 
intended purposes.” 21 U.S.C. 321(h) (emphasis added). 
 
3. How do IVD devices differ from other devices? 
 
Most other devices function on or in a patient. In contrast, IVDs include products 
used to collect specimens, or to prepare or examine specimens (e.g., blood, serum, 
urine, spinal fluid, tissue samples) after they are removed from the human body.

2. How do I determine the applicability of the IDE regulation to my IVD study? 
 
We recommend that you begin with the exemptions in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Your 
proposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits 
any one of the following three categories: 
 
a. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in 
commercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical 
Device Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the 
Glossary for definition), and is used or investigated according to the 
indications in the labeling at that time. 
 
b. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been 
found to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is 
used or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed 
by FDA in determining substantial equivalence. 
 
c. The IVD  
• is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c); 
• is noninvasive (see question #5 below); 
• does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents   
significant risk (see question #4 below); 
• does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject; 
and 
 
 
 
 


 
9
• is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the 
diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or 
procedure (see question # 6 below). 
 
For your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE 
regulation under this third category, it must meet all of the conditions 
listed in “c” above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should 
refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to 
IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the 
criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those 
studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled 
“Disqualification of a clinical investigator.”) 
 
If your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed 
above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) 
before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your 
investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket 
approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a 
study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not 
investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)  
 
The requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study 
presents to subjects. 
 
For a significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor 
must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a 
non-significant risk device (see the Glossary for definition), the sponsor 
must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including 
review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board 
(IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-
significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the 
abbreviated requirements are met. 
 
Note: The requirements of the “Protection of Human Subjects” and 
“Institutional Review Boards” regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply 
to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the 
Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for 
research or marketing permits. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101; see also Section V, 
Human Subject Protection, of this guidance.) Therefore, all studies of 
investigational IVDs that will support applications to FDA are subject to 
21 CFR Parts 50 and 56, even if they are not subject to most requirements 
of 21 CFR Part 812. 
 
3. How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study 
under 21 CFR 812.2(b)? 
 
 
 
 


 
10
 
A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial 
importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise 
preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for 
serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m). 
 
For IVDs, we interpret "potential for serious risk" in relation to the nature of the 
harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused 
by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential 
harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent 
impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.  
 
False positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary 
treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary 
psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are 
involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct 
diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may 
prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of 
infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described 
above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk. FDA recommends the 
sponsor consider all these factors when determining the risk associated with your 
investigational IVD. (See 21 CFR 812.3(m) and also "Information Sheet 
Guidance for IRBs, Clinical Investigators, and Sponsors," available at 
http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida
ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm113709.htm, particularly the one on 
“Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Devices” at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm126622.htm.) 
 
4.  How do I determine if an invasive sampling technique presents a significant risk 
under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3)?  
 
To determine whether an invasive sampling technique presents a serious risk, we 
recommend that you base your risk determination on the nature of the harm that 
may result from sampling. For example, FDA considers sampling techniques that 
require biopsy of a major organ, use of general anesthesia, or placement of a 
blood access line into an artery or large vein (subclavian, femoral, or iliac) to 
present a significant risk.  
 
5. What does noninvasive mean? 
 
A noninvasive device is one that does not, by design or intention: 
 
a. penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body, the 
ocular cavity, or the urethra; or 
 
 
 
 


 
11
 
b. enter the ear beyond the external auditory canal, the nose beyond the 
nares, the mouth beyond the pharynx, the anal canal beyond the rectum, or 
the vagina beyond the cervical os.  
 
(21 CFR 812.3(k)).  
 
Blood sampling that involves simple venipuncture is considered noninvasive, and 
the use of surplus samples of body fluids or tissues that are left over from samples 
taken for noninvestigational purposes is also considered noninvasive (21 CFR 
812.3(k)). 
 
6. What does it mean to have “confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically 
established diagnostic product or procedure?”  
 
For an investigational study to be exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), clinical 
investigators must use a medically established means of diagnosis (e.g., another 
cleared or approved IVD or culture) of the disease or condition as the basis for 
decisions regarding treatment of all subjects participating in the study. 21 CFR 
812.2(c)(3)(iv). Additionally, test results from the exempt IVD investigation 
should not influence patient treatment or clinical management decisions before 
the diagnosis is established by a medically established product or procedure. 
 
If an investigational test uses a new technology or represents a significant 
technological advance, established diagnostic products or procedures may not be 
adequate to confirm the diagnosis provided by the investigational IVD.  For 
example, if an investigational test is designed to identify an infection at the 
earliest stages of viral infection (before formation of antibodies), established 
diagnostic products or procedures that rely on the detection of antibodies to the 
virus would be inadequate to confirm diagnoses.  Under these conditions the 
study would not meet the criteria for exemption under 812.2(c)(3) since the 
testing could not be confirmed with a medically established diagnostic product or 
procedure.  You may consider whether the device is a non-significant risk device 
subject to abbreviated IDE requirements (21 CFR 812.2(b)).    
 
7. What if no medically established means for diagnosing the disease or condition 
exists? 
 
If there is no medically established diagnostic product or procedure and clinical 
investigators use the results from the investigational study to decide on treatment, 
FDA would not consider the study exempt from IDE requirements under 21 CFR 
812.2. The sponsor would need to obtain FDA approval of an IDE if the results 
are used in diagnosis without confirmation (e.g., to assist in determining 
treatment) (21 CFR 812.1, 812.2) and if a significant risk device is involved. 
 
8. Can an investigational IVD device be used outside of the study protocol, in an 
 
 
 
 


 
12
                                                 
emergency situation? 
 
Yes. (See also Chapter III, “Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices,” of the 
guidance document “IDE Policies and Procedures.”)3 A physician may use an 
investigational IVD device in an emergency situation if:  
 
a. the patient has a serious disease or condition; 
 
b. no generally accepted alternative diagnostic device or treatment for the 
condition is available; and 
 
c. there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the 
emergency use. 
 
FDA recommends that the physician make the determination that the patient's 
circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the 
use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that 
benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the 
criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection 
procedures listed below as possible. These include obtaining: 
 
• Informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative; 
 
• Clearance from the institution as specified by their policies; 
 
• Concurrence of the IRB chairperson; 
 
• An assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; 
and 
 
• Authorization from the IDE sponsor, if an approved IDE exists for the 
device; 
 
• Authorization from the device company, if no IDE exists. 
 
Although prior FDA approval for emergency use of the investigational device is 
not required, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb(a), if an IDE exists, the use shall be reported to 
FDA in a supplemental IDE by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the 
time the sponsor learns of the use (21 CFR 812.35(a)(2)). The IDE supplement 
should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient 
outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed. If 
no IDE exists, the physician should follow the above procedures and report the 
emergency use to the sponsor and to CDRH or CBER, as appropriate.

For additional information on the procedures physicians and IRBs should follow 
in an emergency use situation, please see Chapter III, "Expanded Access to 
Unapproved  Devices" of the guidance entitled, IDE Policies and Procedures. 
 
9. Can an unapproved or uncleared investigational IVD device ever be used for 
nonemergency treatment of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria of an 
investigational study? 
 
Yes, in exceptional situations. FDA recognizes that there are circumstances when 
an unapproved or uncleared IVD is the only available option for a patient or small 
group of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria and "compassionate 
use"/single patient use of the device may be appropriate. Section 561 of the Act. 
CBER refers to such situations as “single patient exemptions.”  Appropriate 
patient protection measures are needed for these studies.   
 
Use of an investigational IVD device for one or a small group of patients who do 
not meet the study inclusion criteria would require a change to the investigational 
plan.  21 CFR 812.35(a).  If the study is being conducted under an approved IDE, 
the sponsor should submit a supplement to the IDE requesting a change to the 
investigational plan for “compassionate use.” 21 CFR 812.35(a).  The review of 
this supplement can be facilitated by a phone call to the reviewing division and by 
the submission by facsimile of an advanced copy of the supplement.  If the 
investigational IVD device would require an FDA-approved IDE, but one has not 
yet been submitted or approved, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion 
where the sponsor submits a compassionate use request to CDRH or CBER, as 
appropriate, and follows the patient protection measures listed above for 
emergency use.4 
 
If a study is being conducted according to an exemption under 21 CFR 
812.2(c)(3), or as a non-significant risk IDE under 21 CFR 812.2(b), the sponsor 
should obtain prior approval for the specific compassionate use/single patient use 
for the individual(s) in question from the FDA and the reviewing IRB at the site 
where the physician proposes to use the device. For CDRH regulated products, 
the required information can be submitted to the Director of the IDE Program:

apply for marketing approval through a humanitarian device exemption (HDE)? 
 
Yes, it is possible for an IVD device to be approved for marketing under the 
HDE. See the Glossary for definitions, 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart H, and 
Appendix 1 for more information. 
 
12. Can an IVD device qualify for HUD designation if the affected patient 
population is fewer than 4,000 per year but each patient may need to be tested 
multiple times? 
 
IVD devices qualify for an HUD designation when the number of persons tested 
with the device is fewer than 4,000 per year. FDA recognizes that the number of 
tests with the device may exceed one per patient. A device that involves multiple 
patient uses may still qualify for HUD designation as long as the IVD device is 
designed for diagnosis or treatment of a total of fewer than 4,000 patients per year 
in the US. 
. 
If a device is being developed to diagnose or to help diagnose a disease or 
condition with an incidence of fewer than 4,000 patients per year, but there are 
more than 4,000 patients a year “at risk” who would be subject to testing using the 
device, then the device may not qualify as a HUD. 21 CFR 814.102(a)(5). 
 
13. Is there a regulation that specifically addresses labeling of IVD products? 
 
Yes. The regulation, “Labeling for in vitro diagnostic products,” (21 CFR 
 
 
 
 


 
15
809.10), specifies the information required on labeling and in package inserts of 
marketed products as well as products in development that are distributed for use 
in studies. We recommend that you design IVD studies so that the results will 
support the proposed indications for use in the package insert and labeling. 
 
14. Are there different goals for IVD studies compared to other device studies? 
 
No. The goals for IVD studies are the same as the goals for other device studies, 
even if the IVD study is exempt from most IDE requirements under 21 CFR 
812.2(c)(3). We recommend that the sponsor and the investigators conduct an 
IVD device study with the goals of 
 
• producing valid scientific evidence (for a definition, see 21 CFR 
860.7(c)(2) and answer #1 of section IV) demonstrating reasonable 
assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the product, as described 
below, and 
• protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. (See Human Subject 
Protection, Section V of this guidance). 
 
15. What regulations describe the content requirements for IVD premarket 
submissions? 
 
Regulations that describe the basic content requirements by submission type 
include: 
 
• Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) – 21 CFR 812.20 
• Premarket Notification (510(k)) – 21 CFR 807.87 
• Premarket Approval (PMA) – 21 CFR 814.20 
• Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) – 21 CFR 814.104 
 
Currently, there is no regulation describing the contents for a Product 
Development Protocol (PDP). However, section 515(f)(1) of the Act and the 
CDRH website at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke
tYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm048168.htm#p
dp describe PDP requirements. 
 
In addition, the FDA 510(k) substantial equivalence determination summaries and 
FDA PMA summaries of safety and effectiveness are currently available on the 
CDRH OIVD web page at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/InVitroDiag
nostics/LabTest/ucm126189.htm  or for CBER products at 
http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProd
ucts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/ucm089793.htm and 
http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/510k
Process/ucm133429.htm.    We recommend that the sponsor structure submissions 
 
 
 
 


 
16
according to the relevant regulations and provide sufficient detail to give the 
reader an understanding of the scientific data and information supplied. OIVD has 
issued many device specific guidances that describe FDA’s recommendations for 
premarket submissions for particular types of IVDs. 
 
16. Can published literature be used to support an IVD premarket submission? 
 
FDA has developed a guidance document entitled “Supplements to Approved 
Applications for Class III Medical Devices: Use of Published Literature, Use of 
Previously Submitted Materials, and Priority Review,” which can be found on the 
CDRH website at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm080183.htm. CDRH and CBER believe that the principles outlined 
in this guidance are applicable to other submissions, specifically those for a 
510(k), PMA, and HDE. (See the Glossary for definitions of these submission 
types.) 
 
17. Can data from studies performed outside of the United States (U.S.) be used to 
support an IVD premarket submission? 
 
Yes. FDA recognizes that clinical investigations may be conducted outside of the 
U.S., for example, in order to find adequate numbers of subjects for certain 
disease states, conditions, or pathogens. The PMA regulation contains information 
regarding research conducted outside of the U.S. (21 CFR 814.15). FDA can also 
accept data from foreign studies in support of 510(k)s . 
 
18. Can foreign/international data be used as the sole support of a marketing 
application? 
 
Yes, but only if warranted. The PMA regulation, 21 CFR Part 814, allows foreign 
data to be used as the sole support of a marketing application but only if (1) the 
data are applicable to the U.S. population and to U.S. medical practices, including 
laboratory practices, (2) the studies have been performed by clinical investigators 
of recognized competence, and (3) the data may be considered valid without the 
need for an on-site FDA inspection or, if necessary, FDA can validate the data 
through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means (21 CFR 814.15(d)).  
 
For IVD devices, FDA would consider differences in population demographics, 
disease prevalence, disease presentation, laboratory practices, and medical 
standards of care. If the sponsor plans to submit an application based solely on 
foreign data, FDA recommends that the sponsor consult with the reviewing 
division prior to submission of the application. 
 
See Introduction, Section II, question # 4 of this guidance for a list of reviewing 
divisions in both CDRH and CBER. 
 
 
 
 
 


 
17
19. What is a master file and how is one submitted? 
 
A device master file (MAF) is a reference source that a person submits to FDA. In 
general, it is a file of trade secret or confidential commercial/financial information 
submitted by a third party (i.e., someone other than the applicant) for use as a 
reference source in support of at least one application. FDA will accept MAFs 
from organizations or persons who have not submitted or will not directly submit 
the information in a PMA, IDE, 510(k), or other device-related submission to 
FDA. MAFs may include information on the following: 
 
• facilities and manufacturing procedures and controls; 
 
• synthesis, formulation, purification and specifications for chemicals, 
materials (an alloy, plastic, etc.) or subassemblies for a device; 
 
• packaging materials; 
 
• contract packaging and other manufacturing (such as sterilization); 
 
• nonclinical study data; and 
 
• clinical study data. 
 
We recommend that a MAF include a cover letter, preferably on company 
letterhead, signed by a responsible company official that identifies the submission 
as a MAF and provides the name of a contact person at the company or a 
designated agent. For more information concerning MAFs see the CDRH website 
at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke
tYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm  
 
20. How do I arrange to reference a MAF? 
 
You, the sponsor, should contact the company that owns the information you 
would like to incorporate by reference in your premarket submission to FDA, and 
find out if this information is currently in a master file. If it is, you should obtain a 
written authorization from the master file holder (or an authorized designated 
agent/representative) on company letterhead. You should include the original 
authorization letter in the original copy of the premarket submission to FDA, and 
a copy of the authorization letter in each subsequent copy of the premarket 
submission. The master file holder should not send the authorization letter directly 
to FDA for inclusion in the master file or for inclusion in your premarket 
submission. 
 
If the information you, the sponsor, would like to incorporate by reference in your 
 
 
 
 


 
18
premarket submission to FDA is not already in a master file, you should request 
that the company that owns this information submit a master file to FDA.  
 
For more information on referencing MAFs see the CDRH website at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarke
tYourDevice/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/ucm142714.htm. 
 
IV. Investigational Studies 
 
1. What does FDA consider to be valid scientific evidence? 
 
Valid scientific evidence is defined in the “Medical Device Classification 
Procedures” regulation, 21 CFR Part 860, as: 
 
Evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies 
and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories 
conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with 
a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by 
qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness 
of a device under its conditions of use (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)). 
 
The intended use of the IVD, the level and quality of information in the literature 
relevant to the device use, and FDA knowledge of the technology obtained from 
reviewing other premarket applications determine the type of study and the level 
of evidence you may need to demonstrate reasonable assurance of its safety and 
effectiveness. For example, if you are studying an IVD device that uses a well-
characterized technology and has an intended use that falls within a type of device 
that has been classified into Class I or Class II, the study may consist of a 
comparison of analytic performance to that of a legally marketed (i.e., predicate) 
device. On the other hand, if your IVD uses novel or unproven technology or has 
a new intended use, you may need to conduct a well-planned clinical study of the 
device in the target population defined by your intended use. You may contact the 
Division in the appropriate Center if you have questions regarding the type of 
study you need to conduct for your device. 
 
We recommend that sponsors and investigators of all studies, including exempt 
studies under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), conduct the studies with the following goals in 
mind: producing valid scientific evidence of the product’s safety and effectiveness 
and protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. Sponsors and investigators 
of significant and non-significant risk studies must comply with the regulation 
requirements in 21 CFR Part 812. FDA recommends that sponsors and 
investigators of studies exempt from the majority of requirements under 21 CFR 
Part 812 use the relevant sections of 21 CFR Part 812 regarding the general 
conduct of device studies as guidance. (General Regulatory Issues, Section III 
of this guidance, discusses how 21 CFR Part 812 may apply to a particular IVD 
study.) 
 
 
 
 


 
19
 
2. Why should I review the information regarding the conduct of device studies 
found in the IDE regulation even if, after considering the exemption criteria in the 
regulation, I determine that my proposed studies are exempt from most IDE 
requirements? 
 
Some studies are exempt from most of 21 CFR Part 812 because of the low risk 
they pose to study subjects. However, studies that will support a PMA or other 
premarket submission should have the same goals as all other device studies: 1) to 
produce valid scientific evidence to support reasonable assurance of a product’s 
safety and effectiveness, and 2) to protect study subjects. Therefore, the 
information in 21 CFR Part 812 will also be useful to sponsors and investigators 
of device studies exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c). In addition, all studies that will 
support applications to FDA are subject to 21 CFR 812.119(c) as well as to 21 
CFR Parts 50 and 56. 
 
3. Should I review the “International Conference on Harmonization; Good Clinical 
Practice: Consolidated Guideline” ("ICHGCP") published in the Federal Register 
Vol. 62, No. 90, May 9, 1997, pp. 25691-25709 or the draft ISO 14155, “Clinical 
Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects,” when developing studies for 
devices that fall within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c)? 
 
Although the ICH document was written for studies of pharmaceuticals, sections 
of the guidance address study issues common to all investigational products.  
Thus, these sections of the ICH GCP provide a useful reference regarding the 
proper conduct of studies. 
 
The draft ISO document specifically states that it does not apply to IVD devices. 
The draft ISO document is an international document intended to reflect basic 
practices appropriate to clinical trials worldwide. It does not include all of FDA’s 
specific requirements for clinical studies and is not presently a standard that FDA 
has officially recognized; therefore, we do not recommend that you rely on it. 
 
4. Is FDA willing to review and discuss a study protocol even if the study is exempt 
from most of the 21 CFR Part 812 requirements? 
 
Yes. Both CDRH and CBER have developed processes that allow sponsors to 
obtain early FDA input and review of proposed studies by submission of the 
protocol and other study materials in the form of a “pre-IDE” document and/or a 
discussion in the form of a “pre-IDE” meeting. While we refer to this early input 
as a "pre-IDE" process, it is also available for studies that are exempt from most 
IDE requirements under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3) or that will be conducted under the 
abbreviated IDE regulations for NSR studies (21 CFR 812.2). FDA encourages 
use of the pre-IDE submission and/or meeting whenever the sponsor desires early 
feedback for clinical studies, particularly those for novel or high risk (Class III) 
devices. If you (the sponsor) are interested in submitting a pre-IDE, we 
 
 
 
 


 
20
recommend that you contact the Division that will review your device before you 
initiate your studies (See Introduction, Section II, question # 4 of this guidance). 
Use of the pre-IDE process does not obligate you in any way to future submission 
of an IDE. FDA also encourages continued communication throughout the course 
of the study. This communication can be in the form of an informational 
meeting/telephone call or status reports to the pre-IDE file. 
 
5. Can I obtain a more formal evaluation of my study design or investigational plan 
through a determination and/or agreement meeting? 
 
Yes, for Class III IVDs. (See the Glossary for definition of terms.) A guidance 
document regarding these meetings, “Early Collaboration Meetings Under the 
FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH 
Staff,” is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm073604.htm. CBER also follows this meeting guidance document 
when determination and/or agreement meetings are requested. 
 
6. Under 21 CFR Part 812, what are the sponsor’s and investigator’s responsibilities 
for studies of a non-significant risk device conducted under the abbreviated 
requirements in 21 CFR Part 812? 
 
The majority of the sponsor’s and investigator’s responsibilities in a study of a 
nonsignificant risk device are found in 21 CFR 812.2(b)(1) of the IDE regulation 
and are summarized below: 
 
a. Label the device in accordance with 21 CFR 812.5; 
 
b. Obtain IRB approval of the investigation after presenting the reviewing IRB 
with a brief explanation of why the device is not a significant risk device, and 
maintain such approval. 
 
c. Ensure that each investigator participating in an investigation of the device 
obtains from each subject under the investigator’s care, informed consent under 
part 50 and documents it, unless documentation is waived by an IRB under 21 
CFR 56.109(c). 
 
d. Comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 812.46 with respect to monitoring 
investigations; 
 
e. Maintain the records required under 21 CFR 812.140(b)(4) and (5) and make 
the reports required under 21 CFR 812.150 (b)(1) through (3) and (5) through 
(10); 
 
f. Ensure that participating investigators maintain the records required by 
21 CFR 812.140(a)(3)(i) and make the reports required under 21 CFR 
812.150(a)(1), (2), (5), and (7); 
 
 
 
 


 
21
 
g. Comply with the prohibitions in 21 CFR 812.7 against promotion and other 
practices. 
 
All studies should have a written protocol as described in 21 CFR 812.25(b) and a 
risk analysis as described in 21 CFR 812.25(c), regardless of the status of the 
study under 21 CFR Part 812. 
 
All sites participating in the study should use identical copies of the protocol and 
receive protocol amendments simultaneously so that data is collected in a 
consistent manner. Data collected from different sites otherwise may not be able 
to be pooled in the final analysis due to inconsistencies in how it was collected. 
We recommend that protocols describe the study objectives, design, methodology, 
subject populations, types of specimens, data to be collected and planned data 
analysis. (See also Data Considerations, Section VI, of this guidance). For 
information on how to monitor the study, you may refer to the FDA guidance 
document entitled “Guideline for the Monitoring of Clinical Investigations,” 
which is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/EnforcementActions/BioresearchMonitorin
g/UCM133752.pdf 
 
7. What are my responsibilities as the sponsor or the investigator of a study of a 
significant risk device subject to 21 CFR Part 812? 
 
The sponsor’s responsibilities for significant risk device investigations are 
described in Appendix 3 of this guidance. This information is also included as an 
enclosure in all IDE approval letters. 
 
The investigator’s responsibilities for significant risk device investigations are 
described in Appendix 4 of this guidance. This information is also included as an 
enclosure in all IDE approval letters. 
 
8. Is it appropriate to use a quality systems approach in the conduct of IVD studies? 
 
Yes, we recommend that sponsors and investigators follow quality systems 
methodologies, including accountability and traceability of the investigational device, 
auditing of data collected and monitoring to make sure the protocol was followed, 
documentation of training of staff in the use of the device [21 CFR 812.43(a)], 
and notifying FDA of unanticipated adverse device effects [21 CFR 
812.150(b)(1)] in the conduct of IVD studies. Also, 21 CFR 812.20(b)(3) requires 
“[a] description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for the manufacture, 
processing, packing, storage, and, where appropriate, installation of the device, in 
sufficient detail so that a person generally familiar with good manufacturing 
practices can make a knowledgeable judgment about the quality control used in 
the manufacture of the device.” This suggestion is consistent with both the need to 
provide scientifically valid information in support of premarket submissions and 
the design control requirements. Manufacturers of Class II and Class III IVD 
 
 
 
 


 
22
devices, and some Class I devices, are required to follow design controls, as 
described in 21 CFR 820.30 of the “Quality System Regulation,” during the 
development of investigational devices. 21 CFR 812.1(a). See the Glossary for 
the definition of device classes. 
 
9. If a sponsor’s ‘in-house’ laboratory participates in the study of an IVD is the 
laboratory considered to be a study site? 
 
Yes. All locations involved in an IVD study are considered study sites whether 
they are located at a sponsor-owned facility or at an independently-owned 
laboratory. The sponsor should list the laboratory as a study site, and the study 
should be conducted under the same investigational plan. As a study site, this 
laboratory can be inspected as part of the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring (BIMO) 
inspection program. 
 
V. Human Subject Protection 
 
1. When does an IVD study involve human subjects? 
 
Under FDA’s regulations governing the conduct of IVD device studies, the 
definition of "subject" includes individuals on whose specimens an investigational 
device is used [see 21 CFR 812.3(p)]. As a result, an IVD study using human 
specimens involves human subjects. 
 
2. Am I required to follow the “Good Laboratory Practice for Nonclinical Studies” 
regulation (21 CFR Part 58) in my IVD study? 
 
Part 58 applies only to nonclinical laboratory studies, which are defined as 
in vivo or in vitro experiments in which test articles are studied prospectively in 
test systems under laboratory conditions to determine their safety. The term does 
not include studies utilizing human subjects or clinical studies or field trials in 
animals. The term does not include basic exploratory studies carried out to 
determine whether a test article has any potential utility or to determine physical 
or chemical characteristics of a test article (21 CFR 58.3(d)). 
 
Moreover, because the safety of IVDs is related to the accuracy of the result, most 
IVD studies that are intended to establish safety would necessarily use human 
specimens.  As noted above, an IVD study using human specimens involves 
human subjects and thus is excluded from the definition of nonclinical laboratory 
studies. Such studies to establish safety are subject to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and 
21 CFR Part 812 as applicable, dealing with human subject research, rather than 
to 21 CFR Part 58.   
 
3. What regulations apply regarding human subject protection in investigational 
IVD studies? 
 
 
 
 
 


 
23
FDA regulations on “Protection of Human Subjects” and “Institutional Review 
Boards” (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations 
(investigations involving human subjects) regulated by FDA under section 520(g) 
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as well as other clinical 
investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits for 
products regulated by FDA. (21 CFR 50.1, 56.101). As described above, any 
study using human specimens involves human subjects. FDA has expressed an 
intent to exercise enforcement discretion regarding informed consent for certain 
IVD studies, in the guidance entitled, "Guidance on Informed Consent for In 
Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not 
Individually Identifiable." 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm078384.htm 
 
Some research studies involving human subjects that are conducted or supported 
by a federal department or agency will be required to follow the Federal Policy 
for the Protection of Human Subjects (the “Common Rule”). The Department of 
Health and Human Services (HHS) has codified the Common Rule at 45 CFR 
Part 46, subpart A. Research involving human subjects that is conducted or 
supported by HHS and that is not otherwise exempt must comply with 45 CFR 
Part 46, which contains additional protections for specific populations. For further 
information about the applicability of 45 CFR Part 46 to your study, refer to 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/.  
 
FDA regulation and the Common Rule contain some differing requirements. 
Although FDA and HHS seek to harmonize requirements related to informed 
consent where possible, certain requirements of the FDA regulation and the 
Common Rule are different.  The same study may be subject to both sets of 
requirements, either one, or neither. It is the responsibility of sponsors and 
investigators to comply with all applicable requirements. 
 
4. How do FDA regulations for protection of human subjects, 21 CFR Parts 50 and 
56, differ from HHS regulations in 45 CFR Part 46 subpart A? 
 
A general comparison appears in the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice program 
website, Comparison of FDA and HHS Human Subject Protection Regulations 
found at 
http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Educa
tionalMaterials/ucm112910.htm. For additional information on 45 CFR Part 46 
subpart A refer to the Office for Human Research Protections at 
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.htm. 
 
5. Can investigational IVD studies receive expedited review (see Glossary for 
definition) by an IRB? 
 
 
 
 
 


 
24
Yes, in many cases an investigational IVD study is eligible for IRB expedited 
review (see 21 CFR 56.110), for both initial approval and continuing review. The 
categories of research that may be reviewed by the IRB through an expedited 
review procedure are described in the Federal Register notice on expedited 
review, found at 
http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RunningClinicalTrials/Guida
ncesInformationSheetsandNotices/ucm118099.htm. As stated in a Federal 
Register notice, however, sponsors and investigators may not use the expedited 
review procedure where identification of the subjects and/or their responses 
would reasonably place the subjects at risk of criminal or civil liability or be 
damaging to the subjects’ financial standing, employability, insurability, 
reputation, or be stigmatizing, unless reasonable and appropriate protections will 
be implemented so that risks related to invasion of privacy and breach of 
confidentiality are no greater than minimal. (63 FR 60353, November 9, 1998). 
 
6. Can leftover specimens be used in IVD studies without informed consent? 
 
The document entitled, "Guidance for Industry, Institutional Review Boards, 
Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug Administration: Guidance on Informed 
Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies using Leftover Human Specimens 
that are not Individually Identifiable,"  
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm078384.htm, describes the limited circumstances in which FDA 
intends to exercise enforcement discretion regarding requirements for informed 
consent. (See Glossary for definition of "leftover specimens".) 
 
7. Can those who routinely conduct studies with IVDs (e.g., research hospitals) use a 
general informed consent to address future studies using samples collected in their 
own facility? 
 
To fulfill FDA informed consent requirements for studies of IVDs, a site may 
develop an informed consent process to address the use of samples collected at 
the facility (see the Glossary for definition) in a specific study or for a broader 
category of future studies. This general informed consent process may be used for 
subjects seen at and/or admitted to a specific facility. The informed consent 
document must contain all of the required elements found in 21 CFR 50.25. 
 
8. Can a human specimen that was initially collected in a study with the informed 
consent of the subject be used in a later study without a new consent process? 
 
If the original informed consent document contains a statement that excess 
specimen(s) will be stored for future use in specified types of studies and the new 
study meets the criteria stated in that consent document, it is possible that no 
further consent is necessary. This assumes that the original informed consent 
document contains all of the other essential elements, including notice to the 
subject that FDA may review their files and an explanation of the purposes and 
 
 
 
 


 
25
benefits of the research. (See 21 CFR 50.25.) We recommend sponsors and 
investigators consult with the IRB regarding the need for a new informed consent 
process in such a case. The IRB decision should include consideration of any state 
and/or local requirements regarding informed consent and patient rights. If new 
testing could expose the subject to previously unanticipated risks (e.g., privacy 
concerns for the subject and/or his family related to testing for a genetic marker), 
a new consent may be needed. In addition, if the original informed consent did not 
address future research use at all, or did not cover the type of study now under 
consideration, it is likely a new consent will be needed.  
 
Under certain circumstances, for human specimens leftover from specimens 
originally collected for a previous study, FDA intends to exercise enforcement 
discretion regarding informed consent requirements. See "Guidance for Industry, 
Institutional Review Boards, Clinical Investigators, and Food and Drug 
Administration: Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device 
Studies using Leftover Human Specimens that are not Individually Identifiable,"  
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm078384.htm, 
 
VI. Data Considerations 
 
1. What information should the protocol include to ensure that the investigational 
IVD study will be scientifically sound? 
 
We recommend that the protocol include a clear description of study design; 
objectives, estimation of performance goals (e.g., desired confidence interval 
widths) that are directly related to the intended claims for the IVD device, or 
hypotheses; and a statistical plan to be applied to the data. (See the Glossary for 
definitions of protocol, statistical hypothesis, and confidence interval.) 
 
2. Is it acceptable to develop new or to revise existing study hypotheses as the study 
progresses? 
 
We generally believe it would be inappropriate to draw conclusions from after-
the-fact hypotheses. We recommend that changes in study protocols be carefully 
documented and explained. FDA encourages sponsors to contact the appropriate 
review division to discuss studies before they are initiated and to consult FDA 
before changes in protocols are made mid-study. (For the FDA divisions 
responsible for review of IVD products, see Introduction, Section II, of this 
guidance.) 
 
3. How should I determine appropriate sample size for a study? 
 
The sponsor should formulate sample size based on standard statistical techniques 
and the sample size should account for any unique issues related to intended 
use(s), device technologies, and/or the biology of the condition being studied. 
 
 
 
 


 
26
 
4. What guidance is available for sponsors to determine how to estimate IVD 
performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity, how to handle discrepant results, 
and what to do when a study is performed without a truth standard (“gold 
standard”) (see the Glossary for definitions)? 
 
FDA has recognized a number of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
[(CLSI), formerly National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards 
(NCCLS)] standards related to these issues. A list of these standards, but not the 
standards themselves, can be found through the database on the CDRH web page 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scrIpts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm 
National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards 
The agency’s guidance entitled “Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from 
Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests” can be viewed at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm071148.htm 
 
5. How much leeway is there in deciding on the populations from which human 
specimens are collected and under what conditions are data on simulated specimens 
(see the Glossary for definition) acceptable? 
 
Studies should be performed in a representative sample of the intended use 
population (i.e., representation of both diseased and non-diseased cases, and 
controlling for subject demographics and morbidity factors that may affect the 
level of device performance). When a disease is rare or samples are needed 
specifically to challenge cut-off points, sponsors may use enriched samples, 
panels of credentialed samples (e.g., Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) panels), and/or spiked or contrived samples. The acceptance of simulated 
specimens depends on how well they represent specimens from the intended-use 
population and whether their performance accurately reflects what the IVD device 
user can expect. 
 
6. Is it acceptable to eliminate data that appear to be out of line with the main body 
of the dataset (i.e., “outliers”)? 
 
An outlier, an observation that lies an unexpected distance from other values, does 
not in itself prove that an error or violation has occurred. Therefore, the primary 
data analysis should include all such observations, including “outliers”. A sponsor 
may perform some specific supplemental analyses on subsets of the data, if 
clinically and scientifically justified, that may exclude outlying data points. 
Excluding large amounts of data, regardless of the reasons for exclusion, will 
seriously bias the results. 
 
7. Can I add additional testing on the same subject to the dataset, particularly when 
it is hard to find study subjects? 
 
 
 
 
 


 
27
In most studies the sponsor should avoid multiple testings of the same subject 
because it may skew performance statistics and under-estimate standard 
deviations. When multiple testing is done, the sponsor should explain why it is 
necessary and choose methods of statistical analysis that allow adjustment for 
within-subject correlation. 
 
It is appropriate to conduct repeated testing of the same sample to evaluate test 
reproducibility – i.e., the ability of the test to yield the same or similar readings 
when expected. 
 
8. How much precision (see the Glossary for definition) is needed for measurement 
data, e.g., in terms of decimal places? 
 
Study data should contain no more decimal places than the precision of the 
instrument allows, i.e., if the instrument is only precise to the second decimal 
place the sponsor should not analyze the data using three decimal places. 
 
9. What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational 
study? 
 
Unless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record 
requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed 
are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should 
contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same 
protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records 
because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the 
collected data. 
 
We also recommend that investigators: 
 
a. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including 
raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic 
and morbidity factors; 
 
b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person’s co-
variable data; 
 
c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all 
specimens collected. 
 
Additionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful. Given the possible 
need to review or analyze study data at the most detailed level, electronic 
spreadsheets may help to minimize review time. For information on electronic 
records, see the guidance document, "Part 11, Electronic Records; Electronic 
Signatures -- Scope and Application," at 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformatio
n/Guidances/ucm072322.pdf. There is also a more general guidance document 
 
 
 
 


 
28
available on electronic records for clinical studies that is entitled “Computerized 
Systems Used in Clinical Trials,” which can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.  
 
10. What does FDA recommend be included in the final report of the investigation 
from the sponsor to all reviewing IRBs (and to FDA for significant risk studies) (21 
CFR 812.150(b)(7))? 
 
A final report should be a basic scientific report of the studies conducted, including the 
results of testing the study hypotheses. This report can be a useful means of providing a 
simple account of the data collection and study outcome. Such a report can facilitate 
preparation of the eventual submission for regulatory action, particularly when 
accompanied by the information included in the investigational plan (see the Glossary 
for definition). 
 
The suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all 
IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance. 
 
It should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), 
PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a 
marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a 
supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the 
final report for the study. 
 
The final report for significant risk device investigations must be submitted to the IRBs 
and/or FDA within six months after termination or completion of the study. 21 CFR 
812.150(b)(7). 
 
VII. Glossary 
 
Note: this glossary is written in plain language and is for use exclusively with this 
guidance document. 
 
Definitions that have been taken from the Act, other pertinent laws, or in Federal 
regulations include the relevant citation. 
 
510(k) – See Premarket Notification. 
 
Agreement meeting – a meeting, under section 520(g)(7) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 
360j(g)(7)), that is available to anyone planning to investigate the safety or effectiveness 
of a class III device (see definition below) or any implant. The purpose of the meeting is 
to reach agreement on the key parameters of the investigational plan, including the study 
protocol. The meeting is to be held within 30 days of the receipt of a written request. 
FDA will document in writing any agreement reached and make it a part of the 
administrative record. The agreement is binding on FDA and can only be changed with 
the written agreement of the applicant or when there is a substantial scientific issue

essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the device. See 21 U.S.C. § 
360j(g)(7). A guidance document regarding these meetings, “Early Collaboration 
Meetings Under the FDA Modernization Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and 
for CDRH Staff,” is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument
s/ucm073604.htm. 
 
Analyte specific reagent (ASR) - ASRs are defined as “antibodies, both polyclonal and 
monoclonal, specific receptor proteins, ligands, nucleic acid sequences, and similar 
reagents which, through specific binding or chemical reactions with substances in a 
specimen, are intended for use in a diagnostic application for identification and 
quantification of an individual chemical substance or ligand in biological specimens." 21 
CFR 864.4020(a). ASRs are medical devices that are regulated by FDA. They are subject 
to general controls, including current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs), 21 CFR 
Part 820, as well as the specific provisions of the ASR regulations (21 CFR 809.10(e), 
809.30, 864.4020). 
  
Class I devices – devices for which the general controls of the Act are sufficient to 
provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. They typically present 
minimal potential for harm to the user and the person being tested. They are subject to 
general controls, which include registration and listing, labeling, and adverse event 
reporting requirements (section 513(a)(1)(A) of the Act). Most Class I devices are 
exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to certain limitations 
found in section 510(l) of the Act and in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. Some are also 
exempt from the “Quality Systems Regulation” found in 21 CFR Part 820. IVD examples 
of Class I devices include complement reagent, phosphorus (inorganic) test systems (21 
CFR 862.1580), and E. coli serological reagents (21 CFR 866.3255). 
 
Class II devices – devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to provide 
reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness and for which establishment of 
special controls can provide such assurances. Special controls may include special 
labeling, mandatory performance standards, risk mitigation measures identified in 
guidance, and postmarket surveillance (section 513(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Some Class II 
devices are exempt from premarket notification (see definition below), subject to 
limitation in 21 CFR 862.9, 864.9, and 866.9. IVD examples of Class II devices include 
glucose test systems (21 CFR 862.1345), antinuclear antibody immunological test 
systems (21 CFR 866.5100), and coagulation instruments (21 CFR 864.5400). 
 
Class III devices – devices for which insufficient information exists to provide 
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness through general or special controls. 
Class III devices are usually those that support or sustain human life, are of substantial 
importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, 
unreasonable risk of illness or injury (section 513(a)(1)(C) of the Act). Most Class III 
devices require premarket approval (PMA, see definition below). IVD examples of these 
include automated PAP smear readers, nucleic acid amplification devices for 
tuberculosis, and total prostate specific antigen (PSA) for the detection of cancer. A 
limited number of Class III devices that are equivalent to devices legally marketed before 
 
 
 
 


 
30
enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 may be marketed through the 
premarket notification (510(k)) process (see definition below), until FDA has published a 
requirement for manufacturers of that generic type of device to submit PMA data. 
 
Compassionate use – The compassionate use provision allows access for patients with a 
serious disease or condition who do not meet the requirements for inclusion in the clinical 
investigation but for whom the treating physician believes the device may provide a 
benefit in treating and/or diagnosing their disease or condition. There must be no feasible 
alternative therapies/diagnostics available. Compassionate use is typically available only 
for individual patients but also may be used to treat a small group. Prior FDA approval is 
needed before compassionate use occurs.  
Further information can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour
Device/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm051345.htm. 
 
Confidence interval – the range of plausible values for a statistical parameter, consistent 
with the observed data, which is computed with a sample estimate parameter (e.g., mean) 
and its standard deviation. For example, a “95% Confidence Interval” is computed such 
that, if the parameter was determined for repeated experiments, the resulting values 
would include the true parameter value 95% of the time. 
 
Continued access to investigational devices – FDA may allow sponsors to continue to 
enroll subjects under an IDE, after the trial has been completed, while a marketing 
application is prepared by the sponsor and/or reviewed by FDA. To continue enrolling 
subjects, a sponsor should show that there is a public health need for the device, that 
preliminary evidence indicates that the device is likely to be effective for the indications 
proposed, and that no significant safety concerns have been identified for the proposed 
indication. A guidance document, entitled “Continued Access to Investigational Devices 
During PMA Preparation and Review,” can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument
s/ucm080260.htm . 
 
Co-variables – data elements relating to a subject that might affect how well a diagnostic 
test works, such as demographic status (age, gender, etc.), morbidity, or concurrent 
therapy. 
 
Determination Meeting – A Determination meeting under section 513(a)(3)(D) of the 
Act is available to anyone anticipating submitting a PMA or PDP and is intended to 
provide the applicant with the FDA’s determination of the type of valid scientific 
evidence that will be necessary to demonstrate that the device is effective for its intended 
use. As a result of this meeting, FDA will determine whether clinical studies are needed 
to establish effectiveness and, in consultation with the applicant, determine the least 
burdensome way of evaluating device effectiveness that has a reasonable likelihood of 
success. The applicant can expect that FDA will determine if concurrent randomized 
controls, concurrent non-randomized controls, historical controls, or other types of 
evidence will be acceptable. FDA’s determination is to be written, shared with the 
 
 
 
 


 
31
applicant within 30 days following the meeting, and is binding upon the FDA, unless it 
could be contrary to public health. 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(3)(D). A guidance document 
regarding these meetings, “Early Collaboration Meetings Under the FDA Modernization 
Act (FDAMA); Final Guidance for Industry and for CDRH Staff,” is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocument
s/ucm073604.htm. 
 
Device – as defined in the Act, section 201(h): an instrument, apparatus, implement, 
machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, 
including any component, part, or accessory, which is a) recognized in the official 
National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any supplement to them; b) 
intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, 
treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals; or c) intended to affect the 
structure or any function of the body of man or other animals, and which does not 
achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of 
man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the 
achievement of its primary intended purposes.  
 
Excess samples – remnants of human specimens collected for routine clinical care or 
analysis that would otherwise have been discarded, as well as specimens leftover from 
specimens previously collected for other unrelated research or investigations. Excess 
samples are also referred to as “surplus samples,” “residual”, “reserved samples,” "library 
samples," and "leftover specimens." 
 
Expedited review – review by an institutional review board (IRB) that does not require 
full board review or a convened meeting. Such a review may be carried out by the IRB 
chairperson or one or more experienced reviewers assigned by the IRB chairperson from 
among the members of the IRB. Reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB 
except they may not disapprove the study. Disapproval may only result through the IRB’s 
non-expedited review process. Expedited review is reserved for minimal risk studies. 
(See 21 CFR 56.110.) 
 
General purpose reagents – chemical reagents that have general laboratory application 
and that are not labeled or otherwise intended for a specific diagnostic application. They 
are used to collect, prepare, and/or examine specimens from the human body for 
diagnostic purposes.  (Example: reagents used for general staining in microscopic 
procedures.) General purpose reagents do not include laboratory machinery, automated or 
powered systems (21 CFR 864.4010(a)). 
 
Gold standard – see truth standard. 
 
Humanitarian use devices (HUDs) –HUDs are devices intended to diagnose a disease 
or condition in fewer than 4,000 patients in the U.S. per year. Such devices are regulated 
under 21 CFR Part 814, Subpart H. If a device receives a designation as an HUD, a 
Humanitarian Device Exemption request (HDE) can be submitted. HUDs that are 
 
 
 
 


 
32
approved for marketing under an HDE have specific labeling requirements. IRB approval 
is required for use of a HUD (21 CFR 814.124). 
 
Investigation – a clinical investigation or research involving one or more subjects to 
determine the safety or effectiveness of a device (21 CFR 812.3(h)). It is often referred to 
as a clinical trial and is sometimes referred to as a field trial. 
 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) – application which, when approved, allows 
the device to be used lawfully for the purpose of conducting studies regarding the safety 
and effectiveness of the device, without complying with certain requirements of the Act. 
(See 21 CFR 812.1 for specific exemptions.) For significant risk (SR) device studies (see 
definition below), a sponsor must apply to FDA to obtain approval for an IDE. (See 21 
CFR 812.20.) For non-significant risk (NSR) device studies (see definition below), an 
IDE is considered approved when a sponsor meets the abbreviated requirements found in 
21 CFR 812.2(b), which include approval from the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board(s) (IRB(s)). 
 
Investigational plan – sponsor’s overall plan regarding the conduct of an investigational 
study.  It includes, but is not limited to, the purpose of the study, a written protocol, a risk 
analysis, device description, labeling, written monitoring procedures, informed consent 
materials, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) information. (21 CFR 812.25.) For IVD 
studies, protocols should describe the study objectives, design, methodology, subject 
populations, types of specimens, data to be collected and planned data analysis. 
 
Investigational Use in vitro diagnostic (IVD) product – an IVD product being used for 
product testing prior to full commercial marketing (e.g., for use on specimens derived 
from humans to compare the usefulness of the product with other products or procedures 
in current use or recognized as useful). These products must be labeled according to 21 
CFR 812.5 for non-significant risk or significant risk devices and according to 21 CFR 
809.10(c)(2)(ii) for devices that are exempt under 21 CFR 812.2(c). 
 
Investigator – an individual who actually conducts a clinical investigation, i.e., a person 
under whose immediate direction the investigational product is administered, dispensed, 
or used, provided that the investigation involves a subject. In the event of an investigation 
conducted by a team of individuals, the investigator is the responsible leader of that team 
(21 CFR 812.3(i)). 
 
In vitro diagnostic (IVD) products – those reagents, instruments, and systems intended 
for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, including a determination of the 
state of health, in order to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease or its sequelae. Such 
products are intended for use in the collection, preparation, and examination of specimens 
taken from the human body.  IVD products are devices as defined in section 201(h) of the 
Act and may also be biological products subject to section 351 of the Public Health 
Service Act. The regulatory definition of in vitro diagnostic products is found in 21 CFR 
809.3(a). 
 
 
 
 
 


 
33
Leftover specimens -- remnants of specimens collected for routine clinical care or 
analysis that would otherwise have been discarded, or remnants of specimens previously 
collected for other unrelated research. These specimens may be obtained from a specimen 
repository -- a common site for storage of collections of human biological specimens 
available for study. See also Excess samples. 
 
Non-significant risk (NSR) device – a device that does not meet the definition of 
significant risk (SR) device (see definition below). An IDE is considered approved for a 
NSR investigational device study once sponsors meet the abbreviated requirements found 
in the “Investigational Device Exemptions” regulation at 21 CFR 812.2(b). The risk 
determination for an investigational device study should be based on the proposed use of 
the device in the investigation in addition to the characteristics of the device. 
 
Outlier – a data observation whose value appears to be out of line with the main body of 
data that has been collected. 
 
Pre-amendment in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests – IVD tests that were in commercial 
distribution before May 28, 1976. 
 
Precision – the closeness of agreement between independent diagnostic test results 
obtained under stipulated conditions. For additional information refer to the Harmonized 
Technology Database, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, available at 
http://www.clsi.org. 
 
Premarket Approval Application (PMA) – the application for approval required prior 
to the marketing of most Class III medical devices (section 515 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 
360e). (See definitions of Class I, II, and III devices above.) PMA approval is based on a 
determination by FDA that the applicant’s submission provides sufficient valid scientific 
evidence to provide reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its 
intended use(s). The PMA regulation is 21 CFR Part 814. PMA information is available 
at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour
Device/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketApprovalPMA/default.htm. 
 
Premarket Notification – also referred to as a 510(k), is a submission to FDA that 
contains information to demonstrate that a device is substantially equivalent (SE) to a 
legally marketed (predicate) device. Governing regulations regarding premarket 
notification procedures are found in Subpart E of the “Establishment Registration and 
Device Listing for Manufacturers and Initial Importers of Devices” regulation (21 CFR 
Part 807). The 510(k) device advice page is available at 
http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYour
Device/PremarketSubmissions/PremarketNotification510k/default.htm. 
 
Product Development Protocol (PDP) – FDA process of approval for marketing of 
medical devices, usually reserved for Class III devices (see definitions of device classes 
 
 
 
 


 
34
above), by which the sponsor and FDA agree on the product design and testing early in 
the concept and planning stages of a product (section 515(f) of the Act). 
 
Protocol – a document that contains a description of the objectives and design of an 
investigational study, methodology(s) to be used, and data to be collected. It may also 
contain information regarding the planned data analysis and study monitoring. For most 
studies in the development of an IVD product, it also contains information regarding 
types of specimens and subject populations. 
 
Reserved samples – see excess samples. 
 
Sensitivity – the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a positive result when the 
disease or the target analyte is present. 
 
Significant risk (SR) device – an investigational device that presents a potential for 
serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject and:  
1. is intended as an implant; 
2. is purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life; 
3. is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or 
treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; or 
4. otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of 
a subject. 
 
The risk determination for an investigational device study should be based on the 
proposed use of the device in the investigation in addition to the device characteristics. 
Sponsors of significant risk device studies must apply to FDA for an Investigational 
Device Exemption (IDE) (see definition above). (21 CFR 812.3(a), 812.3(m); 812.20.) 
 
Simulated specimens – specimens made in the laboratory by adding the analyte of 
interest in known concentrations to a medium that simulates the natural matrix. 
 
Specificity – the probability that a diagnostic test will yield a negative result when the 
disease or target analyte is absent. 
 
Sponsor – a person who initiates, but who does not actually conduct, the investigation, 
i.e., the investigational device is administered, dispensed, or used under the immediate 
direction of another individual. A person other than an individual that uses one or more of 
its own employees to conduct an investigation that it has initiated is a sponsor, not a 
sponsor-investigator (see next definition), and the employees are investigators (see 
definition above) (21 CFR 812.3(n)). 
 
Sponsor-investigator – an individual who both initiates and actually conducts, alone or 
with others, an investigation, i.e., under whose immediate direction the investigational 
device is administered, dispensed, or used. The term does not include any person other 
than an individual.  The obligations of a sponsor-investigator include both those of an 
investigator and those of a sponsor (21 CFR 812.3(o)). 
 
 
 
 


 
35
 
Statistical hypothesis – a statement about some state of nature that a proposed study or 
set of studies will either accept or reject on the basis of the experimental data. The 
hypothesis is usually broken down into a null hypothesis (a statement of what the testing 
results will hopefully reject) and an alternative hypothesis (a statement of what the testing 
results will hopefully accept). 
 
Study – as used in this document, covers the systematic evaluations conducted in the 
development of an IVD product, including the feasibility, analytical assessments, method 
comparison, and evaluations to determine clinical utility of a product. 
 
Subject – a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom 
or on whose specimen an investigational device is used or as a control. A subject may be 
in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease (21 CFR 812.3(p)). 
 
Surplus samples – see excess samples. 
 
Transitional device – a product defined as a device as of May 28, 1976, but previously 
considered by FDA to be a new drug or an antibiotic drug (21 CFR 812.3(r)). 
 
Treatment IDE – use of an unapproved investigational device for the treatment or 
diagnosis of patients during the clinical trial or prior to final FDA action on the marketing 
application, if during the course of the clinical trial the data suggest that the device is 
effective. A treatment IDE may cover a large number of patients that exceeds the number 
of clinical sites and patients stipulated in the original IDE. The device must be for 
treatment or diagnosis of a serious or immediately life-threatening disease or condition; 
there must be no comparable or satisfactory alternative device or therapy available; the 
device must be under investigation in a controlled clinical study for the same use under 
an approved IDE, or such clinical studies have been completed; and the sponsor must be 
actively pursuing marketing approval or clearance of the device. Requirements for an 
application for a treatment IDE are found in the Investigational Device Exemptions 
regulation at 21 CFR 812.36. 
 
Truth Standard (“Gold” Standard) − any medical procedure or laboratory method or 
combination of procedures and methods that the clinical community relies upon for 
diagnosis, that is accepted by FDA, and that is regarded as having negligible risk of either 
a false positive or a false negative result. The truth standard result should be definitive 
(positive/negative, present/absent, or diseased/non-diseased), and should not give an 
indeterminate result. As science and technology improve, newer, more reliable standards 
may replace previous standards, particularly in the case of new disease markers.

 Appendix 3: Sponsor’s Responsibilities for Significant Risk Device 
Investigations 
 
Sponsors are required to comply with all applicable duties under the regulations.  We summarize them below. 
 
1. General Duties (21 CFR 812.40) 
 
a. Submitting the IDE application to FDA 
b. Obtaining both FDA and IRB approval for the investigation 
c. Selecting qualified investigators and providing them with the information they need to conduct the investigation 
properly 
d. Ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
e. Ensuring that any reviewing IRB and FDA are promptly informed of significant new information about an 
investigation 
 
2. Selection of Investigators (21 CFR 812.43) 
 
a. Assuring selection of investigators qualified by training and experience 
b. Permitting only participating investigators to use the investigational device 
c. Obtaining a signed investigator's agreement from each investigator containing: 
(1) investigator's curriculum vitae 
(2) statement of investigator's relevant experience, including dates, location, extent, and type of experience 
(3) if an investigator was involved in an investigation or other research that was terminated, an explanation of 
the circumstances that led to the termination 
(4) statement of the investigator's commitment to: 
• conduct the investigation in accordance with the agreement, the investigational plan, 21 CFR Part 812 
and other applicable regulations, and any conditions of approval imposed by the IRB or FDA 
• supervise all testing of the device involving human subjects 
• ensure that the requirements for obtaining informed consent are met (21 CFR Part 50) 
d. Selecting monitor(s) qualified by training and experience to monitor the progress of the investigation in accordance 
with FDA regulations. 
e. Providing investigators with the investigational plan and report of prior 
 
3. Monitoring (21 CFR 812.46) 


 
43
 
a. Securing compliance of all investigators in accordance with the signed 
investigator's agreement, the investigational plan, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 812 or 
other applicable FDA regulations, or any condition of approval imposed by the 
reviewing IRB or FDA. If compliance cannot be secured, use of the device 
by the investigator and the investigator's participation in the investigation must be 
discontinued. 
b. Evaluating all unanticipated adverse device effects and terminating the 
investigation, or portions of it, as soon as possible if that effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to subjects (Reporting requirements are listed below.) 
c. Resuming terminated investigations only after IRB and/or FDA approvals are 
obtained, as required by this regulation. 
 
4. Controlling Distribution and Disposition of Devices that are Shipped 
 
Although investigators are responsible for ensuring that investigational devices are made available only to persons who are 
legally authorized to receive them (see 21 CFR 812.110(c)), sponsors also bear responsibility for taking proper measures to 
ensure that devices are not diverted outside of legally authorized channels. Sponsors may ship investigational devices only to 
qualified investigators participating in the clinical investigation (21 CFR 812.43(b)). Sponsors must also maintain complete, 
current, and accurate records pertaining to the shipment and disposition of the investigational device (21 CFR 812.140(b)(2)). 
Records of shipment shall include the name and address of the consignee, type and quantity of device, date of shipment, and 
batch number or code mark. Records of disposition shall describe the batch number or code marks of any devices returned to 
the sponsor, repaired, or disposed of in other ways by the investigator or another person, and the reasons for and method of 
disposal.  
 
To further ensure compliance with these requirements, sponsors should take appropriate measures to instruct investigators 
regarding their responsibilities with respect to recordkeeping and device disposition. The specific recordkeeping requirements 
for investigators are set forth at 21 CFR 812.140(a). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the 
investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor any 
remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
44
5. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7) 
 
The IDE regulation prohibits the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or approved for 
marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on behalf of a sponsor or 
investigator), and encompasses the following activities: 
a. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device 
b. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of manufacture, 
research, development, and handling 
c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the device 
is safe and effective, and 
d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated. 
 
6. Supplemental Applications (21 CFR 812.35(a) and (b)) 
 
Supplemental applications are required to be submitted to, and approved by, FDA in the following situations: 
a. Changes in the investigational plan: FDA approval is required for any change that may affect the scientific 
soundness of the investigation or the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. IRB approval is also required for changes 
that may affect the rights, safety or welfare of the subjects. The change in the investigational plan may not be 
implemented until FDA approval (and IRB approval, if required) is obtained. 
b. Addition of new institutions: IRB approval is also required for new institutions. 
The investigation at the new institution(s) may not begin until both FDA and IRB 
approval(s) are obtained, and certification of IRB approval is submitted to FDA. 
 
7. Maintaining Records (21 CFR 812.140(b)) 
 
A sponsor shall maintain the following accurate, complete, and current records relating to an investigation (also See Table I, 
next page): 
a. Correspondence (including reports) with another sponsor, monitor, investigators, an IRB or FDA 
b. Records of any shipment, including: 
(1) name and address of consignee 
(2) type and quantity of device 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
45
(3) date of shipment 
(4) batch numbers or code marks 
c. Records of disposition, describing: 
(1) Batch number or code mark of devices returned, repaired, or disposed of by the investigator or other persons 
(2) Reasons for and method of disposal 
d. Signed investigator agreements 
e. Adverse device effects (whether anticipated or unanticipated) and complaints 
f. Any other records that FDA requires by regulation or by specific requirement for a category of investigation or a 
particular investigation 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


a. Unanticipated adverse device effects (with evaluation) to FDA, all IRBs, and investigators within 10 working days

allow the applicant to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements under Part 54. 
e. Disposing of the device properly. Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation or the investigator's part 
of an investigation, or at the sponsor's request, an investigator shall return to the sponsor any remaining supply of the 
device or otherwise dispose of the device as the sponsor directs. 
3. Maintaining Records (21 CFR 812.140) 
An investigator shall maintain the following accurate, complete, and current records relating to the investigator's 
participation in an investigation:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
50
a. Correspondence with another investigator, an IRB, the sponsor, a monitor, or FDA 
b. Records of receipt, use or disposition of a device that relate to: 
(1) the type and quantity of the device, dates of receipt, and batch numbers or code marks 
(2) names of all persons who received, used, or disposed of each device 
(3) the number of units of the device returned to the sponsor, repaired, or otherwise disposed of, and the 
reason(s) therefore 
c. Records of each subject's case history and exposure to the device, including: 
(1) documents evidencing informed consent and, for any use of a device by the investigator without 
informed consent, any written concurrence of a licensed physician and a brief description of the 
circumstances 
(2) justifying the failure to obtain informed consent 
(3) document all relevant observations, including records concerning adverse device effects (whether 
anticipated or not), information and data on the condition of each subject upon entering, and during the 
course of, the investigation, including information about relevant previous medical history and the 
results of all diagnostic tests 
(4) a record of the exposure of each subject to the investigational device, including the date and time of 
each use, and any other therapy 
d. The protocol, with documents showing the dates of and reasons for each deviation from the protocol 
e. Any other records that FDA requires to be maintained by regulation or by specific requirement for a category 
of investigations or a particular investigation. 
4. Inspections (21 CFR 812.145) 
Investigators are required to permit FDA to inspect and copy any records pertaining to the investigation including, in certain 
situations, those which identify subjects. 
5. Submitting Reports (21 CFR 812.150) 
An investigator shall prepare and submit the following complete, accurate, and timely reports: 
a. To the sponsor and the IRB: 
(1) Any unanticipated adverse device effect occurring during an 
investigation. (Due no later than 10 working days after the investigator first learns of the effect.) 
(2) Progress reports on the investigation. (These reports must be provided at regular intervals, but in no event 
less often than yearly. If there is a study monitor, a copy of the report should also be sent to the monitor.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
51
(3) Any deviation from the investigational plan made to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an 
emergency. (Report is due as soon as possible but no later than 5 working days after the emergency occurs.  
Except in emergency situations, a protocol deviation requires prior sponsor approval; and if the deviation may 
affect the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects, prior FDA and IRB 
approval are required.) 
(4) Any use of the device without obtaining informed consent. (Due within 5 working days after such use.) 
(5) A final report. (Due within 3 months following termination or completion of the investigation or the 
investigator's part of the investigation. For additional guidance, see the discussion under the section entitled 
"Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports.") 
(6) Any further information requested by FDA or the IRB about any aspect of the investigation. 
b. To the Sponsor: 
(1) Withdrawal of IRB approval of the investigator's part of an investigation. (Due within 5 working days of 
such action). 
6. Investigational Device Distribution and Tracking 
The IDE regulations prohibit an investigator from providing an investigational device to any person not authorized to 
receive it (21 CFR 812.110(c)). The best strategy for reducing the risk that an investigational device could be 
improperly dispensed (whether purposely or inadvertently) is for the sponsor and the investigators to closely monitor 
the shipping, use, and final disposal of the device(s). Upon completion or termination of a clinical investigation (or the 
investigator's part of an investigation), or at the sponsor's request, an investigator is required to return to the sponsor 
any remaining supply of the device or otherwise to dispose of the device as the sponsor directs (21 CFR 812.110(e)). 
Investigators must also maintain complete, current and accurate records of the receipt, use, or disposition of 
investigational devices (21 CFR  812.140(a)(2)).  Specific investigator recordkeeping requirements are set forth at 21 
CFR 812.140(a). 
7. Prohibition of Promotion and Other Practices (21 CFR 812.7) 
The IDE regulations prohibit the promotion and commercialization of a device that has not been first cleared or 
approved for marketing by FDA. This prohibition is applicable to sponsors and investigators (or any person acting on 
behalf of a sponsor or investigator), and encompasses the following activities: 
a. Promotion or test marketing of the investigational device 
b. Charging subjects or investigators for the device a price larger than is necessary to recover the costs of 
manufacture, research, development, and handling 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
52
c. Unduly prolonging an investigation beyond the point needed to collect data required to determine whether the 
device is safe and effective, and 
d. Representing that the device is safe or effective for the purposes for which it is being investigated. 
8. Annual Progress Reports and Final Reports 
The IDE regulations do not specify the content of the annual progress or final reports.  With respect to reports to the 
IRB, the IRB itself may specify what information it wishes to be included in these reports. Because FDA does require 
the information listed below, it is suggested that, at a minimum, the annual progress and final reports to the sponsor and 
the IRB also include the following items: 
a. IDE number 
b. Device name 
c. Indications for use 
d. Brief summary of study progress in relation to investigational plan 
e. Number of investigators and investigational sites 
f. Number of subjects enrolled 
g. Number of devices received, used, and the final disposition of unused devices 
h. Brief summary of results and conclusions 
i. Summary of anticipated and unanticipated adverse device effects 
j. Description of any deviations from investigational plan 
k. Reprints of any articles published by the investigator in relation to the study
