FDA Categorization of Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE) Devices to
Assist the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) with
Coverage Decisions
Guidance for Sponsors, Clinical
Investigators, Industry, Institutional
Review Boards, and Food and Drug
Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance modifies the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s or the Agency’s) current
policy on categorizing investigational device exemption (IDE) devices, which assists the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining whether or not an IDE device should
be covered (reimbursed) by CMS.
On December 2, 2015, FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and CMS’s
Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG) executed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)1 to
1

streamline and facilitate the efficient categorization of investigational medical devices in order to
support CMS’s ability to make Medicare coverage (reimbursement) determinations for those
investigational devices under 42 CFR 405 Subpart B. The MOU noted the need for FDA and
CMS to revise their shared understanding regarding categorization. This guidance document is
intended to implement the MOU by further explaining the framework that FDA (both CDRH and
the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER)) intends to follow for such decisions.
This guidance applies to all devices reviewed by CDRH and CBER. The MOU took effect June
2, 2016 (six months following signature by both FDA and CMS, as stated in the MOU). The
framework in this guidance represents the Agency’s current thinking on categorization.

II. Background
1995 Final Rule and FDA-HCFA Interagency Agreement
In September 1995, the Health Care Financing Administration (now known as CMS) published a
final rule and entered into an Interagency Agreement (IA) with FDA regarding reimbursement
categorization of investigational devices. 60 Federal Register (FR) 48417 (September 19, 1995).
The rule established that certain devices with an IDE approved by FDA (and certain services
related to those devices) may be covered under Medicare, and set forth the process by which
FDA would assist CMS in identifying such devices. FDA would assign a device with an FDAapproved IDE to one of two categories: Experimental/Investigational (Category A) devices or
Non-experimental/Investigational (Category B) devices based on the level of risk the device
presented to patients. The IA set forth criteria, agreed upon by CMS and FDA, that FDA would
use to categorize devices. The categorization would then be used by CMS as part of its
determination of whether or not items and services met the requirements for Medicare coverage
under Section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act (the “reasonable and necessary” clause).
That is, to be eligible to be covered (e.g., to have a benefit category determination) under
Medicare, the device must be reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an
illness or injury, or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.2
Under the 1995 CMS final rule, Category A devices were devices believed to be in class III for
which “absolute risk” of the device type had not yet been established. That is, initial questions
of safety and effectiveness had not been resolved and FDA was unsure whether the device type
could be safe and effective. The IA contained two sub-categories which provided criteria
indicating that a given device met this standard and should be placed into Category A: those
devices for which no marketing application had been approved through the premarket approval
(PMA) process for any indication for use, and devices that would otherwise be a Category B
(discussed below), but had undergone significant modification for a new indication or use. An
example of a significant modification might be the addition of a drug to a legally marketed
device where the drug previously had not been used on this type of device.

Under the 1995 CMS final rule, Category B devices were those devices believed to be in Class I
or II, or devices believed to be in Class III for which the incremental risk was the primary risk in
question. That is, with respect to Category B devices, the underlying questions of safety and
effectiveness of that device type had been resolved, or it was known that the device type could be
safe and effective because, for example, other manufacturers had obtained FDA approval for that
device type. The IA identified six sub-categories of investigational devices that were of a device
type for which the underlying questions of safety and effectiveness had been resolved and, thus,
should be placed in Category B. Under the IA, Category B devices included those that were
under investigation to demonstrate substantial equivalence to a predicate device (legally
marketed device) through the 510(k) process and devices comparable to a PMA-approved
device. Several examples of Category A and B devices can be found later in this document.
Importantly, CMS and FDA both recognized that experience in categorizing devices might
require changes to the IA.3
2013 Amendment to 42 CFR 405 Subpart B
CMS, with FDA’s concurrence, published a final rule in the FR on December 10, 2013 (78 FR
74230, 74809) that, among other things, modified the definitions for Category A and Category B.
These definitions can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 42 CFR 405.201:
Category A (Experimental)
42 CFR 405.201(b): “…a device for which ‘absolute risk’ of the device type has not been
established (that is, initial questions of safety and effectiveness have not been resolved) and the
FDA is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective.”
Category B (Nonexperimental/investigational)
42 CFR 405.201(b): “…a device for which the incremental risk is the primary risk in question
(that is, initial questions of safety and effectiveness of that device type have been resolved), or it
is known that the device type can be safe and effective because, for example, other
manufacturers have obtained FDA premarket approval or clearance for that device type.”
CMS uses FDA’s categorization determination as a factor in evaluating whether or not an IDE
device receives Medicare coverage. Medicare may make payment for an investigational device
and routine care items and services furnished in an FDA-approved Category B
(Nonexperimental/Investigational) IDE study if CMS (or its designated entity) determines, prior
to the submission of the first related claim, that the Medicare coverage IDE study criteria in 42
CFR 405.212 are met.4 If the criteria are not met for a Category B device, neither the device nor
other elements of the study will be covered. With respect to Category A devices, if CMS (or its
designated entity) determines that Medicare coverage IDE study criteria in 42 CFR 405.212 are
met, Medicare may cover only routine care items and services furnished in an FDA-approved
The IA was published as an addendum to the final rule in 1995. The FR noted that: “As experience is gained in the
categorization process, this addendum may be modified.” 60 FR at 48419.

Category A (Experimental) IDE study, but not the device itself.5 In other words, Medicare
cannot cover device expenses with respect to studies involving devices that FDA has categorized
as Category A (Experimental).
Reasons for Modification of the Previous FDA Policy
In the more than twenty years since the IA was signed, FDA has received a number of IDEs
which do not easily fit into any of the eight sub-categories identified in the IA.
In 2013, FDA published a final guidance document entitled “Investigational Device Exemptions
(IDEs) for Early Feasibility Medical Device Clinical Studies, Including Certain First in Human
(FIH) Studies” (available at
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocumen
ts/ucm279103.pdf). That document provides guidance on the development and review of IDE
applications for early feasibility studies (EFS) of significant risk devices. EFS are feasibility
studies that are very small in size and allow for early clinical evaluation of devices that may not
be a final design. They are intended to provide proof of principle and initial clinical study data.
Traditional feasibility studies, on the other hand, are completed with a device design that is nearfinal or final and are commonly used to capture preliminary safety and effectiveness information
which may be used to inform a pivotal study design. They are typically larger than EFS. The
general term “feasibility studies” may refer to EFS or traditional feasibility studies. Pivotal
studies are clinical investigations designed to collect definitive evidence of the safety and
effectiveness of a device for a specified intended use, typically in a statistically justified number
of subjects. The previous FDA policy regarding reimbursement categorization did not
adequately articulate categorization criteria that are relevant to certain feasibility studies,
particularly those for devices similar to approved devices but with modifications which raise
significant new safety questions. As a result of this, and the recent increase in EFS submissions
subsequent to the publication of the guidance document referenced above, FDA has determined
that additional clarification of FDA’s approach to these categorization criteria is warranted. It is
important to note that the category designation is made independent of study type and instead is
based on the criteria described in this document.
In addition to the above consideration, there are situations when adequate data are provided to
resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness (e.g., data from a feasibility study becomes
available) and, therefore, it is appropriate to change the device category for subsequent studies of
the same device from Category A to Category B. In these circumstances, a device that had
previously been categorized as experimental could now be considered
nonexperimental/investigational. However, the IA did not describe a pathway for changing
categorization from Category A to Category B when approving subsequent studies for the same
device. In order to outline a mechanism to revisit the categorization of IDE devices when new
information is gathered, the previous FDA policy for categorization of IDE devices is being
modified.

Lastly, in its changes to the regulations (42 CFR 405 Subpart B), effective January 1, 2015,
CMS, with FDA’s concurrence, added criteria for coverage of IDE devices within CMS
approved studies. This was a change from local Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC)
review. The change to a centralized IDE review further reinforced the need for CMS and FDA
to revisit the policy that FDA used to categorize IDE devices. CMS and FDA recognized the
need to revise their shared understanding regarding the categorization of IDE devices to help
ensure that reimbursement of devices will not be precluded due to an inappropriate
reimbursement categorization determination. Rather than amending their 1995 IA, FDA and
CMS entered into an MOU on December 2, 2015 that became effective on June 2, 2016. The
policies and framework in this guidance represent the Agency’s current thinking on
categorization.

III. FDA Interpretation of Medicare Coverage Categories A
and B
After receipt of an IDE application, FDA will determine whether the sponsor has provided
enough information to support initiation of the clinical study. An IDE application is “approved,”
or “approved with conditions,” if FDA has determined that the sponsor has provided adequate
data to support initiation of a human clinical study, no subject protection concerns preclude
initiation of the investigation, and the benefit-risk profile is sufficiently favorable to justify
enrollment.6 A study which has been approved or approved with conditions may be staged such
that preliminary data can be reviewed prior to full patient enrollment. FDA intends to use the
criteria described below to assign a device to Category A or B when the IDE is approved or
approved with conditions. Please refer to Appendix A for a flowchart depicting the decisionmaking process.
Category A: Experimental
42 CFR 405.201(b): “…a device for which ‘absolute risk’ of the device type has not been
established (that is, initial questions of safety and effectiveness have not been resolved) and the
FDA is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective.” FDA intends to consider a
device to be in Category A if one or more of the following three criteria are met:


No PMA approval, 510(k) clearance, or De Novo request has been granted for the
proposed device or similar devices, and data on the proposed device or other similar
devices do not resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness and FDA is unsure
whether the device type can be safe and effective.



The proposed device is being studied for a new indication, or new intended use, for
which information from the proposed or a similar device related to the previous
indication or intended use does not resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness.

For more information on how IDE Decisions are made please refer to the FDA Guidance document “FDA
Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations,” available at
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279107.pdf.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Available non-clinical and/or clinical data on the proposed device or similar devices
relative to the new indication or intended use also do not resolve these questions and
FDA is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective.


The proposed device has different technological characteristics compared to a legally
marketed device, and information related to the marketed device does not resolve initial
questions of safety and effectiveness for the proposed device. Available non-clinical
and/or clinical data on the proposed device or similar devices also do not resolve these
questions and FDA is unsure whether the device type can be safe and effective.

Category B: Nonexperimental/Investigational
42 CFR 405.201(b): “…a device for which the incremental risk is the primary risk in question
(that is, initial questions of safety and effectiveness of that device type have been resolved), or it
is known that the device type can be safe and effective because, for example, other
manufacturers have obtained FDA premarket approval or clearance for that device type.”
FDA intends to consider a device to be in Category B if one or more of the following three
criteria are met:


No PMA approval, 510(k) clearance, or De Novo request has been granted for the
proposed device or similar devices; however, available information (e.g., feasibility study
data) from the proposed device or a similar device resolve the initial questions of safety
and effectiveness.



The proposed device is being studied for a new indication or new intended use; however,
information from the proposed or a similar device related to the previous indication or
intended use resolves the initial questions of safety and effectiveness. In some cases,
additional non-clinical and/or clinical data on the proposed device may also have been
used to resolve these questions.



The proposed device has similar technological characteristics compared to a legally
marketed device, and information related to the marketed device resolves the initial
questions of safety and effectiveness for the proposed device. In some cases, additional
non-clinical and/or clinical data on the proposed device may also have been used to
resolve these questions.

IV. Considerations When Changing from Category A to B
As mentioned previously in this document, there are situations in which clinical and/or nonclinical evaluations provide adequate data to resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness
and, therefore, it is appropriate to change the device category from Category A to Category B.
Data can come from different sources and may become available at different points in time.
Therefore, a category change from A to B could occur in a variety of circumstances and the
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

change may or may not coincide with the completion of a clinical study, or a stage of a clinical
study, on the investigational device.
One situation when a categorization change would be appropriate is when a completed study in
which the device was designated as Category A has resulted in clinical data that resolve the
initial questions of safety and effectiveness. In this case, the device should be designated as
Category B in the subsequent study.
Another situation where a category change may be warranted is when an IDE study receives a
staged approval or staged approval with conditions. 7 In a staged approval, FDA may grant IDE
approval or approval with conditions for a portion of the intended study cohort, enabling certain
outstanding questions to be answered concurrently with enrollment in this initial stage cohort.
The sponsor will be permitted to expand enrollment once an IDE supplement containing the
necessary additional information is submitted to FDA and found to be acceptable. In cases in
which the device has been designated as Category A because there are questions relevant to
initial safety and effectiveness, data gathered from the first (or subsequent) enrollment stage(s)
may resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness such that the device category may be
changed from Category A to Category B during continued study in the full study subject cohort.
FDA will evaluate whether adequate data are present to resolve the initial questions of safety and
effectiveness; a categorization decision will be made upon study approval (for a new study),
upon submission of a request to change the category, or upon review of other IDE supplements
related to the study (e.g., study expansion request). FDA assigns a category independently for a
new study and may initiate a categorization change either independently or in response to a
sponsor’s request. A request to change the IDE category (either from Category A to B or
Category B to A8) can be submitted at any time as an IDE supplement and FDA intends to render
a decision within thirty days. The supplement should include data which would support meeting
the criteria as identified in 42 CFR 405.201(b). Examples of data that may support a change
from Category A to Category B can include but are not limited to:






Peer-reviewed studies on the same or a similar device.
Premarket or postmarket data from studies conducted outside the U.S. on the same or a
similar device.
Reference to commercialization of a device of a similar type.
Preliminary clinical data on the device (e.g., initial data from a staged study, feasibility
study).
Additional non-clinical data on the same or a similar device may be included as
supportive information.

FDA also occasionally receives requests from study sponsors to change from Category B to
Category A. In order to support a change from Category B to Category A, there should be
See “FDA Decisions for Investigational Device Exemption Clinical Investigations” at
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm279107.pdf.

FDA expects most category changes to be from A to B as additional information about the device is obtained.
However, the category designation may also change from B to A.
7

10

directly relevant new information which demonstrates that initial questions of safety and
effectiveness have not been resolved. For example, a comparison of the proposed device to a
commercialized device of a similar type could be supplied along with an explanation to support
why initial questions of safety and effectiveness related to the proposed device still remain that
warrants a categorization change.
The categorization decision will be included in the IDE (original or supplement) approval letter
to the sponsor. In addition to the formal communication by FDA to CMS, it is at the sponsor’s
discretion to communicate to CMS when IDE categorization changes. It should be noted that a
categorization change for a given device will not automatically apply to similar devices.

Examples

V.

Category A: Experimental
The list below provides examples of when a Category A determination may be appropriate, but it
does not represent an exhaustive list of when a device should be classified as Category A.


A device is completely novel and has no, or limited, previous human use and there are
initial questions of safety and effectiveness. There is adequate non-clinical information
to support initiation of an early feasibility study that will provide data to inform potential
device design or procedural improvements.



A drug is added to a previously approved or cleared device. While substantial
information is known about the previously approved or cleared device, the drug has not
previously been used on this type of device, and relevant non-clinical or clinical data are
not available to address the initial questions of safety and effectiveness associated with
the addition of the drug.



An already-approved or -cleared device is being evaluated for a new intended use or
indication for which the device will be placed in a different anatomical location. The
device’s technology is unchanged from what was initially approved or cleared. While
some non-clinical data on this device may be used to anticipate certain aspects of device
performance, it is still uncertain as to whether the device can be safely placed, and be
effective, in the new anatomical location. Therefore, there are inadequate data to resolve
the initial questions of safety and effectiveness relative to the new intended use or
indication, and FDA is unsure whether or not the device type can be safe and effective.



The initial question of safety has been answered with the submission of non-clinical data
and short-term clinical data from a small study. However, additional performance data
will be needed to resolve initial questions related to effectiveness. Therefore, this device
will be designated as Category A.



The initial question of effectiveness has been answered with the submission of data that
demonstrate similar performance to a previously approved device. There is inadequate
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

evidence to resolve initial questions related to safety because this will require follow up
in a clinical study; however, the benefit-risk profile supports initiation of a study.
Category B: Nonexperimental/Investigational
The list below provides examples of when a Category B determination may be appropriate, but it
does not represent an exhaustive list of when a device should be classified as Category B.


The insertion system of an approved device has been modified to improve ease of use for
the clinician. Non-clinical test data resolved initial questions of safety and effectiveness
related to this change; however, confirmatory clinical information about the device
performance is required due to the inherent differences between the non-clinical test
environment and the clinical setting.



Adequate data have been gathered from non-clinical testing, and the clinical results of a
feasibility study such that initial questions of safety and effectiveness have been resolved.
A pivotal study will be initiated to provide the primary clinical evidence for the safety
and effectiveness of the device in support of a future marketing application.



A new device will be studied for an indication for which substantial safety and
effectiveness information exists from other similar device(s) of the same type that are
used for the same or a similar indication. Clinical information from similar devices and
non-clinical test data for the new device that have been provided can answer initial safety
and effectiveness questions regarding this indication.



A modification has been made to an approved device in order to improve its
performance. Non-clinical and clinical data available from the previous version of the
device, along with additional testing on the modified device, resolved initial questions of
safety and effectiveness. The purpose of the study will be to gather further data regarding
device performance for this modified version of the device.



New device sizes will be added to a product matrix for an approved device. Initial
questions of safety and effectiveness have been resolved based on experience with the
approved device, and it is generally understood how the new device sizes will perform.
The new device sizes will be evaluated in a clinical study such that confirmatory safety
and effectiveness information relevant to these sizes can be gathered.



An approved device will be evaluated in a new patient population. Non-clinical and
clinical data from use in the previous patient population resolved initial questions of
safety and effectiveness for the new patient population. The new study to be conducted
will provide further data regarding device performance for this new patient population.



An approved device will be evaluated for a new indication. Data exist on the approved
device for a similar indication, and non-clinical data have also been supplied such that the
initial questions of safety and effectiveness related to the new indication have been
resolved. The new study to be conducted will provide further data regarding device
performance for this new indication.
12

Change from Category A to Category B
If the device was previously designated as Category A, but the initial questions of safety and
effectiveness of the device have since been resolved, it may be appropriate to change the
Category from A to B. The list below provides examples of when a change from Category A to
Category B may be appropriate, but it does not represent an exhaustive list of when a device may
change from Category A to Category B.


A novel insertion procedure will be used to place an already-approved or -cleared device,
and there are initial questions of safety and effectiveness regarding the novel insertion
procedure that have not been resolved. In this case, these questions of safety and
effectiveness may be answered in a short timeframe with a limited number of subjects in
the context of a larger clinical study. Therefore, the device will be evaluated in a staged
clinical study where the first stage falls under Category A. If the initial questions of
safety and effectiveness are resolved, and the study continues, the device may be recategorized to Category B.



Adequate data have been gathered on a device from non-clinical testing and an early
feasibility study has been conducted within the U.S., such that initial questions of safety
and effectiveness have been resolved. Additional data are needed to help inform a
pivotal study design; therefore, a traditional feasibility study will be initiated. Although
the EFS was originally designated as Category A, adequate data as described above have
since been gathered (in the EFS) to support a change to Category B for the traditional
feasibility study.



A device is currently being evaluated in a clinical study and has been designated
Category A. While the study is being conducted, clinical study results for similar devices
become available which resolve initial questions of safety and effectiveness for the
device. This information will be used to support a categorization change from Category
A to Category B for the device evaluated in the ongoing clinical study.

VI. Conclusions
FDA categorizes IDE devices based on whether available data demonstrate that initial questions
of safety and effectiveness have been resolved. This guidance document describes the process
and information that will be used to help determine the appropriate category for a device to be
studied. This guidance document also describes when it is appropriate to change the device
category from Category A to Category B.
The categorization of IDE devices is used by CMS as part of its determination of which devices
meet the requirements for Medicare coverage under Section 1862 (a)(1)(A) of the Social
Security Act (the “reasonable and necessary” clause). IDE device categorization is only part of
the information used to determine coverage by CMS. Please refer to the website “Medicare
Coverage Related to Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) Studies”
