Regulatory Considerations for
Microneedling Products
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance is being issued to assist industry in understanding when a microneedling product
is a device as defined in section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C
Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), and is, therefore, subject to the device requirements under the FD&C
Act and its implementing regulations. This document also provides information on the regulatory
pathway to market for microneedling devices for aesthetic use.
Throughout this guidance document, the term “we” refers to FDA staff from CDRH. “You” and
“your” refers to the sponsor.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope
This guidance addresses certain “microneedling products,” which is a generic term that
encompasses instruments with common technological features that include an array of needles,
“micro-protrusion” tips, or pins, which can be blunt or sharp, and of varying lengths. The
needles1 are incorporated into the body of an instrument that facilitates rolling or stamping of
1

For the purposes of this guidance document, the term “needles” refers to any configuration of needles, “microprotrusion” tips, or pins.

these needles across or into the skin. For example, the needles may be attached to a cylinder that
is rolled across the skin, attached perpendicular to a flat surface that is applied to the skin in a
“stamping” fashion, or arranged in an array on the tip of a pen-shaped instrument. The
application of needles to skin may be done manually, or motorized where the depth and speed of
penetration of needles into the skin can be controlled. Other generic terms used to describe
microneedling products include: microneedling or needling instruments, needlers, dermal rollers,
microneedle rollers, microneedle stamps, dermal stamps, and variations thereof.
Microneedling products have a wide range of uses from facilitating skin exfoliation and
improvement of the appearance of skin, to treatment of scars, wrinkles, and other skin conditions
(e.g., acne). In addition, these products may be for single use or multiple use for a single or
multiple users, and include, or have available separately, cleaning solutions, additional needle
cartridges, and/or additional tips.
Microneedling products have also been promoted with topically applied substances such as
creams, ointments, gels, vitamin solutions, drugs, or blood products (e.g., platelet-rich plasma),
which may be packaged together with the microneedling product or available separately where
the microneedling product provides instructions for use with such topical products. Such
microneedling products may be combination products under 21 CFR 3.2(e), which would be
regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), the Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research (CBER), and/or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH). Microneedling combination products are outside the scope of this guidance;
manufacturers of such combination products should contact the Office of Combination Products
(OCP) for additional information regarding the regulation of these products.2
Acupuncture needles, hypodermic needles or other needles for injection, tattoo machine needles,
needle probes that emit any type of energy (e.g., radio-frequency needles) or deliver any type of
energy to a patient (e.g., LASER, ultrasound), and dermabrasion devices are also outside the
scope of this guidance.
Certain microneedling products are devices, whereas others are not. See sections IV and V for
more information. Sections VII.1 and VII.2 of this guidance provide examples of microneedling
products that would be devices and that would not be devices, respectively.
The guidance also covers the regulation of certain microneedling devices. Specifically,
microneedling devices for aesthetic use are classified as class II devices under 21 CFR 878.4430.
In addition, note that microneedling devices are different than dermabrasion devices, which are
not within the scope of this guidance. Dermabrasion devices are classified as class I devices
under 21 CFR 878.4800 (manual) and 21 CFR 878.4820 (motorized) and are exempt from the
premarket notification (510(k)) process under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §

360(k), and 21 CFR part 807, subpart E, subject to the limitations in 21 CFR 878.9. According to
CDRH’s 1999 guidance document “Guidance for Dermabrasion Devices,”3 dermabrasion
devices are defined as “devices with indications for general dermabrasion, scar revision, acne
scar revision, and tattoo removal.” Dermabrasion devices utilize abrasion substrates such as
brushes, rasps, and burrs that are intended to abrade or remove layers of the skin via shear forces.
In contrast, microneedling devices utilize a substrate of needles. Although some dermabrasion
devices and microneedling devices may have the same or similar intended uses, as identified
above, microneedling devices have different technological characteristics and operate via
different modes of action compared to dermabrasion devices which raise different questions of
safety and effectiveness. In addition, microneedling devices may have intended uses that are
different from those of dermabrasion devices.

III. Definitions
The following definitions are intended to be used within the context of this guidance and are not
necessarily applicable to any context beyond this document.
Stratum corneum: The stratum corneum is the superficial or outer layer of the epidermis,
consisting of several layers of flat, keratinized, non-viable, peeling cells. The stratum corneum is
a dead cell layer of skin, as opposed to living layers of skin.
Exfoliation: Exfoliation is the detachment and shedding of superficial dead cells of the
epidermis, i.e., the stratum corneum.
Living layers of skin: Living layers of skin are layers of live cells and surrounding tissues (e.g.,
connective tissue) within the epidermis, dermis, and subcutis, including hair follicles and
glandular structures. Living layers of skin exclude the stratum corneum.
Dermabrasion: Dermabrasion is the abrading or eroding of skin via shear forces with abrasive
substrates such as brushes, rasps, corundum, and burrs.

IV. Microneedling Products That Are Devices
A.

Statutory Definition of a Device

Under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, a device is an instrument, apparatus, implement,
machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any
component, part, or accessory which is:
(1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopeia, or any
supplement to them,

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation,
treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animal, or
(3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animal, and
which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or
on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized
for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.
Whether a microneedling product is a device depends, in part, on whether it is intended for use in
the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of
disease, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. A product’s intended use
refers to the “objective intent” of those legally responsible for the labeling of a product,4 which is
determined by their expressions or may be determined by considering the circumstances
surrounding the distribution of a product.5 This objective intent may be shown, for example, by
the claims made by a firm of a microneedling product, and from other relevant sources.

B.

Determining Whether a Microneedling Product Is a
Device

FDA may consider the following, among other relevant sources, in determining whether a
microneedling product is a device under the FD&C Act:
1.

Firm’s Claims and Statements

FDA may consider, among other things, any written or oral claims or statements in any
label, labeling, advertising, and/or promotion of a microneedling product by or on behalf
of a firm in determining whether a microneedling product is intended to cure, mitigate,
treat or prevent disease or affect the structure or function of the body. Further, FDA
considers claims or statements that indicate penetration or some effect beyond the stratum
corneum into living layers of skin by such products to be evidence of a firm’s intent to
affect the structure or function of the body. The stratum corneum is a dead layer of skin
that is naturally shed through the desquamation process. Therefore, claims or statements
regarding the removal of the stratum corneum are not considered an intent to affect the
structure or function of the body. In contrast, explicitly or implicitly claiming or stating
that a microneedling product penetrates living layers of skin (e.g., epidermis and dermis)
would be considered an intent to affect the structure or function of the body. The
following are examples of claims or statements associated with microneedling products
that FDA believes would generally cause the product to meet the device definition:
•
•

Treats scars (e.g., acne scars, atrophic scars, hypertrophic scars, burn scars)
Treats wrinkles and deep facial lines

4

For the purposes of this guidance document, the term “firm” is used to refer to “persons legally responsible for the
labeling of devices” under 21 CFR 801.4 as a convenience throughout the guidance.

2.

Product Design and Technological Characteristics/Features

In addition to examining a firm’s claims and statements, FDA may consider the design
and technological characteristics/features of a microneedling product in determining
whether a microneedling product is a device under the FD&C Act. Specifically, FDA
considers needle penetration beyond the stratum corneum as a result of the design or
technology of a microneedling product as evidence that it may be “intended to affect the
structure or any function of the body” under section 201(h) of FD&C Act. In considering
the design and technological characteristics of these products, FDA may evaluate the
following:
•
•
•

Needle length and arrangement and whether the specifications facilitate
penetration into living layers of skin
Needle sharpness and whether that facilitates penetration into living layers of skin
Degree of control of manual or motorized microneedling products over the
movement of needles and depth of penetration into living layers of skin

Information regarding design and technological characteristics may be found in various
places, including the product’s specifications, directions for use, or other materials.

V.

Microneedling Products That Are Not Devices

Microneedling products that are not intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other
conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease, and that are not
intended to affect the structure or any function of the body, are not devices under section 201(h)
of the FD&C Act. For example, generally, microneedling products that do not penetrate living
skin (e.g., epidermal and dermal layers of the skin) and claim only to do the following would not
be devices:
·
·
·
·

facilitate exfoliation of the skin (i.e., disruption or removal of the stratum corneum)
improve the appearance of skin
give skin a smoother look and feel
give skin a luminous look

In general, such microneedling products would not be devices; however, the products may still
be subject to other requirements of the FD&C Act or other Federal statutes or regulations
administered by other Federal agencies.

VI. Classification of Certain Microneedling Devices
Microneedling devices for aesthetic use are classified as class II devices under 21 CFR 878.4430,
subject to premarket notification (510(k)) and special controls outlined in the classification
regulation (see 21 CFR 878.4430(b)(1)-(10)). Under 21 CFR 878.4430, a microneedling device
for aesthetic use is identified as a device using one or more needles to mechanically puncture and
injure skin tissue for aesthetic use. This classification does not include devices intended for
transdermal delivery of topical products such as cosmetics, drugs, or biologics. FDA classified
microneedling devices for aesthetic use into class II under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act,
also referred to as the De Novo classification process. This process provides a pathway to class I
or class II classification for devices for which general controls or general and special controls
provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, but for which there is no legally
marketed predicate device. Additional recommendations on information to include in a 510(k)
submission for a microneedling device for aesthetic use is provided in response to Question 3
below.

VII. Questions and Answers
1. What are examples of microneedling products that would be
devices?
As discussed above, microneedling products are regulated as devices if they are intended to
diagnose disease or other conditions, or cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect
the structure or function of the body, as defined under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act. The
following are examples of microneedling products that FDA believes generally would be
regulated as devices:
a) A manual microneedling product with short, blunt needles where the firm makes claims
that the product is intended to exfoliate, give skin a luminous look, stimulate collagen
production, and treat wrinkles
In spite of the exfoliation and “give skin a luminous look” claims in this first example, the
firm also makes claims that the microneedling product is intended to stimulate collagen
production and treat wrinkles (i.e., affect the structure or function of skin); therefore, the
product would be subject to FDA regulation as a device.
b) A motorized microneedling product with sharp needles that penetrate living layers of the
skin, where the firm makes claims that the product is intended to make skin smoother by
penetrating the skin to stimulate healing response and formation of new tissue
This second example illustrates how FDA considers the design and technological
characteristics of a microneedling product, in conjunction with claims by the firm, to
determine whether the product is a device. Here, the microneedling product is intended to
affect the structure and function of the body. Although making skin smoother may not
necessarily require an effect on the structure or function of the body, such as through the
9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

removal or disruption of the stratum corneum, the firm makes claims that the product here is
intended to penetrate living layers of the skin and designed the product to achieve this effect.
Therefore, it would be subject to FDA regulation as a device.

2. What are examples of microneedling products that would not
be devices?
As discussed above, microneedling products that are not intended to diagnose disease or
other conditions, or cure, mitigate, treat or prevent disease and that are not intended to affect
the structure or any function of the body are not devices, as defined under section 201(h) of
FD&C Act. The following are examples of microneedling products that FDA believes
generally would not be devices:
a) A microneedling product with short, blunt needles or “micro-protrusion” tips that do not
penetrate living layers of skin and for which the firm claims that the product is intended
to facilitate skin exfoliation
b) A microneedling product with short, densely packed needles that are not designed to
penetrate living layers of skin and for which the firm claims that the product is intended
to give skin a smoother look and feel
In both examples, the products would not be devices. In these examples, the microneedling
products are intended to be used to facilitate skin exfoliation and to give skin a smoother look
and feel. Furthermore, the products are designed such that they would not penetrate living
layers of skin due to the needle length, blunt needle tips, and/or densely packed needles.

3. I have determined my microneedling product is a device
regulated by CDRH. What are my next steps?
Microneedling devices for aesthetic use were classified as class II devices under 21 CFR
878.44306 as part of a De Novo classification request (DEN160029).7
Manufacturers wishing to market their microneedling device for aesthetic use should submit
a premarket notification (510(k))8 submission demonstrating substantial equivalence of their
device to a legally marketed predicate microneedling device and compliance with the special
controls as codified in 21 CFR 878.4430.

The special controls described in 21 CFR 878.4430(b)(1)-(10) mitigate the identified risks to
health associated with microneedling devices for aesthetic use including adverse tissue
reaction; cross-contamination and infection; electrical shock or electromagnetic interference
with other devices; and damage to underlying tissue including nerves and blood vessels,
scarring, and hyper/hypopigmentation due to exceeding safe penetration depth, mechanical
failure, or software malfunction.
The 510(k) submission should identify the predicate device to which the new microneedling
device is compared. For a microneedling device that has new or modified indications for use
and/or different technological characteristics when compared to the predicate device, FDA
may request clinical performance data in addition to non-clinical testing if needed to make a
substantial equivalence determination.9 For those submissions where clinical data is
necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence, we recommend considering the following
when designing a clinical study:
i)

The clinical study protocol should generally ensure that enrolled subjects are
representative of the clinical population that the device is intended to treat. This
should be reflected in the inclusion and exclusion criteria developed for the study.

ii)

Safety data should generally be collected to support the safe use of the device. Such
data should characterize the risks of infection, nerve and blood vessel damage, scar
formation, hyper-/hypo-pigmentation, skin inflammation, allergic reactions, skin
irritation, and other adverse events related to the use of the device.

iii)

The proposed primary effectiveness endpoint should generally be developed to
align with the proposed indications for use for your device. Effectiveness should be
measured using a method that minimizes subjectivity or bias. FDA recommends use
of validated measurement tools to assess device effectiveness.

iv)

The follow-up period should ensure a reasonable assessment of the short-term and
long-term performance of the device, as it relates to the safety and effectiveness
endpoints as outlined above.

As a resource for designing clinical studies, FDA recommends reviewing the guidance
document “Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices.”10
If you have further questions regarding a proposed premarket submission, you may contact
FDA via the Pre-Submission process. For more information regarding the Pre-Submission
program, refer to the guidance document “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical
Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.”11
