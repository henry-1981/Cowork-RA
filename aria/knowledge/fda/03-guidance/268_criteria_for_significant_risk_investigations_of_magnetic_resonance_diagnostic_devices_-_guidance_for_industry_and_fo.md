Criteria for Significant Risk
Investigations of Magnetic Resonance

Diagnostic Devices
Guidance for Industry
and Food and Drug Administration
Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to
discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
This guidance describes the device operation conditions for magnetic resonance diagnostic
devices that FDA considers significant risk for the purposes of determining whether a clinical
study requires Agency approval of an Investigation Device Exemption (IDE). Magnetic
resonance diagnostic devices are class II devices described under 21 CFR 892.1000. The
product codes for these devices are:
LNH Magnetic Resonance Imaging System
LNI Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic System
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Studies of Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic Devices
If a clinical study is needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence, i.e., conducted prior to
obtaining 510(k) clearance of the device, the study must be conducted under the IDE
regulation (21 CFR Part 812). FDA believes that a magnetic resonance diagnostic device used
under any one of the operating conditions listed below is a significant risk device as defined
in 21 CFR 812.3(m)(4) and, therefore, that studies involving such a device do not qualify for
the abbreviated IDE requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b). In addition to the requirement of
having an FDA-approved IDE, sponsors of significant risk studies must comply with the
regulations governing institutional review boards (21 CFR Part 56) and informed consent (21
CFR Part 50).

Significant Risk Magnetic Resonance Diagnostic
Devices
You should consider the following operating conditions when assessing whether a study may
be considered significant risk:
•
•
•
•

main static magnetic field
specific absorption rate (SAR)
gradient fields rate of change
sound pressure level

Generally, FDA deems magnetic resonance diagnostic devices significant risk when used
under any of the operating conditions described below.

Main Static Magnetic Field
Population

Main static magnetic
field greater than (tesla)

adults, children, and infants aged > 1 month

8

neonates i.e., infants aged 1 month or less

4

2

Specific Absorption Rate (SAR)
Site

Dose

Time (min)
equal to or greater than:

SAR
(W/kg)

whole body

averaged over

15

>4

head

averaged over

10

>3.2

If you have questions about significant risk criteria related to local SAR, you may
wish to contact FDA.

Gradient Fields Rate of Change
Any time rate of change of gradient fields (dB/dt) sufficient to produce severe
discomfort or painful nerve stimulation

Sound Pressure Level
Peak unweighted sound pressure level greater than 140 dB.
A-weighted root mean square (rms) sound pressure level greater than 99 dBA with
hearing protection in place.
These criteria apply only to device operating conditions. Other aspects of the study may
involve significant risks and the study, therefore, may require IDE approval regardless of
operating conditions. See Blue Book Memorandum entitled Significant Risk and Nonsignificant Risk Medical Device Studies
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126418.pdf) for
further discussion.
After FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent, clinical studies conducted in
accordance with the indications reviewed in the 510(k), including clinical design validation
studies conducted in accordance with the quality systems regulation, are exempt from the
investigational device exemptions (IDE) requirements. However, such studies must be
performed in conformance with 21 CFR 56 and 21 CFR 50.
