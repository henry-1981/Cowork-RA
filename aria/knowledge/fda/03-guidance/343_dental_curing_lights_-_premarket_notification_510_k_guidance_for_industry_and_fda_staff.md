Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Dental Curing Lights - Premarket
Notification [510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current
thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and
does not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the
approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you
want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for
implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket
notification submissions for dental curing lights intended for polymerize (set) resinous
dental pit and fissure sealants or restorative materials by transmission of light through a
rod (21 CFR 872.6070).

2.

The Least Burdensome Approach

The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered
the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the
issues we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome
approach to resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you
believe that there is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the
procedures outlined in the “A Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome
Issues” document. It is available on our Center web page at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

3. Background
A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type should conform
to the general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act),
including the premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart
E, and obtain a substantial equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing
the device. (See also 21 CFR 807.81 and 807.87).
This guidance document identifies the classification regulations and product codes for
dental curing lights (refer to Section 5. Scope). In addition, other sections of this
guidance document provide additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks
related to these devices in premarket notifications (510[k]s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content
requirements of a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR
807.87 and “How to Prepare a 510(k) Submission” on FDA Device Advice at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications; Final Guidance,”
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html, a manufacturer may submit a Traditional
510(k) or has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k).
FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of
demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued
a guidance document addressing that device. Manufacturers considering certain
modifications to their own cleared devices may lessen the regulatory burden by
submitting a Special 510(k).

4. The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission
An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21
CFR 807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the
device, its intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), FDA
may consider the contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within
the meaning of 21 CFR 807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a
summary report. The report should describe how this guidance document was used
during the device development and testing and should briefly describe the methods or
tests used and a summary of the test data or description of the acceptance criteria applied
to address the risks identified in this document, as well as any additional risks specific to
your device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the requirements of 21
CFR 807.87 as well as some other items that we recommend you include in an
Abbreviated 510(k).

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k)
and cite the title of this guidance document.

Proposed labeling
Proposed labeling should be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (Please refer to Section 11. Labeling for specific information
that should be included in the labeling for devices of the types covered by this
guidance document.)

Summary report
FDA recommends that the summary report contain:
Description of the device and its intended use
We recommend that you describe the performance specifications and, when
appropriate, include detailed, labeled drawings of the device. (Please refer to
Section 6. Device Description for specific information that we recommend you
include in the device description for devices of the types covered by this guidance
document.) You should also submit an “indications for use” enclosure.1
Description of device design
We recommend that you include a brief description of the device design
requirements.
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess
the risk profile, in general, as well as the specific device’s design and the results
of this analysis. (Please refer to Section 7. Risks to Health for the risks to health
generally associated with the use of this device that FDA has identified.)
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks
identified in this guidance document, as well as any additional risks identified in
your risk analysis.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Description of the performance aspects
We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have
used or intend to use to address each performance aspect identified in Sections 9–
11 of this guidance document. If you follow a suggested test method, you may
cite the method rather than describing it. If you modify a suggested test method,
you may cite the method but should provide sufficient information to explain the
nature of and reason for the modification. For each test, you may either (1)
briefly present the data resulting from the test in clear and concise form, such as a
table, or (2) describe the acceptance criteria that you will apply to your test
results.2 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C - Design Controls for the Quality
System Regulation.)
Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or testing,
you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

declaration of conformity to the standard.3

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe
you cannot properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed
the testing the standard describes. For more information, please refer to section
514(c)(1)(B) of the Act and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial
Equivalence Determinations.4
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional
risks identified through your risk analysis, we may request additional information
about aspects of the device’s performance characteristics. We may also request
additional information if we need it to assess the adequacy of your acceptance
criteria. (Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), we may request any additional information
that is necessary to reach a determination regarding substantial equivalence.)
2

If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the
subject device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being
introduced into interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance
criteria and, thus, differs from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA
recommends that submitters apply the same criteria used to assess modifications to
legally marketed devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to determine whether marketing of the
finished device requires clearance of a new 510(k).

As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional
510(k) that provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and
described in this guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods,
data, acceptance criteria, and conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain
modifications to their own cleared devices should consider submitting Special 510(k)s.
In general, the discussion above applies to any 510(k). The following is a specific
discussion of how you should apply this guidance document to a premarket notification
submission for dental curing lights.

5. Scope
This document applies to dental curing lights for photoactivation of resins and dental
bleaching agents (class II, product procode EBZ) classified under the following
regulation.
21 CFR 872.6070 Ultraviolet Activator for Polymerization
An ultraviolet activator for polymerization is a device that produces ultraviolet
radiation intended to polymerize (set) resinous dental pit and fissure sealants or
restorative materials by transmission of light through a rod.
The scope of this guidance includes devices that use light sources such as quartztungsten-halogen lamps, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and xenon-plasma arcs, as well as
laser energy sources.
The scope of this guidance does not include heat or light sources intended exclusively
for tooth bleaching procedures. These are classified under 21 CFR 872.6475, Heat
Source for Bleaching Teeth, product code EEG. These devices are exempt from the
premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter, subject to the
limitations of §872.9.

6. Device Description
We recommend you identify your device by regulation number and product code
identified in Section 5. Scope and include a description of:
•

the principles of operation (i.e., the scientific principles behind how the device
achieves its intended use)

•

how you plan to market the device (and accessories, if any).

We recommend you provide information to show how the new device is both similar to
and different from the legally marketed device. Side by side comparisons, whenever
possible, are desirable; for example, using a tabular format as shown below. We also

We recommend you demonstrate that the use of your device does not present a thermal
hazard to the patient. For example, you may wish to demonstrate that, for the longest
prescribed curing times, patient contacting portions of the device do not present a thermal
hazard.
We recommend you demonstrate that the use of your device does not present an optical
radiation hazard to the patient for the maximum expected exposure time in any single
area associated with the use of the device; for example, showing that for the longest
exposure times, the optical radiation emissions from the device do not present hazards.

9. Electrical Safety and Electromagnetic Compatibility
We recommend you demonstrate the electrical safety of your device by following both
FDA-recognized standards below or equivalent methods:
•

American National Standard/American Dental Association (ANSI/ADA)
Specification No. 48, Visible Light Curing Units, 2004

•

IEC 60601-1:1988, Medical Electrical Equipment – Part 1: General
requirements for safety.

We recommend you demonstrate the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of your
device by following the recommendations of the FDA-recognized standards below or
equivalent methods:
•

sterilization, or both, as appropriate for your device, and include the validated method,
suitable chemical disinfectants for the device material type, and the cycle
variables―time, temperature, pressure.

11. Labeling
The premarket notification should include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). Products using lasers must also comply with 21 CFR
Sections 1040.10 and 1040.11 and labeled according to 21 CFR 1040.10(g).
The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you in preparing labeling that satisfies
the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801.8 We recommend labeling include:
•

maximum light intensity

•

peak wavelength

•

types of curing systems compatible with your device

•

warnings about optical radiation and thermal hazards.

We recommend that the labeling and instructions for use of your device follow the
recommendations of the FDA guidance: Labeling Reusable Medical Devices for
Reprocessing in Health Care Facilities: FDA Reviewer Guidance.9 In particular, the
instructions for reprocessing should include details for the user on:
•

disassembly

•

cleaning

•

rinsing

•

disinfection/sterilization

•

drying

•

reassembly of the device

•

use of disposable sheathing for other portions of the device.
