On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Unique Device Identification System
Small Entity Compliance Guide
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

I.

Introduction

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by
assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and
other biological products, medical devices, the nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary
supplements, and products that give off radiation; and for regulating tobacco products.
Section 226 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) and
section 614 of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012
(FDASIA) amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to add section 519(f), which
directs FDA to publish regulations establishing a unique device identification system for
medical devices. On September 24, 2013, FDA published a final rule establishing a unique
device identification system (the UDI Rule). Some parts of the rule became effective on
October 24, 2013; the remaining parts became effective on December 23, 2013. Certain
requirements within the rule have later compliance dates, as will be explained in Section VI
of this document. In developing the UDI Rule, FDA solicited input from a variety of
stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, global regulatory bodies, the clinical community, patient
advocates) to ensure that as many perspectives were incorporated as possible.
This guidance is intended primarily to provide information to the medical device industry,
including small businesses, concerning FDA’s September 24, 2013, final rule establishing a
unique device identification system; see 78 FR 58786 et seq. It provides an overview of the
UDI Rule’s regulatory requirements and discusses the actions a small entity should take to
meet those requirements. Other guidance documents, such as the guidance document titled

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID) and issued on June 25, 2014,
discuss in greater detail the technical implementation of the UDI Rule.
Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us” and “our” refer to FDA staff from
CDRH and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). “You” and “your”
refers to the labeler.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally-enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe FDA’s current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in FDA guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Under Section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (PL
104-121) we are required to publish one or more guides that assist small entities in complying
with each rule or group of related rules for which we are required to prepare a final regulatory
flexibility analysis under 5 USC 605(b).
The UDI Rule establishes a UDI system. It requires the labels and device packages of
medical devices distributed in the United States include a unique device identifier (UDI),
unless we grant an exception or alternative to UDI label requirements. As will be explained
later, this UDI will be in both easily readable plain-text and Automatic Identification and
Data Capture (AIDC) technology – usually a bar code. The UDI Rule also requires specified
product information be submitted to FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database
(GUDID). Most of this information in GUDID will be made available to the public. When
fully implemented, the UDI system will serve several important public health objectives:
•
•
•
•

•

It will facilitate the healthcare community, industry, and the public’s rapid and
accurate identification of a device using the UDI that appears on the device’s label
and device package.
Medical providers, patients and others will be able to more easily access important
information concerning the device, thereby reducing medical errors.
It will allow more accurate reporting, reviewing, and analyzing of adverse event
reports so that problems can be identified and corrected more quickly.
It will provide a standard and clear way to document device use in electronic health
records, clinical information systems, claims data sources and registries, leading to a
more robust postmarket surveillance system which can be leveraged to support
premarket approval or clearance of new devices and new uses of currently marketed
devices.
It will enable manufacturers, distributors and healthcare facilities to more effectively
manage medical device recalls.

•

It will provide a foundation for a global, secure distribution chain that will help
address counterfeiting and diversion, and prepare for medical emergencies.

III. Overview
The UDI Rule establishes label and data submission requirements for all medical devices in
commercial distribution in the United States. There are two main parts to the UDI system;
there is a label requirement and a data submission requirement. Every medical device label
and every device package must include a UDI, unless we have granted an exception or
alternative. The rule lists general exceptions and outlines the procedure for requesting a
specific exception or alternative. The UDI Rule specifies the requirements for how the UDI
will appear on the device label and package. The UDI Rule also specifies data submission
and record keeping requirements. It requires all UDIs to be issued under a system operated
by an FDA-accredited issuing agency. It also outlines the procedure to apply for FDAaccreditation as an issuing agency, specifies the information that the applicant must provide
to FDA, and lists the criteria we will apply in evaluating applications. The UDI Rule
provides for the suspension and revocation of the accreditation of an issuing agency, and
explains the circumstances under which we may act as an issuing agency. The UDI system
will be phased in over a seven year period, through an established set of compliance dates, to
ensure a smooth implementation, and to spread the costs and burdens over time. Greater
details of the UDI Rule are set out in the following sections of this document.

IV. Definitions

V.

UDI Final Rule
A.

Requirement to bear a UDI label

The UDI Rule requires a UDI on every device label and package. There are general
exceptions to this requirement which are explained in Section V.E.1. 3 Each UDI must be in
both easily readable plain-text and in a form that uses automatic identification and data
capture (AIDC) technology. We explain this more in Section V.B.1.
The “labeler” has the responsibility for complying with the UDI label, data submission, and
records requirements. Therefore, it is important to determine whether you fit the definition of
“labeler”. The definition of “labeler” is included in Section IV. In most instances, the device
manufacturer is the labeler. But this is not always the case. For example, if you
remanufacture and place a new label on a device, you are a labeler for purposes of the UDI
Rule.

1.

Device Identifier and Production Identifier
(UDI = DI + PI)

A UDI typically comprises both a device identifier (DI) and a production identifier (PI).
These terms are defined in Section IV. However the UDI of a class I device is not required to
include a PI.
a.

Device Identifier

The device identifier (DI) is a mandatory, fixed portion of the UDI that identifies (1) you as
the labeler, and (2) the specific model or version of your device. The DI is used to look up
information about the device in the database administered by FDA called the GUDID. The
GUDID is discussed further in Section V.D.
Each DI is used to identify only one version or model. You must assign a new DI if you
change a device so that it becomes a new version or model. Also, if you create a new device
package such as a new package configuration or another packaging level, you must assign a
new DI to that new package. Keep in mind, you as the labeler, and not FDA, decides what is
a separate version or model of your device for purposes of requiring a DI.
If you discontinue a version or model of a device, you may not reassign the DI to another
device. If you reintroduce a discontinued version or model of a device, you may use the DI
assigned to that particular version or model of the device at the time that you discontinued it.
3

If you do not fit within one of the general exceptions, Section V.E.2 explains how to request a specific
exception or alternative.
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

b.

Production Identifier (PI)

A production identifier (PI) is a conditional, variable portion of the UDI. If you have
included any of following information in your device label, that information must also be
included in the PI portion of the UDI:
(a) The lot or batch within which a device was manufactured;
(b) The serial number of a specific device;
(c) The expiration date of a specific device;
(d) The date a specific device was manufactured.
(e) For an HCT/P regulated as a device, the distinct identification code required by 21
CFR 1271.290(c).
For ease of use, this type of information is referred to as “PI. Please note: any identifiers
beyond those five listed above are outside the scope of the FDA-regulated UDI.

2.

Voluntary Labeling of Device with UDI (21 CFR 801.35)

If your device is not required to have a UDI, you may still voluntarily comply with UDI
requirements, including label and data submission requirements. If you voluntarily comply
with the UDI label requirements, you are not required to submit data to the GUDID, but you
may volunteer to do so.

3.

In Vitro Diagnostic Products (21 CFR 801.119)

In vitro diagnostic products must comply with both UDI label requirements and the label
requirements in 21 CFR 809.10.

4.

Discontinuation of legacy FDA identification numbers
assigned to medical devices (NHRIC and NDC numbers)
(21 CFR 801.57)

If your device has a National Health-Related Item Code (NHRIC) or National Drug Code
(NDC) assigned to it, and a UDI is also required, the NHRIC or NDC will be rescinded on
the device’s UDI compliance date (see Section VI for compliance dates). As of the UDI
compliance date, you may no longer put a NHRIC or NDC number on your device label or
package.
If your device is not required to bear a UDI, any NHRIC or NDC assigned to it will be
rescinded on September 24, 2018, and you will not be permitted to put the NHRIC or NDC
on the device label or package.

B.

UDI Label Requirements
1.

Form of a UDI (21 CFR 801.40)

Every UDI must be presented in two forms:
(1) Easily readable plain-text, and
(2) Automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) technology. If the AIDC
technology is not evident upon visual examination of the label or package, the label or
package must disclose the presence of the AIDC technology.
If your device is class I, you may use a Universal Product Code (UPC) to serve as the UDI on
the device label and package. In addition, the UDI on your class I devices are not required to
include a PI.

2.

Technical Requirements for a UDI (21 CFR 830.20)

There are very specific technical requirements for UDIs. FDA-accredited issuing agencies
(IAs) are required to issue UDIs that conform to the following ISO standards (FDAaccredited issuing agency is explained in detail in Section V.C.):
(a) ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006(E), Information technology--Unique identifiers--Part 2:
Registration procedures (second edition; March 1, 2006);
(b) ISO/IEC 15459-4:2008(E), Information technology--Unique identifiers--Part 4:
Individual items (second edition; July 15, 2008); and

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(c) ISO/IEC 15459-6:2007(E), Information technology--Unique identifiers--Part 6:
Unique identifier for product groupings (first edition; June 15, 2007).
The UDI may use only characters and numbers from the invariant character set of ISO/IEC
646:1991(E), Information technology--ISO 7-bit coded character set for information
interchange (third edition; December 15, 1991).

3.

Format for Dates Provided on a Label (21 CFR 801.18)

If your device label includes a printed expiration date, date of manufacture, or any other date
that you intend to be brought to the attention of the user, the dates must be presented in a
specified format that is consistent with international standards and international practice.
This format is: the year, using four digits: followed by the month, using two digits; followed
by the day, using two digits; each separated by hyphens. For example, January 2, 2014, must
be presented as 2014-01-02.
There are some limited exceptions pertaining to combination products and radiation emitting
products that are listed in 21 CFR 801.18(b).

4.

Permanent UDI (21 CFR 801.45)

If your device is intended to be used more than once and intended to be reprocessed before
each use, your device must have the UDI permanently marked on the device itself. This
permanent UDI may be identical to the UDI that appears on the device label, or it may be a
different UDI to distinguish the device itself from its packaging. The permanent UDI must
be in either or both (1) easily readable plain-text and (2) AIDC form or alternative technology
that will provide the UDI of the device on demand.
The permanent UDI requirement does not apply if your device that is intended to be used
more than once and intended to be reprocessed before each use meets any of the following
criteria:
(1) Any type of direct marking would interfere with the safety and effectiveness of the
device;
(2) It is not technologically feasible to directly mark the device;
(3) The device is cleared/approved as a single use device; or
(4) The device already has a permanent UDI directly marked on the device.
If you decide to make use of one of these exceptions, the basis of your decision must be
documented in the design history file required by 21 CFR 820.30(j).

Stand Alone Software (21 CFR 801.50)

There are no UDI special requirements for a device that contains software as a component of
the device, but stand-alone software must be labeled with a UDI. If your stand-alone
software is distributed in packaged form, it is subject to the same UDI labeling requirements

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

as any other medical device -- the device label and device package must bear a UDI in plaintext and AIDC formats. All stand-alone software, regardless of whether it is or is not
distributed in packaged form, that is regulated as a medical device must provide its unique
device identifier through either or both of the following:
(1) An easily readable plain-text statement displayed whenever the software is started,
and/or
(2) An easily readable plain-text statement displayed through a menu command (e.g., an
‘‘About * * *’’ command).
Stand-alone software that is not distributed in packaged form (e.g., when downloaded from a
Web site) must also convey the version number in its production identifier.
Stand-alone software that is distributed in both packaged form and in a form that is not
packaged may be identified with the same DI.

C.

Issuing Agency

You are required to use a UDI system operated by a FDA-accredited issuing agency (IA).
An IA may charge a labeler a fee for use of the IA for the issuance of UDIs. Each IA
operates a system for assignment of UDIs that meets the requirements listed in Section
V.B.2. An IA makes available information concerning its system for assigning UDIs,
maintains a list of labelers that use its system for the assignment of UDIs, provides an
annual list of labelers to FDA, and upon request provides us with information on a labeler
that employs the IA’s system for assigning UDIs.
We accredit IAs. The eligibility and accreditation criteria are set out in 21 CFR 830.100.
A private organization may apply for accreditation. We may accredit an organization if
the system employed by the organization will (1) conform with the ISO standards listed in
Section V.B.2.of this document, (2) be available to all users according to a single set of
consistent, fair, and reasonable terms and conditions and (3) protect against conflicts of
interests between the organization and labelers.
The procedure for FDA initial accreditation and renewal is outlined in 21 CFR 830.110.
The initial term of accreditation is three years with renewal terms of seven years. We
may suspend or revoke an IA’s accreditation if we find that the IA was guilty of fraud in
obtaining its accreditation, failed to fulfill the responsibilities required by the UDI Rule,
failed to protect against conflicts of interest or has engaged in anticompetitive activity, or
has violated the UDI Rule or related regulation.
Under 830.200, under certain conditions, FDA may act as an IA. These conditions
include (1) any period where these is no accredited IA, (2) when we determine that a
significant number of small businesses would be substantially and adversely affected by
the fees required by all accredited IAs, (3) when we determine that it is necessary for the
continuation of the UDI system, or (4) when we determine it is appropriate to facilitate or

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

implement an alternative granted under 21 CFR 801.55. When we act as an IA, any
labeler may use our IA services, not only small businesses.
If your IA relinquishes or does not renew its accreditation, you may continue to use the
previously assigned DI until the UDI Rule otherwise requires a new DI to be assigned (e.g. a
change in version or model).

D.

GUDID data submission requirements

In general, if a UDI is required for your device or device package, you are also required to
submit the information described below to the GUDID electronically. You may obtain a
waiver from electronic submission by submitting a letter requesting a waiver addressed to the
CDRH or CBER Center Director at the address listed on the front page of this document. If
you have already been granted a waiver from electronic submission of 21 USC 510(p)
registration and listing information, you are automatically waived from UDI electronic
submission. If granted a waiver from electronic submission, you must submit the required
information by letter as described in 21 CFR 830.320(c)(3).

1.

Information required (21 CFR 830.310)
a.

Concerning the labeler

You must designate one individual to serve as the point of contact with FDA on matters
relating to the identification of medical devices marketed by you. This individual may
authorize an IA or other person to submit information to us. The contact individual (or other
authorized person) shall submit your name and contact information, and the IA(s) you use for
issuance of UDIs to the GUDID.
b.

Concerning each version or model of a device

For each version or model of a device required to have a UDI on its label, you must submit
the following information to the GUDID:
1. The device identifier portion of the UDI assigned to the version or model;
2. When reporting a substitution of a new device identifier, the device identifier that was
previously assigned to the version or model;
3. If the device is required to bear a permanent UDI on the device itself, either:
i. A statement that the device identifier that appears as a permanent marking on
the device is identical to that reported under paragraph (b)(1) of this section,
or
ii. The device identifier portion of the UDI that appears as a permanent marking
on the device;
4. The proprietary, trade, or brand name of the device as it appears on the label of the
device;
16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

5. Any version or model number or similar reference that appears on the label of the
device;
6. If the device is labeled as sterile, a statement to that effect;
7. If the device is labeled as containing natural rubber latex that contacts humans, or is
labeled as having packaging containing natural rubber latex that contacts humans, a
statement to that effect;
8. Whether a patient may be safely exposed to magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance tomography while using the
device, or while the device is implanted in the patient.
9. If the device is available in more than one size, the size of the particular version or
model, together with the unit of measure, as it appears on the label of the device;
10. The type of PI that appears on the label of the device;
11. The FDA premarket submission number of a cleared or approved device, or a
statement that FDA has by regulation exempted the device from premarket
notification;
12. The FDA listing number assigned to the device;
13. The Global Medical Device Nomenclature (GMDN) term or code for the device; and
14. The total number of individual devices contained in the device package.

2.

Rejection, removal or correction
a.

FDA rejection or removal of submitted information

If you submit device identification data that: does not conform with UDI requirements;
concerns a device or combination product that requires, but does not have premarket
approval, licensure or clearance; concerns a device that is neither manufactured nor in
interstate commerce in the United States; the product is not a device or does not contain a
device; or concerns a device that we have banned, we may reject or delete that information
from GUDID. We may also reject or remove any device identification data if we have
suspended the accreditation of the IA that you use. This does not apply if the IA relinquishes
or does not renew its accreditation. This is explained further in Section V.C..
b.

Correction (21 CFR 830.350)

We may notify you and delete or correct any information submitted to the GUDID that
appears to be incorrect or potentially misleading. You must provide corrected information, or
explain why the information is correct, within 30 days from receipt of our notice.

E.
