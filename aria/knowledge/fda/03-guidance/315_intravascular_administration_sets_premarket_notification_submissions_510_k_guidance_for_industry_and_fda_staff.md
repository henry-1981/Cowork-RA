Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Intravascular Administration Sets
Premarket Notification Submissions
[510(k)]
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA has developed this guidance document to assist industry in preparing premarket
notification (510(k)s) submissions for intravascular (IV) administration sets and accessories.
This revision of the document issued in 2005 updates the FDA-recognized standards and
clarifies our recommendations for microbial ingress testing. IV administration sets and
accessories include:
• extension sets
• IV stopcocks and manifolds
• in-line filters
• flow regulators
• fluid delivery tubing
• vial adapters
• IV transfer sets
• subcutaneous administration sets
•
•

blood administration sets
transfusion filters.

IV administration sets with or without needleless access devices or systems are also
addressed in this guidance. A needleless system may be incorporated as an integral

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
component (e.g., a Y-site connector), or may be marketed separately as an accessory (e.g.,
attached to other devices by the user at the point of use.)
If your device contains a sharps injury prevention (safety) feature, we recommend that you
consult the guidance entitled, Supplementary Guidance on Premarket Notifications for
Medical Devices with Sharps Injury Prevention Features,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/guidance/934.html for information about simulated use testing
of sharps injury prevention features.

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe should be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also
considered the burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and
address the issues we have identified. We believe that we have considered the least
burdensome approach to resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If,
however, you believe that there is a less burdensome way to address the issues, you
should follow the procedures outlined in the document “A Suggested Approach to
Resolving Least Burdensome Issues.” It is available on our Center’s Web page at
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2.

Background

A manufacturer who intends to market a device of this generic type must conform to the
general controls of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), including the
premarket notification requirements described in 21 CFR 807 Subpart E, and obtain a
substantial equivalence determination from FDA prior to marketing the device. (See also 21
CFR 807.81 and 807.87.)
This guidance document identifies the classification regulation and product codes for
hemodialysis blood tubing sets (refer to Section 4. Scope). Other sections of this guidance
document provide additional information to manufacturers on addressing risks related to
these devices in premarket notifications (510(k)s).
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content
requirements of a premarket notification submission. You should also refer to 21 CFR

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
807.87, the guidance, Format for Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s, 1 and “Premarket
Notification 510(k)” on CDRH Device Advice. 2
Under “The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications,” 3 a manufacturer may submit a
Traditional 510(k) or has the option of submitting either an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special
510(k). FDA believes an Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of
demonstrating substantial equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued a
guidance document addressing that device. Manufacturers considering certain modifications
to their own cleared devices may lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a Special
510(k).

3.

The Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
Submission

An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k), we recommend that
you include a descriptive summary report of appropriate supporting data within the meaning
of 21 CFR 807.87(f) or (g). The descriptive summary report should explain how this
guidance document was used during the device development and testing, briefly describe the
methods or tests used, and include a summary of the test data or description of the acceptance
criteria applied to address the risks identified in this document and any other additional risks
specific to your device. This section suggests information to fulfill some of the requirements
of section 21 CFR 807.87 and identifies other items that we recommend you include in an
Abbreviated 510(k).

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k) and
cite the title of this guidance document.

Proposed Labeling
Proposed labeling must be sufficient to describe the device, its intended use, and the
directions for its use. (21 CFR 807.87(e)) (Please refer to Section 11. Labeling for
specific information that should be included in the labeling for devices of the type
covered by this guidance document.)

Abbreviated 510(k) Summary Report

4

In accordance with 21 CFR 807.87, your summary report should contain the following:
Description of the device and its intended use
Please describe the device and include an explanation of how the device functions
and the specific physical and performance characteristics of the device. Refer to
Section 5. Device Description for specific information to include in the device
description for devices of the type covered by this guidance document. You should
also submit an “indications for use” enclosure. 5
Description of device design
You must include a brief description of the device design requirements. (21 CFR
807.87(f))
Identification of the risk analysis method
We recommend that you identify the risk analysis method(s) you used to assess the
risk profile, in general, as well as the risk profile of the specific device’s design and
the results of this analysis. Please refer to Section 6. Risks to Health for the risks to
health generally associated with the use of this device that FDA has identified.
Discussion of the device characteristics
We recommend that you discuss the device characteristics that address the risks
identified in this guidance document and any additional risks identified in your risk
analysis.
Description of the performance aspects
You should describe the nonclinical tests submitted, referenced, or relied on in your
submission. See Sections 7-10 of this guidance for specific performance aspects. If
you follow a suggested test method, you may cite the method rather than describing
it. If you modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method but should
provide sufficient information to explain the nature of and reason for the
modification. For each test, you may either (1) briefly present the data resulting from
the test in clear and concise form, such as a table, or (2) describe the acceptance
criteria that you will apply to your test results. 6 (See also 21 CFR 820.30, Subpart C
- Design Controls for the Quality System Regulation.)
4

This is not the report described in 21 CFR 807.92, which may be submitted to satisfy 21
CFR 807.87(h).
5
Refer to http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/indicate.html for the recommended format.
6
If FDA makes a substantial equivalence determination based on acceptance criteria, the
subject device should be tested and shown to meet these acceptance criteria before being
introduced into interstate commerce. If the finished device does not meet the acceptance

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Reliance on standards
If you choose to rely on a recognized standard for any part of the device design or
testing, you may include either a:
•

statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria
before the device is marketed; or

•

declaration of conformity to the standard. 7

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, you cannot
properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the testing the
standard describes. For more information, please refer to section 514(c)(1)(B) of the
act and the FDA guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence
Determinations. 8
If it is not clear how you have addressed the risks identified by FDA or additional risks
identified through your risk analysis, we may request additional information about aspects of
the device’s performance characteristics. We may also request additional information if we
need it to assess the adequacy of your acceptance criteria. Under 21 CFR 807.87(l), you
must submit any additional information that is necessary to reach a determination regarding
substantial equivalence.
As an alternative to submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), you can submit a Traditional 510(k)
that provides all of the information and data required under 21 CFR 807.87 and described in
this guidance. A Traditional 510(k) should include all of your methods, data, acceptance
criteria, and conclusions. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own
cleared devices should consider submitting Special 510(k)s.
The following is a specific discussion of how you should apply this guidance document to a
premarket notification submission for IV administration sets and accessories.

4. Scope
The scope of this document is limited to the device defined in 21 CFR 880.5440, class II, and
assigned the product codes described in the table below.

criteria and, thus, differs from the device described in the cleared 510(k), FDA recommends
that submitters apply the same criteria used to assess modifications to legally marketed
devices (21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)) to determine whether marketing of the finished device
requires clearance of a new 510(k).

Section 880.5440 Intravascular Administration Set
An intravascular administration set is a device used to administer fluids from a container
to a patient’s vascular system through a needle or catheter inserted into a vein. The
device may include the needle or catheter, tubing, a flow regulator, a drip chamber, an
infusion line filter, an I.V. set stopcock, fluid delivery tubing, connectors between parts
of the set, a side tube with a cap to serve as an injection site, and a hollow spike to
penetrate and connect the tubing to an I.V. bag or other infusion fluid container.
IV administration sets administer fluids to a patient’s vascular system by various means,
gravity flow, via a pump, subcutaneously, or through implanted vascular ports. These IV sets
may include Diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and non-DEHP PVC tubing, co-extruded tubing,
calibrated burettes, filters, standard and needle free Y-injection sites (swabbable and nonswabbable), anti-siphon valves, and check valves to prevent retrograde fluid flow.

5. Device Description
We recommend that you identify your device by regulation and product code described in
Section 4. Scope, and include the following information:
• indications for use
• design features; i.e., materials, configurations, size, safety features
• specifications and dimensions
• materials, including chemical formulation
• conformance with standards.
Side by side comparisons of the information described below, whenever possible, in tabular
format are desirable. We recommend that you describe how any differences may affect the
comparative safety and effectiveness of the new device.

Material Composition
We recommend that you provide a complete listing of all device materials (trade name
and chemical formula) and identify any metallic components. Metallic components may
affect the safety of the device in an MRI environment. We also recommend that you
identify any polyvinylchloride (PVC) plasticizers, lubricants, bonding agents, or other
additives (e.g., color additives, ink, dyes, markings, radiopaque materials) and provide
their amounts.
It is helpful to present the information in the form of a listing, noting the component
name followed by specific material identifier. We believe stating only a generic class
(e.g., “PVC”) is not adequate because there are many formulations of material
compositions.

Physical Specifications
When describing physical specifications, we recommend that you include:
• dimensions: inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), length, width
• types of configurations
• priming volume
• residual volume in needleless access ports
•
•
•
•
•

dimensions of other features
proximal and distal end configuration: shape, location, and diameter of outlets
and side ports
connector types: e.g., Luer lock, slip fit
the color of all components
any other unique physical features and specifications of the device.

Mechanical Specifications
When providing mechanical specifications, we recommend that you provide:
• strength of materials (tensile, flexural)
• strength of joints, bonds, connections, hinges, valves, locking mechanisms, etc.
• tubing elongation
• connector performance criteria; e.g., to prevent leakage
• burst pressure
• puncture/reseal limits of septa
• flow characteristics
• material hardness
• crimping/flexion when intended for use with infusion pumps.

Design Features
We recommend that you describe the design features of your device and any similarities
or differences between those features and features of similar legally marketed devices of
the same type, which may affect safety and effectiveness.

6. Risks to Health
In the table below, FDA has identified the risks to health generally associated with the use
of intravascular administration sets and accessories addressed in this document. The
information we recommend you include in your 510(k) to address these identified risks are
given in this guidance document, as shown in the table below. We recommend that you
conduct a risk analysis to identify any other risks specific to your device and submit the
results of this analysis. If you elect to use an alternative approach to address a particular risk
identified in this document or have identified risks additional to those in this document, you
should provide sufficient detail to support the approach you have used to address that risk.

7. Bench Testing
We recommend that you conduct all testing under both a dry test condition and a wet
environment simulating body fluids or fluids being administered. We recommend that you
evaluate your device compared with a similar legally marketed device, using worst case
simulated static and dynamic forces to the failure point of the components. We also
recommend that you describe how you determined the worst case conditions used. Testing
should assess:
• the force to attach and detach connections
• the force to activate and deactivate any safety features present
• the number of injection port accesses to failure for needleless port with valves,
diaphragms, or membranes
• the pressure and leak tolerance for pre-slit septa under extreme conditions of use.
In addition, when your device is intended for use with other manufacturer’s blunt cannulae,
we recommend that you conduct the pressure and leak tolerance testing for pre-slit septa
under extreme conditions of use with those blunt cannulae.
Where appropriate to your device’s intended use or design, we recommend that you follow
the standards listed below or equivalent measures, in addition to the testing described above.

ISO 8536-4: 2004, Infusion Equipment for Medical Use, Part 4

•

ANSI/AAMI BF7: R2002, American National Standard for Blood Transfusion Micro
Filters

•

•

ISO 594, Conical Fittings with a 6 % (Luer) Taper for Syringes, Needles, and Certain
Other Equipment.

8. Microbial Ingress Testing
A needleless device that facilitates bi-directional fluid flow may increase the patient’s risk of
infection because these features allow the entry of microorganisms into the sterile fluid path.
We recommend that you conduct microbial ingress testing of these devices. This testing is
intended to simulate repeated access.
We recommend that you provide results from a simulated use test for microbial ingress in
your device. Testing should simulate the use of the device in a clinical setting, i.e., the
number of microbial challenges in the study should approximate the number of user
interactions with the access site that would be expected clinically. The testing should
demonstrate that the disinfection procedures you use are effective. We recommend that you
provide an analysis of the study results and a summary of the results and conclusions.

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend that you provide a detailed protocol for your study, which describes the:
•

study procedure for the subject device

•

amount and identity of challenge organisms

•

methods used to prepare the challenge organisms commonly associated with
contaminated needleless access devices, i.e. 2 gram negative and 2 gram positive
organisms.

•

method of device contamination/inoculation for all sites of device inoculated

•

access procedure

•

time and culture procedures

•

rationale for the challenge microorganisms used as inoculum (minimum of 103 per
device)

•

type of environment in which the study was conducted

•

positive (non-disinfected device) and negative controls used in the study

•

rationale for the sample size used in the study

•

validation (using microbiological techniques) of the disinfecting procedures for
insertion and reinsertion into the needleless access site.

9. Simulated Clinical Use Testing
For devices that include sharps injury prevention features, we recommend that you conduct
simulated clinical use testing; provide an analysis of the results; and a summary of the results
and conclusions. For information about this kind of testing, see Training for Development of
Innovative Technologies Project, 9 and the guidance entitled, Supplementary Guidance on
Premarket Notifications for Medical Devices with Sharps Injury Prevention Features. 10
We recommend that you provide a detailed protocol for your study that addresses variables
in the patient and health care professional user populations. If the device will be exposed to
many conditions of use, we recommend that you assess the variables to accurately judge the
performance of the device under these conditions. These variables include, but are not
limited to training, learning curve, and the experience of users. For information about device
design and human factors, see ANSI/AAMI HE48-1993: Human factors engineering
guidelines and preferred practices for the design of medical devices and the FDA guidance
entitled, Do It By Design - An Introduction to Human Factors in Medical Devices. 11

We recommend that you devise protocols, whenever possible, based on statistical
considerations, such as sample size, response variables, pass-or-fail criteria, comprehensive
report forms, proper controls, and appropriate statistical test methods. (This guidance does
not provide a detailed discussion of statistical considerations).

10. Sterilization
FDA recommends that you provide sterilization information as described in the guidance,
Updated 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1. 12 The device should be sterile, with a
sterility assurance level (SAL) of 1 x 10-6 using a sterilization cycle that has been validated
in accordance with the Quality Systems (QS). 21 CFR 820.30.

11. Biocompatibility
We recommend that you conduct biocompatibility testing for your device as a prolonged
duration, indirect blood path contacting device as described in the guidance entitled, Use of
International Standard ISO-10993, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1:
Evaluation and Testing. 13 You should select the tests appropriate for the duration and level
of contact and submit your pass/fail criteria. We also recommend that you document the
results in your design history file as a part of the QS (21 CFR 820.30). If identical materials
are used in a predicate device with the same type and duration of contact, you may identify
the predicate device in lieu of performing biocompatibility testing.

12. Labeling
Labeling must provide sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The
following information will assist you in meeting the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 14

Intended Use
We recommend that you clearly state the intended use of your device and include the
indications for use and include the intended (target) population, e.g., pediatric patients. If
your device is intended for use with a specific blunt cannula, infusion pump, or other
device, we recommend that you identify that device.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend that the description of the device include:
• type
• set length, in inches and millimeters
• inner diameter (ID)
• outer diameter (OD)
• drops/ml
• priming volume
• filter
• needle gauge and length
• single use only, nontoxic, non-pyrogenic fluid path, where applicable
• sterile, if package is intact, undamaged, and protective caps are secure.

Directions for Use
We recommend that your directions for use include:
• a step-by-step procedure for use of the device
• a step-by-step procedure for the use of needleless access components, where
applicable
• special patient instructions (including instructions for contacting the healthcare
provider if indicated for home use)
• the recommended frequency of replacing the IV set or needless access device, as
appropriate, for example “per CDC guidelines or facility protocol”
• the duration of use and frequency of replacing IV sets when used for the
administration of lipids, blood, or blood products according to their labeling
• directions for replacing the sterile cap (needleless access devices without pre-slit
septa only) with each use unless a mechanism is in place to keep the cap sterile
• instructions for cleaning and disinfecting y-sites
• instructions for cleaning and disinfecting pre-slit septa, where applicable
• instructions for discarding a used device.
We also recommend that you include illustrations, pictures, posters, cards, and other
visual aids that clarify and reinforce the directions for use.

Precautions
We recommend that labeling include any special limitations related to opacity or the type
of solutions used with the device (e.g., light sensitive solutions, fat emulsions, lipids,
blood, and blood products). We also recommend that labeling identify the presence of the

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
plasticizer DEHP in the fluid pathway of PVC tubing, because leaching of the plasticizer
is possible on contact with lipids.

Warnings
We recommend that labeling warn against use with high-pressure infusion systems,
where applicable.
For administration sets that may be used with infusion pumps with no restricted flow
feature, labeling should include warnings related to unrestricted flow and instructions for
use with gravity flow.

Labeling of Shelf Containers
For labeling a multi-unit or shelf container, we recommend that you include:
• a description of the contents, in words and/or pictures
• the number of infusion sets or accessories
• instructions for use in each shelf container
• terms describing whether the units are sterile and single use
• the year and month of sterilization
• the recommended storage conditions, if any.

Needleless System. Components of a device that provide repeated access to a patient’s
vascular system without the use of sharps. Fluid flow through the system may be unidirectional or bi-directional, with the latter enabling the user to administer or withdraw fluids
or medication. Needleless mechanisms include three types: pre-pierced septum and blunt
cannula; valved connector (also called reflux valve); and capped Luer connector.
Prepierced Septum and Blunt Cannula. A needleless system in which a blunt cannula is
placed on the syringe or secondary set. It can be aseptically inserted into a pre-pierced
septum on a Y-site, injection adapter, or extension set.
Valved Connector (also called reflux valve). A needleless system in which a valved
connector prevents the flow through the connector until a mating Luer connector is
aseptically inserted; the valve then opens.
Vial Adapter. A device designed to facilitate the withdrawal of drugs or solutions from a
vial and may have a needleless device component as part of its design.
