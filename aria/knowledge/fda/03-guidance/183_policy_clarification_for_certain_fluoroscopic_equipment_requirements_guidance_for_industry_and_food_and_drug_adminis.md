Policy Clarification for Certain
Fluoroscopic Equipment Requirements
Guidance for Industry and Food and
Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is
not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies
the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance document intends to clarify FDA’s interpretation of certain aspects of the
performance standard requirements in 21 CFR 1020.30 and 1020.32 for fluoroscopic
equipment.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document,
see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.1
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
In 2005, the Agency amended the federal performance standard for fluoroscopic
equipment found at 21 CFR 1020.32 to account for changes in the technology and use of
radiographic and fluoroscopic x-ray systems and to fully utilize the International System
of Units to describe radiation-related quantities and their units when used in the federal
performance standard for fluoroscopic equipment found at 21 CFR 1020.32.2

On March 30-31, 2010, the Agency held a public meeting on “Device Improvements to
Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging.”3 FDA sought input on
steps that manufacturers of computed tomography and fluoroscopic devices could take to
reduce unnecessary radiation exposure to patients, and asked a number of specific
questions related to equipment features, labeling, premarket submission requirements,
user training, and quality assurance measures.4 Many of the recommendations FDA
received at the public meeting focused on incorporating certain features and safeguards,
to the extent possible, that had been identified in recently amended IEC standards.5
Based on this discussion, it became clear that there are some areas of the federal
performance standard for fluoroscopic equipment, found at 21 CFR 1020.30 and 21 CFR
1020.32, that could be further clarified.

III. Scope
The products addressed by this guidance are both “devices” as defined in section 201(h)
of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and “electronic products” as
defined in section 531 of the FD&C Act. As such, these products are subject to the laws
and regulations in the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations that apply to devices,
as well as those applicable to electronic products. In particular, these products are subject
to, among other laws and regulations, 21 CFR 892.1650, 1020.30, and 1020.32. This
guidance is limited to fluoroscopic x-ray systems, whether stationary or mobile, classified
as follows:
21 CFR 892.1650 – Image-intensified fluoroscopic x-ray system.
(a) Identification. An image-intensified fluoroscopic x-ray system is a device
intended to visualize anatomical structures by converting a pattern of xradiation into a visible image through electronic amplification. This generic
type of device may include signal analysis and display equipment, patient and
equipment supports, component parts, and accessories.
(b) Classification. Class II. When intended as an accessory to the device
described in paragraph (a) of this section, the fluoroscopic compression device
is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807
of this chapter subject to §892.9.

The following product codes are currently associated with this regulation and addressed
by this guidance:
· JAA – system, x-ray, fluoroscopic, image-intensified
· OWB – interventional fluoroscopic x-ray system
· OXO – image-intensified fluoroscopic x-ray system, mobile
An image-intensified fluoroscopic x-ray system refers to any fluoroscopic x-ray system
with an image receptor comprised of either an image intensifier or a solid-state x-ray
imaging device.
Angiographic x-ray system devices, classified in 21 CFR 892.1600, are not addressed by
this guidance, as they do not have the capability to perform fluoroscopy.

IV. Specific Portions of the Performance Standard that
are the Subject of this Guidance
Three aspects of the federal performance standard for fluoroscopic equipment (21 CFR
1020.32) are described below, with FDA’s clarifications:
·

Fluoroscopic Irradiation Time
21 CFR 1020.32(h)(2) requires that x-ray controls manufactured on or after
June 10, 2006, provide a display of the fluoroscopic irradiation time at the
fluoroscopist's working position (fluoroscopic irradiation time is more
commonly known as “fluoroscopy time”). Specific requirements are provided
at 21 CFR 1020.32(h)(2)(i) and (ii).
21 CFR 1020.30(b) defines fluoroscopic irradiation time as “the cumulative
duration during an examination or procedure of operator-applied continuous
pressure to the device, enabling x-ray tube activation in any fluoroscopic mode
of operation.”
FDA interprets this definition to mean the cumulation of the entire time that the
fluoroscopy control (typically a pedal) is activated by the operator (“operatorapplied continuous pressure”). When defined this way, a single minute of
continuous pressure on the fluoroscopy control results in a fluoroscopic
irradiation time of one minute, regardless of whether fluoroscopy is used in a
pulsed or continuous mode, and, if pulsed, regardless of pulse width and pulse
rate.
This interpretation is consistent with statements made by professional
organizations. For example, the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), in
its Standards of Practice, defines fluoroscopy time as “[t]he total time that
fluoroscopy is used during an imaging or interventional procedure. For each

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
fluoroscopic series, the fluoroscopic time is measured from the start to the end
of x-ray production (start of first pulse to the end of the last pulse).”6
FDA’s interpretation of 21 CFR 1020.30(b) is also consistent with the IEC,
which defines an “irradiation-event” as the “loading of x-ray equipment caused
by a single continuous actuation of the equipment’s irradiation switch, from the
start of the loading time of the first pulse until the loading time trailing edge of
the final pulse.”7
FDA’s interpretation of 21 CFR 1020.30(b) allows for the comparison of
fluoroscopic irradiation time among different procedures and different
operators. Fluoroscopic irradiation time is an indicator of operator training and
performance separate from other radiation dose metrics, such as cumulative air
kerma and air kerma-area product.8
· Last-Image-Hold
21 CFR 1020.32(j) requires that fluoroscopic equipment manufactured on or
after June 10, 2006, be equipped with means to display a last-image-hold
image following termination of the fluoroscopic exposure. A last-image-hold
image is intended for review for study, consultation, or education instead of
continuing fluoroscopy or obtaining a separate radiograph. If the last-imagehold image is of adequate quality, no additional radiation exposure is
necessary, and patient radiation dose is reduced.9
21 CFR 1020.32(c) requires continuous pressure by the operator for the entire
time of any fluoroscopic exposure. If the fluoroscopic exposure is too short,
the last-image-hold will not be of adequate quality.
At present, fluoroscopy equipment should be designed so that the fluoroscopy
exposure terminates after the release of continuous pressure by the

fluoroscopist, regardless of the quality of the last-image-hold image. This
design is necessary for compliance with the FDA’s performance standard (21
CFR 1020.32(c)).10 21 CFR 1020.32(c) does not specify a maximum
allowable time between release of continuous pressure by the fluoroscopist and
termination of the irradiation, nor does it address obtaining a last-image-hold
image of adequate quality following very short fluoroscopic exposures.
FDA interprets the following scenarios as complying with the performance
standard in 21 CFR 1020.32(c):
·

·

For a fluoroscopy exposure of more than 0.5 sec, the device terminates
the exposure within 0.1 sec from the time the fluoroscopist releases
continuous pressure.
For a fluoroscopy exposure of 0.5 sec or less, the device terminates the
exposure within 0.5 sec from the time the fluoroscopist releases
continuous pressure.

These termination times address the fact that fluoroscopic irradiation cannot
cease instantaneously with release of continuous pressure by the fluoroscopist,
due to unavoidable delays imposed by the operation of the necessary electronic
circuitry, and provide enough time to create a last-image-hold image that is of
adequate quality, as this improves patient safety.
This interpretation should not be unduly burdensome, as it is identical to the
measure described in IEC standard 60601-2-54.11 This approach, which
clarifies the maximum time between release of continuous pressure by the
fluoroscopist and termination of the irradiation exposure, will help reduce
unnecessary radiation exposure of patients and will also allow usable lastimage-hold images to be obtained.
·

Emergency Fluoroscopy Mode
In the case of an equipment malfunction, it is desirable that a fluoroscope
intended for use in interventional procedures enter an emergency fluoroscopy
mode, during which time fluoroscopy continues in a limited mode while the
fluoroscope attempts to return to normal function. This is an important safety
feature for these types of procedures.
FDA’s performance standard requires, in 21 CFR 1020.32(f), (h), (j), and (k),
that x-ray tube potential and current, fluoroscopic irradiation time, and values
of air kerma rate and cumulative air kerma be displayed continuously, and that
a last-image-hold be displayed following termination of the fluoroscopic

10

It is also consistent with IEC, 60601-1-3:2008/AMD1:2013, General requirements for basic safety and
essential performance – Collateral standard: Radiation protection in diagnostic X-ray equipment,
subclause 6.2.1.
11
IEC standard 60601-2-54, subclause 203.6.2.1 (Normal initiation and termination of the irradiation).

exposure, among other things. These displays, however, may not be available
in emergency fluoroscopy mode.
Emergency fluoroscopy mode typically involves fluoroscopy in the mode of
operation which was used at the time of the recoverable equipment failure, or,
if this is not possible, fluoroscopy in the mode of operation as close as possible
to the one which was used at the time of the recoverable equipment failure;
normal operation of the tabletop; normal operation of the gantry; normal
operation of tableside controls for all functions described above; normal
operation of irradiation and motion disabling switches; and normal operation of
anti-collision functions.
If, at the time of the malfunction, the operator is performing a task for which
fluoroscopy is critical (e.g., angioplasty, intravascular stent placement,
embolization), the rapid restoration of limited fluoroscopy capability may
prevent a catastrophic complication to the patient. The limited functionality
provided by the emergency fluoroscopy mode will improve safety, provided
that measures are in place for an expeditious return to a normal mode of
operation.
As such, we do not intend to enforce the display and other requirements of 21
CFR 1020.32(f), (h), (j), and (k), for devices operating in the emergency
fluoroscopy mode, where automatic or manual recovery methods from
emergency fluoroscopy mode provide for a return to the normal mode of
operation with all functions available (including the display requirements of 21
CFR 1020.32) for failures from which recovery is possible as quickly as
reasonably practicable, which generally should not exceed 10 minutes.
This policy is based on considerations found in IEC 60601-2-43 for emergency
fluoroscopy mode.12
