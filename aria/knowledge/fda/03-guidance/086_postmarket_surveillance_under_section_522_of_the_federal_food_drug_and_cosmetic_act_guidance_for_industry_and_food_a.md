Postmarket Surveillance Under
Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

Section 522 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) provides the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to require manufacturers to conduct postmarket
surveillance at the time of approval or clearance or at any time thereafter of certain class II or
class III devices. Postmarket surveillance is the active, systematic, scientifically valid
collection, analysis, and interpretation of data or other information about a marketed device. 1
The data collected under a surveillance order help to address important public health questions
on the safety and effectiveness of a device.
This guidance document will assist manufacturers of devices subject to section 522
postmarket surveillance orders (522 orders) by providing:
•

an overview of section 522 of the FD&C Act;

•

information on how to fulfill section 522 obligations, 2 including:
o when postmarket surveillance should be considered commenced;

o recommendations for achieving an approved postmarket surveillance plan in a
timely manner; and
o recommendations for enrollment schedules to help achieve timely completion
of postmarket surveillance;
21 CFR 822.3(i).
See 21 CFR Part 822 for the full set of procedures and requirements for postmarket surveillance under section 522
of the FD&C Act.

•

recommendations on the format, content, and review of postmarket surveillance plan
and report submissions, including revised FDA review times for postmarket
surveillance-related submissions; and

•

updated surveillance status categories to better reflect progress.

This guidance document also aims to increase transparency to stakeholders on FDA’s
approach to the issuance and tracking of 522 orders, and expectations for timely study
completion. Our initiative to increase transparency includes posting the manufacturers’
progress on addressing 522 orders on FDA’s website. 3
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The
use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Pre-522 Postmarket Surveillance Process
When FDA identifies a potential issue with a device that could warrant postmarket
surveillance (such as those described in Section II.B below), the associated review team may
assess whether a 522 order is appropriate and falls within the statutory criteria.
Section 522 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360l, authorizes FDA to require postmarket
surveillance in the following instances:
•

a class II or class III device for which failure of the device would be reasonably likely
to have a serious adverse health consequence (section 522(a)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C
Act);

•

a class II or class III device expected to have significant use in pediatric populations
(section 522(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act);

•

a class II or class III device that is intended to be implanted in the human body for more
than one year (section 522(a)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the FD&C Act); or

•

a class II or class III device that is intended to be a life-sustaining or life-supporting
device used outside of a device user facility (section 522(a)(1)(A)(iii)(II) of the FD&C
Act).

FDA may identify device issues that are appropriate for postmarket surveillance at any point
during the life cycle of a class II or III device, which meets statutory criteria identified in
section 522(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act. Such issues may be identified through a variety of
sources including analysis of adverse event reports, a recall or corrective action, post-approval
data, review of premarket data, reports from other governmental authorities, or review of
scientific literature.
Examples of situations that may raise postmarket questions, during both the premarket and
postmarket periods, are listed below. FDA may order postmarket surveillance to:
•

better understand the nature, severity, or frequency of suspected problems reported in
adverse event reports or in the published literature.

•

obtain more information on device performance associated with real-world clinical
practice.

•

address long term or infrequent safety and effectiveness issues for implantable and
other devices for which the premarket testing provided more limited information. For
example, premarket evaluation of a device may have been based on surrogate markers.
Once the device is actually marketed, postmarket surveillance may be appropriate to
assess the effectiveness of the device in detecting or treating the disease or condition,
rather than the surrogate. Data collected through postmarket surveillance may include
rates of malfunction or failure of a device intended for long-term use or incidents of
latent sequelae resulting from device use.

•

better define the association between problems and devices when unexpected or
unexplained serious adverse events occur after a device is marketed, if there is a change
in the nature of serious adverse events (e.g., severity), or if there is an increase in the
frequency of serious adverse events.

In assessing the appropriateness of issuing a 522 order, multiple elements are considered, as
indicated below, with the goal of making a determination as to whether or not postmarket
surveillance for a class II or class III device should be ordered. In addition, FDA may also
engage external stakeholders prior to the issuance of a 522 order, when appropriate.
Some of the elements considered by FDA in deciding whether to issue a 522 order include:
•

Are the statutory criteria of section 522 of the FD&C Act met?

•

What is the public health question? The delineation of the public health question is the
most important element discussed by the team.

•

What is the public health question based on? It should be based on FDA’s evaluation of
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
currently available data. Examples include but are not limited to scientific/medical
concern from the review of a premarket submission and/or observed issues from the
premarket data, a recall, medical device reports (MDRs), case studies, literature, or
another source.
•

Is the public health issue device-specific or device type-specific?

•

For a device for which a condition of clearance or approval is being considered, can and
should the public health question be addressed premarket rather than as part of a 522
order?

•

Is there any other source of data (e.g., MDR review, published literature, real-world
data (RWD) sources) or action (e.g., revised labeling, public health notice, recall), or a
combination thereof, that may be used to address the public health question, instead of a
522 order?

•

Does another ongoing study (e.g., premarket approval application (PMA) post-approval
study as described in 21 CFR 814.82(a)(2) and 21 CFR 814.82(a)(9)) address the public
health question?

•

What type(s) of 522 postmarket surveillance design(s) should be recommended?
Feasibility and timeliness of the different types of postmarket surveillance should be
considered.

•

What combination of efforts should be considered to address the public health question?
In addition, when applicable, what changes, if any, are being made with regard to the
premarket review?

As noted above, the statute authorizes postmarket surveillance for class II and III devices that
are “expected to have a significant use in pediatric populations” and also authorizes the
Agency to order postmarket surveillance as a condition of clearance or approval for devices
expected to have significant use in pediatric populations. 4,5 These provisions are not limited to
devices labeled for pediatric uses, and therefore specific consideration is given to devices with
anticipated pediatric use.
Note that section 402(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. §
282(j)(1)(A)(ii)) also states that any “pediatric postmarket surveillance required under section
Sections 522(a)(1)(A)(ii) and 522(a)(1)(B)
Since “pediatric populations” is not defined in section 522 of the FD&C Act, for the purposes of 522 orders, FDA
interprets pediatric populations to mean patients who are 21 years of age or younger at the time of diagnosis or
treatment, that is, from birth through the twenty-first year of life, up to, but not including the patient’s twenty-second
birthday. This definition is consistent with the definition of “pediatric patients” under section 520(m)(6)(E)(i) of the
FD&C Act, which was added to the FD&C Act at the same time as the pediatric use criterion in section 522.

522” is considered to be an “applicable device clinical trial.” As such, the pediatric postmarket
surveillance must be in compliance with the registration and results submission requirements
of section 402(j) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. § 282(j)). Additional information on these
requirements can be found at https://clinicaltrials.gov/.
FDA intends to work with the manufacturer to help FDA determine the appropriate timeframe
for a pediatric 522 postmarket surveillance study.
The 522 order will specify the device(s) subject to the surveillance order and the reason that
we are requiring postmarket surveillance (i.e., the public health question(s)). 6 The order will
also typically include any general or specific guidance that is available to assist the
manufacturer subject to the 522 order in preparing the postmarket surveillance plan. 7 FDA
intends to identify the premarket submission involved (i.e., premarket notification [510(k)],
PMA, humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application, or De Novo request) in the 522
order. A 522 order could also include timelines for certain surveillance plan milestones such
as subject enrollment, data accrual, and submission of the final report, depending on the plan
and timing of the order. If a manufacturer disagrees with any order or condition requiring
postmarket surveillance under section 522 of the FD&C Act, a manufacturer may request
review under section 562 of the FD&C Act (see section 522(c) of the FD&C Act) and other
options are further described in 21 CFR 822.7.
Section 522(a)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act specifies that the Agency may issue a postmarket
surveillance order at the time of device approval or clearance or any time thereafter. When a
522 order is being considered for issuance at the time of market authorization, FDA may
advise the manufacturer of the potential 522 order and the surveillance plan schedule, when
appropriate. Pursuant to section 522(b)(1) each manufacturer must develop and submit for
FDA approval a postmarket surveillance plan within 30 days 8 of receiving the order (see also
21 C.F.R. 822.9 and 822.10). Section 522(b)(1) of the FD&C Act provides that a
manufacturer must commence postmarket surveillance not later than 15 months after the day
the order is issued. FDA typically considers postmarket surveillance to have commenced
when the first subject is enrolled as outlined in the approved surveillance plan. For plans that
do not involve enrollment of subjects (e.g., non-clinical studies), FDA considers postmarket
surveillance to have commenced when data accrual has started as outlined in the approved
surveillance plan. 9
In FDA’s experience, surveillance plans that require enrolling subjects in a prospectivelytargeted manner are more likely to achieve timely completion by following the recommended
schedule below from the date of issuance of the 522 order.

III. Postmarket Surveillance Plans
FDA will assign a postmarket surveillance (PS) order number (i.e., PS######) to each 522
order. Manufacturers should cite the assigned PS order number when submitting a proposed
postmarket surveillance plan. Surveillance plans are reviewed under the assigned PS order
number. If there are multiple postmarket surveillance questions in a 522 order that require
different methodologies to address each question, then a separate postmarket surveillance plan
should be submitted for each question, and it is tracked as an individual requirement under the
PS order number. FDA will confirm receipt and identify each plan submission by a unique
document number. 10
A manufacturer must submit a postmarket surveillance plan within 30 calendar days of receipt
of the 522 order. 11 Per Section 522(b)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 822.17, FDA will
review postmarket surveillance plans and respond within 60 calendar days of receipt. FDA
intends to promptly review postmarket surveillance plans and work interactively with the
manufacturer in order to issue a decision within 30 calendar days of receiving the plan. The
manufacturer should prioritize resolution of any surveillance plan deficiencies identified by
the Agency and work interactively with the FDA to facilitate that a full surveillance plan
review can be achieved within 60 calendar days from the issuance of the 522 order date.

The general content and format of a postmarket surveillance submission is outlined in 21 CFR
822.9. See Appendix 1 for FDA’s internal checklist for determining whether a submission is
administratively complete in accordance with 21 CFR 822.9.

As outlined in 21 CFR 822.10, the following sections must be included in your postmarket
surveillance plan:
•

postmarket surveillance plan objectives addressing the surveillance question(s) 12

•

postmarket surveillance approach (i.e., design) or methodology to be used 13 (see
Section III.E. of this guidance); we recommend including the hypothesis(es) and
success criteria

•

the variables and endpoints for assessing the surveillance question(s), 17 such as the
primary and secondary endpoints; we recommend including definitions for endpoints, a
list of expected adverse events/complications, an agreement to collect unexpected
adverse events, and a plan to assess relatedness of endpoints with the device and/or the
procedure

•

sample size; 18 we recommend including sample size calculation that is statistically
justified and based on study hypothesis, where applicable

•

description of the data source (e.g., hospital records, registry data); 19 we recommend
including description of the data source relevance (e.g., does it capture information to
address the surveillance question(s) in the order?) and of its reliability (e.g., data
quality)

FDA notes that, where appropriate, it may be possible to meet a 522 order requirement through prospective or
retrospective analysis of data from RWD sources, such as device registries and electronic health records. In addition,
if RWD already exist that are of sufficient relevance and reliability and a prospective analysis will be timely
performed by a device manufacturer, FDA may decide not to issue a 522 order. For additional information on the
use of real-world evidence for medical devices, see FDA Guidance, “Use of Real-World Evidence to Support
Regulatory Decision-Making for Medical Devices,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/searchfda-guidance-documents/use-real-world-evidence-support-regulatory-decision-making-medical-devices.

procedures for monitoring conduct and progress of the surveillance, 28 and estimate of
the duration of the surveillance, 29 such as plan milestones/timeline elements, we
recommend including (where applicable):
o expected monthly number of study sites with IRB approvals
o expected dates for achieving enrollment milestones (e.g., first subject, 20%,
50%, and 100%)
o expected date to complete follow-up of all study participants, and
o if applicable, information related to intermediate milestones (e.g., evaluation of
surrogate endpoints in a study that also measures clinical benefits)
FDA expects for manufacturers to meet elements set forth in and committed to in the
postmarket surveillance plan. 30 The milestones identified in the postmarket
surveillance plan will be the milestones which FDA intends to use to assess study
status (see Sections III.D., IV, V, IX, and X for additional details related to reports and
postmarket surveillance status).

•

The content and timing of the Postmarket Surveillance Reports 31

In addition to the items above, FDA also recommends the postmarket surveillance plan
include the following:
• an interim data release plan (include frequency of interim analyses, type of analysis,
data endpoints that will be assessed, content (i.e., endpoints to be posted), and
proposed frequency of posting on the FDA’s 522 Postmarket Surveillance Studies
Database webpage).
• a background section (e.g., a brief description of the device, the regulatory history, the
indications for use), and enrollment and recruitment plan.
In general, section 522(b)(1) of the FD&C Act authorizes FDA to order prospective
postmarket surveillance for duration of up to 36 months unless the manufacturer and FDA
agree to extend that timeframe or, if there is no agreement, after the completion of a dispute
resolution as described in section 562 of the FD&C Act. Further, under section 522(b)(2) of
the FD&C Act, FDA may by order require a prospective surveillance period of more than 36
months with respect to a device that is expected to have significant use in pediatric
populations, if such period is necessary in order to assess the impact of the device on growth
and development, or the effects of growth, development, activity level, or other factors on the
safety or efficacy of the device. FDA may work interactively with the manufacturer to help
FDA determine the appropriate time frame for a pediatric 522 postmarket surveillance study.

FDA will evaluate the proposed surveillance plan to determine whether it is administratively

complete, whether the person designated to conduct the surveillance has appropriate
qualifications and experience to undertake such surveillance, and if the plan will result in the
collection of useful data that can reveal unforeseen adverse events or other information
necessary to protect the public health and will answer the surveillance question(s). 32
Accordingly, FDA may issue one of the following letters: 33
•

Not Acceptable Letter – This letter is issued when a submission is found to be
administratively incomplete because it does not include the items required by 21 CFR
822.9 and 822.10 to allow for a substantive review. See Appendix 1 for FDA’s internal
checklist for determining whether a submission is administratively complete.

•

Approval Letter – This letter indicates FDA’s approval of the proposed surveillance
plan as submitted, along with any specific requirements or recommendations related to
the surveillance plan.

•

Major Deficiency Letter – This letter cites serious deficiencies relating to whether the
plan will result in the collection of useful data that will answer the surveillance
questions. The manufacturer must address these deficiencies and/or requests for
specific information within the specified timeframe before the surveillance plan can be
approved. 34

•

Disapproval Letter – This letter indicates FDA’s disapproval of the plan submitted
because FDA has determined it is not likely to result in the collection of useful data that
will address the postmarket surveillance questions in the 522 order. The letter directs
the manufacturer to revise its surveillance plan by submitting an entirely new
submission within the specified timeframe that proposes a new surveillance plan
intended to address the postmarket surveillance questions in the 522 order.

If a manufacturer disagrees with FDA about the content of the surveillance plan or if the
surveillance plan is disapproved, possible recourse options are described in 21 CFR 822.22.
These include seeking internal review of FDA’s decision under 21 CFR 10.75; requesting an
informal hearing under 21 CFR Part 16; or requesting review by the Medical Devices Dispute
Resolution Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee. A manufacturer may also
request a meeting with the FDA employee that has signed the 522 order. During the pendency
of such review, FDA does not intend to take enforcement action except as indicated in Section
X.
FDA developed this guidance document, in part, to help facilitate timely discussions with
manufacturers on postmarket surveillance plans, issues and challenges. Early and ongoing
See 522(b)(1) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 822.16.
See 21 CFR 822.19. FDA plans to use similar decision letters for supplements submitted by
manufacturers proposing changes to approved surveillance plans.
34
Consistent with FDA’s approach to least burdensome provisions as outlined in the guidance “Developing and
Responding to Deficiencies in Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/search-fda-guidance-documents/developing-and-responding-deficiencies-accordance-least-burdensomeprovisions) if only minor deficiencies are identified, FDA intends to resolve such outstanding issues interactively.
32
33

interactions with FDA should be the primary method to ensure the adequacy of 522
surveillance plans and to resolve any issues. FDA intends to work with manufacturers on the
development of their surveillance plans, including the timelines and expectations for
commencing and progress of the postmarket surveillance, and plan for posting of any interim
data that may be supplied on FDA’s website. However, if FDA is unable to complete the
review of the postmarket surveillance plan within 60 calendar days of issuance of a 522 order
due to outstanding deficiencies that the manufacturer needs to address, we intend for the
postmarket surveillance to be categorized as “Plan Overdue” on FDA’s website. 35 Moreover,
once the Secretary issues an order under section 522 requiring a manufacturer to conduct
postmarket surveillance, if a manufacturer fails to submit a plan within 30 calendar days of
the 522 order, fails to have an approved postmarket surveillance plan, or fails to commence
postmarket surveillance within 15 months of the 522 order, this would constitute a failure to
comply with a requirement under section 522. Failure to comply with a requirement under
section 522 of the FD&C Act may result in enforcement action by FDA, as appropriate (See
Section X.)

If a manufacturer wishes to propose a change to an approved postmarket surveillance plan that
will affect the nature or validity of the data collected, the manufacturer must obtain FDA
approval in writing before making such changes. 36 Examples of changes to an approved
postmarket surveillance plan that FDA may consider to affect the nature or validity of the data
collected could include changes to sample size, endpoints, follow-up assessments, etc. The
manufacturer should not combine such a surveillance plan change with any 522 reports, but
instead should submit a supplement to the PS order number (PS######) with the request and
the revised postmarket surveillance plan for FDA review. Changes in the postmarket
surveillance plan that will not affect the nature or validity of the data collected in accordance
with the plan must be reported in the next interim report as required by the order. 37
FDA understands that study delays sometimes may occur, however, FDA generally does not
intend for manufacturers to routinely modify the postmarket surveillance plan to adjust study
milestones. Manufacturers may request changes to the original enrollment milestones and
FDA intends to consider each request on a case-by-case basis. An example of where a change
to the original study milestone could be appropriate might be when new information indicates
that the original study enrollment milestones were impractical at the time of the postmarket
surveillance plan approval. However, based on its past experience, FDA expects that revisions
to the original study milestones in the surveillance plan may only be appropriate in limited
circumstances and the agency intends to determine the postmarket surveillance progress and
to designate its status (e.g., as pending, ongoing, overdue, delayed, or non-compliant) based
on the milestones as specified in the approved surveillance plan. See Section IV and Section
V.C for recommendations regarding the communication of anticipated or occurring study
delays in status reports. See Section VI for considerations for mitigating study delays.

In keeping with FDA’s practice of focusing review resources on complete submissions,
requests to change an approved postmarket surveillance plan will first undergo acceptance
review to assess whether a supplement is administratively complete for FDA to conduct a
substantive review. 38 If a supplement does not include the items listed in Appendix 1, a Not
Acceptable letter may be issued identifying the missing items, which the manufacturer would
need to provide in order for FDA to conduct a substantive review of the supplement.
Once accepted for substantive review, FDA may also find other deficiencies with a
supplement, and issue a Major Deficiency letter identifying those issues that the manufacturer
would need to address in order to receive approval. Or, if FDA determines that a proposed
modification to an approved plan is not likely to result in the collection of useful data that will
address the postmarket surveillance question, FDA will issue a Disapproval letter identifying
the reasons for disapproval. 39
Unless FDA approves the revised surveillance plan, the manufacturer remains responsible for
completing the postmarket surveillance following the previously approved surveillance plan.
Failure to meet the milestones and timelines outlined in the approved surveillance plan may
result in enforcement action by FDA (see Section X).

FDA may order postmarket surveillance to address a wide variety of device-related public
health questions. When developing a surveillance plan, FDA and the manufacturer should
consider a least burdensome approach that is scientifically appropriate to address the
surveillance question(s). 40 A 522 order may include multiple public health questions. If more
than one postmarket surveillance study is needed to address the postmarket questions, each is
tracked as a unique requirement under the 522 order. FDA also notes that, where appropriate,
it may be possible to meet a 522 order requirement through prospective or retrospective
analysis of data from RWD sources, such as device registries and electronic health records. 41
Table 1 below describes different types of postmarket surveillance designs that could be used
depending on the particular public health question.

randomly to one of the study groups.
A study in which the subjects in a defined population are followed
prospectively in time to assess the occurrence of outcomes of interest
as they occur. Such studies can include one or more groups defined in
terms of their exposure to a device. There is no randomization of
treatment assignment.
A study in which the subjects in a defined population are followed
forward in time; however, unlike a prospective cohort study, the data
records documenting the device exposure and outcomes have been
collected in the past relative to the time when the study is initiated.
Such studies can include one or more groups defined in terms of their
exposure to a device. There is no randomization of treatment
assignment.
A study in which the presence or absence of an exposure and health
outcome are assessed at the same point in time.
Continued monitoring of the distribution and trends in the incidence
of adverse events through ongoing, passive, but systematic collection,
analysis, and interpretation of data. A passive approach to
surveillance means that the organization conducting the surveillance
does not contact potential reporters and leaves the initial reporting to
others. The surveillance may be designed to collect information on
events that are both MDR-reportable and MDR non-reportable
adverse events or device complaints.
Continued monitoring of the distribution and trends in the incidence
of adverse events through ongoing, active systematic collection,

Systematic review that combines the results of several studies that
address a set of related research hypotheses. This is normally done by
identification of a common measure of effect size, which is modeled
using a form of meta-regression of the published or unpublished
study data.
A hybrid cohort study in which data are collected both retrospectively
and prospectively. There is no randomization of the treatment

IV. When and How to Submit Postmarket Surveillance
Reports
Per 21 CFR 822.38, manufacturers must submit interim and final reports as specified in the
postmarket surveillance plan. A 522 order can include the timing of reports. FDA
recommends submitting two types of interim reports: “Enrollment Reports” and “Interim
Postmarket Surveillance Status Reports.” An Enrollment Report provides the progress
towards meeting the enrollment milestones specified in the postmarket surveillance plan. For
Enrollment Reports, the timing can be based on the expected completion dates for those
enrollment milestones. An Interim Postmarket Surveillance Status Report includes subject
accountability as well as device performance data. There may be instances in which the timing
for submission of an Enrollment Report coincides with the timing for an Interim Postmarket
Surveillance Status Report. In such instances, a manufacturer can submit one report labeled as
“Enrollment and Interim Postmarket Surveillance Status Report.”
The Final Postmarket Surveillance Report is a written report of a postmarket surveillance
requirement that has been completed or terminated.
Unless alternative timeframes are specified in the 522 order, for each postmarket surveillance
requirement, manufacturers should submit an Interim Postmarket Surveillance Status Report
every 6 months for the first 2 years of the postmarket surveillance and annually, thereafter,
from the date of the 522 postmarket surveillance plan approval or other agreed-upon starting
date, separately for each unique requirement. Manufacturers should continue this reporting
schedule, for each unique requirement, until the Final Postmarket Surveillance Report(s) are
submitted. In accordance with the 522 order, the Final Postmarket Surveillance Report should
be submitted no later than three months after study/surveillance completion for the particular
postmarket surveillance requirement, which FDA considers to have occurred when the last
data point is collected during the surveillance period (e.g., when the last subject completes the
last follow-up visit). 43
FDA supports the principles of the “3Rs,” to reduce, refine, and replace animal use in testing when feasible. We
encourage manufacturers to consult with us if they wish to use a non-animal testing method they believe is suitable,
adequate, validated, and feasible. We will consider if such an alternative method could be assessed for equivalency
to an animal test method.
43
For non-clinical surveillance/studies submission of final report is expected no later than three months from the
date the last datapoint was captured.
42

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In order to ensure proper review, the manufacturer should indicate the type of report and the
time span on the report cover letter in bold letters (e.g., Enrollment Report, 6-Month
Interim Postmarket Surveillance Status Report, 12-Month Interim Postmarket
Surveillance Status Report, Final Postmarket Surveillance Report). For final reports,
FDA also recommends that manufacturers clearly identify the postmarket surveillance
requirement (i.e., public health question(s)) for which the report is being submitted.
Section 522 is not subject to section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 379k-1(b)],
regarding electronic copy (eCopy) requirements. However, submission of an eCopy is
recommended for all postmarket surveillance plan submissions. If you choose to submit an
eCopy, the eCopy should be accompanied by a paper copy of your signed cover letter and
should be sent to the current address displayed on the eCopy Program webpage
http://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress. Refer to FDA Guidance, “eCopy Program for
Medical Device Submissions”, for additional information on the eCopy program. 44

V.

Content and Format of Postmarket Surveillance
Reports

FDA’s ability to adequately track and evaluate postmarket surveillance depends on the quality
and timeliness of information provided. The recommendations in this section are intended to
help ensure that Postmarket Surveillance Reports contain adequate information for the
Agency to identify the device being studied, the specific postmarket surveillance being
conducted, the status of that postmarket surveillance, and, if applicable, the reasons for any
delays or failures to complete the postmarket surveillance.
FDA recommends that Postmarket Surveillance Reports (interim and final) include the
information listed below, clearly identified, and in separate sections. All reports should
contain the data listed below and submitted per the timeline in the postmarket surveillance
plan.

FDA recommends all reports include a section that contains the following general
information:
•
•

Postmarket surveillance tracking number (i.e., PS######)
Manufacturer name and contact information (name of the individual or entity holding
the approved PMA, or HDE, cleared 510(k), or De Novo order):

FDA intends to review Enrollment Reports to assess progress towards the surveillance plan
milestones. If the postmarket surveillance plan involves new enrollment of subjects, 46 FDA
may request a manufacturer to submit Enrollment Reports until enrollment is completed. The
Enrollment Reports should include sufficient information to allow FDA and the manufacturer
to track progress towards the enrollment milestones specified in the postmarket surveillance
plan, including:
•
•
•
•
•

whether information in the reports address the public health question(s)
the expected versus actual status of the study at the time of the report (especially
timeliness in recruitment of subjects and sites to the study and adherence to the
timeline in the postmarket surveillance plan)
the causes for delays in postmarket surveillance progress or failure to meet enrollment
milestones approved in the postmarket surveillance plan, and plan to address
challenges and meet established milestones
o When a sponsor fails to meet those enrollment milestones, FDA expects sponsors
to act with due diligence to mitigate continued study delays. FDA intends to
consider the sponsors’ mitigations to address study delays. Mitigation efforts FDA
may consider include, but are not limited to the following:
-

current and past enrollment recovery efforts;
evaluation of slow enrollment;
device availability on the market;
measures taken to initiate study sites;
measures taken to incentivize study subjects;
outreach to study investigators and potential subjects; and
plans to remove barriers to site and subject participation.

Although it is recommended that the manufacturer identify any missed milestones as part of
postmarket surveillance reports, the manufacturer should communicate circumstances which
are impacting their ability to meet the milestones in the postmarket surveillance plan to FDA
as soon as possible.
FDA intends to review Interim Postmarket Surveillance Reports within 30 calendar days from
submission receipt. If FDA has questions regarding the data provided in the report, or believes
that the data are incomplete or insufficient, FDA will generally request additional information
interactively and/or through a deficiency letter. If an interim report includes insufficient data
or the manufacturer failed to meet established enrollment milestones or timelines, FDA
ultimately may take enforcement actions to ensure compliance with the 522 order, as
appropriate (see Section X). Additionally, if the data raise new concerns regarding the safety
and/or effectiveness of a device, FDA may consider taking actions, which may include issuing
a Safety Communication to provide recommendations on patient management, as appropriate.

VII. Evaluation of Postmarket Surveillance Final Reports
and Possible FDA Actions After 522 Order Completion
FDA recommends the Final Postmarket Surveillance Report describe the methodology and
results and explain how it fulfills the public health questions identified in the 522 order.
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA will consider several factors in its evaluation of the Final Postmarket Surveillance
Report, including:
• the completeness of the report content;
• adherence to methodology in the postmarket surveillance plan and reasons for deviations
from the methodology;
• evaluation of information in the report to assess the performance of the device; and
• evaluation of fulfillment of the 522 order (i.e., have the public health questions been
addressed).
FDA intends to complete its review of a manufacturer’s Final Postmarket Surveillance Report
submission and respond within 60 calendar days. If FDA concludes that the manufacturer has
fulfilled the obligations in the 522 order, FDA will send a letter to the manufacturer reflecting
that decision. However, if the results of the postmarket surveillance raise new issues or
questions, additional actions may be warranted. In such circumstances, FDA could, for
example:
•
•
•
•

request changes to the labeling of the device to reflect additional information learned
from the postmarket surveillance;
issue a new 522 order to address new issues;
consider other actions to protect the public health (e.g., request an update to a device’s
indications for use statement); or
consider clinical recommendations to guide patient management (e.g., Safety
Communication), as appropriate.

VIII. Manufacturer’s Reporting Status
Upon receipt of an Interim or Final Postmarket Surveillance Report, FDA determines your
reporting status based on the schedule in the postmarket surveillance plan. The reporting
status categories are included in Table 2 below. The reporting status for each postmarket
surveillance study is posted in the 522 Postmarket Surveillance Studies Database webpage. 55

IX. Postmarket Surveillance Status
After the review of a supplement with a postmarket surveillance plan, or of an interim 56 or
final report, FDA will consider the manufacturer’s progress with completing the postmarket
surveillance. Factors in considering the postmarket surveillance status include, as applicable:
1. Assessing the status of surveillance plan approval
2. After surveillance plan approval, assessing the following:
a. Whether the surveillance plan milestones are met
b. Progress with data accrual
c. Submission of a final report
Based on the above, FDA will review the potential progress categories (see Table 3 below)
and consider the appropriate progress status to be posted on the 522 Postmarket Surveillance
Studies Database webpage. 57, 58 Information regarding study status is typically communicated
to sponsors prior to updates on the 522 webpage. Of note, there may be circumstances in
which a postmarket surveillance requirement may be put on a temporary hold, be redesigned,
or terminated. A manufacturer’s progress status is considered based on current information
available to the agency and may be revised accordingly based on the availability of new
information. Each of these status categories are described in Table 3 below.

Overall Status

Description

Plan Pending

FDA has not received the postmarket surveillance plan or is

Plan Overdue

FDA is unable to complete its review of the proposed postmarket
surveillance plan due to outstanding deficiencies that the
manufacturer needs to address, and it has been more than 60
calendar days since issuance of the 522 order.

Surveillance Pending

This status category is used from the time the postmarket
surveillance plan is approved to the completion of the review of
the first Interim Postmarket Surveillance Report.

Ongoing

The surveillance is proceeding according to, or is ahead of, the

surveillance plan.

Delayed

The progression of the surveillance is behind the approved
schedule. For example, the enrollment of subjects (or data
accrual) may or may not have started but the projected date for
completion of that milestone has passed. Delays can occur in any
phase of the surveillance, including subject enrollment, analysis
of data, or submission of the final report to the FDA. While the
milestones in the postmarket surveillance plan serve as the basis
for defining the surveillance as delayed, each phase of the
surveillance will be considered on its own right. If the
manufacturer has one delayed phase, but gets back on schedule
during the next phase, the delayed status will no longer apply.

Non-compliant

The surveillance fails to comply with a requirement under section
522, e.g., it has been more than 15 months since the 522 order
date and the surveillance has not commenced.

Completed

The manufacturer has fulfilled the postmarket surveillance
requirement(s) and FDA considers the requirement(s) under the
522 order to be satisfied.

Terminated

The manufacturer has not fulfilled or cannot fulfill the postmarket
surveillance requirement identified in the 522 order (i.e.,
postmarket surveillance questions are no longer relevant, dataset
cannot address public health question(s) in 522 order), and after
all appropriate efforts to fulfill the requirement have been
exhausted, FDA has terminated the postmarket surveillance
requirement.

Redesigned/Replaced

The manufacturer has not fulfilled or cannot fulfill the
surveillance requirement in the 522 order as designed and
approved. All appropriate efforts to fulfill the postmarket
surveillance requirement have been exhausted, and FDA has
agreed to allow the manufacturer to redesign or replace the
approved postmarket surveillance plan with a new surveillance
plan to address the public health question(s) in the 522 order. The
new plan supersedes the previous plan.

Hold

This status reflects when a postmarket surveillance requirement
has been placed on a hold temporarily. Examples of situations
when a postmarket surveillance requirement might be temporarily
paused include the following examples:
• while a change in ownership is completed, a pending
separate study is being used to address the public health

question(s) in the 522 order,
• redesigning the device and it needs prior premarket
authorization to use in study,
• device has been authorized for marketing in US, but is not
currently marketed by manufacturer,
• ceased device sales, but regulatory submission that
received the 522 order has not been withdrawn.
When the circumstances supporting the hold have resolved, the
manufacturer is responsible for implementing the surveillance
plan. The progress is assessed against the milestones approved in
the postmarket surveillance plan and time since issuance of the
revised 522 order.

Consolidated

X.

The manufacturer has requested to consolidate multiple 522
orders for devices of a particular device type into one
consolidated 522 order. FDA has agreed to have the multiple 522
orders consolidated under one 522 order.

Failure to Comply with Postmarket Surveillance
Requirements under Section 522 of the FD&C Act

Failure or refusal to comply with a requirement under section 522 of the FD&C Act, including
failure to commence surveillance within 15 months of a 522 order, is a prohibited act under
section 301(q)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(q)(1)(C), and renders the device
misbranded under section 502(t)(3) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(t)(3). Note that
violations of sections 301(q)(1)(C) or misbranding under section 502(t)(3) may lead to
enforcement actions including seizure of product, injunction, prosecution, and/or civil money
penalties, as appropriate. 59
Furthermore, the “failure to have an approved postmarket surveillance plan or failure to
conduct postmarket surveillance in accordance with the approved plan” could also be the basis
of enforcement action, as appropriate, because such constitutes failure to comply with section
522 of the FD&C Act, which is a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act
and the device would be misbranded under section 502(t)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 CFR
822.20).
There may be instances in which it is impossible or inappropriate for a manufacturer to
complete a particular postmarket surveillance order, and manufacturers may request
exemption from the requirement to conduct postmarket surveillance for their devices, which
FDA will consider under 21 CFR 822.30. Unless an exemption is granted, manufacturers must

59

21 CFR 822.20

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
comply with the 522 order. 60 If a manufacturer stops marketing the device subject to the
postmarket surveillance order, it still must continue to conduct postmarket surveillance in
accordance with the postmarket surveillance plan unless notified otherwise by the Agency. 61
Requests to terminate or modify postmarket surveillance in such instances will be decided on
a case-by-case basis but are less likely to be granted for devices that are implanted long-term.
FDA recommends that manufacturers initiate early communication with FDA if they intend to
terminate postmarket surveillance prior to fulfilling the postmarket surveillance commitment.
Alternatively, if FDA determines a surveillance plan will no longer answer or adequately
address questions in a 522 order, for example, because of the postmarket surveillance design,
or due to a discontinuation in marketing or manufacturing of the device, but the 522 order
objectives remain important, FDA intends to discuss the establishment of a new postmarket
surveillance plan and schedule with the manufacturer.

XI. Public Disclosure of Postmarket Surveillance Plan
Information and Reports
After approval of the manufacturer’s plan, FDA may disclose the contents of the original
submission and any amendments, supplements, or reports, in accordance with applicable
disclosure laws, such as the Freedom of Information Act. When FDA discloses such
information, FDA will continue to protect any trade secret or confidential commercial
information, as well as any personal privacy information of patients. 62
Any postmarket surveillance study that is an “applicable device clinical trial” as defined in
section 402(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the PHS Act must comply with registration and results submission
requirements for such clinical trials. Certain information on clinical trials is publicly available
on the Clinical Trials webpage. Additional information on these requirements can be found at
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/background.

To increase transparency to FDA stakeholders, including consumers, healthcare providers,
and industry, FDA posts information about postmarket surveillance (e.g., study description,
status, and interim or final study results, see details below) on the FDA 522 Postmarket
Surveillance Studies Database webpage. 63 As noted above, this information is posted in
compliance with applicable disclosure statutes and regulations. Postmarket surveillance
details that may be posted include:

Interim Postmarket Surveillance Status Report Information
FDA intends to post on its website, or otherwise make public, postmarket surveillance interim
results consistent with the interim data release plan in the postmarket surveillance plan. When
interim data includes additional information that may be beneficial for public awareness that
is not specified in the interim release plan, FDA may also include these data on the 522
Postmarket Surveillance Studies Database webpage. If the postmarket surveillance plan does
not include an interim data release plan, FDA intends to post postmarket surveillance interim
summary data and/or FDA’s analyses thereof when appropriate to protect the public health,
for example, when interim results raise safety concerns, serves to provide critical device
performance information, or may otherwise impact treatment. FDA generally considers such
information to be publicly releasable in accordance with applicable disclosure laws, such as
the Freedom of Information Act. When sharing information appropriate to protect public
health, FDA will consider the benefits of sharing the information, as well as other
considerations on the study conduct. Examples of interim report information that FDA
publicly discloses include:
• number of subjects enrolled
• number of sites enrolled
• interim safety/effectiveness findings
However, if a manufacturer believes in a particular instance that interim results are prohibited
from public release; for example, because they constitute personal identifying information,
trade secrets, or confidential commercial information, they should notify FDA of this in the
