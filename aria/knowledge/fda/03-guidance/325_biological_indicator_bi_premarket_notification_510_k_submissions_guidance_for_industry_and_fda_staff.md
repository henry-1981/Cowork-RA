Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Biological Indicator (BI) Premarket
Notification [510(k)] Submissions
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic.
It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the
public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA
staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call
the appropriate number listed on the title page of this guidance.

1.

Introduction

FDA regulates biological indicators (BI) intended to monitor sterilizers used in health care
facilities as class II medical devices requiring premarket notification (510(k)). 21 CFR
880.2800(a). This guidance document provides information that will help manufacturers prepare
510(k)s for BIs used with conventional sterilization methods. FDA believes that providing this
information will promote a consistent and efficient regulatory process.
The effective performance of sterilizers used in health care facilities is important to help prevent
nosocomial infections. BIs can provide sterilizer users with information on the effectiveness of
sterilizer processes. The use of comprehensive, scientifically sound criteria to evaluate BIs helps
ensure the performance of these devices. This guidance document draws upon long-standing
scientific principles used to evaluate BIs. It was produced through interaction with industry,
government, academia, and health care professionals.
This document supplements other FDA documents regarding the specific content requirements
of a 510(k) submission. You should also refer to: 21 CFR 807.87; the guidance, Format for
Traditional and Abbreviated 510(k)s; 1 and the section of CDRH’s Device Advice, Premarket
Notification 510(k). 2
In addition, The New 510(k) Paradigm - Alternate Approaches to Demonstrating
Substantial Equivalence in Premarket Notifications, 3 describes options for submitting either

2 http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/314.html.
3 http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.html.

an Abbreviated 510(k) or a Special 510(k), in lieu of a Traditional 510(k). FDA believes an
Abbreviated 510(k) provides the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
equivalence for a new device, particularly once FDA has issued a guidance document addressing
that device. Manufacturers considering certain modifications to their own cleared devices may
lessen the regulatory burden by submitting a Special 510(k).

The Least Burdensome Approach
The issues identified in this guidance document represent those that we believe need to be
addressed before your device can be marketed. In developing the guidance, we carefully
considered the relevant statutory criteria for Agency decision-making. We also considered the
burden that may be incurred in your attempt to follow the guidance and address the issues we
have identified. We believe that we have considered the least burdensome approach to
resolving the issues presented in the guidance document. If, however, you believe that there is a
less burdensome way to address the issues, you should follow the procedures outlined in the A
Suggested Approach to Resolving Least Burdensome Issues,
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/modact/leastburdensome.html.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

2.

Scope

This document provides guidance concerning the content and format of 510(k) submissions for
BIs intended to monitor sterilization processes used in health care facilities (product code, FRC).
These are Class II devices identified under 21 CFR 880.2800(a):
A biological sterilization process indicator is a device intended for use by a health care
provider to accompany products being sterilized through a sterilization procedure and to
monitor adequacy of sterilization. The device consists of a known number of
microorganisms, of a known resistance to the mode of sterilization, in or on a carrier and
enclosed in a protective package. Subsequent growth or failure of the microorganisms to
grow under suitable conditions indicates the adequacy of sterilization.
FDA encourages you to contact the Division of Small Manufacturers, International, and
Consumer Assistance (DSMICA) or the Division of Anesthesiology, General Hospital, Infection
Control, and Dental Devices (DAGID) representatives with any questions you may have before
submitting a 510(k) for a BI.

Exclusions
This document does not address the following sterilization process indicators or related
products:

3.

•

physical/chemical sterilization process indicators (JOJ, LRT, MTC) identified under
21 CFR 880.2800(b)

•

BIs intended for use in a manufacturing setting

•

BIs intended for use in liquid chemical sterilization (product code MRB).

Definitions

The following are definitions of terms used throughout the document. Many of the definitions
have been standardized by organizations such as the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the Association
for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Complete citations for these
standards are in section 12, “References.”
Biological Indicator (BI): Microbiological test system providing a defined resistance to a
specified sterilization process (AAMI, 2006a).
Carrier: Supporting material onto which indicator organisms are deposited (AAMI 2006b).
Chemical Indicator: System that reveals change in one or more predefined process variables
based on a chemical or physical change resulting from exposure to a process. (ISO, 2006)
D-value: (decimal reduction value): Time or radiation dose required to achieve inactivation of
90% of a population of the test microorganism under stated exposure conditions (AAMI 2006a).4
Death Rate Curve (or Survivor Curve): The graphic representation of inactivation against
increasing exposure to stated conditions (AAMI, 2006a).
Inactivation: Loss of the ability of indicator organisms to germinate, outgrow, and/or multiply
under specified culture conditions (AAMI, 2006a).
Inoculated Carrier: Specified material onto which a defined number of test organisms have
been deposited (AAMI, 2006a).

4 This is the definition for D-value in the standard cited. However, radiation sterilization is not discussed in this
guidance document because it is not a sterilization method generally used in health care facilities.

product after sterilization (AAMI, 2006a).
Sterilization: Validated process used to render a product free of all forms of viable
microorganisms (AAMI, 2006a).
5 In addition to routine quality system testing of indicator performance consistency, a resistometer is used to
characterize cause and effect relationships associated with a given sterilization process and devices used to evaluate
the efficacy of the sterilization process.
6 Resistometers were formerly referred to as Biological Indicator Evaluator Resistometer (BIER) or Chemical
Indicator Evaluator Resistometer test systems (AAMI 2002).

FDA-Recognized Standards

If any part of the device design or testing relies on a recognized standard, we recommend that
you include either:
•

a statement that testing will be conducted and meet specified acceptance criteria before
the device is marketed or

•

a declaration of conformity to the standard. 7

Because a declaration of conformity is based on results from testing, we believe you cannot
properly submit a declaration of conformity until you have completed the testing the standard
describes. For more information, please refer to section 514(c)(1)(B) of the Act and the FDA
guidance, Use of Standards in Substantial Equivalence Determinations; Final Guidance for
Industry and FDA. 8
Recognized standards that apply to BIs are discussed in the following sections.

FDA recommends that performance studies include statistically valid sample sizes and are
conducted on at least 3 different spore lots, prepared from different spore crops. You should
conduct the performance studies discussed below.
A. Viable Spore Population Assay
You should provide assay results to demonstrate that the product meets its specification for
the spore population. For examples of assay methods, refer to the applicable United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) standards and FDA recognized standards (see 12. References). See
also Table 3 Recommended Minimum Populations and Resistance Characteristics.
B. Resistance Characteristics Study
You should provide the resistance characteristics of the BI in the specified sterilization
process and cycle, using a resistometer. We recommend that you perform all testing on only
final finished products. We also recommend that the resistometer used for the
characterization of the BI conform with the current ANSI/AAMI standard for resistometers.
If no resistometer exists for the sterilization process being evaluated, we recommend using
actual production sterilizers with the critical cycle parameters controlled to the extent
possible during testing. You should document that testing parameters were adequately
controlled and explain how this was achieved. If you conduct resistance characteristics
studies using sterilizers that do not routinely monitor all critical parameters, we recommend
that you add external monitors to document evidence of adequate control.
D-value
For test methods for determining BI resistance characteristics, please refer to
ANSI/AAMI ST 59 or equivalent method.
For non self-contained BIs, you should plot the D-values for a representative range (e.g.,
115°C, 120°C, 125°C, 130°C) to determine the D-value for different thermal exposure
temperatures. If the curve demonstrates linearity, the BI is suitable for the full range of
cycle temperatures.
For self-contained BIs, you should calculate the D-value at each proposed temperature.
Z-value
You should provide Z-values for thermal processes. FDA generally recommends that BIs
have a minimum Z-value of 10°C.
To determine the Z-value, you should construct a thermal resistance curve. The thermal
resistance curve is a semi-logarithmic graph of D-value vs. temperature. The Z-value
can be obtained from the slope of the curve by calculating the number of degrees of
temperature for a 1-logarithm change in D-value. The greater the number of

page 8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

temperatures studied, the more accurate the resulting Z-value. FDA recommends that
studies use at least three different temperatures (Pflug, 1990).
Survival/Kill Window
You should conduct a study to verify the calculated survival/kill window. USP provides
an acceptable test method. The minimum expected survival time and maximum expected
kill time can be calculated from the following equations (USP):
Minimum Expected Survival Time
Survival Time = Not Less Than D - value × (log10 viable spore population - 2)
Maximum Expected Kill Time
Kill Time = Not More Than D - value × (log 10 viable spore population + 4 )
Table 3 below lists examples of the resistance characteristics of 510(k) cleared BIs with
minimum populations, D-values, and the survival times.

You should evaluate the effects of carrier and packaging materials on the resistance
characteristics of the BI. Please refer to ANSI/AAMI/ISO 11138-1 Annex B for examples of
methods that may be used.

page 9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

D. Holding Time Assessment
Holding time is the length of time that the exposed BI is held before incubation. You should
evaluate the effect of the labeled holding time on the resistance characteristics and spore
recovery.
E. Recovery Protocols
You should identify the recovery media and evaluate all recovery protocols to validate the
incubation time. Generally, FDA recommends 7 days as the conventional incubation time
for BIs used to monitor the traditional sterilization processes listed in Table 2. To validate
incubation times of less than 7 days, see Examples of Validation of Biological Indicator
Incubation Time in Attachment II.
For self contained BIs, you should also evaluate the effect of the sterilization process on the
recovery medium.
F. Mail-In Protocols
Some manufacturers market BIs as part of a monitoring service; the user mails the exposed
BI to the manufacturer (or laboratory) to incubate and read. The handling required by the
monitoring service may impact adversely upon the BI resistance. Therefore, labeling for BIs
marketed as part of a monitoring service should detail the handling protocol. The handling
protocol should be validated.

8.

Shelf Life

You should demonstrate that the specifications (e.g., D-value, spore population) are maintained
throughout the labeled shelf life of the device. For all studies, FDA recommends that you use at
least 3 lots from 3 different spore crops of BI and a statistically significant sample size. You
should use storage conditions described in the device labeling.
You should provide the following information about shelf life:
•

labeled shelf life

•

dates and length of time for each testing interval, e.g., 0, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years

•

resistometer vessel results for each testing interval demonstrating that the established
endpoints are maintained.

BIs may be unstable at elevated temperatures; therefore, FDA believes accelerated aging studies
may be inappropriate.
In lieu of complete real time shelf life data, the FDA will consider preliminary real time shelf life
data (e.g., 6 months) along with a detailed protocol and sampling plan for an ongoing real time

page 10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(e.g., 2 years) study that you intend to continue after your device is cleared. These study
protocols should include the shelf life information listed above. You should document the
results in your design history file as a part of the Quality System Regulations (21 CFR 820.30).

9.

Incubators

BI labeling may recommend a suitable incubator. Alternatively, labeling may recommend
incubation conditions and allow users to select an appropriate incubator. FDA considers
incubators without specific claims to be general purpose laboratory equipment regulated under
21 CFR 862.2050 as Class I exempt. A 510(k) may be required for incubators that are dedicated
for a specific BI or make specific performance claims that go beyond incubation.
However, incubator performance is an important aspect in BI validation. Some (typically selfcontained) BIs are marketed as part of a system that includes an incubator. A 510(k) for this
kind of BI should include a certification that any incubator sold as part of a system maintains the
operating temperature specifications under all potential loading conditions over the
recommended incubation time.

10. Test packs
BIs may be used in test packs to simulate products being sterilized. 9 Test packs are intended to
simulate products and constitute a defined challenge to the sterilization process that is equal to or
greater than the most difficult item routinely processed. For BIs indicated for use in specific test
packs, you should demonstrate that the performance of the BI in that test pack is equivalent to
the performance of the AAMI reference BI in the same test pack in their respective sterilization
processes. You should also demonstrate that the BI test pack provides a greater challenge to the
process than the BI itself.

11. Labeling
The premarket notification must include labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements
of 21 CFR 807.87(e). The following suggestions are aimed at assisting you in preparing labeling
that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801. 10
A. Intended Use
We recommend that the intended use describe:
•

method of sterilization

9 These test packs are also called process challenge devices (PCDs).
10 Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with the requirements of
21 CFR Part 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate commerce. Labeling recommendations in this
guidance are consistent with the requirements of part 801.

page 11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

sterilization cycle

•

exposure time

•

temperature

•

sterilant concentration

•

any other information specific to the intended use of your device.

B. Description
We recommend that the labeling provide a description of the device. The description should
include:
•

genus, species, and strain

•

lot/batch number

•

type of BI (paper strip, self-contained, size of paper carrier)

•

D- value and method used to determine it (see also D. Precautions below)

•

Z-value (thermal processes only)

•

survival/kill time under the conditions specified

•

total viable spore count, including whether the count had been determined after
preliminary heat treatment

•

expiration information.

C. Instructions for Use
We recommend that your instructions for use include:
•

sterilization method, cycle, and exposure time

•

instructions for interpreting results

•

instructions for disposal, e.g., “sterilize by steam 121°C for not less than 30 minutes”

•

instructions for spore recovery, e.g., incubation time, culture conditions, type of
media.

For self contained BIs, we also recommend that the labeling state whether the supplied
bacteriological medium will meet requirements for growth promoting ability.
D. Precautions
The labeling should advise users that the manufacturer’s D-value cannot be duplicated in the
healthcare facility, for example:

page 12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

The D-value is reproducible only under the exact test laboratory resistometer conditions
under which it was determined. The user would not necessarily obtain the same result.

Attachment II. Examples of Validation of Biological
Indicator Incubation Time
These recommendations are appropriate for all biological indicators, self contained or on a strip,
which are intended to accompany products being sterilized through a sterilization procedure and
to monitor adequacy of sterilization.
The incubation period for BIs may be reduced from the standard seven or more days, provided
that the validation studies demonstrate that the revised numbers of days of incubation are
sufficient according to appropriate methodology.
Methodology
FDA recommends that manufacturers use the following methodology to reduce the incubation
time for BIs from the standard seven or more days.
•

Identify the partial cycle in which 30 -80% of the BIs survive. A partial cycle is
one in which all sterilization parameters, except the time parameter, are met.

•

Obtain a minimum of 100 BIs from each of 3 different lots (for a minimal sample
size of 300 BIs).

•

Expose the BIs to 3 partial sterilization cycles using 100 indicators from each lot
per each partial cycle. Only the BIs from one lot should be used in each partial
cycle. Lots should not be mixed.

•

It is preferable to run BIs in a device load. However, because of the inherent
difficulties of achieving a partial cycle kill under such circumstances, partial
cycles can be run without device loads.
NOTE: During all sterilization validation studies, the effects of the sterilant in
combination with the device material on the indicator organism should be
determined. If the materials are judged to have a significant effect on organism
destruction, the indicators should be exposed to the sterilant in conjunction with
the devices during the partial cycle studies.

•

Place the BIs in the growth media no more than 8 hours after removal from the
sterilization chamber or removal from the sterilized load of devices. Incubate all
of the BIs for a minimum of 7 days.

•

Prepare a growth chart to record the number of positive BIs on either a daily basis
or for the particular time interval of interest.

•

Using the number of BIs that test positive on day 7 as the base of 100% grow out
(denominator data), determine from the growth chart the number of BIs that have
more than 97% of the base number of BIs (numerator) that test positive in each
partial cycle for the proposed incubation time to be acceptable.

•

The greatest number of days of incubation time to obtain more than 97% positive
BIs (based on the 7 day incubation time) in any one of the partial cycles is the

minimum incubation time for the BI. For this method, averaging the three (or
more) partial cycle incubation times is not recommended (see examples below).
•

If there are fewer than 30% survivors or more than 80% survivors in any one run,
this particular run should not be used and should be repeated to achieve the
desired number of survivors (see examples below).

Example #1: The following Table provides examples of the number of positive BIs needed to
achieve 97% growth.

The numerator is the number of positive BIs that is greater than 97% of the denominator. If
the numerator is equal to or greater than the one listed for the corresponding denominator (based
on the total number of positive BIs on day 7), the length of the incubation time when this occurs
is acceptable.

The denominator is the total number of positive BIs on day 7 of incubation.

The 3-day reduced incubation time is not validated because, of the three valid partial cycles, not
all achieved 97% growth in 3 or fewer days. However, based upon the criteria listed in bullet 7
of the test methodology, the data validate a 5-day reduced incubation time. The 5-day incubation
time in this example is the greatest number of days, from all the valid partial cycles, needed to
grow out more than 97% of the denominator BIs.
