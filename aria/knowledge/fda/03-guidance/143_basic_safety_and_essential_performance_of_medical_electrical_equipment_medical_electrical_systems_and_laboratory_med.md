Evaluation of safety is critical for electrically powered medical devices. The IEC
60601/806015 series of standards applies to devices used in patient care settings, while the
IEC 61010-1 series applies to devices used in laboratory settings. These standards are used in
the majority of premarket submissions for electrically powered medical devices to support
device safety. These standards take an ‘all-hazards approach’ to device safety, encompassing
electrical, mechanical, and radiation hazards, among others, in addition to hazards posed by
the environment of use. Besides addressing the wide range of generic safety requirements,
the IEC 60601/80601 and IEC 61010 series include close to 100 “particular standards” with
safety requirements for specific types of devices, such as clinical thermometers, infusion
pumps, infant incubators, and laboratory centrifuges.
The FDA-recognized consensus standards eligible for inclusion in the ASCA Pilot for basic
safety and essential performance of medical devices and laboratory equipment are listed
below. Any activities carried out by the testing laboratory under its scope of ASCA
Accreditation to assess the conformity of a product to one or more of these standards is
within the scope of the ASCA Pilot. The extent of FDA recognition (complete or partial) is
provided in the Supplemental Information Sheet (SIS) for each standard listed in the FDA
Recognized Consensus Standards Database.6 The SIS provides additional information to
consider when using FDA-recognized consensus standards, such as relevant guidance
documents that provide clarity on FDA recommendations for testing to support premarket
submissions.

IV. Accreditation and Assessment of Testing Laboratories
by ASCA­ Recognized Accreditation Bodies
A.

Scope of Assessments

Section 7 of ISO/IEC 17011: Conformity assessment – Requirements for accreditation bodies
accrediting conformity assessment bodies (hereafter referred to as “ISO/IEC 17011”)
describes processes by which accreditation bodies assess testing laboratories. In order to
maintain conformance to ISO/IEC 17011, an accreditation body assesses a sample of the
scope of accreditation of its accredited testing laboratories at least every two years.7 There
are no additional expectations for assessments under the ASCA Pilot for basic safety and
essential performance standards. That is, in the ASCA Pilot, ASCA-recognized accreditation
bodies may assess a sample of the basic safety and essential performance standards in order
to ensure competence across the testing laboratory’s entire scope of ASCA Accreditation.

B. ASCA Program Specifications for Basic Safety and
Essential Performance of Medical Electrical Equipment,
Medical Electrical Systems, and Laboratory Medical
Equipment
The ASCA program specifications in this section provide expectations for the accreditation
of testing laboratories for basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical
equipment, medical electrical systems, and laboratory medical equipment under the ASCA
Pilot. ASCA-recognized accreditation bodies, following the processes of ISO/IEC 17011,
accredit testing laboratories to ISO/IEC 17025:2017: General requirements for the
competence of testing and calibration laboratories (hereafter referred to as “ISO/IEC
17025”) as well as the ASCA program specifications identified in this section. In addition, all
testing should be conducted considering the recommendations of relevant FDA guidance
documents (Refer to Section III. of this guidance). For readability and ease of reference, the
numbering and nomenclature (including the term “requirements”)8 below correspond to the
numbering and nomenclature of clauses/subclauses in ISO/IEC 17025.
ISO/IEC 17025 Section 4 “General requirements”
For the purposes of the ASCA Pilot, testing laboratories inspect the manufacturer’s risk
management file to the extent necessary to assess compliance with the expectations of IEC
60601/80601 or IEC 61010. The testing laboratories do not make judgments concerning the
adequacy of the manufacturer’s risk management process. Nor do they make judgments
concerning the acceptability of risk or the adequacy of the manufacturer’s decisions
concerning risk. Each time a clause of IEC 60601/80601 or IEC 61010 calls for inspection of
the risk management policy, plan, or records (i.e., the risk management file), it is to check to
see if a related IEC 60601/80601 or IEC 61010 expectation has been complied with.

V. Premarket Submission Contents for FDA­Recognized
Consensus Standards in the ASCA Pilot for Basic Safety
and Essential Performance
FDA recommends that the following be included in any regulatory submission that contains
basic safety and essential performance testing conducted by an ASCA-accredited testing
laboratory.

A.

Cover Letter

FDA recommendations for a cover letter for a premarket submission containing testing
results from an ASCA-accredited testing laboratory are provided in FDA’s guidance The
Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot Program.

B.

Declaration of Conformity

Section IV.A. of FDA’s guidance Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in
Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices10 recommends contents for a DOC to an FDArecognized consensus standard. For basic safety and essential performance testing from an
ASCA-accredited testing laboratory, FDA recommends the device manufacturer include the
following additional items in a DOC:
·
·
·

·

Date(s) the testing was conducted
Location(s) where the testing was conducted
Confirmation that the FDA-recognized consensus standards used during testing were
within the laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation and not subject to any temporary
labeling constraints as a result of a suspension of ASCA Accreditation at the time
testing was conducted. If the relevant standard was impacted by a suspension of
ASCA Accreditation, the DOC should include an explanation of how this suspension
may or may not affect the testing results.
Limitations on the validity of the DOC:
· How the test article compares with the device provided in this premarket
submission (including any modifications made during testing)
· How any concerns communicated by the test laboratory were resolved
· How any observations and/or degradations during testing were resolved

An example DOC is provided in Appendix A of this guidance. This example provides one
approach to how a single DOC might contain testing to FDA-recognized consensus standards
included and not included in a testing laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation.

An ASCA summary test report is recommended for all testing conducted under the ASCA
Pilot.11 An example ASCA summary test report is provided in Appendix B of this guidance.
Note that the ASCA-accredited testing laboratory provides the ASCA summary test report to
the device manufacturer who then includes it with its own DOC in a premarket submission to
FDA.
During the ASCA Pilot, FDA generally will accept determinations from ASCA-accredited
testing laboratories (i.e., test results) when the standard and test methods are within the
testing laboratory’s scope of ASCA Accreditation at the time of testing. Circumstances where
FDA may request and review additional information relating to testing from an ASCAaccredited testing laboratory are described in the bulleted points of Section XIII.A of the
guidance titled The Accreditation Scheme for Conformity Assessment (ASCA) Pilot
Program.
The ASCA Pilot processes and policies enhance confidence in testing results only when
specific test methods and acceptance criteria are used. In cases where the standard permits
modifications or additions to individual clauses to ensure basic safety and essential
performance, FDA recommends that the premarket submission include the test plan and
procedure, acceptance criteria, and results justifying the safety claim. In such cases, FDA
recommends that the ASCA summary test report include relevant information about the
testing that was performed. The following examples illustrate a few situations where this
additional documentation is appropriate.
·
·
·

Where a test method specified in a clause of the standard was modified based on
specific characteristics and/or intended use of the device or its operating conditions.
Where the acceptance criteria specified in a clause was modified based on the
manufacturer’s risk management.
Where clauses in the IEC 60601/80601 and IEC 61010 series do not provide specific
test methods and acceptance criteria. For example, a clause might indicate
“compliance is checked by inspection of the risk management file and functional tests
if necessary.” In other cases, a clause may provide for revision of the specific test
methods and acceptance criteria based on risk management.

Instances of device showing unexpected behaviors (e.g., display of incorrect values,
display of error messages, device or components need to be restarted, if the device or
components restart unexpectedly).
Instances of device or components being unexpectedly damaged and need replacement
or other intervention to return to normal operation.

This list should capture unexpected events. As an example, an error message would be
unexpected (and therefore would be listed) during EMC testing when a valid input is present;
conversely, the same error message would be expected (and therefore would not be listed)
during a test that feeds an out-of-range input to verify the function of input errors. Any
unexpected behavior is reported even if acceptable per the pass/fail criteria. If the unexpected
behavior is listed as possible in the labeling (e.g., “the device may restart unexpectedly”), it
would still be reported here.
