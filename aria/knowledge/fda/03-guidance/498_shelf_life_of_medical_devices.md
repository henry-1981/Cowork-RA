INTRODUCTION

The potential benefit from the use of a medical device ranges
from relieving minor irritations to correcting life threatening
conditions. If the device design and manufacturing processes are
done adequately, there is a high probability that the device will
perform as desired at the time it is manufactured. However,
there are many naturally occurring factors that can affect how
long after manufacturing the device will maintain the ability to
fully perform the intended function.
Shelf life is the term or period during which a commodity remains
suitable for the intended use. An expiration date is the
termination of shelf life, after which a percentage of the
commodity, e.g., medical devices, may no longer function as
intended. To determine if a particular device requires a shelf
life and assign an expiration date, there are a number of
different parameters that must be considered. The device must be
analyzed to determine if it is susceptible to degradation that
would lead to functional failure and the level of risk that the
failure would present. For some devices, e.g., tongue
depressors, it is not reasonable to assign a shelf life because
of the small likelihood of time-dependant product degradation and
the lack of serious consequences if it did fail to perform as
designed. For certain devices susceptible to degradation that
are intended to treat life-threatening conditions, e.g.,
pacemakers, the failure rate should approach zero within the
labeled shelf life.
The purpose of this document is to:
inform readers of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations and policies relating to shelf life of medical
devices.
discuss the various parameters that determine the length of
time a particular device will remain within acceptable
specifications;
outline the different activities that can be undertaken to
establish the shelf life of a device; and
STABILITY CRITERIA AND VARIABLES

The United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) defines stability as "the
extent to which a product retains, within specified limits, and
throughout its period of storage and use, i.e., its shelf life,
the same properties and characteristics that it possessed at the
time of manufacture." There is no one exhaustive set of criteria
that would apply equally to all medical devices. The USP has a
section <1191> entitled "Stability Considerations in Dispensing
Practicen that supplies general information on this topic. It
includes a list of five sets of criteria for acceptable levels of
stability for drug products as follows on the next page:

1.

5.

chemical,
physical,
microbiological,
therapeutic, and
toxicological.

Although this set of criteria applies specifically to the
evaluation of drug product stability, it is useful as a starting
point in developing a set of criteria to evaluate the stability
of medical devices.
The following outline may be useful in identifying parameters
that could significantly affect the shelf life of a device, even
though all of the criteria will not apply to every device. This
outline is based on the criteria listed above with the addition
of biocompatibility.
Chemical
Degradation: Do any active ingredients or components of the
device degrade over time in a manner which adversely affects
device safety or performance?
Interactions: Do ingredients or components interact to
alter the device? Does the device have interactions among
the various components that cause degradation of the ability
to perform the intended function?
Device and Packaging Interaction: Is there interaction
between the device and package that has undesirable affects?
Radioactive Decay: Does the device contain radioactive
material with a relatively short half-life? Do the
radioactive decay by-products alter the safety or
effectiveness of the device either by themselves or through
further interaction?
Manufacturing: Do any of the manufacturing processes alter
the chemistry of the raw materials, components, or finished
device in a manner which adversely affects device Safety or
performance?
Physical
Physical Characteristics: Does the device have physical
characteristics that vary with time; e.g., appearance,
viscosity, elasticity, tensile strength, burst strength, or
electrical resistance? In some cases, a significant change
in appearance may cause concern to the user even though the
performance of the device is not affected.

2.2

Manufacturing Process: Do the different steps in the
manufacture of the device affect the physical
characteristics of the individual components or the finished
device in a manner which adversely affects device safety or
performance?

2.3

Storage Conditions: Do the storage conditions, e.g.,
temperature, humidity, light, etc., have an affect on the
device in a manner which adversely affects device safety or
performance?

3.

Microbiological

3.1

Sterility: Do sterile devices remain sterile? Maintenance
of sterility is primarily determined by the maintenance of
package and seal integrity.

3.2

Environmental Control: Is an environmental control program
needed during manufacturing or storage to monitor and adjust
the microbial load in or on the device and packaging below
an established tolerance level to prevent adverse
degradation of the product?

3.3

Antimicrobial Effectiveness: Does the device lose the
ability to perform the intended antimicrobial function?

3.4

Integrity:

3.5

Preservative Effectiveness: If the device uses a
preservative system, how long does the preservative system
retain effectiveness within tolerance levels?

4.

Therapeutic: Does the ability of the device to perform the
intended therapeutic or diagnostic function change under
storage or use conditions?

5.

Toxicological: Do device degradation by-products form
during storage or use that produce an adverse toxic effect?

6.

Biocompatibility: Does the biocompatibility of the product
change adversely during storage or use?

Do the device's barrier characteristics change?

There are numerous variables that affect the shelf life of a
medical device. Some of these were discussed in the stability
criteria outline above while additional product dependent
variables are listed below. Although manufacturers may not be
able to control all of the variables, their affect on device
performance can be minimized if properly considered. Each of the
categories listed below should be addressed during the
preproduction estimation of product shelf life and the actual
determination of the shelf life for normal production units. A
written procedure for determining the necessity of a shelf life
and setting the shelf life of a finished medical device should be
used to avoid missing an important aspect and to provide needed

documentation. While developing these written procedures for
determining a shelf life of a device, the stability criteria and
the product specific variables that follow should be assessed.
1.

Storage conditions, e.g.! temperature variations, relative
humidity, ventilation, a n pressure, air-borne
contamination, visible light and other radiation, etc.

2.

The nature of the device and intended use, e.g., medical
gloves are made of latex because of the intended use even
though latex deteriorates with age.

3.

The components used to manufacture the device, e.g., some
devices contain a battery or other components that would
suffer degradation of function with the passage of time.

4.

Method of manufacture, e.g., an in vitro diagnostic device
that is aseptically packaged may have a shorter shelf life
than one that is terminally sterilized.

5.

Packaging, e.g., products that are packaged in different
size containers may each have a different stability shelf
life due to the different ratio of product to package
surface area contact.

6.

Transportation conditions; e.g., vibration, shock,
temperature, humidity, etc.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The concept of shelf life or expiration dating should be
incorporated into product reliability during the process of
developing or improving a device for commercial distribution.
The result is to make sure that, if the device is used in
accordance with the labeling, the device will perform in the
intended manner. Developing an appropriate set of specifications
for the device's characteristics and assigning tolerance values
for these characteristics is essential to the process of shelf
life determination. The events that can cause a device to no
longer perform in the intended manner may originate:
a

internally, e.g., device component interactions or
degradation can cause the device operating characteristics
to fall outside of the prescribed tolerances; or

a

externally, e.g., the shipping or storage conditions can
cause a breakage in the device, a failure of the barrier
properties of a sterile package or degeneration of the
device itself.

device's "shelf lifew should not be confused with a device's
"useful life.'' The useful life of a device is the duration of
actual use or the number and duration of repeat uses before some
change results in the device's inability to achieve its intended
function.

A

Establishing a Shelf Life
The best time to begin considering device shelf life is during
preproduction planning and review while the device is being
formulated before any concrete decisions about the device have
been made and changes can be readily adapted. When design,
material and process factors that influence shelf life are
identified early in the process, redesigning the device
parameters involve the least cost. The materials, components and
packaging that are to be used in the manufacture of the device
may need to be examined for their individual shelf life
characteristics in addition to their effect on the shelf life of
the finished device. Some materials and components may need
special handling to maintain their characteristics within the
desired specifications. Also, the intended use of the device is
an important consideration because this will greatly influence
the tolerance level of shelf life or other failure of the device.
Begin by establishing a target shelf life for the finished device
that allows adequate time for shipping, storage and use.
Evaluate the proposed materials and components used to produce
and package the device. Also, a review of the literature should
be conducted and, where feasible, data for similar devices
collected. The method of manufacturing may need to be tailored
to the materials or different materials may need to be selected
that don't interfere with, and are not affected by, the
manufacturing process. For devices that are found to have good
stability characteristics, larger production runs may be
practical to permit savings in production costs. With all
devices there must be sufficient inventory control to produce,
ship and sell the device within the shelf life period to avoid
the monetary losses associated with recovering an out-of-date
product, reworking a product, or otherwise disposing material to
prevent unnecessary health risks for the consumer. If the shelf
life considerations are implemented properly, they will add to
product quality and actually decrease total production cost.
For devices that are intended to be sterilized, the affect of the
sterilization procedure on both the device and the package must
be considered. It is much easier to rule out a package with
water soluble sealants and select packaging that is compatible
with steam sterilization, if steam sterilization is selected as
the most desirable procedure before a contract with a package
supplier is signed. There are numerous reference works available
that cover packaging technology and various sterilization
technologies.
Procedure for Testing Shelf Life
A written procedure for establishing and monitoring shelf life of
medical devices should include the following:
1.

Organizational units responsible for the various phases of
the shelf life testing program should be included in the
written procedure.

A Finished Device Sampling Plan, including the purpose for
collecting the samples, the number of finished devices to be
collected, frequency of sampling, sample selection criteria,
and lots to be sampled.
Raw Materials, Components and Packaging Evaluation Plan, to
determine if any of these have their own individual shelf
life considerations and how they affect the shelf life of
the finished device. This plan should include obtaining
data from suppliers, obtain new data as appropriate, and
recording data for current and future designs.
A Plan for Storage of Shelf Life Samples, including storage
conditions and the environmental conditions to be
controlled, monitored and recorded. .
Accelerated Aging Parameters, including information that
validates the accelerated system. The results need to be
supported by real time testing of shelf life samples to
confirm the tentative shelf life data collected from the
accelerated tests.
Simulation of Shipping and Handling Stresses Plan, including
vibration tests, temperature extremes challenge, actual
shipping and intentionally mishandling the device to
determine the affect of unusual circumstances.
Follow-up procedures should be included in the written plan
that outline the steps to be taken based upon the results of
the shelf life testing. These procedures must also cover
conspicuously placing the expiration date on appropriate raw
materials in storage and on the finished device to aid in
stock rotation. The results of the shelf life testing may
indicate a need to set limits on the time the device is held
in storage, redesign the packaging of the device, or control
the environmental conditions to minimize the degradation.
REGULATIONS

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is a codification of the
general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by
the Executive Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government.
FDA regulations are grouped in Title 21 of the CFR, and the
regulations that govern medical devices are contained in Parts
800 to 1299. The regulations that apply specifically to shelf
life and expiration dating of medical devices are listed below:
In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation - 21 CFR Part 809
1.

The paragraph below outlines the labeling requirements for
the primary container or wrapper of the retail package.
21 CFR 809.10(a)(5):
For a reagent, appropriate storage
instructions adequate to protect the stability of the
product. When applicable, these instructions shall include

such information as conditions of temperature, light,
humidity, and other pertinent factors. For products
requiring manipulation, such as reconstitution and/or mixing
before use, appropriate storage instructions shall be
provided for the reconstituted or mixed product which is to
be stored in the original container. The basis for such
instructions shall be determined by reliable, meaningful,
and specific test methods such as those described in
211.166 of this chapter.
2.

The paragraph below outlines the information that is to be
included in the package insert or other labeling that
accompanies the product.
21 CFR 809.10(b)(5)(iv):
Appropriate storage instructions

and other pertinent factors. The basis for such
instructions shall be determined by reliable, meaningful,
and specific test methods such as those described in §
211.166 of this chapter.

.

The paragraph below from the drug regulation is referred to
in the three regulations above and specifically requires a
written stability testing program that may include
accelerated shelf life testing, but also indicates that real
time testing must be performed to verify the validity of the
accelerated testing results.

(a) There shall be a written testing
21 CFR 211.166:
program designed to assess the stability characteristics of
drug products. The results of such stability testing shall
be used in determining appropriate storage conditions and
expiration dates. The written program shall include: (1)
Sample size and test intervals based on statistical criteria
for each attribute examined to assure valid estimates of
stability; (2) Storage conditions for samples retained for
testing; (3) Reliable, meaningful, and specific test
methods; ( 4 ) Testing of the drug product in the same

Premarket Approval (PMA)

- 21 CFR Part 814

The PMA requirements concerning shelf life do not stipulate which
devices require a shelf life nor do they stipulate the parameters
that must be considered in establishing a shelf life. It is the
responsibility of the sponsor of the PMA to make the initial
determination of whether their device requires a shelf life and
the device characteristics that will be considered.
1.

The paragraph below outlines the information that is to be
contained in a PMA and requires a section of the PMA to
include the results of nonclinical laboratory studies
including studies of shelf life.
A section c o n t a i n i n g r e s u l t s o f t h e
21 CFR 814.20(b)(6)(i):
n o n c l i n i c a l l a b o r a t o r y s t u d i e s w i t h t h e device i n c l u d i n g

l a b o r a t o r y or animal t e s t s a s a p p r o p r i a t e .

2.

Paragraph (a) below covers the type of changes to a device
that require a supplemental PMA application, and expiration
dating is specifically covered in section (8). It is
advantageous to have a protocol for extending shelf life
approved by FDA in the original PMA, since the change in
product expiration date can be made as soon as the
evaluation is completed instead of having to submit an
additional PMA supplement and awaiting FDA approval.

21 CFR 814.39(a) (8): Extension o f the e x p i r a t i o n d a t e o f
the d e v i c e based on d a t a o b t a i n e d u n d e r a new or r e v i s e d

approved by FDA. I f the p r o t o c o l h a s been approved, the
change s h a l l be r e p o r t e d t o FDA under paragraph ( b ) o f t h i s
section.
3.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has
determined that if a protocol for testing the shelf life of
a device has been approved by FDA in the original PMA or a
PMA supplement, revising the shelf life of the device based
on data collected according to the protocol is a change that
does not affect the device's safety or effectiveness.
Therefore, the change can be made and FDA notified in the
next periodic report.
21 CFR 814.39(b): An a p p l i c a n t may make a change i n a
d e v i c e a f t e r F D A ' s approval o f a PMA f o r a device w i t h o u t
s u b m i t t i n g a PMA supplement i f the change d o e s n o t a f f e c t

s a f e t y or e f f e c t i v e n e s s o f the device.

Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) - 21 CFR Part 820
The GMP requirements outline elements of a quality assurance
system that point to the desired goals, not as an intricate set
of instructions. This approach is beneficial to manufacturers
that may have already implemented quality control procedures
which include shelf life; or who are contemplating a new device
that has unique aspects which would not fit into a l'cookbookv
approach. Some GMP elements that impact on shelf life are
reprinted below.
1.

The paragraph below requires the establishment of a quality
assurance program that would include an expiration date if
appropriate.
21 CFR 820.5: E v e r y f i n i s h e d device m a n u f a c t u r e r s h a l l
p r e p a r e and implement a q u a l i t y a s s u r a n c e program t h a t i s
a p p r o p r i a t e t o the s p e c i f i c device manufactured and meets
the r e q u i r e m e n t s o f t h i s p a r t .

2.

This section requires an environmental control program when
it is necessary to prevent contamination of the device and
to provide proper conditions for the operations performed to
manufacture, store and distribute the device.
21 CFR 820.46: Where e n v i r o n m e n t a l c o n d i t i o n s a t the
m a n u f a c t u r i n g s i t e c o u l d h a v e an a d v e r s e e f f e c t on a

and t o p r o v i d e proper c o n d i t i o n s for e a c h o f t h e o p e r a t i o n s

performed pursuant t o
820.40.
Conditions t o be considered
f o r control are l i g h t i n g , v e n t i l a t i o n , temperature,
humidity, a i r pressure, f i l t r a t i o n , airborne contamination,
and other contamination. Any environmental control system
shall be periodically inspected t o v e r i f y t h a t t h e system i s
properly functioning. Such inspections shall be documented.
3.

4.

Both the manufacturing specifications and the manufacturing
processes must be written and include a formal method to
control changes to these procedures. This GMP requirement
includes an evaluation of any change to the shelf life
characteristics of the device resulting from a specification
or process change.
21 CFR 820.100: W r i t t e n manufacturing s p e c i f i c a t i o n s and
processing procedures shall be established, implemented, and
controlled t o assure t h a t t h e device conforms t o i t s
original design o r any approved changes i n t h a t design.
(also, see subparts F and J)
The paragraph below requires written procedures for
warehouse control and distribution. This could include
controlled storage; e.g., refrigeration, humidity control,
etc., and first-in, first-out shipping, as needed to protect
the device.
21 CFR 820.150: There shall be w r i t t e n procedures for
warehouse control and d i s t r i b u t i o n o f finished devices t o
assure t h a t only those devices approved f o r release are
d i s t r i b u t e d . Where a d e v i c e ' s f i t n e s s f o r use or q u a l i t y
deteriorates over time, there shall be a system t o assure
t h a t t h e o l d e s t approved devices are d i s t r i b u t e d f i r s t .

FDA POLICIES

CDRH has issued various policy and internal guidance documents to
assist CDRH employees and the regulated industry in understanding
what information will be required to satisfy the regulatory
requirements for commercial distribution of a medical device.
The policies that are in effect for the applications submitted to
satisfy these premarketing clearance and distribution
requirements are discussed below.
Premarket Notification (510(k))
There currently is no written policy concerning the determination
of shelf life for a device that is the subject of a 510(k)
submission. However, CDRH has issued an internal guidance
document, 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance #K90-1, to set forth
the procedure to be used by the Office of Device Evaluation (ODE)
and the Office of Compliance and Surveillance (OCS) in reviewing
510(k)s for sterile devices. The 510(k) Sterility Review
Guidance document lists the information that is to be included in
a 510(k) for a sterile device regardless of how the device is
labeled for shelf life. The guidance also acknowledges that
certain sterilization processes have a deleterious effect upon a

nonsterility aspect of the device, e.g., the shelf life of the
sterilized device could vary due to the use of different
sterilization procedures. The 510(k) Sterility Review Guidance
document can be used by medical device manufacturers when
preparing a 510(k) application for a sterile medical device to
make sure the application contains all the information required
by CDRH. An excerpt of #K90-1 follows:

The following information concerning t h e s p e c i f i c a t i o n s related
t o s t e r i l i t y should be collected and reviewed by ODE during t h e
review o f t h e 510 ( k ) f o r a s t e r i l e device:

a description o f t h e method t h a t w i l l be used t o validate
t h e s t e r i l i z a t i o n cycle, but not t h e v a l i d a t i o n data i t s e l f ;

Only t h i s information w i l l be collected regardless o f how t h e
device i s labeled, i . e . , whether it i s labeled s t e r i l e , s t e r i l e
u n t i l opened or damaged, or s t e r i l e u n t i l a stated expiration
date.
We recognize t h a t certain s t e r i l i z a t i o n processes have
d e l e t e r i o u s e f f e c t upon a n o n s t e r i l i t y aspect o f t h e device.
These e f f e c t s have t o be factored i n t o t h e equivalency decision.
The pilot program that is outlined in #K90-1 with the Division of
Cardiovascular Devices (DCD), 510(k) Staff and OCS participating
is still in effect. As of March 1991, there have been no
decisions made regarding expanding the program to the other
divisions, modifying or removing this portion of the guidance or
evaluating the effectiveness of the program.
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
There currently is no written policy concerning the determination
of shelf life for a device that is the subject of an IDE. The
current CDRH policy for shelf life determination for devices
undergoing clinical investigation allows each of the operating
divisions within ODE to determine:
which devices require an established shelf life prior to the
clinical study; and
the methods to be used for validating a shelf life of a
particular device.

Premarket Approval (PMA)
The current policy concerning the determination of shelf life for
a device that is the subject of a PMA is entitled I8Officeof
Device valuation Shelf-Life Policy for PMAs8'issued
March 7 , 1984. This policy for shelf life determination for
devices marketed through the PMA process allows each of the
operating divisions within ODE to determine:
which devices require an established shelf life; and
the adequacy of the proposed methods for validating a shelf
life for a particular device.
The policy also requires that the labeling for the device include
the shelf life and discusses the process for extending the shelf
life by submitting a PMA supplement or following an approved
protocol as previously discussed. The text of the policy
follows:

The ODE Divisions have t h e r e s p o n s i b i l i t y t o determine
whether t h e sponsor must submit data i n support o f s h e l f

The device labeling must include an expiration date based
upon an approved s h e l f l i f e period.

CDRH GUIDANCE
The following documents are issued by CDRH and contain guidance
on the methods to be used in determining a shelf life for various
medical devices. It is important to note that only the first
document is a true guidance document that has undergone the
process of announcement in the Federal Register and response to
comments received, while each of the others is a draft guidance
document.

MICROBIOLOGY REQUIREMENTS FOR ESTABLISHMENT OR EXTENSION OF SHELF
LIFE (EXPIRATION DATE) FOR CONTACT LENSES
Shelf life sterility stability must be demonstrated by one
of the following two tests:
I.

II.

Sterility tests, lenses stored at ambient temperature,
or
Accelerated shelf life sterility study, lenses stored
at elevated temperature to 4S0 C.
Protocols :

I.

Conduct sterility re-check tests according to USP XXI
(Sterility Tests pp. 1156-1160) on 10-20 shelf life
samples which have been stored at ambient temperature,
preferably from several different lots of the
approximate age for which shelf life is requested.
Examples: Six month old lenses stored at ambient
temperature (generally 23-2S°C), with an additional 6
months customarily added to actual shelf life age, are
granted a 12-month (1 year) expiration date if they
have passed the sterility stability testing and the
other (physical/chemical)stability requirements. One
year old lenses, stored at ambient temperature,
similarly are given an 18 month expiration date if they
have passed the sterility stability testing and the
other stability requirements.

II.

Accelerated shelf life studies may be run by storing
samples at higher temperatures for a shorter period of
time and mathematically correlating increased
temperature with time.
a.
b.
c.

Raise temperature a maximum of 20-2S°C above
ambient temperature (45OC.maximum).
The acceleration factor for 10°C rise is 1.8.

these samples.

Example of calculation:
3 month old lenses, stored entire 3 months at 40°C.

'#Testing Guidelines for Class I11 Soft (Hydrophilic) Contact
Lens Solutionsw; Draft - July 15, 1985; issued by DOD within
ODE. Contact Lens Solutions may be stored up to 2 0 ° C above
room temperature to simulate accelerated passage of time.
The guidelines include a mathematical formula for
calculating the simulated age of the subject devices.
Stability of Ph, viscosity, ingredient concentrations,
appearance, preservative concentration, and preservative
effectiveness must be determined along with a test for
sterility. An excerpt from the Guidelines concerning shelf
life follows:

"b. Solution Stability Testinq
The manufacturer must demonstrate the stability of the
solution over time as packaged and stored unde; the proposed
storage conditions.
The size of the container tested should be the same as that
intended to be marketed. Generally, if the solution is
susceptible to chemical oxidation or reduction, the greater
the internal contact of the solution with the container
surface the greater the chance of chemical degradation. The
degradation therefore, is more likely to occur in smaller
containers because the ratio of solution to internal surface
area increases as the container size decreases. For this
reason, it is our policy to approve a solution for marketing
in a container larger than that used for stability testing,
but not a container smaller than tested. FDA believes that
this policy should extend to containers not more than 8
times the size tested provided that containers are
constructed of the same material.
The aging of the solution in the storage container should be
initiated as soon as possible. The stability tests should
include pH, viscosity, preservative concentration, physical
appearance, and concentrations of major ingredients (e g ,
surfactant, enzyme, etc.). Stability results obtained at
the corresponding storage temperature of the solution are
the basis for the establishment of an expiration date.
Accelerated aging up to 50° C may be used as supporting
evidence of stability. As a rule of thumb, every 10" C
increase for the tested temperature will enhance the

..

expiration date by a factor of two compared to the normal
storage temperature e.g., testing solution at 4S°C for 3
months corresponds to the normal storage temperature e.g.,
testing solution at 2S0 C for 12 months (2x2~3). A total of
3 containers of solution randomly selected from 3 lots are
required for shelf life tests of each container size. The
analytical methodology for all tests should be described in
detail. FDA does not restrict the method used; however, all
analytical methods should be scientifically sound. The
following is a suggested protocol:
1.

Number of Samples: 3 containers of solution randomly
selected from 3 lots for each storage temperature and
storage container size.
Parameters monitored: pH; viscosity*; preservative
concentration; physical appearance: (color, clarity,

ingredients: (e.g., enzyme activity, ***
surfactants****)
Test method:
a)
Measure and record pH, viscosity, preservative
concentration, physical appearance, and major
ingredients before study.
b)
Record lot number, beginning date, and storage
temperature for the study.
c) Measure and record pH, viscosity, preservative
concentration, physical appearance, and major
ingredients after study.
d) Record terminating date, lot number and storage
temperature
e) Determine how many parameters have fallen beyond
their specifications and discuss their impact on
safety and effectiveness of the solution.

*** For enzyme tablet or solution.
**** Not applicable for solution without surfactants.
Shelf 1ife Testinq Reuuirements (Second Microbiolocrv
Requirement):
1.

Shelf Life Sterility

The manufacturer must demonstrate that the contact lens
solution (s) will remain sterile for the recommended shelf
life as packaged. This applies to all solutions that will be
labeled as sterile.
To fulfill this requirement, the manufacturer should test 1020 samples (of one type) that have been packaged and stored
for the proposed shelf life. Samples from two or three lots
should be tested for sterility using methods such as USP XX
sterility testing. A separate shelf life sterility test must
be performed for each type of lens solution manufactured.
2.

Shelf Life Preservative Effectiveness

For any preserved solution, the preservative effectiveness
must be demonstrated for the proposed shelf life. Samples
from two or three lots to total a minimum of ten samples are
tested according to the FDA modification of the USP
Preservative Effectiveness Test.
3.

Extension of Shelf Life protocol- see Appendix K
APPENDIX K
Protocol for Shelf Life Extensions

Microbiolocrical Reuuirements
Shelf life sterility stability must be demonstrated. Also
for a preserved solution, the shelf life stability of the
preservative must be demonstrated.
A.

Shelf life sterility stability must be demonstrated by
one of the following two tests:
I.

Sterility tests, solutions stored at ambient
temperature.
or

II. Accelerated shelf life sterility study, solutions
stored at elevated temperature to 50° C.
B.

For preserved solutions, the Preservative Effectiveness
Test is requires in addition to the sterility test.
I. Preservative Effectiveness Test, solutions stored at
ambient temperature.

or
I I . Accelerated preservative Effectiveness study,

solutions stored at elevated temperature to 50° C.
Protocols:
A.

Sterility Stability Tests
I.

Conduct sterility re-check tests according to USP XXI
(Sterility Tests pages 1156-1160) on at least 20
shelf life samples which have been stored at ambient
temperature. Samples may be of different sizes and
should be from several different lots of the
approximate age for which shelf life is requested.
Each sample should be properly identified in the raw
data as to lot number and package size.

Example: Six month old solutions, stored at ambient
temperature, with an additional 6 months customarily
added to the actual shelf life age, are granted a 12
month (1 year) expiration date if they have passed the
sterility stability testing and the other stability
requirements.
I I . Accelerated shelf life studies may be run by storing

samples at higher temperatures for a shorter period
of time and mathematically correlating increased
temperature with time.
a) Raise temperature a maximum of 20-25O C above
ambient temperature (50 c maximum) .
b) For microbiology, the acceleration factor for
each 10 O C rise is 1.8. *
c) sterility tests according to USP XXI are run on
these samples.
Example of calculation:
6 month old solution stored at 45O C
1. Age of solution = 6 months
2. Ambient temperature = 25O C
3. Q,, = 1.8
4.
Acceleration factor (based on a 20° C temperature
difference): (1.8)' = 3.24
5. Length of time at elevated temperature = 6 months
6. Estimation of shelf life
a) time at elevated temperature x acceleration factor =
accelerated age 6 months x 3.24 = 19.44 months
b) accelerated age + actual age = shelf life
+ 6
= 25.44 months
19.44
approximately 2 years
Note:
The customary additional 6 months is not given for
accelerated shelf life.

B.

Preservative Efficacy Test
For shelf life stability any preserved solution must pass
the FDA modification of the USP Preservative
Effectiveness Test against all five of the challenge
organisms. Refer to page 53 of the FDA Guidelines for
Testing Contact Lens Solutions; also to USP XXI, page
1151

"GuiBelines for Intraocular Lensesw; Draft - June 9, 1980;
issued by DOD within ODE. The Intraocular Lenses guidelines
allow accelerated aging but do not give parameters to be used
in designing an accelerated aging program and also state that
room temperature storage is usually the most valuable.
Stability of the mechanical and optical properties are to be
measured against the original measurements along with a test
for sterility.
#Id. Storage Stability
The storage stability of the intraocular lens is an
important factor in the overall investigation of a new
lens material. A study of the aging of the lenses and
their containers must be initiated as soon as possible.
These stability tests made at regular intervals should
include all parameters cited previously. [The parameters
are as follow: 1. permeability (small molecules,
proteins, oxygen); 2. chemical and physical stability
(ultra-violet, boiling water, steam, ethylene oxide,
radiation, caustic solution); 3. light transmittance
(white light); 4. extractables (if none, state
methodology); 5. physical property profile (elongation,
deformation, tensile strength); 6. average molecular
weight, molecular weight distribution; 7 . infrared
spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy; 8. nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy; 9. melting point, glass
transition temperature; 10. solubility in water, saline,
selected solvents; 11. refractive index; 12. elemental
analysis of metals and nonmetals; 13. surface microscopy
(scanning electron microscopy); 14. biocompatibility
(i.e. tissue culture); and 15. heat deformation
temperature]. Special importance should be given to
monitoring change in mechanical and optical properties.
Accelerated aging may be used as supporting evidence of
stability. Stability results obtained at the storage
temperature of the device are the basis for the
establishment of an expiration date. In the case of
packaged lenses, room temperature is usually the most
valuable. Other temperatures, low and elevated (below
freezing and approximately 50 degrees C.) are helpful for
the determination of product stability. Some plastics
may be susceptible to temperature variations. Freezing
of the aqueous phase may seriously alter the structure of
the lens.

Medical Gloves: Two separate CDRH documents concerning
medical gloves contain references to shelf life. Excerpt
from these are included in the following subsections.

6.1 "United States FDA Pre-Marketing and Labeling Requirements
for Medical Glovess~;March 1990; issued by DSMA within the

Office of Training and Assistance. This document describes
the activities that must be completed to import and market
medical gloves in the US. In the section that discusses the
labeling requirements of medical gloves is stated " F i n a l l y ,

6.2 "Guidance for the Content and Organization of a Premarket
Notification [510(k)] for Surgeon's Glovesw; August 1989;
issued by the General and Plastic Surgical Devices Branch,
Division of Surgical and Rehabilitation Devices within ODE.
This document details the information that should be included
in a 510(k) for surgeon's gloves and states that "If a s h e l f
l i f e i s t o be i n c l u d e d on t h e l a b e l o f t h e f i n i s h e d g l o v e s ,
t h e a p p l i c a n t must p r o v i d e d a t a s u p p o r t i n g t h e proposed
shelf l i f e . "
Additionally, DCD within ODE, has begun drafting a guidance
document for determining the shelf life of products that are the
subject of applications reviewed in DCD. This guidance document
has not yet been issued in final or draft form. Their current
policy is to determine if a shelf life is appropriate on a caseby-case basis for PMA products (class I11 devices). DCD is also
participating in the pilot program that is outlined in the 510(k)
Sterility Review Guidance mentioned previously.
The Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance (DSMA) was
established to meet the requirements of the Medical Device
Amendments that FDA establish an office to provide technical and
other nonfinancial assistance to medical device manufacturers.
The guidelines and other documents referenced throughout this
paper are available from DSMA by calling 800-638-2041 (or
301-443-6597 in Maryland). DSMA is also ready to answer requests
for other information or guidance concerning the obligations of
medical device establishments.
