On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the effective date of the final rule. FDA encourages
manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the relevant regulatory
requirements.

Remanufacturing of Medical Devices
Guidance for Industry, Entities That
Perform Servicing or
Remanufacturing, and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

Medical devices encompass a vast array of products with different technologies, product
lifecycles, complexity, intended users, and environments of use. Many devices are reusable and
need preventive maintenance and repair during their useful life. For these devices, proper
servicing is critical to their continued safe and effective use. However, there is a lack of clarity
regarding the distinction between “servicing” and “remanufacturing” of a device. Most notably,
remanufacturing has implications for the regulatory responsibilities of entities performing these
activities. 1
This guidance is intended to help clarify whether activities performed on devices are likely
“remanufacturing.” Such clarification is intended to help provide consistency and better
understanding of applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. This guidance also includes
recommendations for information that should be included in labeling to help assure the continued
quality, safety, and effectiveness of devices that are intended to be serviced over their useful life.
In developing this guidance, FDA considered objective evidence and information learned from
the Agency’s activities discussed in this guidance.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 2 For more information regarding use of
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled

Servicing) discusses medical device servicing in more detail, available at https://www.fda.gov/media/

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
FDA has been working to gain additional perspectives on the distinction between “servicing”
and “remanufacturing” and has undertaken several efforts to help promote clarity. FDA opened a
docket for public comment 5 and held a public workshop in 2016. 6 FDA received comments,
complaints, and adverse event reports alleging inadequate servicing, which were discussed and
analyzed in the FDA Report on Device Servicing, 7 published by FDA in May 2018 in
accordance with section 710 of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA) (Pub. L. 11552). 8
In the FDA Report on Device Servicing, FDA concluded that a majority of the comments,
complaints, and adverse event reports received by the Agency that referred to inadequate
“servicing” causing or contributing to adverse events and deaths actually pertained to
“remanufacturing.” This conclusion was based on FDA’s evaluation of the available objective
evidence 9 related to the quality, safety, and effectiveness of medical device servicing.
In 2018, FDA released a white paper, opened a public docket, and held a public workshop to
facilitate public discussion on the distinction between servicing and remanufacturing. 10 The
white paper described FDA’s initial thoughts about guiding principles, provided a flowchart with
accompanying text for understanding the distinctions, and contained a complementary approach
for software, as well as considerations for labeling, and examples utilizing the flowchart. FDA

also included targeted questions throughout the white paper for which the Agency sought
feedback. FDA considered the comments from the public docket and discussions during the
public workshop, as well as comments from the public docket on the draft guidance, in
developing this guidance.
The distinction between “remanufacturing” and “servicing” is important to understand.
Remanufacturing is the processing, conditioning, renovating, repackaging, restoring, or any other
act done to a finished device that significantly changes the finished device’s performance or
safety specifications, or intended use. 11 For the purposes of this guidance, FDA refers to the
original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) legally marketed finished device as the “legally
marketed device.”
Servicing is the repair and/or preventive or routine maintenance of one or more parts in a
finished device, after distribution, for purposes of returning it to the safety and performance
specifications established by the OEM and to meet its original intended use. 12 As described in
the FDA Report on Device Servicing, FDA’s authority to regulate the servicing of medical
devices by any entity is grounded in the Agency’s authority to regulate medical devices and
radiation-emitting electronic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act.
Irrespective of an entity’s self-identified designation as a “servicer” or “remanufacturer,” FDA
focuses on the specific activities an entity performs on a particular device. 13 The determination of
whether the activities an entity performs are remanufacturing affects the applicability and
enforcement of regulatory requirements under the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations.
FDA has consistently enforced requirements under the FD&C Act and its implementing
regulations on entities engaged in remanufacturing, including but not limited to registration and
listing, adverse event reporting, the Quality System (QS) regulation, and marketing submissions.

III. Scope
Because of the apparent confusion between servicing and remanufacturing, FDA committed in
the FDA Report on Device Servicing to issue guidance that clarifies the difference between
servicing and remanufacturing activities. To assist with this clarification, FDA focuses this
guidance on those activities that are likely remanufacturing.
This guidance addresses activities performed on devices that are intended to be reused and
maintained. This guidance discusses whether activities performed by OEMs and third parties on
such devices are likely remanufacturing. This guidance is not intended to adopt significant policy
changes, but to clarify FDA’s current thinking on applicable definitions, and clarify, not change,
See 21 CFR 820.3(w).
For purposes of the report that Congress required FDA to post on its website, section 710(c) of FDARA (Pub. L.
115-52, 131 Stat. 1068) defines servicing to include, “with respect to a device, refurbishing, reconditioning,
rebuilding, remarketing, repairing, remanufacturing, or other servicing of the device.” However, for purposes other
than that report, FDA does not consider remanufacturing to be a type of servicing.
13
The designations of servicer and remanufacturer are not mutually exclusive. An entity may meet multiple
definitions based on the activities it performs on one or multiple devices. For example, an entity could be both an
OEM and a third party servicer by manufacturing their own device, and servicing another entity's device,
respectively.

the regulatory requirements applicable to remanufacturers. The concepts in this guidance are also
not intended to alter or supersede existing regulations and policies related to the regulatory
threshold for submitting a marketing submission for a device.
The products included within the scope of this guidance are devices as defined in section 201(h)
of the FD&C Act, including software and electronic products that meet the definition of a device.
In general, the concepts discussed in this guidance are meant to apply to all reusable devices,
irrespective of their classification into class I, II, or III, including those subject to premarket
approval. This guidance is not intended to address reprocessed single-use devices.

IV. Definitions
The following definitions apply for the purposes of this guidance. 14
• Intended use: The general purpose of the device or its function, which encompasses
the indications for use. 15
• Manufacturers (Manufacturers, OEMs, or Remanufacturers): A manufacturer is any
person who designs, manufactures, fabricates, assembles, or processes a finished
device. 16 A remanufacturer is any person who processes, conditions, renovates,
repackages, restores, or does any other act to a finished device that significantly
changes the finished device’s performance or safety specifications, or intended use. 17
Remanufacturers are considered to be manufacturers. 18 For electronic products, a
manufacturer is any person engaged in the business of manufacturing, assembling, or
importing electronic products. 19
• Performance specifications: The performance characteristics of a device established
by the OEM for the device to perform as intended, including those listed in device
labeling or in finished product release specifications. Some examples include
measurement accuracy, output accuracy, energy output level, and stability criteria.
• Recondition/Refurbish/Rebuild: Restores a medical device to the OEM’s original
specifications comparable to when new. The device is brought to current
specifications if the change(s) made to the device do not significantly change the
finished device’s performance or safety specifications, or intended use. These
activities include repair of components, installation of OEM provided updates and
upgrades, and replacement of worn parts.

Consistent with FDA’s current thinking in this context, some of the definitions that appeared in the FDA Report
on Device Servicing have been modified to reflect updated understanding and practice.

V.

Remanufacture: Process, condition, renovate, repackage, restore, or any other act
done to a finished device that significantly changes the finished device’s performance
or safety specifications, or intended use. 20, 21
Repair: A type of servicing that returns a component to the OEM’s original
specifications, including replacing non-working components or parts outside of
preventive or routine maintenance.
Reprocess: With respect to reusable devices, means validated processes used to
render a medical device, which has been previously used or contaminated, fit for a
subsequent single use on a patient. These processes are designed to remove soil and
contaminants by cleaning and to inactivate microorganisms by disinfection or
sterilization. 22
Safety specifications: The safety characteristics of a device established by the OEM
for the safe use of the device, including those incorporated into the device design and
finished product release specifications, generally including the device’s compensating
controls and risk mitigations. Some examples include alarms, sensors, and locking or
fail-safe mechanisms.
Service: Repair and/or preventive or routine maintenance of one or more parts in a
finished device, after distribution, for purposes of returning it to the safety and
performance specifications established by the OEM and to meet its original intended
use. Servicing excludes activities that significantly change the finished device’s
safety or performance specifications, or intended use.
Third party servicers and Independent Service Organizations (ISOs): Entities, other
than the OEM or healthcare delivery organizations, 23 that maintain, restore, refurbish,
repair, or service a finished device after distribution, for purposes of returning it to the
OEM’s original safety and performance specifications and to meet its original
intended use.

Guiding Principles

As outlined above, remanufacturing is the processing, conditioning, renovating, repackaging,
restoring, or any other act done to a finished device that significantly changes the finished
device’s performance or safety specifications, or intended use. 24 In using this guidance to help
determine whether activities are remanufacturing, FDA recommends application of the following
guiding principles:
21 CFR 820.3(w).
FDA acknowledges the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) defines the term “remanufacturer” and
similar terms in their 2012 Publication 4356 entitled “Remanufactured Goods: An Overview of the U.S. and Global
Industries, Markets, and Trade.” The definition in this guidance is based in FDA’s regulation. USITC’s definition is
more analogous to this guidance’s definition of “recondition/refurbish/rebuild.” Additional information on the
USITC’s definition of “remanufacture” terms can be found here:
https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4356.pdf.

See the FDA guidance “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and
Labeling,” available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/reprocessingmedical-devices-health-care-settings-validation-methods-and-labeling.

1. Assess whether there is a change to the intended use – Given that the purpose of
servicing is to return the device to the safety and performance specifications established
by the OEM and to meet its original intended use, any change to the intended use should
be evaluated to determine whether the activity is remanufacturing. 25
2. Determine whether the activities, individually and cumulatively, significantly
change the safety or performance specifications of a finished device –
Remanufacturing includes activities that significantly change the performance or safety
specifications of the finished device. FDA considers “change” to also include activities
that enhance the device. Activities that are not intended to significantly change the
performance or safety specifications, however, should still be evaluated to determine
whether they do significantly change the finished device’s performance and safety
specifications. Multiple changes, when considered cumulatively, may significantly
change the performance or safety specifications of the legally marketed device and
should be evaluated.
3. Evaluate whether any changes to a device require a new marketing submission –
Regardless of whether changes made to a legally marketed device are remanufacturing,
such changes should be evaluated to determine whether a premarket notification (510(k)),
premarket approval application, or other marketing submission is required pursuant to the
FD&C Act and applicable regulations, 26 and entities should consult relevant guidance for
FDA’s recommendations on the topic. 27 Changes that meet the definition of
remanufacturing can trigger the need for a marketing submission, depending on the riskbased classification of the device. For example, a change to a device subject to 510(k)
and/or special controls should be considered with respect to the criteria in 21 CFR 807.81
describing when a new 510(k) submission is required and any special controls under the
relevant device classification regulation, respectively.
4. Assess component/part/material 28 dimensional and performance specifications –
Assessment of changes to dimensional and performance specifications can inform
whether the activity performed is remanufacturing. The impact of
component/part/material changes can be evaluated by comparison to the OEM
components/parts/materials specifications and/or through verification and validation
25
Consistent with Guiding Principle 3, any changes that affect or change intended use should be considered
pursuant to applicable regulations.
26
See, e.g., 21 CFR 807.81 and 21 CFR 814 subpart B.
27
See, e.g., “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device,” available at

Decision-Making Process,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/modifications-devices-subject-premarket-approval-pma-pma-supplement-decision-making-process for
FDA’s current thinking on these topics.
28
21 CFR 820.3(c) defines a component as any raw material, substance, piece, part, software, firmware, labeling, or
assembly which is intended to be included as part of the finished, packaged, and labeled device. In this guidance,
“component” and “component/part/material” are used interchangeably. Due to the nature of software and firmware,
consideration of whether activities involving them may be remanufacturing is discussed separately from
components/parts/materials.

testing. Deviations in component/part/material specifications from the OEM’s legally
marketed device may result in significant changes to the device’s performance or safety
specifications, and may necessitate closer evaluation, such as conducting an engineering
analysis, verification and/or validation testing, or a risk-based assessment, and
consideration of the regulatory criteria describing when a new marketing submission is
required.
5. Employ a risk-based approach – Entities should employ a risk-based approach, such as
one that conforms to or is consistent with ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of
risk management to medical devices 29 when assessing whether an activity they perform is
remanufacturing. For the purposes of this guidance, a risk-based assessment is based on
the combination of multiple risk concepts that are important for managing the risks of
medical devices. Risk estimation, risk acceptability, risk control, benefit/risk analysis,
assessment of hazards and hazardous situations, and overall risk evaluation are all
concepts that can be applied during these activities. The concept of risk, as defined in
ISO 14971, is the combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity
of that harm. Although the risk terminology used in this document is primarily derived
from ISO 14971, we recognize that an individual entity’s terminology may differ.
For the purposes of this guidance, a new risk is a new hazard or hazardous situation that
did not previously exist for the legally marketed device. An activity performed on a
device may introduce a new risk, or may modify the probability or severity of a known
risk. An activity is likely remanufacturing when a risk-based assessment identifies any
new risks or significant modifications to known risks, as these are likely to significantly
change performance or safety specifications, in comparison to the legally marketed
device.
6. Adequately document decision-making – When deciding whether an activity is
remanufacturing or not, FDA recommends that the rationale for the determination be
documented in sufficient detail, including reference to supporting verification and
validation data, to explain how the determination was made. Specifically, such
documentation should specify why the activities performed on the device do or do not
significantly change the performance or safety specifications, or intended use of the
legally marketed device. If an entity previously determined that an activity was not
remanufacturing, and the same entity is performing the identical activity on the same
version or model of a device, such documentation could reference previous
determinations. Effective documentation can facilitate sound decision-making and
evaluation of relevant factors and information such as adverse events, and provide
important information for an entity to help justify their decision-making in the event that
an inspection is conducted by FDA or this information is otherwise requested.

In this context, ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization, an international standards
development organization. See http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html for more information.

VI. Relevant Considerations to Determine if Activities are
Remanufacturing
What is a significant change to device performance or
safety specifications?
Remanufacturing is the processing, conditioning, renovating, repackaging, restoring, or any other
act done to a finished device that significantly changes the finished device’s performance or
safety specifications, or intended use. 30 For purposes of this guidance, FDA generally considers a
significant change to device performance or safety specifications to be one that, based on
verification and validation testing and/or a risk-based assessment, results in a finished device that
is outside the OEM’s performance or safety specifications or introduces new risks or
significantly modifies existing risks. For example, a change to a material that contacts the human
body and impacts the adequacy of the OEM’s validated reprocessing instructions is likely a
significant change to device performance or safety specifications, and therefore, is likely
remanufacturing. Conversely, replacing an internal capacitor with one that has the same
specifications (e.g., same capacitance, working voltage, temperature range, materials, and
footprint) is not likely to significantly change device performance or safety specifications and
therefore, is likely not remanufacturing. However, many activities, such as modifying the design
of a printed circuit board or temporarily breaking a seal to replace a component, may result in a
significant change to safety and performance specifications and should be carefully assessed to
determine if those changes are significant.
FDA has identified certain types of activities that, in general, the Agency believes significantly
change the legally marketed device’s performance or safety specifications:
• Changes to the device’s sterilization methods;
• Changes to the device’s reprocessing instructions; 31 and
• Changes to the device’s control mechanism, 32 operating principle, 33 or energy type. 34
As discussed below in Section VI.B, activities that result in these changes are likely
remanufacturing, and evaluation using the flowchart and accompanying text is not
recommended.

21 CFR 820.3(w).
See the FDA guidance “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and
Labeling,” available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/reprocessingmedical-devices-health-care-settings-validation-methods-and-labeling.
32
For purposes of this guidance, a control mechanism is the manner by which the actions of a device are directed.
One example of a control mechanism change would be a change from analog to digital control of a medical device.
33
For purposes of this guidance, an operating principle is the mode of operation or mechanism of action through
which a device fulfills (or achieves) its intended use. An example of a new operating principle would be changing
the image reconstruction algorithm used in a computed tomography x-ray system from simple back projection to a
new, more radiation-efficient method.
34
For purposes of this guidance, energy type is the type of power input to or output from the device. These changes
include both energy output and input changes. A change from emitting microwave energy to radiofrequency (RF)
energy would be an example of an energy output change; this type of change would likely be part of a significant
redesign.

Determining whether activities are “remanufacturing”
As discussed in Guiding Principle 1, FDA recommends that entities evaluate if their activities
change the intended use of the device. Significant changes to a device’s intended use 35 (e.g.,
changing a single-use device to become reusable, changing the anatomical location of use) are
likely remanufacturing. 36
For activities involving components/parts/materials, FDA recommends the use of the flowchart
in this section (Figure 1) to help entities determine if their activities are likely remanufacturing.
Although the servicing and remanufacturing definitions and guiding principles in this document
apply to software, the approach described in this section should not be applied to software due to
its nature and the methods used to evaluate changes to software. Instead, see Section VII for a
discussion of changes involving software.
Figure 1 is a visual aid intended to be used in conjunction with the accompanying text in this
section and guiding principles. Figure 1 and the accompanying text in this section are intended to
address the most common and important considerations that should be evaluated, but are not
meant to capture all potential considerations that an entity should evaluate to determine if their
activities are likely remanufacturing. Rather, they are intended to guide entities in determining
when they should further evaluate such activities by conducting testing or a risk-based
assessment. Entities should consult Figure 1 and the accompanying text after determining that
there is no significant change to intended use.
In Figure 1, each change (e.g., physical change or change to safety control) should first be
assessed individually to determine whether the activity is likely remanufacturing. After
evaluating each change individually, the cumulative effects should be assessed to determine
whether the activities resulting in the collective changes are likely remanufacturing. The legally
marketed device should be used as the basis for comparison for individual changes and the
cumulative effects of such changes. When there are no deviations in the component/part/material
dimensional, performance, or safety specifications from the legally marketed device’s
counterpart, and there are no new or modified risks or change in the performance or safety
specifications of the legally marketed device, there would likely be no significant changes to the
legally marketed device, in the absence of other changes such as changes involving software.
OEMs may contract with external entities to perform activities on their behalf. For OEMs
performing activities on their own devices, and for entities performing activities on behalf of, or
otherwise explicitly authorized by, the OEM that returns the legally marketed device to its
original performance and safety specifications and intended use, FDA does not recommend
evaluating their activities using Figure 1. Evaluation of the activity, consistent with Guiding
Principle 3, must be performed by the OEM through their quality management system and the

21 CFR 820.3(w).

determination should be adequately documented (see 21 CFR 807.81 and 21 CFR part 820 37, 38).
The responsibility for meeting applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and for having
objective evidence of meeting these requirements may not be delegated by the OEM even though
the actual work may be delegated.
Entities performing activities on devices should make a determination about whether each
activity and the cumulative effects of such activities are remanufacturing and document their
rationale. 39 When deciding whether an activity is remanufacturing, entities should document the
decision-making process and the basis for the determination. The documentation should be
prepared in a way that clearly describes the rationale underlying the conclusion, such that it
could be understood by an FDA investigator or a third party. For this, we recommend that the
documentation include, at a minimum, the following: 40
• Product name (including model number and serial number, if applicable);
• Date of activities performed, assessment, and determination;
• Description of device;
• Description of activities to be performed, including documentation of
components/parts/materials involved;
• Determination of whether the activity is remanufacturing (we recommend using the
applicable sections of this guidance);
• Reference to related documents supporting the decision-making process; and
• Signature(s).
FDA has included examples of such documentation in Appendix B.

21 CFR part 820 allows for manufacturers to implement a quality system that complies with requirements
applicable to the operations in which it is engaged including design controls, purchasing controls, production
controls, process controls, installation, or servicing as it pertains to whether an activity is remanufacturing.
38
On February 2, 2024, FDA issued a final rule amending the device QS regulation, 21 CFR part 820, to align more
closely with international consensus standards for devices (89 FR 7496, available at
https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-01709). This final rule will take effect on February 2, 2026. Once in effect,
this rule will withdraw the majority of the current requirements in part 820 and instead incorporate by reference the
2016 edition of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485, Medical devices – Quality
management systems – Requirements for regulatory purposes, in part 820. As stated in the final rule, the
requirements in ISO 13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the current Part
820, providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to consistently
manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with the FD&C Act. When the final
rule takes effect, FDA will also update the references to provisions in 21 CFR part 820 in this guidance to be
consistent with that rule.
39
In addition, FDA notes that under 21 CFR Part 820, manufacturers are required to maintain certain records as
applicable, e.g., service reports.
40
Consistent with Guiding Principle 6, if the identical activity was previously determined to not be remanufacturing,
is being performed by the same entity, and is being performed on the same version or model of a device, such
documentation could reference previous determinations.

A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or
indirectly contacts body tissue?

Consistent with FDA’s guidance documents on reprocessing 41 and biocompatibility, 42
respectively, entities should assess how their activities may affect validated reprocessing
instructions or cause an unacceptable adverse biological response resulting from device contact
with the human body, including both patient and healthcare provider tissue.
Direct contact is when a component/part/material comes into physical contact with body tissue,
such as catheter tubing used on a patient. A component/part/material has indirect contact when a
fluid or gas passes through it prior to the fluid or gas coming into physical contact with body
tissue (i.e., the device or component/part/material itself does not physically contact body tissue).
For example, materials in a catheter hub (the part of the catheter that is external to the patient)
indirectly contact the patient when fluids or drugs are infused through the hub and into the
patient. Both direct and indirect contact with the patient or user of the device should be
considered when answering A1.
If there is any addition, removal, or change to a component/part/material on the finished device,
and that component/part/material directly or indirectly contacts body tissue, the answer to A1
should be “yes.” This includes exposing a previously unexposed component/part/material to
direct or indirect contact with body tissue. Additionally, if there is any change in material type,
formulation, or chemical composition for a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue, the answer to A1 should be “yes.” If the entity is uncertain how to respond
to A1, the answer should be “yes.” A “yes” answer to A1 does not necessarily mean that the
activity is remanufacturing. Rather, when an entity makes such changes, it should analyze the
impact of the change on the device’s performance and safety specifications using the text in
A1.1.
If no component/part/material added, removed, or changed directly or indirectly contacts body
tissue, the answer should be “no” and then proceed to A2.

A1.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety
specifications?
If the activity adds, removes, or changes a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue (as mentioned above, this includes an activity that exposes a previously
unexposed component/part/material to body tissue either directly or indirectly), a risk-based
assessment should be conducted. The assessment should be conducted to determine whether
there is a significant change to the biocompatibility or the validated reprocessing instructions of
the legally marketed device. An activity that results in such change may be considered
remanufacturing.
See the FDA guidance “Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and
Labeling,” available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/reprocessingmedical-devices-health-care-settings-validation-methods-and-labeling.

Depending on the magnitude of the change and the nature of the component/part/material,
reprocessing validation and a comprehensive biocompatibility risk assessment or testing may be
necessary. Entities should incorporate factors that affect the reprocessing and biocompatibility of
a device in their risk-based assessment and testing where appropriate. These factors may include
the materials of construction, the processing of the materials, methods (including the sterilization
process), any residuals from aids used during the process, and intended use life of the legally
marketed device. Activities that impact the adequacy of the legally marketed device’s validated
reprocessing instructions are likely remanufacturing.
If the answer to A1.1 is “yes,” then the activity would likely be remanufacturing. If the answer to
A1.1 is “no,” then proceed to A2.

A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or
performance specifications of a component/part/material?
Add or remove component/part/material? If there is any addition of a component/part/material to
a legally marketed device that was not originally part of the legally marketed device, the answer
to A2 should be “yes.” Examples include adding an adhesive to mend a break in the device or
fasteners to secure a component/part/material. If there is any removal of a
component/part/material to a legally marketed device that is not replaced in the legally marketed
device, the answer to A2 should be “yes.” Examples include removing a fastener or barrier
without replacement. Add or remove component/part/material also includes replacing an OEM
component/part/material with the same OEM component/part/material or a non-OEM
component/part/material. 43
Change the dimensional or performance specifications of a component/part/material? If there is
any change to or replacement of a component/part/material of the legally marketed device, which
affects the component/part/material’s dimensional or performance specifications, the answer to
A2 should be “yes.” Examples include changes to the inner or outer diameter of a tube or shaft,
architecture or layout of printed circuit boards, and range of motion or articulation of
components/parts/materials.
If a component/part/material is not being added or removed, or the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material are not being changed, the answer to A2 should be
“no.” If uncertain, the answer to A2 should be “yes.”
A “yes” answer to A2 does not necessarily mean that the activity is remanufacturing. Rather,
when an entity makes such changes, it should analyze the impact of the change on the device’s
performance and safety specifications using the text in A2.1. If the answer to A2 is “no,” then
proceed to A3.

As discussed above in Section VI.B., FDA does not recommend evaluation with Figure 1 when an activity is
performed on behalf of, or otherwise explicitly authorized by, the OEM and the activity returns the legally marketed
device to its original performance and safety specifications, and intended use. FDA believes such activities would
likely not be remanufacturing, and the determination should be adequately documented.

43

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety
specifications?
Does the added or removed component/part/material significantly change the device
performance or safety specifications? When evaluating whether the addition or removal of a
component/part/material significantly changes the device’s performance or safety specifications,
the entity should consider the intended use life of the legally marketed device. For instance,
many reusable devices are reprocessed numerous times within their intended use life. Applicable
considerations should include an assessment of whether the added component will withstand
repeated reprocessing cycles within the device’s intended use life or whether the removed
component exposes previously unexposed components that will withstand repeated reprocessing
cycles within the device’s intended use life. Such an assessment can include verification and
validation testing or a risk-based assessment describing why such testing is not warranted. If the
reusable device will not be able to withstand repeated reprocessing cycles within its intended use
life, the addition or removal of the component/part/material may significantly change the legally
marketed device’s performance or safety specifications.
Do the changed dimensional specifications of the component/part/material significantly change
the device performance or safety specifications? In determining whether an activity is
remanufacturing for these types of changes, the entity should consider not only the magnitude of
the dimensional specification change, but the criticality of the modified dimension. The entity
should consider whether dimensional specifications meet a minimum or maximum specification
(e.g., outer diameter cannot exceed 3.0 mm) or are within a range of acceptable tolerance
specifications. If dimensional specifications are within the acceptable range, the answer to A2.1
would likely be “no;” however, for changes that are outside the acceptable range of dimensional
specifications, the answer to A2.1 would likely be “yes.”
Do the changed performance specifications of the component/part/material significantly change
the device performance or safety specifications? When evaluating if there is a significant change
to performance or safety specifications, the entity should consider whether performance outputs
meet a minimum and/or maximum specification (e.g., temperature within chamber cannot exceed
25 ºC and pressure cannot be less than 150 kPa) or are within a range of acceptable tolerance
specifications (e.g., pump flowrate must be between 2 and 20 mL/hour; sound of device must not
exceed 65 decibels while in operation). If performance specifications are within the acceptable
range, the answer to A2.1 would likely be “no;” however, for changes that result in performance
specifications that are outside the acceptable range, the answer to A2.1 would likely be “yes.”
If the answer to A2.1 is “yes,” then the change would likely be remanufacturing. If the answer to
A2.1 is “no,” then proceed to A3.

A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or
safety specifications?
The entity should perform a risk-based assessment to identify new or modified risks or a change
in the performance or safety specifications of the legally marketed device based on the activity
being performed on the device. Both the individual change and cumulative changes performed
on the legally marketed device should be considered. While individual changes may not
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
significantly change the legally marketed device’s performance or safety specifications, the
cumulative changes may do so. The extent of the assessment should be appropriate considering
the nature and extent of the activities being performed.
Is there a new or modified risk? A risk-based assessment can identify whether there are new
risks or modified existing risks in comparison to the legally marketed device. If a new risk is
created or an existing risk has been modified based on the activity being performed, the answer
to A3 should be “yes,” and this activity should be evaluated using the text in A3.1. If uncertain,
the answer to A3 should be “yes.” Examples include risk of electrostatic shock, device short
circuit, or unexpected device movement.
Is there a change in the performance or safety specifications? A risk-based assessment can also
identify whether there is a change in performance or safety specifications. This assessment
should consider, for example, how a change could impact a device’s continued conformity to a
voluntary consensus standard or compliance with a regulation, such as special controls identified
in a device classification regulation. This assessment should also consider whether activities that
break a seal or barrier can adequately return the device to its legally marketed performance and
safety specifications, including its ability to be adequately reprocessed. If a change to
performance or safety specifications has been identified, the answer to A3 should be “yes.” If
uncertain, the answer to A3 should be “yes.”
When an entity makes a change that has a “yes” answer to A3, the entity should analyze the
impact of the change on the device’s performance and safety specifications using the text in
A3.1. If the answer to A3 is “no,” then the change is likely not remanufacturing.

A3.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety
specifications?
If new or modified risks were identified, the entity should evaluate whether they significantly
change the legally marketed device’s performance or safety specifications using the output of the
risk-based assessment performed in A3. Removing, modifying, or bypassing a safety feature
(e.g., fuses, alerts, alarms, interlocks) likely significantly changes the legally marketed device’s
performance or safety specifications. Changes that impact compliance with a regulation or alter
conformity with a voluntary consensus standard would likely significantly change the legally
marketed device’s performance or safety specifications and may also adulterate and/or misbrand
the device. 44
If the answer to A3.1 is “yes,” then the change would likely be remanufacturing. If the answer to
A3.1 is “no,” then the change is likely not remanufacturing.

VII. Changes Involving Software
As described in Section VI, Figure 1 and its accompanying text should not be applied to changes
involving software. Many software changes are likely remanufacturing because of their impact
on a product’s software architecture, software requirements specifications, unresolved anomalies,
44

See, e.g., sections 501(e)(2) and 502(o) of the FD&C Act.

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
and other key characteristics. Further, because the probability of a software failure cannot be
determined using traditional statistical methods, the risk-based assessment approach that FDA
recommends in Section VI should not be applied to software changes. Instead, FDA has
identified certain activities performed on software that are likely not remanufacturing because
they generally do not significantly change the performance or safety specifications of the device:
• Activities performed on behalf of or otherwise explicitly authorized by the OEM that
return the legally marketed device to its performance and safety specifications or
maintain the performance and safety specifications, and intended use;
• Implementing updates and upgrades authorized, approved, or otherwise provided by the
OEM;
• Running software-based hardware diagnostics;
• Assessing for viruses, malware, and other cybersecurity related issues;
• Reinstalling OEM software to restore original performance and safety specifications;
• Reverting software to a previous configuration;
• Installing cybersecurity updates that are authorized by the OEM; 45
• Turning on or off connectivity features (e.g., Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections) consistent
with OEM intended use;
• Performing data backup and recovery operations;
• Assessing software inventory;
• Collecting system logs;
• Managing user accounts; and
• Accessing diagnostic and repair information.
Other activities involving changes to software are likely to significantly change a device’s
performance or safety specifications, such that the activity is likely remanufacturing. However, if
an entity believes that an activity involving a change to software does not significantly change a
device’s performance or safety specifications, the entity should adequately document its
decision-making (see Guiding Principles 5 and 6). Any activity involving software changes that
significantly modifies a device’s intended use would be remanufacturing. 46
Entities should also consider the unintended consequences and cumulative effects of any
software change(s). Entities performing activities on devices should make a determination about
whether each activity and the cumulative effects of the changes resulting from the activities are
remanufacturing and document their rationale.

We recognize that the cybersecurity landscape rapidly evolves. FDA recommends referring to FDA’s website at
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/cybersecurity for updates on statutory and
regulatory requirements and related information.

VIII.
Regulatory Requirements and Considerations for
Remanufacturers
As stated above, remanufacturers 47 are considered manufacturers under the FD&C Act and
FDA’s regulations, 48 and are thus regulated as such. Entities that are remanufacturing devices,
including devices that they did not originally manufacture, are generally subject to the same
regulatory requirements as the OEM of the device. Basic regulatory requirements (general
controls) that manufacturers of medical devices distributed in the U.S. must comply with, unless
exempted by regulations, include, but are not limited to: Establishment Registration and Medical
Device Listing (21 CFR part 807), Medical Device Reporting and Notification (21 CFR parts
803, and 1002) requirements, Recalls and Reports of Corrections and Removals (21 CFR parts 7,
806, 810, and 1003), Quality System (QS) Regulation (21 CFR part 820), and Labeling
requirements (21 CFR parts 801, 809, 830, and 1010). 49, 50 Many device types also require
premarket review, including premarket notification (also known as 510(k)) (21 CFR part 807) or
premarket approval (PMA) (21 CFR part 814), depending on their device classification and other
factors. Certain devices have additional regulatory requirements such as compliance with special
controls, which are usually specific to devices for which general controls alone are insufficient to
provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device. 51 Unique
considerations for remanufacturers for complying with these regulatory requirements are
described below.
Registered remanufacturers and entities engaged in remanufacturing are subject to investigations
and inspections to ensure compliance with the FD&C Act. 52 In planning and conducting
inspections of medical device facilities, the Agency considers risk-based factors consistent with
the FD&C Act to allocate resources effectively to carry out the Agency’s mission of protecting
and promoting public health. 53 When a medical device manufacturer, including a
remanufacturer, fails to comply with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations, FDA has
the authority to respond with enforcement tools. In most cases, the manufacturer will take
voluntary action to correct any violations identified by FDA to avoid the need for enforcement
actions.

The considerations in this section apply to OEMs, third party servicers, and ISOs. The intent of this section is to
provide additional insights for entities that may be less familiar with the FDA’s medical device regulatory
requirements.

Establishment Registration and Medical Device Listing
Under 21 CFR part 807, owners or operators of establishments that are involved in the
manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, assembly, or processing of medical
devices intended for human use in the U.S. are generally required to register annually with FDA.
Generally, establishments that are required to register with FDA are also required to list their
devices and the activities that are performed on those devices. As manufacturers,
remanufacturers of medical devices 54 are also required to obtain their own device listing,
independent of OEM’s device listing, and their own establishment registration if not already
registered as a device manufacturer. 55

Marketing Authorization
The risk of the device determines the regulatory controls needed to provide a reasonable
assurance of safety and effectiveness. Medical devices are classified into class I, II, and III with
increasing regulatory controls. The class to which a device is assigned determines, among other
things, the type of premarket submission or application that is required for FDA authorization to
market. Most class I devices, which includes devices with the lowest risk, are exempt from
premarket notification (i.e., 510(k) Exempt); class II devices require premarket notification (i.e.,
a 510(k)) unless exempt by regulation; and class III devices (those that are the highest risk)
require premarket approval (i.e., a PMA). Remanufacturers are responsible for complying with
premarket requirements, including obtaining the required FDA marketing authorization prior to
conducting remanufacturing activities on the OEM’s legally marketed finished device. 56 The
relevant regulatory standard must be met for remanufactured devices, which have experienced a
significant change to performance or safety specifications, or intended use, as compared to the
OEM’s legally marketed finished device. For example, for remanufactured devices requiring a
510(k), the remanufacturer must demonstrate that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a
legally marketed predicate device in terms of intended use, technological characteristics, and
performance testing, as needed. For remanufactured devices requiring a PMA, the
remanufacturer must provide valid scientific evidence demonstrating a reasonable assurance of
safety and effectiveness for the device’s intended use.

As noted in Section II of this guidance, FDA focuses on the specific activities an entity performs on a particular
device when determining whether an entity is the remanufacturer of the device and not on the entity’s self-identified
designation.

Registration and listing,” available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-yourdevice/device-registration-and-listing
56
Remanufactured devices may require different regulatory controls from the OEM’s legally marketed finished
device to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Remanufacturers must identify the correct
classification for the device to understand and comply with the applicable regulatory controls. For additional
information on premarket submissions, see FDA’s website “How to Study and Market Your Device,” available at

Medical Device Reporting and Electronic Product
Reports
The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation (21 CFR part 803) contains mandatory
requirements for manufacturers, distributors, importers, and device user facilities to report
certain device-related adverse events and product problems to FDA. 21 CFR part 1002 sets forth
the requirements for records and reports that must be kept and submitted for certain electronic
products. Manufacturers, including remanufacturers, are required to report to FDA when they
learn that any of their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury. 57
Manufacturers must also report to FDA when they become aware that their device has
malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the
malfunction were to recur. 58 As manufacturers, remanufacturers also are responsible for
reporting adverse events and certain malfunctions, as further defined and outlined in 21 CFR
parts 803 and 1002, regarding their remanufactured device to FDA.

Reports of Corrections and Removals and Notifications of
Defects
Under 21 CFR part 806, Medical Device Reports of Correction and Removals, manufacturers
and importers are required to submit a written report to FDA of any correction or removal of
medical devices if the correction or removal was initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the
device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act caused by the device which may present a risk
to health. 59 Even if a remanufacturer is not required to report a correction or removal of a device
to FDA under 21 CFR 806.10, records of such actions must be kept. 60 Under 21 CFR part 1003,
Notification of Defects or Failure to Comply, manufacturers, assemblers, and importers of
electronic products who discover a defect or that the product otherwise fails to comply with
applicable standards, are required to submit written notification to the FDA, and when
applicable, affected persons. 61
Firms may also choose to voluntarily report under 21 CFR part 7 if it conducts a recall, which is
a firm's removal or correction of a marketed product that FDA considers to be in violation of the
laws it administers and against which the agency would initiate legal action, e.g., seizure. 62 A
recall may be undertaken voluntarily and at any time by manufacturers and distributors, or at the

See 21 CFR 806.10(a). However, no report is required if the information has already been submitted to FDA

request of FDA. 63 21 CFR part 7 provides guidelines so that responsible firms may conduct an
effective recall, including information to report to FDA and communicating about the recall. In
rare instances, where the manufacturer or importer fails to voluntarily recall a device that is a
risk to health, FDA may issue a recall order to the manufacturer under 21 CFR part 810, Medical
Device Recall Authority. 64 As manufacturers, remanufacturers are responsible for taking action
and reporting to FDA any correction or removal which was initiated to reduce a risk to health
posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Act caused by the device which may present
a risk to health.

Quality System
The QS Regulation (21 CFR part 820) includes requirements related to the methods used in and
the facilities and controls used for: designing, purchasing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling,
storing, installing and servicing of medical devices. 65 Remanufacturers of medical devices are
required to have a quality system in place for their device, unless the device is exempt from good
manufacturing practices (GMP) requirements. 66

Labeling
Labeling includes labels on the device as well as descriptive and informational literature that
accompanies the device. 67 General device labeling requirements are found in 21 CFR part 801.
Additional labeling requirements for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) are found in 21 CFR part 809
and labeling requirements for electronic products are found in 21 CFR part 1010. Unique device
identification (UDI) labeling requirements are found in 21 CFR part 830. 68 Remanufactured
devices most likely already have labeling associated with them that is provided by the OEM of
the finished device. Remanufacturing activities that significantly change the performance or
safety specifications of a device, or its intended use, are likely to require corresponding labeling
changes. For example, if a remanufacturer adds a feature or function to a reusable device, such
modification would necessitate labeling changes to provide adequate instructions for how to use
the new feature or function and to the associated reprocessing instructions to ensure the device

FDA has determined that certain types of medical devices are exempt from GMP requirements. These devices are
exempted by FDA classification regulations published in the Federal Register and codified in 21 CFR 862 to 892.
Exemption from the GMP requirements does not exempt manufacturers of finished devices from keeping complaint
files (21 CFR 820.198) or from general requirements concerning records (21 CFR 820.180).

can be reused safely and effectively with the new feature or function. It is the responsibility of
the remanufacturer to modify and validate any necessary labeling changes that are associated
with the specific remanufacturing activity including, but not limited to, the remanufacturer
identifying information, obtaining a new UDI, and modifying directions for use, device
specifications, and warnings as needed. 69

IX. Considerations for Labeling
Based on publicly available information and FDA’s activities discussed in Section II of this
guidance, FDA believes that OEMs of reusable devices intend for their devices to routinely
undergo both preventive maintenance and repair. It is important that such devices include
instructions on how to adequately return a device to its performance and safety specifications
established by the OEM. 70 Unintentional remanufacturing can occur when entities do not have
the instructions necessary to return a device to its original performance and safety specifications.
The lack of adequate servicing instructions can also create challenges in the availability of
quality, safe, and effective devices.
Consistent with promoting and protecting the public health, FDA encourages OEMs, as an
industry best practice, to provide servicing instructions that facilitate routine maintenance and
repair of their reusable devices. FDA’s recommendations are not intended to encourage the
disclosure of trade secrets or confidential commercial information. The OEM labeling of
reusable devices should include at least the following information, as applicable, to facilitate
routine device maintenance and repair:
• A description of the key performance and safety specifications;
• Critical technical or functional specifications, including:
o Physical dimensions;
o Electrical characteristics, including batteries (e.g., chemistry, amperage, voltage,
rechargeability), internal fuses, and power supply (e.g., voltage, amperage,
frequency); and
o Device-specific performance specifications (e.g., flow rate accuracy or range,
humidity, temperature, wavelength).
• The recommended maintenance activities and schedule;
• Recommended troubleshooting steps, routine testing, and acceptance criteria to
confirm that the device remains within its performance and safety specifications;
• A description of error codes, alerts, and alarm features on the device;
See sections 502(a), 201(n), 502(c), and 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act. A device shall be deemed misbranded if,
among other things: its labeling is false or misleading; its labeling does not contain adequate warnings; or any
information required to be in the labeling is not prominently placed with such conspicuousness and in such terms to
render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of purchase and
use.
70
Section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act requires that labeling bear adequate directions for use. For non-prescription
devices, adequate directions for use include instructions on preparing a device for use. 21 CFR 801.5(g).
Prescription devices are exempt from the adequate directions for use requirement provided certain conditions are
met, including that the labeling bear “information for use, including indications, effects, routes, methods, and
frequency and duration of administration, and any relevant hazards, contraindications, side effects, and precautions
under which practitioners licensed by law to administer the device can use the device safely and for the purpose for
which it is intended…” 21 CFR 801.109(c).

Appendix A. Examples
The following are illustrative examples of activities that may be performed on devices with
explanations about why such examples are or are not likely remanufacturing. Note that these
generalized examples do not necessarily account for every possible detail, risk, or consideration
that an entity should evaluate, and should not be taken to mean that the changes described are or
are not definitively remanufacturing. Real-world decisions will depend on the specific facts and
circumstances, including the specific details of the changes made to the specific device. FDA
recommends referencing the guiding principles when considering the examples to expand
understanding. For example, when reviewing the activities outlined in the examples below, it
may be helpful to consider whether the activity results in changes to a device that would require
a new marketing submission (consistent with Guiding Principle 3) and how a risk-based
approach, such as ISO 14971: Medical devices – Application of risk management to medical
devices may be instrumental in assessing risk (consistent with Guiding Principle 5).

(1) Component/part/material activities

Example E.1
Activity: The door of an infusion pump was bent and now pinches the administration set.
The flow rate accuracy fell outside the OEM’s specified accuracy range. The door is replaced
with a non-OEM door that is marketed as compatible with this infusion pump. It has the
same overall dimensions and is made from a similar material of construction. However, the
replacement door material is more rigid than the original door.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. The existing and replacement doors do not have direct or indirect contact with the
patient’s body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes, the old door was removed and replaced. While the new door is marketed as compatible,
all dimensions were confirmed through comparative measurement, including the hinges and
latch. The specific material of the original door is unknown and there is a noticeable
difference in flexibility that may impact the pump’s performance specifications.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. Once replaced, the door was confirmed to open and close with similar effort as the
original door and it was confirmed that the added rigidity did not significantly change the
pump’s performance or safety specifications (e.g., flowrate accuracy).

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
No. A risk-based assessment determined that there are no new or modified risks and there is
no change in performance or safety specifications (e.g., the change does not alter conformity
to a voluntary consensus standard or compliance with a regulation).
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Example E.2
Activity: The rotor within a peristaltic infusion pump no longer functions as intended and is
replaced. The subject pump rotor is no longer supported by the OEM, but a comparable offthe-shelf rotor is available. The dimensions of the rotor, including the individual rollers, are
the same; however, the material of construction of the rollers, which contact and apply
pressure to the administration set, appears to be stainless steel. This is different from the
plastic rollers in the legally marketed device.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. Neither the existing or replacement component directly or indirectly contact body tissue.
It is only in contact with the outside of the administration set.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The rotor was removed and replaced. Also, although the dimensional specifications of
the non-OEM pump rotor, including the individual rollers, are the same as the OEM rotor,
the roller materials are different.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. Once the rotor was replaced, the device appears to function adequately. The change in
material of the rollers does not significantly change the accuracy of the flowrate across the
labeled flowrate range. However, a risk-based assessment identified that the change in
material of the rollers can affect the useful life of the administration set. The change in the
roller material from plastic to stainless steel increases the administration set wear and/or
breakage due to fatigue. Evaluation of this risk concluded that the increased fatigue on the
administration set is more likely to lead to patient under-dosing before the administration set
is intended to be replaced. This significantly changes the device’s performance and safety
specifications.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.3
Activity: The gradient coil of a magnetic resonance (MR) system was damaged during an
imaging session and needs to be replaced. The gradient coil is replaced with a non-OEM
gradient coil. The maximum slew rate of the coil matches that of the OEM gradient coil;
however, the peak gradient strength is larger than the OEM coil.
24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue?
No. The gradient coil does not have direct or indirect contact with body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The gradient coil was removed and replaced, and the new gradient coil has a larger
peak gradient strength.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. An assessment was performed to determine the significance of the change. A
gradient coil with a larger peak gradient strength significantly changes the imaging
performance specifications (e.g., slice thickness, spatial resolution).
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Activity: The gradient coil of an MR system was damaged during an imaging session and
needs to be replaced. It is replaced with a non-OEM gradient coil that has different
dimensional specifications and coil design.
Relevant questions:
In this example, the answers to flowchart questions A1 and A2 are the same as Example
E.3.a. except that for A2, the new gradient coil has different dimensional specifications
and coil design.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The new gradient coil only differs by small changes in design and dimensional
specifications. There are no significant changes to the performance and safety
specifications (e.g., slew rate, peak gradient strength, power).
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
No. A risk-based assessment identified no new or modified risks or change in the
performance or safety specifications due to this change because the non-OEM gradient
coil has the same hardware performance specifications (e.g., slew rate), equivalent
imaging performance, and meets the same safety and performance specifications (e.g.,
acoustic output) when compared to the OEM gradient coil.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Example E.4
Activity: The slide heater pads on an immunohistochemistry (IHC) autostainer are worn out
and need to be replaced. They are replaced with an OEM part.

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. The slide heater pads do not have direct or indirect contact with body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The heater pad components were physically removed and replaced with new pads.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. An assessment was performed to evaluate this replacement and identified no changes to
dimensions, materials, or performance or safety specifications of the pads.
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
No. A risk-based assessment identified no new or modified risks because the slide heater
pads are identical to the original part from the OEM. The device now functions within its
functional specifications identified in the labeling. There is no change in the performance or
safety specifications.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Example E.5
Activity: The tubing on a sample processor became kinked from use and needs to be
replaced. Tubing was found from the same OEM, but the tubing is intended for use with a
different sample processor.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. There is no direct or indirect contact between the tubing and body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The tubing was removed and replaced with new tubing of a different inner diameter.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. The inner diameter of the tubing is different from the legally marketed device.
Verification and validation testing was performed to evaluate this replacement and identified
significant changes to performance because different fluid characteristics (e.g., flow rate)
than those specified for the legally marketed device were noted with the new tubing.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.6
Activity: A tissue pre-treatment water bath was updated by replacing the heating chamber
with one that has a different temperature range.
26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. The tissue specimens have been removed from the human body, are within a sealed
container, and neither the water bath nor heating chamber directly or indirectly contacts the
tissue.
A2 Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The heating chamber was removed and replaced. The heating chamber’s performance
specifications were changed because the new heating chamber has a different temperature
range.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. The performance is significantly changed because the heating range extends beyond that
of the heating chamber in the legally marketed device.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.7
Activity: A stainless steel manual drill is intended to be used in the implantation of
orthopedic devices. The drill is intended to be reprocessed and reused for multiple
procedures. The drill was sharpened because it is dull and difficult to use. This is the first
time the drill has been sharpened.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue?
Yes. Sharpening the drill removes material and exposes a fresh surface that directly
contacts bone.
A1.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The drill is not coated. The material and structure of the drill that contacts body
tissue is uniform. A risk-based assessment concluded that removal of material due to
sharpening as well as the sharpening process itself does not significantly change the
biocompatibility or reprocessing.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. Sharpening of the drill removes material changing the dimensions of the drill.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The drill was returned to its performance and safety specifications because the entity
sharpened the device to its labeled outer diameter and original edge profile angle.

27

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
Yes. Sharpening the drill may change the size of the resulting pilot drill hole. Changing
the size of the pilot hole can change the fit of the implant or overall purchase in bone
such that the mechanical integrity of the implant is compromised.
A3.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. Based on the facility’s maintenance record, it was determined that this is the first
drill sharpening. The drill produces the same pilot hole size as the legally marketed
device after the sharpening has been completed. There is no significant change to the
device’s performance or safety specifications at this time.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Activity: A stainless steel manual drill with a titanium nitride coating is intended to be
used in the implantation of orthopedic devices. The drill is intended to be reprocessed and
reused for multiple procedures. The drill was sharpened because it is dull and difficult to
use. The drill has been sharpened multiple times.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue?
Yes. Sharpening the drill removes material and exposes a fresh surface that directly
contacts bone.
A1.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. While sharpening the drill exposes the stainless steel surface beneath the coating,
both the surface coating and underlying stainless steel have been subjected to a
biocompatibility assessment. Additionally, a risk-based assessment concluded that
removal of material due to sharpening does not significantly change the biocompatibility
or reprocessing.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. Sharpening of the drill removes material changing the dimensions and cutting
surface of the drill.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. Based on the facility’s maintenance record, it was determined that the drill has been
sharpened multiple times. While the outer diameter of the drill is not significantly
changed from the legally marketed device, the titanium nitride coating is no longer intact
on the cutting surface of the drill, causing inefficient or destructive cutting. This activity
significantly changes the device’s performance and safety specifications.
Decision: Remanufacturing.

Example E.8
Activity: The lens of an endoscope is cracked. The lens is affixed by an epoxy that is not
described in the labeling. The cracked lens was removed and replaced. The epoxy used
was purchased from the OEM and is identical to that used in the legally marketed device.
The replacement lens was not purchased from the OEM. The lens was tested and
demonstrated to have the same optical specifications (e.g., focal length, Abbe number)
and materials as the original lens.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue?
Yes, both the lens and the epoxy directly contact body tissue.
A1.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The epoxy is identical to the epoxy used in the legally marketed device. The
replacement lens is the same material as original lens. A risk-based assessment that
considered both the individual and cumulative changes was performed to determine if the
procedure used to replace the lens affects biocompatibility and reprocessing instructions.
A biocompatibility assessment confirmed that there are no new surfaces previously
unexposed to body tissue. A comprehensive reprocessing risk assessment and testing
demonstrated that the validated reprocessing instructions identified in the labeling of the
legally marketed device are not impacted by the replacement parts or the procedure used
to replace the parts.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The epoxy and lens were replaced.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The optical performance testing (e.g., resolution and distortion) and reprocessing risk
assessment and testing indicated there has been no significant change in performance or
safety specifications.
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
No. A risk-based assessment was performed that considered both the individual and
cumulative changes that could have affected biocompatibility, reprocessing, and optical
performance. This assessment identified that there are no new or modified risks, and
there is no change in performance or safety specifications.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Activity: The lens of an endoscope is cracked. The lens is affixed by an epoxy that is not
described in the labeling. The cracked lens was removed and replaced. The epoxy used
was purchased from the OEM and is identical to that used in the legally marketed device.
The replacement lens comes from a different endoscope model from the same OEM; that
model was 510(k)-cleared with improved optical performance (e.g., resolution and
29

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
distortion) relative to the original endoscope. The replacement lens has the same material
but different optical specifications (e.g., focal length, Abbe number) from the original.
Relevant questions:
In this example, the answers to flowchart questions A1, A1.1, and A2 are the same as
Example E.8.a.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. The epoxy is identical to that used in the legally marketed device, but the lens has
different optical specifications from the original lens. The endoscope with the
replacement lens has different imaging specifications relative to the legally marketed
device. While the replacement lens is present on another 510(k)-cleared device, it was not
present on the original endoscope and significantly changes the performance
specifications of the original endoscope.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.9
Activity: An endoscope’s connection to the video processor was damaged during use. After
repair, it was observed that the endoscope readily disconnected from the video processor. To
address this problem, an adapter was added to reduce the probability of a disconnection
between the endoscope and video processor. The adapter was found to be capable of
connecting to the video processor; however, it is bulkier than the connector.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. The added adapter does not directly or indirectly contact body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes, the adapter has been added to the endoscope.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The adapter still allows the endoscope to be connected to the video processor and optical
performance testing demonstrated the same optical performance as the original endoscope.
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
Yes. A risk-based assessment was performed to determine the effects of this added
component. Increased risks exist with the added adapter, such as disconnection from the light
source, and the potential change to the electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) of the device.
A3.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. Disconnection from a light source during a procedure could result in a loss of imaging
and adverse events such as increased procedure time or other patient injuries such as
30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
perforation. Additionally, testing should also be performed for the electrical safety and EMC
of the device.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.10
Activity: The motor on a powered wheelchair no longer functions and does not propel the
wheelchair as intended. The motor was inspected and it was determined that the motor
should be replaced. Neither the identical motor nor one with similar specifications could be
located. A motor of similar size was inserted with different power and speed specifications.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
No. The motor does not directly or indirectly contact body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The original motor was removed and replaced.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. While the motor has the same physical dimensions, the replacement motor has a
different power output and maximum speed than the legally marketed device. This
significantly changes the device’s performance specifications because the wheelchair can go
faster than intended. This also significantly changes the device’s safety specifications
because the controller and software to operate the wheelchair may no longer be compatible
with the motor.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.11
Activity: The liquid cooling system responsible for maintaining the temperature of a
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) coil is malfunctioning and causing the system to
overheat. The cooling system was inspected and it was determined that the pump
circulating the liquid coolant stopped functioning. A replacement pump was located and
installed with no additional changes to the device.
Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly
contacts body tissue?
No. The liquid coolant is maintained in the sealed coolant system and neither the liquid
coolant nor the pump directly or indirectly contacts body tissue.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes, the pump was replaced.
31

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. Both the dimensions and performance specifications of the original pump were
assessed in comparison to the replacement part. The replacement pump has the same
dimensional and performance specifications of the original pump. The overall
performance and safety specifications of the TMS coils were verified by testing to be the
same.
A3. Is there a new or modified risk or is there a change in the performance or safety
specifications?
No. A risk-based assessment identified no new or modified risks because the replacement
pump is equivalent to that used in the OEM’s legally marketed device and there is no
change in the device performance or safety specifications.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Activity: The liquid cooling system responsible for maintaining the temperature of a
TMS coil is malfunctioning and causing the system to overheat. The cooling system was
inspected and it was determined that the pump circulating the liquid coolant stopped
functioning. A replacement pump was located with the same size and flow specifications,
but it uses a different coolant liquid. The pump was replaced with one that uses a
different coolant into the cooling system.
Relevant questions:
In this example, the answer to flowchart question A1 is the same as Example E.11.a.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. A replacement pump that uses a different coolant liquid was installed.
A2.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. Although the pump has the same dimensional and flow specifications as the original
pump, the new pump uses a different liquid coolant. The new liquid coolant does not
have the same heat capacity as that used in the legally marketed device. Verification and
validation testing was performed and it was determined that there was a significant
change to cooling effectiveness, which poses a safety hazard when the TMS coil is not
properly cooled. This may burn the patient or cause further device malfunctions.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example E.12
Activity: An energy-delivering aesthetic device has multiple compatible handpieces with
specific areas of application. Applicator A can only be used for the chin, while Applicator B
can only be used on the abdomen. An entity cannibalizes Applicator B and uses those parts to
repair Applicator A for use on the chin.

32

Relevant questions:
A1. Add, remove, or change a component/part/material that directly or indirectly contacts
body tissue?
Yes. The distal end of Applicator B is used to reconstruct Applicator A. It directly contacts
the patient and delivers the energy.
A1.1 Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
No. The distal end of both applicators has identical materials and the reprocessing
instructions provided by the OEM are the same for both applicators. A risk-based assessment
was performed to determine the effects of implementing these repairs on the biocompatibility
and reprocessing. A biocompatibility assessment and reprocessing risk assessment were used
to determine that the performance and safety specifications of the device were not
significantly changed.
A2. Add or remove component/part/material or change the dimensional or performance
specifications of a component/part/material?
Yes. The distal end of Applicator B has different dimensional specifications compared to
Applicator A.
A2.1. Is there a significant change to device performance or safety specifications?
Yes. The surface area that contacts the patient has increased by 150%. The increase in
surface area changes the energy output delivered to the patient, which significantly changes
both the performance and safety specifications of Applicator A.
Decision: Remanufacturing.

(2) Software activities
Example S.1
Activity: A specular microscope with a camera is intended for examination of corneal
endothelium and for measurement of the thickness of the cornea. The software was updated
to implement an OEM-authorized patch.
Relevant analysis: The installation of this OEM-authorized patch does not significantly
change the device performance or safety specifications. See Section VII of this guidance for
further discussion of changes involving software. The patch is intended to maintain the
original specifications.
Decision: Not Remanufacturing.
Example S.2
Activity: A device has the capability of real-time remote customer service where the current
status of the device can be accessed. A capability is added so that the customer service
technician can access and directly manipulate the device, including changing device settings,
resetting the device, delivering energy, and positioning the device.

33

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Relevant analysis: The capability of the customer service technician to control the device
introduces new risks (e.g., accidental device reset, unintended device movement) and
functionality (remote control and access) that significantly changes the finished device’s
performance and safety specifications.
Decision: Remanufacturing.
Example S.3
Activity: A device that connects to a facility’s network has software that was designed to run
the Microsoft Windows operating system (OS). Adjustments are made to allow the device to
run using a Linux OS.
Relevant analysis: This change introduces new risks and may impact mitigations for existing
risks that significantly change the finished device’s performance and safety specifications.
This is a redesign of the product and includes the addition of integration with both device
drivers for the target OS as well as specific features of the OS.
Decision: Remanufacturing.

Appendix B. Documentation Examples
The examples below are to illustrate one possible approach to documentation; other approaches
may also be appropriate. Entities are encouraged to use an approach that works for their specific
purposes, taking into account the considerations discussed above. Rationale documentation may
also be incorporated into existing procedures, forms, and other documents when appropriate. The
first example demonstrates a simple change that does not necessitate detailed analysis. The
second example demonstrates a more complex change for which additional analysis and
reference to supporting documentation are warranted. These are generalized examples to
demonstrate documentation principles and do not necessarily account for every possible detail,
risk, or consideration.
