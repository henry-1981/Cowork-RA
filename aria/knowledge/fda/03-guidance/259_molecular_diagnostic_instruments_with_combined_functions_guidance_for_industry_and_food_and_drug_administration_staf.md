Molecular Diagnostic Instruments with
Combined Functions
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

I. Introduction
This document provides FDA’s current thinking on regulation of molecular diagnostic
instruments that combine in a single instrument both approved/cleared device functions and
device functions for which approval/clearance is not required. It also provides advice on the
type of information that should be provided in a premarket submission for a molecular
diagnostic instrument that measures or characterizes nucleic acid analytes and has combined
functions. In this document, “combined functions” refers to instruments that serve as a
component of an FDA-cleared or approved IVD system but can also be configured by the
user for other test purposes, such as basic research.
In this document, for simplicity, “approved/cleared” refers to instruments and functions
requiring approval through the PMA process or clearance through the 510(k) process.
Similarly, “approval/clearance” refers to both the process for approving instruments through
the PMA process and to the process for clearing instruments through the 510(k) process.
“Approval/clearance is not required” refers to instruments or functions that do not need to be
approved or cleared by FDA, such as those intended solely for use for basic research.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
Molecular diagnostic instruments, for example, real-time thermocyclers, are critical
components of certain in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs). One molecular diagnostic
instrument is often used to perform multiple unrelated assays, such as those that detect
methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Hepatitis C virus, and genetic markers of cystic
fibrosis. These types of instruments are not generally approved/cleared alone, i.e., without an
accompanying assay, because their safety and effectiveness or substantial equivalence cannot
be evaluated without reference to the assays they run and the assay’s defined performance
parameters. The same instruments may also be used for additional purposes that do not
require FDA approval or clearance, such as for basic scientific research—purposes this
document refers to as functions for which approval/clearance is not required. In the past,
FDA has provided informal advice in response to individual inquiries regarding the
permissibility of having functions for which approval/clearance is not required on an
instrument intended to be used with approved/cleared in vitro diagnostic assays. This
guidance is meant to communicate FDA’s policy regarding molecular diagnostic instruments
with combined functions.

III. Scope
This document applies to molecular diagnostic instruments that are medical devices1 used
with assays that measure or characterize nucleic acid analytes (human or microbial), and
that combine both approved/cleared device functions and device functions for which
approval/clearance is not required in a single instrument. This document applies to the
instrument itself (hardware) as well as to any firmware or other software intended to
operate on or to control the instrument. This guidance also addresses software that is
distributed as a stand alone device for use with an approved/cleared molecular diagnostic
assay.
The document does not apply to instruments approved/cleared for use with assays that are
intended to screen donors of blood and blood components and donors of human cells, tissues,
and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) for communicable diseases. The document
also does not apply to instruments approved/cleared for blood grouping. We encourage
manufacturers wishing to market such instruments with combined functionality to contact the
appropriate office in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

The recommendations in this document do not apply to assays and reagents. FDA has
separately issued guidance regarding the marketing of Research Use Only (RUO) and
Investigational Use Only (IUO) assays for clinical use that can be found in the guidance
entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or
Investigational Use Only: Frequently Asked Questions” found at
http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/uc
m253307.htm.

IV. Approval/Clearance of Molecular Diagnostic
Instruments
FDA has developed the following policy for premarket submissions for molecular diagnostic
instruments that have functions for which the sponsor is seeking approval/clearance and
additional functions for which the sponsor need not seek approval/clearance. For FDA to
determine that such submissions meet the regulatory criteria for approval or clearance, as
applicable, we will assess whether sufficient measures are in place to 1) assure that the
functions for which approval/clearance is not required do not interfere with or adversely
affect the safety or effectiveness of the approved/cleared functions, and 2) prevent confusion
on the part of the end user. These measures may include implementation of the following:
·
·

·

·

·

Instrument and software design controls to assure the safety and effectiveness
of the molecular diagnostic instrument with combined functions.
Instrument validation procedures for users to employ following a use for
which approval/clearance is not required to verify that the use will not
interfere with subsequent use of the molecular diagnostic instrument as an
approved/cleared device, and to document that interference did not occur on
subsequent use.
A risk mitigation plan that provides sufficient information to demonstrate that
any risks that could be introduced by having functions for which
approval/clearance is not required can be appropriately mitigated.
Labeling that clearly distinguishes the approved/cleared functions from
functions for which approval/clearance is not required (e.g., separate labeling
for approved/cleared functions and functions for which approval/clearance is
not required).
Result reports that distinguish between the use of the approved/cleared
functions and the use of the same instrument for functions for which
approval/clearance is not required (e.g., adding “Not approved/cleared by
FDA” in result reports, as applicable).

Upon review of the information supplied in the premarket submission, FDA will determine if
such measures described are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and
effectiveness or substantial equivalence for the approved/cleared functionalities. FDA may

3

request additional information if we determine that it is necessary to assess safety and
effectiveness or substantial equivalence of the device.
FDA will review information regarding functions for which approval/clearance is not
required only for the purpose of evaluating the risks posed to the approved/cleared functions
and adequacy of mitigations. We do not intend to review this information with respect to
performance characteristics or suitability for use, and do not intend to provide comment on
how instrument functions for which approval/clearance is not required may be marketed,
described in labeling, or otherwise made available.

V.Recommendations for Submissions for Molecular
Diagnostic Instruments with Combined Functions
1. New instruments
For those manufacturers who are developing new molecular diagnostic instruments with
functions for which approval/clearance is not required, FDA recommends that the software
for such devices clearly separate the approved/cleared functions from any functions for which
approval/clearance is not required. One way to accomplish this separation is a dual boot
design. When using dual boot design, at start-up the instrument gives a choice of either the
approved/cleared functions or functions for which approval/clearance is not required,
requiring the user to choose one or the other depending on the type of assay to be performed.
The user would not be able to switch between functions without first going back to the startup screen. This approach may serve, for example, to effectively separate the software
functions and prevent any confusion on the part of the user as to which function the
instrument is performing and to provide a protective mechanism that prevents the user from
altering any approved/cleared function parameters.
Alternative approaches to dual boot designs may be acceptable, provided that noninterference of approved/cleared functionalities with non-approved/non-cleared
functionalities is demonstrated by the manufacturer.

2. Existing approved/cleared instruments
a. For those manufacturers who already have approved or cleared molecular diagnostic
instruments that are also configured to perform functions for which
approval/clearance is not required, but have not specifically addressed the issues
regarding coexistence of approved/cleared functions and those for which
approval/clearance is not required, FDA intends for you to address the
recommendations in this document in any new premarket assay submission for which
the instrument is intended for use.

b. Alternatively, for manufacturers who would prefer to address these recommendations
prior to any new premarket assay submission, you should contact FDA to discuss
potential submissions, and the recommendations outlined in this guidance.

3. Submission information, labeling, and marketing
In determining whether to grant approval/clearance for a molecular diagnostic instrument
with combined functions for use with an approved/cleared assay, it is FDA’s intent to
consider the following conditions:
a. Sponsor demonstrates that functions for which approval/clearance is not required do
not interfere with approved/cleared functions, by providing sufficient information to
establish that the approved/cleared functions are not affected by the functions for
which approval/clearance is not required. For example, a sponsor may provide or
describe: materials and instructions to verify that the use of functions for which
approval/clearance is not required will not interfere with the approved/cleared
functions; use of an ‘analyte test panel’ prior to performing an approved/cleared
assay; recalibration procedures; instrument cleaning and maintenance, etc. We
recommend that the sponsor provide documentation on how the separation of
approved/cleared functions and those functions for which approval/clearance is not
required will be managed through system design measures and labeling, and how it
will be applied to avoid or eliminate user confusion about whether a given assay is
approved/cleared or not, both during assay operation and reporting of results.
b. Sponsor provides a risk/hazard analysis addressing functions for which
approval/clearance is not required in coexistence with approved/cleared functions,
and clearly identifies appropriate mitigation measures. Sponsors should consider
human factors in the design of the mitigations such as clear menu options, grayed-out
software options that are not applicable, etc.
c. Sponsor develops separate labeling (including instrument manuals and other labeling)
for the approved/cleared functions. Labeling for the approved/cleared functions is
subject to the requirements for in vitro diagnostic products found in 21 CFR 809.10,
and should reference only the aspects of the device that were reviewed and
approved/cleared by FDA. Additionally, the labeling for the approved/cleared device
should indicate that the instrument was approved/cleared to run only the
approved/cleared assays. This information should be included in decision summaries,
substantial equivalence and approval letters, and instrument manuals.
d. Consistent with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the instrument
manufacturer or sponsor may not adulterate or misbrand the device by promoting nonapproved/non-cleared assays/reagents as approved/cleared for use on the molecular

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

diagnostic instrument, or otherwise imply, directly or indirectly, that FDA has
approved/cleared functions for which approval/clearance is not required.2

4. Promotion and labeling issues
The following provides guidance on labeling and promotion of molecular diagnostic
instruments with combined functions. The sponsor of such a product may generally:
·
·

·

Promote the instrument as approved/cleared for use with assays that are
approved/cleared for use on that instrument system.
Promote the instrument for uses for which approval/clearance is not required (i.e.,
other than in approved/cleared labeling) without claiming or implying that the uses
are approved/cleared.
Provide information about functions of the molecular diagnostic instrument for which
approval/clearance is not required separately from instrument labeling provided for
the approved/cleared product.

With regard to these products, a sponsor generally should not:
·
·
·
·

Combine approved/cleared and other labeling claims (e.g., “you can use this
instrument for detecting MRSA and for basic research”).
Combine labeling describing the approved/cleared functions (i.e., user’s manual,
brochures, etc.) with information about other functions.
Claim or imply approved/cleared status for the other functions.
Imply or claim that the instrument is approved/cleared for any assay other than those
the FDA has specifically approved/cleared for use on the instrument.

5. Software/hardware changes
Once a molecular diagnostic instrument with combined functions is approved/cleared, you
should notify FDA of changes to the device hardware or software that have the potential to
affect the approved/cleared functions of the instrument as required under 21 CFR
807.81(a)(3) and 814.39. This applies to changes to both approved/cleared hardware and
software functions and hardware and software functions for which approval/clearance was
not required. All changes to both approved/cleared functions and those for which
approval/clearance was not required should be included in the manufacturer’s IVD change
control section in the manufacturer’s quality system. Manufacturers should consider the
potential impact to both class II and III assays used on their system and perform appropriate
risk assessments to determine the need to submit the changes to FDA, based on the
recommendations stated in the relevant guidance documents listed below:

6. Third Party assay developers
Assays submitted to FDA by third party assay developers to be run on user-configurable
molecular diagnostic instruments, such as those described in this guidance, will be
reviewed by FDA on a case-by-case basis to determine whether risks are adequately
mitigated, as described above, for use on molecular diagnostic instruments with
combined functions. At a minimum, third party assay developers should provide
complete instructions for use to allow the end user to perform the assay (including
procedures to assure non-interference and proper operation of the instrument and software
for approved/cleared functions) on the specified instrument. In addition, the labeling
should not rely on or refer to an instrument user manual that is not part of an
approved/cleared product’s labeling.

VI. MDR Reporting
Manufacturers and user facilities are required to report all device-related adverse events in
accordance with the requirements under 21 CFR 803.10. Even though molecular diagnostic
instruments covered by this guidance include molecular diagnostic device functions for
which approval/clearance is not required, FDA expects malfunctions, injuries, and deaths
associated with such functions to be reported as adverse events under 21 CFR Part 803. All
instrument device functions, whether approved/cleared or not required to be approved/cleared
can have a direct or indirect adverse impact on approved/cleared indications. For third-party
developed assays, instrument manufacturers and assay manufacturers should be prepared to
conduct coordinated investigations to determine the root cause of adverse events if
circumstances so direct.
