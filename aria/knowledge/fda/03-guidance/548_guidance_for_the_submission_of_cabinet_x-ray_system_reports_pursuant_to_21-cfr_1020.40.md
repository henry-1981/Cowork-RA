Foreword
The Office of Compliance, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) developed this guide.  This guide will assist
manufacturers1 of electronic products which emit radiation in providing adequate reporting of radiation safety testing and
compliance with federal performance standards.  Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 1002 and 1003 specify
Reporting and Notification requirements2, 3.
Reports submitted on radiation safety of electronic products must follow the appropriate guide (21 CFR 1002.7).  If the report does
not follow an applicable guide it must contain a sufficient justification for any deviations.  The submitter of the report will receive
an acknowledgment letter with the accession number we assign to the report.  Please reference this accession number in the future
when providing additional information about this model family in either a supplement or the annual report.  If a report is
incomplete or inadequate CDRH may reject it and return it for completion.  CDRH will not enter a rejected report into our
database.  Also, a rejected report will not receive an accession number.
WE DO NOT APPROVE THESE REPORTS OR THE PRODUCTS BEING REPORTED.  It is the manufacturer's
responsibility to certify that their products comply with all applicable standards (21 CFR 1010 - 1050), based on a testing program
in accordance with good manufacturing practices.  Prior to the shipment of products in interstate commerce 21 CFR 1002  requires
the manufacturer to submit the report  and to comply with all applicable importation requirements (21 CFR 1005).  If there are
deficiencies, we may disapprove the firm's quality control and testing program, determine that the product contains a radiation
defect, or determine that the product fails to comply with a standard.  We will notify the manufacturer if we make such a
determination.  CDRH may require the manufacturer to cease introduction into U.S. commerce until deficiencies are corrected, and
to initiate a corrective action program (21 CFR 1003 - 1004) for products already introduced into commerce.
Please mail your reports to the address below (FDA can not process electronic submissions at this time).  Provide the original
report with appropriate signature(s) (no facsimiles, please).  Provide extra copies only if this guide specifically requires them.
Submit the report written in the English language.  Translate any text that appears in a language other than English into English in
a complete and accurate manner.  Keep a copy of the completed report in your records.
We are making our reporting guides and other regulatory information available on the Internet under http://www.fda.gov/cdrh.  No
copyright exists for these guides.  Reproduce these guides as needed.  If you would like to comment on the reporting guides, web
site, or future electronic submissions, you may direct the comments to the address below.  If you need additional  regulations for
electronic products or medical devices, you should contact the Division of Small Manufacturers Assistance by telephone at 1-800-
638-2041 or 301-443-6597, or by facsimile at 301-443-8818.

1    Manufacturer (see 21 CFR § 1000.3(n)) means any person engaged in the business of manufacturing, assembling, or importing electronic products.
2    Accidental Radiation Occurrences: 21 CFR  1002.20 requires manufacturers to immediately report accidental radiation occurrences (see 21 CFR
1000.3(a) for the definition).
3   Notification: Title 21 CFR Part 1003 requires manufacturers to provide Notification of Defects or Failure to Comply.  Send these notifications to the
Director of the Office of Compliance (HFZ-300).


FOREWORD 
This docqmeqt is intended to serve as a guide to assist manufacturers in 
the eubmiseion of initial and eupplements to initial report6 for cabinet x-ray 
systems (21 CFR 1020.40). 
The format selected for this guidance is that of a 
report form. It may be used directly or it may serve as a model for developing 
a reporting form. 
However, if a manufacturer develops his own tpport form he 
must be eure that all information requested by the "modal" form is included and 
keyed to this format since this information hae been interpreted by the Division 
of ComplC,mce as being necessary to satisfy, in whole or in part, the initial 
and supplemental reporting requirements. In order to standardize reports and 
facilitate their review the order and organizatiop of the model form should b e  
followed as closely as poasible.
