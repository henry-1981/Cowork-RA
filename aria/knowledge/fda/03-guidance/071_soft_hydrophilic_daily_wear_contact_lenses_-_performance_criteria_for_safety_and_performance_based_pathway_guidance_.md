Soft (Hydrophilic) Daily Wear Contact
Lenses – Performance Criteria for
Safety and Performance Based
Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses in
support of the Safety and Performance Based Pathway.1 Under this framework, submitters (you)
planning to submit a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for soft
(hydrophilic) contact lenses will have the option to use the performance criteria proposed in this
guidance to support substantial equivalence, rather than a direct comparison of the performance
of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.2 For more information
regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA
guidance entitled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions
for Medical Devices.”3
In general, FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic

and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is
suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway4 – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter
could demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate
that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the
specific set of performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an
appropriate predicate for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria
represent performance that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed
devices of that device type. Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA
staff, information in literature, and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed soft
(hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses to determine the performance criteria and associated
testing methods that could support a finding of substantial equivalence for soft (hydrophilic)
daily wear contact lenses as described in this guidance. FDA recognizes that in some cases, it
may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing against an appropriate predicate
device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of performance and technological
characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate performance criteria
established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the optional device-specific Safety and
Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance criteria identified in this guidance
provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses that are the subject of this guidance are Class II
devices and are regulated under 21 CFR 886.5925, with the product code LPL.
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses that fall within the scope of this guidance are
prescription devices intended to be worn directly against the cornea and adjacent limbal and
scleral areas of the eye for the optical correction of ametropia (myopia or hyperopia with or
without astigmatism). The lenses are designed to be frequent replacement or daily disposable
lenses.
Soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses with the following indications for use and/or characteristics are
outside the scope of this guidance:
· To correct presbyopia
· To enhance or alter the apparent color of the eye
· To act as a bandage or therapeutic lens

For the management of keratoconus or irregular corneal conditions
Lenses with special optical performance beyond that of correcting ametropia (e.g., blue
light filtering)
Lenses with special physical performance (e.g., retains moisture, lubricates, reduces
deposits)
Lenses with special health performance characteristics (e.g., relieves dry eye)

Device Design Characteristics:
The soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses that fall within the scope of this guidance are
spherical or toric lenses made from polymacon, etafilcon A or hioxifilcon D polymeric
materials as defined by the United States Adopted Name (USAN) Council and include the
associated primary packaging components. Polymacon, etafilcon A, and hioxilfilcon D
represent well-established contact lens materials that have been used in many 510(k)s by
numerous contact lens manufacturers. Listed color additives5 are used for handling and
visibility tinting only. The lenses are designed to be frequent replacement or daily disposable
lenses.
Please note that the scope of this guidance document does not include rigid gas permeable
contact lenses (21 CFR 886.5918) or soft contact lens materials that have not been specified in
the scope of this document.
In addition, soft (hydrophilic) daily wear contact lenses with the following features are outside
the scope of this guidance:
· Lenses made of materials not defined above
· Lens materials made of non-polymeric components
· Lens materials with non-listed color additives
· Lenses with UV-additives not previously used in polymacon, etafilcon A or hioxifilcon D
materials
· Lenses with coatings, whether directly or indirectly applied (e.g., wetting agents applied
by immersion in packaging solution)
· Lenses with novel packaging solution ingredients not used in any previously marketed
contact lens packaging solution or care product
· Lens materials with special optical filtering capabilities (e.g., blue light filtering)
· Lenses with new spherical or toric optical designs that have not previously been marketed
· Combination products
Some of the recommendations in this safety and performance guidance may assist in complying
with some of the special controls for soft daily wear contact lenses. For information regarding
the special controls for soft daily wear contact lenses, see “Premarket Notification [510(k)]
Guidance Document for Class II Daily Wear Contact Lenses.”6 Descriptive information such as
that related to the device description, United States Adopted Name Council (USAN) designation,

provided as recommended in the above guidance. Similarly, general information that is beyond
the scope of this safety and performance guidance document regarding submission of a 510(k)
for daily wear contact lenses (i.e., labeling and shelf life), can also be found in the above
guidance.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission7 to engage in discussion with
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k).

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) recommended below for each test or
evaluation. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions
under the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the performance criteria sections
below, test information such as summary results or test protocols should be submitted as part of
the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance, Safety and Performance Based Pathway.8 For
additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please
refer to FDA’s guidance: Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench
Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.9
FDA believes that the testing and performance criteria identified in this section provide at least
the same level of protection of the public health and safety as the testing described in the
guidance document entitled, “Premarket Notification [510(k)] Guidance Document for Class II
Daily Wear Contact Lenses.”10 To the extent the recommendations in this section depart from

Note that tests involving leachability, lens solution compatibility, and preservative uptake and release identified in
the guidance document, “Premarket Notification [510(k)] Guidance Document for Class II Daily Wear Contact
Lenses,” are mainly driven by material characteristics and properties of soft daily wear contact lenses that have been
defined and incorporated into the testing performance criteria identified in this section.

Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile11
Additional Considerations: Please note that for devices considered in this guidance these
recommendations pertain solely to moist heat sterilization. Any other sterilization method
(e.g., ethylene oxide, radiation, or dry heat) is outside the scope of this guidance.
Submission Information: If using an Established Category A sterilization method, you
should provide the information described in Section V.A. of the FDA guidance
“Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k)
Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile”; generally, the validation data itself is not
needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence.
Biocompatibility
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process,12 referred to in the rest of this document as the FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
“Surface Devices” with a “limited” mucosal membrane contact duration of ≤ 24 hours and you
should assess the endpoints below, as referenced in Attachment A of the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance, with the following FDA currently-recognized consensus standards.
· Cytotoxicity - ISO 10993-5 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 5: Tests
for in vitro cytotoxicity
· Sensitization - ISO 10993-10 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 10:
Tests for irritation and skin sensitization
· Ocular Irritation - ISO 10993-10 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 10:
Tests for irritation and skin sensitization; ISO 10993-23 Biological evaluation of
medical devices – Part 23: Tests for irritation
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical blank
polymer buttons and identical packaging materials using identical manufacturing processes as a
predicate device with the same type and duration of tissue contact, and any changes in device
design are not expected to impact the biological response, this is typically sufficient to establish
substantially equivalent biocompatibility.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports for both the lens and packaging materials
be provided for all tests performed unless a declaration of conformity without supplemental
information can be appropriately provided, as described in Attachment E of the FDA
Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative, and/or reagent controls should
perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be thoroughly described and justified;

however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate comparison to the performance
criteria listed below resulting in the need for submission of a Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated
510(k).
14.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility methods that include comparison device control samples,
the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as expected, as
specified above for the subject device samples.
