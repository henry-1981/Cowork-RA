Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019
Tests (Revised)
Guidance for Developers and Food
and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

FDA plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious
diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. FDA is committed to
providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic.
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide FDA’s review priorities and enforcement policies
regarding novel coronavirus (COVID-19) tests. Rapid detection of COVID-19 cases in the
United States requires wide availability of testing to control the spread of this highly contagious
infection.
The policies in this guidance are intended to remain in effect only for the duration of the
declaration under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) by the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on February 4, 2020, declaring that
circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for
detection and/or diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).1 FDA continues to assess the
evolving situation and intends to update this guidance as appropriate.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended,
but not required.

II. Background
There is currently a pandemic of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus. The virus has
been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it
causes has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the
Secretary of HHS issued a declaration of a public health emergency under section 319 of the
Public Health Services Act related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of
HHS.2 On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration that circumstances exist
justifying the authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detection and/or
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 based on the HHS Secretary’s public health emergency determination
under section 564(b)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act.3 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President
declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.4
Under section 564 of the FD&C Act, the FDA Commissioner may authorize the use of
unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical products, in certain
emergency circumstances, after the HHS Secretary has made a declaration of emergency or
threat justifying authorization of emergency use, to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or lifethreatening diseases or conditions caused by chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear
(CBRN) threat agents when certain criteria are met. The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)
authorities allow FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against CBRN
threats by facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during certain
public health emergencies.
As of August 15, 2022, FDA has issued EUAs for more than 439 tests for COVID-19, including
more than 354 diagnostic and 85 serology or other immune response tests. Further, two
molecular diagnostic COVID-19 tests have been granted marketing authorization through the
traditional device premarket review pathways. In the context of a public health emergency
involving pandemic infectious disease, it is critically important that tests are validated because
false results not only can negatively impact the individual patient but also can have a broad
public health impact. False positive results for diagnostic tests, for example, can lead to
unnecessary quarantine and potential further spread when presumed positive individuals are
quarantined together, wasted contact tracing and testing resources, and delay in accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment for the individual. False negative results can lead to lack of
appropriate treatment for the individual and further spread of the disease.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Previous versions of this guidance described policies regarding the distribution and offering of
certain tests for clinical use prior to or without an EUA. These policies were issued to help
quickly increase availability of tests in the early stages of the pandemic. Unless and until an
EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific test, under the
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), section 353 of the Public Health Service
Act (42 USC 263a), use of that test is limited to laboratories that are certified under CLIA, and
meet the requirements to perform tests of high complexity, and at the point-of-care (POC) when
covered by such a laboratory’s CLIA certificate. Throughout this guidance, references to “highcomplexity CLIA-certified laboratories” are referring to laboratories that are certified under
CLIA and meet the requirements to perform tests of high complexity. These policies did not
apply to at-home tests or tests with home specimen collection.
FDA has updated these policies when appropriate in response to the changing landscape of this
pandemic. The previous update on November 15, 2021, explained FDA’s intent to review EUA
requests for certain types of tests that FDA believed would be most beneficial at that stage of the
pandemic. In addition, in the November 15, 2021, version, FDA revised the previous
enforcement policies to reflect that, at that stage of the pandemic, the Agency generally expected
COVID-19 tests to have been issued an EUA prior to the tests being distributed or offered.
FDA has continued to closely monitor the COVID-19 testing landscape and believes it is again
appropriate to update its policies to reflect the current needs of the pandemic. As explained
throughout this guidance, FDA intends to review the EUA requests for a small subset of tests
based on the review priorities described in section IV.A. Traditional marketing pathways remain
available to all developers and FDA encourages developers of tests that fall outside the scope of
the priorities outlined in this guidance to pursue those routes. In sum, in the September 27, 2022,
update, FDA revised this guidance to update the types of COVID-19 tests for which the Agency
intends to review EUA requests, to discuss the use of the traditional premarket review pathways
for other types of COVID-19 tests for which the Agency does not intend to review EUA
requests, and to make minor updates to the enforcement policies. In the current version of this
guidance, FDA has revised the duration for which the policies in this guidance are intended to
remain in effect.

III. Scope
This guidance applies to diagnostic and serology tests for COVID-19.5 The policies and
recommendations described in this guidance are intended to facilitate availability of tests for
5

Throughout this guidance, the term “diagnostic test” is generally used to refer to molecular or antigen tests, both of
which can be used to diagnose infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Diagnostic tests may be designed for use in
various settings, such as in a CLIA-certified laboratory, at the point of care at a site covered by a laboratory’s CLIA
certificate, or at home. Screening tests, which are used for testing individuals without symptoms or other reasons to
suspect COVID-19, are a subset of diagnostic tests. Molecular tests detect the presence of viral RNA and antigen
tests detect the presence of viral proteins that are part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There may also be diagnostic tests
that incorporate different technologies, such as breath tests, that have a reasonable expectation of technical and
clinical success. While the principles in this guidance are generally still applicable to such tests, there are fewer
available, so different approaches may be appropriate. Therefore, FDA recommends that developers of such tests
contact FDA at CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov to discuss the best approach for their test. The terms

COVID-19 that FDA believes will be most beneficial at the current stage of the public health
emergency.
FDA notes that the enforcement policies in this guidance do not address medical device reporting
(MDR) under 21 CFR Part 803 for tests offered prior to authorization as described in the
guidance. Developers offering such tests are expected to comply with applicable MDR
requirements, including reporting of medical device events that reasonably suggest that their
device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and malfunctions that would
be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if they were to recur. Moreover,
unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific
test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratories,
including testing at the point-of-care when the site is covered by the laboratory’s CLIA
certificate for high complexity testing.

IV. Policy
A.

Review of EUA Requests for COVID­19 Tests

The issuance of an EUA is discretionary. FDA’s decision to review and process an EUA request,
and ultimately issue an EUA if the relevant statutory criteria are met, is based on a
determination, on a case-by-case basis, that such action is necessary to protect the public health
in an emergency. It is an authorization that the government “may” issue when necessary to
protect the public health in an emergency (see section 564(a)(1) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.
360bbb-3(a)(1)), which states, in relevant part, “subject to the provisions of this section, the
Secretary may authorize the introduction into interstate commerce…a drug, device, or biological
product intended for use in an actual or potential emergency”). FDA’s January 2017 guidance,
Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities, 6 describes factors
that FDA intends to use in its prioritization of EUA requests, such as the public health need for
the product, the availability of the product, the availability and adequacy of the information
concerning the likelihood that the product may be safe and effective in preventing, treating, or
diagnosing the condition, and whether the product is included in government stakeholder
stockpiles.
Given the need to address urgent public health priorities, FDA has and continues to prioritize
among the EUA requests it receives for COVID-19 tests.
At this stage of the pandemic, FDA intends to prioritize its review of EUA requests and
supplemental EUA requests from experienced developers7 for diagnostic tests that are likely to
“serology” or “antibody” tests are generally used to refer to tests that detect antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Because the antibodies are part of the body’s immune response to exposure and not the virus itself, such testing
cannot be used for diagnosis of acute infection.
6
See https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorizationmedical-products-and-related-authorities.
7
For the purposes of this guidance, “experienced developers” refers to developers who have interacted with FDA
through a successful EUA request or have similar experience. FDA has interacted with over 1,000 test developers
through the EUA and pre-EUA processes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The Agency has found that EUA

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
have a significant public health benefit (e.g., employ innovative technology) or are likely to
fulfill an unmet need (e.g., diagnosing infection with a new variant or subvariant).
FDA generally intends to focus its review on EUA requests and supplemental EUA requests for
tests that are within these priorities.8 In addition to the above priorities, FDA also intends to
focus its review on EUA requests that are from or supported by a U.S. government stakeholder,9
such as tests funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority
(BARDA) or the National Institutes of Health’s Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx).
FDA intends to notify test developers of its intent by email if FDA declines to review or
otherwise decides not to authorize a test/modification in an EUA request or supplemental EUA
request.
In general, FDA believes these priorities are appropriate to address the public health needs at the
current stage of the public health emergency based on the available information and may adjust
these priorities as public health needs change. Specifically, there is generally sufficient
availability of authorized high-throughput laboratory-based diagnostic tests intended for use with
pooled samples and authorized home-use antigen tests that are available for over the-counter
(OTC) or prescription use.
FDA believes that the number of EUA requests that fall within FDA’s current review priorities
described in this guidance are likely limited and generally encourages developers to submit
COVID-19 tests through traditional premarket review pathways. If you are unsure whether your
test may be prioritized for review, we encourage you to reach out to CDRH-EUATemplates@fda.hhs.gov; however, at this stage, FDA strongly encourages developers of new
tests and existing tests for which modifications are sought to pursue traditional pre-market
pathways.

B. State Authorization of High­Complexity CLIA­Certified
Laboratories
Versions of this guidance prior to November 15, 2021, described a policy regarding States and
territories that authorize laboratories within their State or territory to develop their own COVID19 tests and perform specimen testing, where the notification of SARS-CoV-2 test validation is
not submitted to FDA and the laboratory does not submit an EUA request to FDA.

requests from inexperienced developers are more resource intensive to review. At this phase of the pandemic, and
given our experiences to date, we believe that for COVID-19 tests, FDA’s review resources are more impactful
when working with experienced developers given the design and validation complexities associated with such tests.
As a result, FDA intends to prioritize the review of EUA requests for tests from experienced developers.
8
Developers of tests that are not within these priorities should consider pursuing marketing authorization through a
traditional premarket review pathway. Test developers are welcome to reach out to the team at CDRH-EUATemplates@fda.hhs.gov to discuss whether review of their EUA request may be prioritized.
9
Prioritization of EUA requests from (or supported by) government stakeholders is discussed in the Guidance for
Industry and Other Stakeholders: Emergency Use Authorization of Medical Products and Related Authorities,
available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-useauthorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Under such policy, a State or territory choosing to authorize laboratories within that State or
territory to develop and perform a test for COVID-19 would do so under authority of its own
State law, and under a process that it established, and FDA did not intend to object to the use of
such tests for specimen testing where the notification of SARS-CoV-2 test validation was not
submitted to FDA and the laboratory did not submit an EUA request to FDA, and where instead
the State or territory took responsibility for COVID-19 testing by laboratories in its State during
the COVID-19 outbreak. This policy applied only to tests designed, developed, and used within a
single, high-complexity, CLIA-certified laboratory. The policy did not apply to at-home tests or
tests with home specimen collection, or any testing outside of a high-complexity CLIA-certified
laboratory.10
In versions of this guidance prior to November 15, 2021, FDA requested that the State or
territory notify us if it chose to use this flexibility to expedite COVID-19 testing.11 FDA
indicated that it would not be reviewing the process adopted by the State or territory. FDA
expected that such States and territories as part of their oversight process would require
laboratories developing SARS-CoV-2 tests to validate those tests prior to use. FDA encouraged
laboratories that developed and performed a test for COVID-19 that was authorized by a State or
territory to notify FDA that they have started clinical testing by sending an email to that effect to
CDRH-EUA-Templates@FDA.HHS.GOV, and provide information on testing capacity.
In the November 15, 2021, version of this guidance, FDA revised this policy such that FDA no
longer intended to apply the policy to any additional States or territories going forward.12 The
FDA is maintaining the policy in Section IV.B. of the November 15, 2021, policy, without
further revision. For the States and territories listed on the notification list on FDA’s website
prior to November 15, 2021, that are continuing to authorize laboratories within that State or
territory to develop and perform a test for COVID-19, FDA does not intend to object to the use
of such tests for specimen testing where notification of SARS-CoV-2 test validation is not
submitted to FDA and the laboratory does not submit an EUA request to FDA, and where instead
the State or territory takes responsibility. This policy applies only to tests designed, developed,
and used within a single, high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory. This policy does not apply
to at-home tests or tests with home specimen collection, or any testing outside of a highcomplexity CLIA-certified laboratory.13

10

There are different risks associated with testing in different settings and different issues need to be addressed. For
example, home collection raises several issues of importance, including whether the lay user can safely and properly
collect the specimen, whether the components of the specimen transport media are safe for use in the home
environment (because some may be toxic), proper shipment, and adequate stability of the specimen given the time
lapse between collection and testing and the potential impact of shipping conditions (such as, if the specimen sits in
a hot truck). Tests performed fully at home raise additional issues such as whether the lay user can safely and
properly perform the test and read and accurately interpret the results.
11
A list of States and territories that have notified FDA under this policy is available on FDA’s FAQ website at:
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/notifications-and-emergency-useauthorizations-faqs-testing-sars-cov-2.
12
A State or territory that believes there would be a particular benefit to the policy applying to the State or territory
is welcome to reach out to FDA to discuss further by sending an email to CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov.
13
As discussed in FN [8], there are different risks associated with testing in different settings and different issues
need to be addressed.

FDA notes that laboratories should be aware of requirements to report test results to appropriate
federal, state, and local public health agencies in accordance with applicable federal, state, and
local laws.14

C. Distribution and Offering of SARS­CoV­2 Diagnostic and
Serology Tests During FDA Review
Previous versions of this guidance document described enforcement policies where FDA
generally did not intend to object to developers distributing and offering certain tests prior to
FDA authorization, as described in the policies. Those policies were updated in the November
15, 2021, version of the guidance, and FDA is generally continuing those updated policies and
clarifying them, as discussed below.

(1) FDA Review of EUA Requests
For the following tests, FDA does not intend to object to the continued distribution or offering of
the test while FDA reviews the EUA request for the test:
· Tests on one of the notification lists15 on FDA’s website at the time of issuance of
this updated guidance; and,
· Laboratory developed tests (LDTs)16 offered following the HHS August 2020
Web Statement entitled, “Rescission of Guidances and Other Informal Issuances
Concerning Premarket Review of Laboratory Developed Tests” (“August 2020
HHS Announcement”) and prior to November 15, 2021, where an EUA request
was submitted to FDA as described in Section IV.C.2 of the November 15, 2021
version of this guidance document.17
For tests described in this section, FDA intends to notify test developers by email if FDA
declines to review, declines to issue, or otherwise decides not to authorize the test for any reason,
including lack of response or a determination that there is a lack of adequate data to support
authorization. If so notified, FDA generally expects developers to cease distributing, marketing,
and offering their tests within 15 calendar days. Moreover, if FDA identifies a significant
problem or concern with a test, based either on the provided information or external reports,
FDA generally would expect the developer to take appropriate steps to address such problems,
14

Under section 18115 of the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136), laboratories, including those in patient care
settings operating under a CLIA Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Accreditation,
must report the results of COVID-19 tests to HHS or its designee, in such form and manner as the Secretary may
prescribe, during the declared public health emergency. For additional information on the laboratory data reporting
guidance and FAQs from HHS, please see: https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/testing/covid-19-diagnostic-datareporting/index.html.
15
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/notifications-and-emergencyuse-authorizations-faqs-testing-sars-cov-2
16
LDTs are typically considered tests that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory that is
certified under CLIA and meets the requirements to perform tests of high complexity.
17
This does not apply to EUA requests for which FDA has already notified the test developer by email that FDA
declines to review, declines to issue, or otherwise decides not to authorize the test for any reason, including lack of
response or a determination that there is a lack of adequate data to support authorization. Developers of such tests
were generally expected to cease distributing, marketing, and offering their tests within 15 calendar days of
receiving such an email.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
which could include conducting a recall of the test and/or notification concerning corrected test
reports indicating prior test results may not be accurate.

(2) Recommendations Regarding Test Reports and Other
Information for Tests Offered During FDA Review of EUA
Requests
FDA continues to recommend the following:
1. Test reports should prominently disclose that the test has not been reviewed by FDA.
Until the test is authorized by FDA, any statements in the test reports and other labeling
that expressly state or imply that the test has been authorized by FDA would be false.
Similarly, any statements in the test reports and other labeling that state or imply that
EUA issuance or FDA authorization are imminent or pending could be misleading.
2. Developers should make publicly available on their website the instructions for use for
the test and data about the test’s performance characteristics, including a summary of
assay performance.
3. Instructions for use and patient test reports for serology tests should include information
that helps users and patients understand the test results, including the following:
·
·
·

Negative results do not preclude acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. If acute infection is
suspected, direct (i.e., diagnostic) testing for SARS-CoV-2 is necessary.
Results from antibody testing should not be used to diagnose or exclude acute
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus strains, such as coronavirus HKU1, NL63, OC43, or 229E.

In addition, as noted in previous versions of this guidance and earlier in this updated guidance,
unless and until an EUA is issued that authorizes additional testing environments for a specific
test, under CLIA, use of that test is limited to high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratories,
including testing at the POC when the site is covered by such a laboratory’s CLIA certificate.

D. Modifications to EUA­Authorized Diagnostic COVID­19
Tests
Throughout the course of the pandemic, FDA has issued various policies with respect to
modifications and, as discussed further below, FDA is updating these policies. The policies in
this section do not apply to at-home tests or tests with at-home specimen collection.
In order to provide transparency, when a developer is distributing or offering a test that is a
modification of an EUA-authorized diagnostic test prior to or without authorization of the
modified test, as discussed in this section, the recommendations in Section IV.C.2 of this updated
guidance apply. FDA further recommends that the developer post data about the modified test’s
performance characteristics on the developer’s website, and that the instructions for use or test

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
protocol and the test reports accurately reflect the modification and prominently disclose that the
test has been modified since authorization by FDA and that the modified test has not been
reviewed by FDA.
If FDA identifies a significant problem or concern with a modified test, based either on the
provided information or external reports, that cannot be addressed in a timely manner, FDA
generally would expect the developer to cease distribution, marketing and offering the modified
test and address such problem, which could include conducting a recall of the modified test
and/or notification concerning corrected test reports indicating prior test results may not be
accurate.

(1) Modifications Made After Issuance of this Updated Guidance
In addition to the priorities above, FDA intends to review supplemental EUA requests that fulfill
a condition of an EUA. For other supplemental requests, such as those that are beyond the
priorities outlined above, FDA encourages developers to consider including the modification in a
submission through a traditional premarket review pathway. In general, FDA expects such
modified tests to be authorized under an EUA or pursuant to a traditional premarket review
pathway before being distributed or offered.
When a high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory is modifying an authorized COVID-19
molecular diagnostic test, including one for which such laboratory is not the developer of the
original, EUA-authorized test, and the modifications do not change the indication for use set
forth in the EUA (e.g., including new/different extraction kits or instruments that would not be
expected to change the indication for use) and do not change the analyte specific reagents (e.g.,
the modifications do not change the PCR primers and/or probes),18 FDA does not intend to
object to implementation of the modification to the diagnostic test without notification to FDA or
a new or amended EUA where the laboratory has validated the modification and confirmed that
the performance of the modified test is equivalent to the performance of the authorized test, and
use of the test is limited to the high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory in which the
modification was made.19
In such cases, where the laboratory modifying and performing the test is not the developer of the
original, EUA-authorized test, FDA encourages the laboratory to collaborate with the developer
of the authorized test so that validation data supporting the modifications can be submitted by the
original developer to FDA in a supplemental EUA request or incorporated into a future
submission through the traditional premarket review pathways.

18

Other modifications, including new specimen types, test settings (e.g., point-of-care, home testing), and new
patient populations (e.g., asymptomatic individuals), among others, do not fall under this policy.
19
FDA generally considers equivalent performance to be where the LoD of the modified test (using the same
validation material used in the LoD study described in the authorized test’s Instructions For Use (IFU)) is within 3x
of the LoD established in the authorized test’s IFU or that the LoD of the modified test is within 3x of the LoD of
the authorized test in a direct comparison LoD study.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(2) Certain Modifications Made Before Issuance of this Updated
Guidance
Under previous versions of this guidance, when a commercial manufacturer made certain
modifications to its EUA-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test, and where validation data
supporting the modification had been submitted in a supplemental EUA request, FDA stated that
it did not intend to object to implementation of the modification while FDA conducted its
review, except for modifications to add specimen types that have not been previously authorized
with another test of the same technology. For such modifications made and implemented as
discussed in the policies in the previous version of the guidance, FDA does not intend to object
to such commercial manufacturers continuing to implement the modification while FDA
conducts its review.
Under previous versions of the guidance, when a high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory
modified an EUA-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test20 prior to November 15, 2021, for use
with a new specimen type, where the new specimen type has been previously authorized for
another test of the same technology21 and where the laboratory had validated the test for the new
specimen type, FDA stated that it did not intend to object to the use of such a modified test
without notification to FDA or a new or amended EUA. For all other types of modifications
made by the high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory prior to November 15, 2021, for an
EUA-authorized COVID-19 diagnostic test, in previous versions of the guidance, FDA stated
that it did not intend to object to the use of the test by high-complexity CLIA-certified
laboratories, without notification to FDA or a new or amended EUA, where the modified test is
validated using a bridging study to the EUA-authorized test.
For high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratories that modified an authorized COVID-19
molecular diagnostic test after November 15, 2021, but before issuance of the September 27,
2022, version of the guidance, including one for which such laboratory is not the developer of
the original, EUA-authorized test, and the modifications do not change the indication for use set
forth in the EUA (e.g., including new/different extraction kits or instruments that would not be
expected to change the indication for use) and do not change the analyte specific reagents (e.g.,
the modifications do not change the PCR primers and/or probes),22 FDA stated that it did not
intend to object to implementation of the modification to the diagnostic test without notification
to FDA or a new or amended EUA where the laboratory has validated the modification and
confirmed that the performance of the modified test is equivalent to the performance of the
authorized test, and use of the test is limited to the high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratory in
which the modification was made.23
20

This applies to modifications to any EUA-authorized diagnostic test, including a laboratory’s own test with an
EUA or a purchased kit from a commercial manufacturer with an EUA, but does not apply to modifications of
authorized home collection kits.
21
For the purposes of this guidance, all nucleic acid amplification tests are considered to have the same technology.
22
Other modifications, including new specimen types, test settings (e.g., point-of-care, home testing), and new
patient populations (e.g., asymptomatic individuals), among others, do not fall under this policy.
23
FDA generally considers equivalent performance to be where the LoD of the modified test (using the same
validation material used in the LoD study described in the authorized test’s Instructions For Use (IFU)) is within 3x
of the LoD established in the authorized test’s IFU or that the LoD of the modified test is within 3x of the LoD of
the authorized test in a direct comparison LoD study.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

For such modifications made and implemented by high-complexity CLIA-certified laboratories
as discussed in the policies in the previous versions of the guidance, FDA does not intend to
object to such laboratories continuing to offer any of those modified tests.
In such cases, where the laboratory performing the modified test is not the developer of the
original, EUA-authorized test, FDA encourages the laboratory to share its validation data with
the developer of the original, EUA-authorized test so that the developer of the original, EUAauthorized test can use the validation data in support of a supplemental EUA request to add the
modification or can incorporate it into a future submission through the traditional premarket
review pathways.

V.

Validation

All clinical tests should be validated using clinical specimens and an appropriate comparator test
prior to use.
In the context of a public health emergency, it is critically important that tests be validated prior
to use because false results not only can negatively impact the individual patient but also can
have a broad public health impact. However, FDA also generally accepts a lower level of
evidence of validation for an EUA than for traditional premarket review pathways. FDA has
provided recommendations regarding testing that should be performed to ensure analytical and
clinical validity to the level of evidence expected for an EUA, including descriptions of
appropriate comparators for different types of tests, in the EUA templates available through
download from our website.24 Depending on the characteristics of a developer’s test, additional
validation studies may be recommended.
Because the level of evidence required for authorization under traditional premarket review
pathways is higher than that required for an EUA, the recommendations in the EUA templates
may not be sufficient for developers seeking marketing authorization of their tests through
traditional premarket review pathways. FDA can provide recommendations specific to a test
developer’s situation through inquiries to CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov or through presubmission interactions.25
Developers can use alternative approaches. FDA encourages developers to discuss any
alternative technological approaches to validating their test with FDA through CDRH-EUATemplates@FDA.HHS.GOV.

Additionally, FDA continues to expect certain serology tests to be independently evaluated by
NIH/NCI,26 prior to authorization, when requested by the FDA. When performed, this additional
testing can assist FDA in determining whether the EUA issuance criteria in section 564 of the
FD&C Act have been met and whether FDA should authorize the test. This independent
evaluation may also be used to assist FDA in determining whether the criteria for marketing
authorization have been met for tests submitted through traditional premarket review pathways.

VI. Availability of EUA Templates and Inquiries Regarding
Validation
FDA has made available through download from our website27 a series of templates that
developers may choose to use to facilitate the preparation and submission of an EUA request for
various types of COVID-19 tests. The templates reflect FDA’s current thinking on validation
recommendations for SARS-CoV-2 tests and the data and information that developers should
submit to facilitate the EUA process. The templates provide information and recommendations,
and FDA plans to update them as appropriate as more is learned about COVID-19 and more
experience is gained with the EUA process for the various types of COVID-19 tests. Developers
may use alternative approaches. Developers who are considering alternative approaches should
consider seeking FDA’s feedback.
FDA can provide validation recommendations specific to a test developer’s situation both for
those seeking EUA and for those seeking marketing authorization through traditional review
pathways. Developers can send simple inquiries to CDRH-EUA-Templates@fda.hhs.gov or
submit a pre-EUA or pre-submission for more complex inquiries.28 For tests seeking marketing
authorization through traditional premarket review pathways, FDA may recommend validation
studies or supportive evidence in addition to the recommendations in the EUA templates.
Members of the public can submit questions about the templates to CDRH-EUATemplates@FDA.HHS.GOV, or they can submit comments regarding the templates to the public
docket established for this guidance.

26

The FDA is working with the NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and BARDA to assess
the performance of certain commercial manufacturers’ serology tests. As part of this project, the FDA, working with
partnering agencies, has designed a performance assessment protocol that offers a mechanism for an independent
evaluation of certain lateral flow and certain enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or similar technologybased SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests in a laboratory environment. Under this protocol, each test evaluated at the
NIH/NCI will be evaluated with a well-characterized sample panel consisting of positive and negative plasma and/or
serum samples. The approach represents a balanced attempt to provide a reasonable understanding of the potential
performance of a significant number of the tests within a short time period. Performance results are considered
during FDA’s review of an EUA request for the test.
