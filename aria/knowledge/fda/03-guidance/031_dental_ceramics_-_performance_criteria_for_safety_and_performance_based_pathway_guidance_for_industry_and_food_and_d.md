Dental Ceramics – Performance
Criteria for Safety and Performance
Based Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for dental ceramics in support of the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway. Under this framework, submitters (you) planning to submit a
510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for dental ceramics will have the option
to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence,
rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject device to that of a predicate
device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.

In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter could
demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the specific set of
performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an appropriate predicate
for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria represent performance
that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed devices of that device type.
Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature,
and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed dental ceramics to determine the
performance criteria and associated testing methods that could support a finding of substantial
equivalence for dental ceramics as described in this guidance. FDA recognizes that in some
cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing against an appropriate
predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of performance and
technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate performance
criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the optional device-specific Safety
and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance criteria identified in this guidance
provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The scope of this guidance includes dental ceramics. These Class II devices and are regulated
under 21 CFR 872.6660, Porcelain powder for clinical use (product code EIH), and under 21
CFR 872.3920, Porcelain tooth (product code ELL).
The following devices are outside the scope of this guidance:
· Posterior artificial teeth with metal inserts under 21 CFR 872.3900 (product code ELJ)1
· Backing and facing for artificial teeth under 21 CFR 872.3910 (product code ELK)1
· Endosseous dental implants under 21 CFR 872.3640 (product codes DZE, NRQ, and
OAT)
· Endosseous dental implant abutments under 21 CFR 872.3630 (product code NHA)
· Temporary crown and bridge resin under 21 CFR 872.3770 (product codes EBG and
POW)
· Tooth shade resin material under 21 CFR 872.3690 (product code EBF)
· Bone grafting materials under 21 CFR 872.3930

This Class I device is considered exempt from premarket notification. However, if the limits of exemption in 21
CFR 872.9 are exceeded and premarket notification would be required, then the device would be outside the scope
of this guidance.

Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The dental ceramics that fall within the scope of this guidance document are devices consisting
of a mixture of kaolin, felspar, quartz, or other substances intended for use in the production of
artificial teeth in fixed or removable dentures, of jacket crowns, facings, bridges, and veneers.
The devices are used in prosthetic dentistry by heating the powder mixture to a high temperature
in an oven to produce a hard restoration or prosthesis with a glass-like finish. These devices are
for prescription use only.
Device Design Characteristics:
The following types of dental ceramic materials are within the scope of this guidance and are
defined in the FDA-recognized consensus standard ISO 6872 Dentistry – Ceramic materials:
— Type I: Ceramic products that are provided as powders, pastes, or aerosols.
— Type II: All other forms of ceramic products.
Within ISO 6872, dental ceramics are further divided into five classes according to their intended
clinical use and indications as follows:
— Class 1:
a) Monolithic ceramic for single-unit anterior prostheses, veneers, inlays, or onlays
adhesively cemented.
b) Ceramic for coverage of a metal framework or a ceramic substructure.
— Class 2:
a) Monolithic ceramic for single-unit anterior or posterior prostheses adhesively
cemented.
b) Partially or fully covered substructure ceramic for single-unit anterior or posterior
prostheses adhesively cemented.
— Class 3:
a) Monolithic ceramic for single-unit anterior or posterior prostheses and for three-unit
prostheses not involving molar restoration, adhesively or non-adhesively cemented.
b) Partially or fully covered substructure for single-unit anterior or posterior prostheses
and for three-unit prostheses not involving molar restoration, adhesively or nonadhesively cemented.
— Class 4:
a) Monolithic ceramic for three-unit prostheses involving molar restoration.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
b) Partially or fully covered substructure for three-unit prostheses involving molar
restoration.
— Class 5:
Monolithic ceramic for prostheses involving partially or fully covered substructure for
four or more units or fully covered substructure for prostheses involving four or more
units.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion with
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k) as described in FDA guidance Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DOC) 2) recommended for each test or evaluation
below. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions under
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the sections below, test information
such as results summary, test protocols, and complete test reports should be submitted as part of
the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway. For
additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please

Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, referred to in the rest of this document as the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
External Communicating Devices in contact with tissue/bone/dentin with a prolonged or
permanent contact duration of >30 days and you should assess the endpoints below per
Attachment A of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Oral Mucosa Irritation
· Acute Systemic Toxicity – Oral Application
· Subacute/Subchronic Toxicity – Oral Application
· Genotoxicity
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological

response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. As described in the FDA guidance Safety
and Performance Based Pathway, if a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria
identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program; however, the previously established
510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are
conducted, including Traditional, Special, or Abbreviated 510(k), remain available.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from FDA Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus standards:
·
·

ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and
testing within a risk management process
ISO 7405 Dentistry – Evaluation of biocompatibility of medical devices used in
dentistry (this standard is an application of ISO 10993-1 to dental devices)

Performance Criteria: All direct tissue contacting components of the device and devicespecific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
