On January 20, 2023, FDA issued a final rule entitled “Radiological Health Regulations;
Amendments to Records and Reports for Radiation Emitting Electronic Products; Amendments
to Performance Standards for Diagnostic X-ray, Laser, and Ultrasonic Products” (88 FR 3638)1.
This final rule went into effect on February 21, 2023 and amended the records and reporting
requirements for electronic products and medical devices by removing or reducing some of the
annual reports and test record requirements that are unnecessary or may be duplicative of other
reporting requirements (see 21 CFR 1002.1), among other changes. The amendments codified
long-standing policies previously found in Low Power Laser Reporting Exemption (Laser Notice
41) and Clarification of Compliance Requirements for Certain Manufacturers Who Incorporate
Certified Class I Laser Products into Their Products (Laser Notice 42).
In addition, Laser Products - Conformance with IEC 60825-1 Ed. 3 and IEC 60601-2-22 Ed. 3.1
(Laser Notice No. 56): Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff 2 revises
certain policies within this Compliance Guide for Laser Products.

INTRODUCTION
This guide briefly summarizes the requirements of the regulations under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), Chapter V, Subchapter C Electronic Product Radiation Control, that applies to manufacturers of laser
products. It explains the performance, labeling, and informational requirements
of the standard and the procedures for remedial actions and for variances or
exemptions. It does not replace the regulations, however, and if there is any
conflict between the guide and the regulations, the regulations must prevail.
Throughout this guide, pertinent sections of Title 21, Code of Federal
Regulations, Chapter I, Subchapter J, are cited in parentheses. Please consult
them before making design or procedural decisions. The guide is current through
the most recent amendments to the standard which were published in 1985.
Specific questions may be directed to the Electronic Products Branch (HFZ-240),
Office of Communication, Education, and Radiation Programs, Center for Devices
and Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, 9200 Corporate Blvd.,
Rockville, MD 20850, 240-276-3332. Laser Notices to Industry are issued
periodically whenever it is determined that an issue needs further
clarification, or when CDRH establishes a new policy regarding certain
requirements. These Notices can be requested from the Electronic Products
Branch or the Division of Small Manufacturers, International, and Consumer
Assistance (DSMICA), at 1-800-638-2041. DSMICA should be contacted for requests
of any current documents, reporting guides, and regulatory guidance on
radiation-emitting products and medical devices.
The following definitions are basic to the regulations:
A laser is a device capable of producing or amplifying electromagnetic radiation
in the wavelength range from 180 to 1 x 106* nanometers by the process of
controlled stimulated emission [1040.10(b)(19)].
A laser system consists of a laser in conjunction with its power supply
[1040.10(b)(23)].
A laser product is any device that constitutes, incorporates, or is intended to
incorporate a laser or laser system [1040.10(b)(21)].

A manufacturer is any person or organization in the business of making,
assembling, importing [1000.3(f)], or modifying laser products [1040.10(i)].
As explained in this guide, manufacturers of laser products must:
•design and manufacture their products to be in compliance with the standard;
•test their products to assure compliance;
•certify compliance of their products;
•maintain test and distribution records and a file of correspondence
concerning radiation safety, safety complaints, and inquiries;
•use the published reporting guides to submit reports to CDRH, including Laser
Product Reports describing compliance of the product design and testing
program and Annual Reports summarizing required records;
•report accidental radiation occurrences (i.e., possible, suspected, and known
exposures);
•report any radiation defects or noncompliances; and
•recall (i.e., repair, replace, or refund the purchase price of) defective or
noncompliant products.
Manufacturers of OEM laser products (laser components for sale to manufacturers
of laser products) are required to register and submit certain minimal
information to CDRH, including the product name, model number, and the laser
medium or wavelength [1040.10(a)(3)].

THE

The laser standard applies to all laser products manufactured on or after August
2, 1976 [1040.10(a)], unless the products are either: sold to a manufacturer for
use as components (or replacements) in products that will be certified
[1040.10(a)(1)]; sold by or for a manufacturer as repair or replacement
components if they are properly labeled as such and have installation
instructions [1040.10)(a)(2)]; or intended for export only, are labeled as such,
and comply with the requirements of the importing country (1010.20).
Manufacturers of laser products that are sold to other manufacturers for use as
components in their products are required to register and list such products,
following the OEM registration and listing requirements in 1040.10(a)(3).

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

In designing laser products, manufacturers must first determine the level of
laser radiation to which human access is necessary during operation
[1040.10(b)(27)] in order for the product to perform its intended function.
This level should be determined in terms of the nature of the product, as well
as significant economic and design factors. A laser radiation field is within
human access [1040.10(b)(15)] if it can be intercepted by any part of the body,
or if the levels are in Class IIIb or IV and can be reflected by a single flat
surface through any opening or hole in the product. Laser radiation to which
human access is not necessary must be eliminated or contained within a
protective housing [1040.10(f)(1)].
Manufacturers must then determine the Class of their products [1040.10(c)]
according to the highest level of laser radiation accessible during operation.
The Class of the product determines the requirements for controls, indicators,
and warnings on the product and warnings in its literature. The wording of any
required warning is based on the injury-causing potential of accessible laser
radiation. The standard also contains additional requirements for specificpurpose laser products. Appendix A is a table summarizing the requirements of
the standard.

CLASSIFICATION

OF

LASER

PRODUCTS

Laser products are classified on the basis of the highest level of laser
radiation to which human access [1040.10(b)15)] is possible during operation
only. Other laser radiation fields to which human access is necessary only
during maintenance or service do not affect the classification but may affect
the labeling and safety interlock requirements. Use-factor data, if available
and adequately convincing, may be used in determining the level of laser
emissions from a product.
The standard establishes the following limits for the Classes:
Class I limits [1040.10(b)(5) and 1040.10(d)(Table I)] apply to devices that
have emissions in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectra, and are limits
below which biological hazards have not been established. In the visible and
near infra-red spectra there are separate Class I limits for radiant energy
(power) and integrated radiance (radiance); both limits must be exceeded for the
device to move from Class I.
Class IIa limits [1040.10(b)(6) and 1040.10(d)(Table II-A)] apply to products
whose visible emission does not exceed Class I limits for emission durations of
1000 seconds or less and are not intended for viewing. Class IIa limits
therefore may not exceed the Class II limits. An example of a Class IIa laser
product might be a supermarket scanner.

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 3

Class II limits [1040.10(b)(7) and 1040.10(d)(Table II)] apply to products that
have emissions in the visible spectrum (400 to 710 nm) for emission durations in
excess of 0.25 second, providing that emissions for other durations and/or
wavelengths do not exceed the Class I limits. Class II products are considered
a hazard for direct long-term ocular exposure.
Class IIIa limits [1040.10(b)(8) and 1040.10(d)(Table III-A)] apply to products
that have emissions in the visible spectrum and that have beams where the total
collectable radiant power does not exceed 5 milliwatts. Class IIIa products
include most helium-neon lasers.
Class IIIb limits [1040.10(b)(9) and 1040.10(d)(Table III-B)] apply to devices
that emit in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared spectra. Class IIIb
products include laser systems ranging from 5 to 500 milliwatts in the visible
spectrum. Class IIIb emission levels are ocular hazards for direct exposure
throughout the range of the Class, and skin hazards at the higher levels of the
Class.
Class IV levels [1040.10(b)(11)] exceed the limits of Class IIIb and are a
hazard for scattered (diffuse) reflection as well as for direct exposure.
The Class limit expressions are given in Tables I, II-A, II, III-A, and III-B
and are functions of wavelength and emission duration. Included in the
expressions of the limits are two factors, k1 and k2, dependent on wavelength and
emission duration. The values of k1 and k2 are in Tables IV and V. The
expressions also indicate the units of the limit:
J, the unit for radiant energy (joules);
J cm-2 sr-1, the unit for integrated radiance; and
J cm-2, the unit for radiant exposure.
Specific conditions are given for the determination or measurement of these
parameters [1040.10(e)]:
Radiant energy (J) or radiant power (W) is the energy or power detected through
a 7 mm diameter circular aperture with a solid angle of acceptance* of 10-3
steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less [1040.10(e)(3)(i)] for
laser products intended to be used where viewing with optical instruments is
unlikely. Otherwise a 50 mm aperture stop must be used.
__________________
* Solid angle of acceptance refers to that solid angle subtended by the source
at the point of measurement. The solid angle of acceptance is therefore
independent of detector aperture. A 7 mm diameter source subtends 10-3 sr
at 20 cm, and a 0.7 mm diameter source subtends a 10-5 sr at 20 cm.

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 4

Integrated radiance (J cm-2 sr-1) or radiance (W cm-2 sr-1) is the energy or power
detected through a 7 mm diameter circular aperture with a solid angle of
acceptance of 10-5 steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less,
divided by that solid angle and by 0.385 cm2, the area of the aperture
[1040.10(e)(3)(iii)].
Radiant exposure (J cm-2) is the energy detected through a 7 mm diameter circular
aperture, divided by 0.385 cm2, the area of the aperture [1040.10(e)(3)(ii)].
Irradiance (W cm-2) is the power detected through a 7 mm diameter circular
aperture with a solid angle of acceptance of 10-3 steradian with collimating
optics of 5 diopters or less, divided by 0.385 cm2 [1040.10(e)(3)(ii)].
If the limit of a Class is exceeded at any emission duration, the product cannot
be in that Class; all possible emission durations must be considered, ranging
from single nanosecond pulses (1 x 10-9 sec) to the very long term average
(greater than 104 seconds).
Measurements to determine classification must be made with the measuring
instrument positioned for maximum detection and with all controls on the laser
product adjusted to achieve maximum emission [1040.10(e)(2)]. If calculations
are used instead of measurements, all values must be justified and must
represent a worst-case analysis.
The measurement parameters for radiant energy, power, and irradiance also state
that collimating optics must be used, if appropriate, in order to account for
diverging laser sources. The collimating optics must have an optical power of 5
diopters or less (20 cm or longer focal length), as necessary to maximize
detection. Naturally collimated or expanded laser beams that have low
divergence and maximum detectability without collimating optics must be measured
so that all the energy collectable within the specified aperture stop is
considered. Multiple beams or diffuse sources that lie within a solid angle of
acceptance of 10-3 sr must be included in the measurement.
If the laser radiation is scanned, measurements of radiant energy and power are
made with a 7 mm diameter 2 circular aperture having a solid angle of acceptance
of 10-3 steradian with collimating optics of 5 diopters or less [1040.10(e)(3)].
If the angular rate of scanning is less than 5 radians/sec, the direction of
the solid angle of acceptance must also track the scan.
Note that products are classified according to the maximum level of laser
radiation within human access during operation only. Levels accessible only
during maintenance or service do not affect the classification. Hence, it is
possible for Class I products to contain Class IV lasers.

2

After August 20, 1986, a 50 mm diameter circular aperture must be
substituted for the 7 mm aperture in situations such as a laser
light show where viewing with optical instruments is likely.

It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to determine whether specific
functions are operation, maintenance, or service. In general, the following
definitions apply.
Operation [1040.10(b)(27)] consists of functions by which the product
accomplishes its intended purpose; these may include loading work-pieces or
documents and setting and manipulating external controls.
Maintenance [1040.10(b)(24)] consists of functions performed by the user to
assure performance; these may include cleaning and replenishment of expendables.
Service [1040.10(b)(38)] usually means repair. It may be performed by specially
trained service personnel or by sophisticated users following instructions
specifically indicated as service instructions. Certain maintenance procedures
will be considered service if they are infrequent, complex, or highly
specialized.
Collateral radiation [1040.10(b)(12)] is generally any optical, electromagnetic,
or x radiation that is either necessary for, or occurs as a result of, the
operation of a laser. Collateral radiation includes x radiation produced by a
high voltage power supply, plasma glow in a discharge tube, excitation lamp
light or reradiation from a workpiece. Limits for collateral optical radiation
are the same as the Class I limits for laser radiation for 1000 seconds or less;
limits for collateral x radiation are 0.5 milliroentgen in an hour averaged over
an area of 10 cm2 parallel to the product surface with no dimension greater than
5 cm [1040.10(d)(Table VI)].
If a laser product produces emissions of multiple wavelengths
[1040.10(d)(1),(2),(3)], the levels of the emissions must be added if their
wavelengths are within any individual wavelength range indicated in Table I, IIA, II, III-A, or III-B; the emission levels may be considered separately if they
lie in different wavelength ranges.

REQUIREMENTS FOR LASER PRODUCTS

PERFORMANCE

REQUIREMENTS

The standard specifies performance requirements according to the Class of the
laser product and the accessible laser radiation. Note that, where the standard
requires a particular performance feature, the feature must be readily
identifiable as such on the product. Failure to properly identify required
features may lead to difficulties in determining product compliance.
The applicability of many requirements depends on whether the product is a laser
or a laser system [1040.10(b)(19),(23)].
A protective housing [1040.10(f)(1)] is required for all laser products. The
protective housing must prevent human access to laser radiation in excess of the
limits of Class I (and collateral radiation in excess of the collateral
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 6

radiation limits) at all places and times where and when such human access is
not necessary in order for the product to accomplish its intended function. In
essence, this requirement means that the product must be of the lowest possible
Class. The manufacturer must be prepared to justify the necessity of human
access to laser radiation greater than Class I limits. If the purpose of the
laser system is to generate a laser beam, the justification is self-evident. In
other cases, a detailed analysis may be required. Generally, a protective
housing must be contiguous. The most common difficulties with protective
housings have been human access to laser radiation through cooling vents or
through a poor fit between sections of a protective housing. A protective
housing must be sturdy enough to prevent access caused by bending or warping as
the product ages.
Specific guidance for industrial workstations large enough for a person to enter
is given in the Laser Notice to Industry # 37 (October 21, 1985). The notice
specifies security measures to be taken in designing the protective
housing/interlock system in order to avoid certain hazardous conditions, such as
someone being inside the enclosure when the equipment is operated.
Safety interlocks [1040.10(f)(2)] may be required on any laser product. They
must prevent human access to laser or collateral radiation that exceeds the
limits of Class I and Table VI when a protective housing is opened during
operation or maintenance, and human access to the interior radiation is not
always necessary during such operation or maintenance. (Note that if the
housing must be opened during operation and it is necessary to have access to
the interior radiation, the level of the interior radiation must be considered
when classifying the product, i.e., the classification is determined by the
interior level, if it is higher than the exterior level. If the intermittent
access to laser radiation occurs only during a maintenance procedure, it does
not affect the Class of the product.) If access to the interior radiation is
sometimes needed, the interlock may be defeatable and the housing must be so
labeled. Safety interlocks need not prevent access to interior radiation
otherwise accessible only during service. See Safety Interlock Requirements
flow chart for clarification.

Safety Interlock Requirements

<Graphics here>

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 7

Safety interlocks to protect from Class IIIb or IV levels must also be redundant
or fail-safe; if fail-safe, they must either prevent opening the housing in case
they fail or they must be incapable of failing in a mode that would permit
access. Defeatable safety interlocks must provide a visible or audible
indication of defeat; further, it must not be possible to close the housing with
the interlock remaining defeated. A redundant or fail-safe safety interlock is
also required if failure of a single interlock would allow access to laser
radiation in excess of the accessible emission limits of Class II to be emitted
directly through the opening created by removal or displacement of the
interlocked portion of the protective housing.
Snap-action spring switches are subject to short-circuit failure; they cannot
serve as fail-safe safety interlocks. However, such a switch could be used in
series with a second such switch or with a solenoid-operated door latch if the
access door would remain latched in the event of switch failure.
CDRH has not objected to the use of switching elements consisting of shorting
bars or plugs and sockets that operate by physical removal of a part of the
electrical circuit when the housing is opened. CDRH has also not objected to
the use of cam- or wedge-driven switches in conjunction with a mechanical latch
or key.
A remote interlock connector [1040.10(f)(3)] is required on all Class IIIb and
IV laser systems. The purpose of the remote interlock connector is to permit
the user to connect a remote barrier interlock, emergency stop switch, or
similar device. The circuit must be such that, when the terminals of the
connector are open, human access to laser radiation is prevented. The
electrical potential across the connector terminals must not be greater than 130
volts rms. A shorted mating connector may be provided by the manufacturer to
allow the product to be operated when the remote interlock connector is not
being used.
A key control [1040.10(f)(4)] is required for Class IIIb and IV laser systems in
order for the user to prevent unauthorized operation. The key must not be
removable in the "on" position. A computer password may serve as an adequate
key control provided that the password must be reentered each time the computer
is turned on or the laser operation sequence is begun.
An emission indicator [1040.10(f)(5)] is required on Class II, IIIa, IIIb, and
IV laser systems. The indicator can be visible or audible. On Class IIIb and
IV laser systems the indication must precede emission by a length of time
sufficient to allow users and others in the area to recognize that the product
has been energized so they can avoid expo-sure. Depending on the action required
and the level of laser radiation involved, the time needed can vary
considerably; typical values are in the range of 2 to 20 seconds. Emission
indicators must be duplicated on lasers (heads) and operation controls if they
are capable of being separated by greater than 2 meters.
A beam attenuator [1040.10(f)(6)] is required on Class II, IIIa, IIIb, and IV
laser systems. The beam attenuator is a mechanical or electrical device such as
a shutter or attenuator that blocks emission. The beam attenuator blocks bodily
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 8

access to laser radiation above Class I limits without the need to turn off the
laser. The beam attenuator must be available for use at all times during
operation. Power switches and key controls do not satisfy the beam attenuator
requirement. Manufacturers may apply for approval of alternate means of
providing this protection if a beam attenuator is inappropriate to the product.
Note: If a beam attenuator would be inappropriate for your product, you may
apply for approval of alternate means of providing the protection that a beam
attenuator would provide.
Operating controls [1040.10(f)(7)] on a Class II, IIIa, IIIb or IV laser product
must be located such that it is not necessary for the user to be exposed while
manipulating them.
Viewing optics, viewports, or display screens [1040.10(f)(8)] may not provide
human access to laser or collateral radiation in excess of the limits of Class I
and Table VI during operation or maintenance. If the viewing optics employ a
shutter or variable attenuator, the shutter or attenuator must be fail-safe;
that is, it must be designed such that, upon failure, it is impossible to open
the shutter or vary the attenuation. Viewing optics include such devices as
viewports, windows, microscopes on welding and drilling devices, and operating
microscopes on surgical lasers. Attenuation may be total, or it may be partial
as with a filter. Acceptable designs may prevent laser operation until the
attenuator has moved into position. Service instructions must include
instructions or procedures to avoid hazardous exposure through viewing optics.
A scanning safeguard [1040.10(f)(9)] must prevent emission in excess of the
limits of the class of the product. For Class IIIb or IV laser products that
operate in both scanned and unscanned modes, the scanning safeguard also must
prevent emission in excess of the limits of the class of the scanned laser
radiation (and whose failure would result in emissions exceeding Class IIIa).
Scanned laser radiation is laser radiation that is moved in translation or by
changing direction. A scan failure safeguard must have a reaction time short
enough to operate before levels of a higher Class are emitted; it is possible to
achieve this performance by means of a high inertia scanner in conjunction with
an electromechanical shutter.
A manual reset [1040.10(f)(10)] is required on Class IV laser systems
manufactured after August 20, 1986. It must prevent automatic restart after an
interruption due to remote interlock activation or from an interruption for more
than 5 seconds due to unexpected loss of main electrical power.

LABELING

REQUIREMENTS

A warning logotype [1040.10(g)(1),(2),(3)] is required on Class II, IIIa, IIIb,
and IV laser products. The regulations specify the warning statement and
design, by product Class, for visible radiation. If there is emission in the
ultraviolet or infrared spectrum there must be a warning for invisible radiation
as well [1040.10(g)(8)]. The CAUTION warning logotype is for Class II laser
products and for IIIa laser products that have an irradiance not exceeding 2.5 x

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 9

10-3W cm-2. The DANGER warning is for Class IIIa laser products that have an
irradiance exceeding 2.5 x 10-3W cm-2, and for Class IIIb and IV laser products.
A specific warning statement without logotype is required on Class IIa products
[1040.10(g)(1)(i)].
The warning logotype must also contain [1040.10(g)(4)] a statement of the
maximum output, pulse duration (if pulsed), and the laser medium or emitted
wavelength(s).
Removable or displaceable protective housings [1040.10(g)(6),(7)] that are not
safety-interlocked or that have defeatable safety interlocks also require
warning labels. The severity of the warning depends on the type and level of
the interior laser radiation. Wording is specified; invisible, electromagnetic,
and x radiation must also be indicated if present. Labeling must also be
visible on the product prior to and during removal or displacement of the
housing and close to the opening involved.
An aperture warning label is required for each aperture through which laser
radiation in excess of Class I or IIa or collateral radiation in excess of Table
VI is emitted during operation [1040.10(g)(5)]. Wording is specified;
invisible, electromagnetic, and x radiation must also be indicated if present.
A certification label is required (1010.2) and must state that the manufacturer
certifies that the product complies with the standard or with an approved
variance. The certification statement must appear on a label on the product and
make specific reference to the regulations with which the product complies.
Minimum suitable statements would include:
"Complies with 21 CFR Chapter 1, Subchapter J."
"Complies with 21 CFR 1040.10 and 1040.11."

or

An identification label must be provided and must contain the name and address
of the manufacturer and the place, month, and year of manufacture; the month and
year of manufacture may not be abbreviated (1010.3). Alternate brand names,
other company names, or a coded place of manufacture may be used if an
explanation is provided to CDRH.
All required labels must be permanently affixed, and must be readable without
requiring exposure to levels exceeding Class I.
Note: If certain labeling requirements are inappropriate for your product, you
may apply for approval of alternate labeling.

INFORMATIONAL

REQUIREMENTS

Informational requirements apply to user information for operation and
maintenance, to purchasing information such as brochures and specification
sheets, and to servicing information.
User information must contain [1040.10(h)(1)]:
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 10

•instructions for operation and maintenance, with appropriate warnings to
avoid exposure;
•radiation specifications;
•reproductions and locations of labels that are required by the standard and
that are accessible during operation and maintenance;
•a listing of all controls and adjustments; and
•a caution statement, as specified in the regulations, concerning possible
hazardous exposure if instructions are not followed. Note: If this
warning statement is not appropriate to your product, you may request
approval of a more specific warning better suited to your product.
Additional requirements for certain laser workstations are contained in Laser
Notice # 39, that addresses the multi-axis, robotic, high power laser
workstations that are not Class I due to the need to accommodate all sizes of
workpieces. The notice discusses hazards unique to these products and proposes
specific information required in the user's manual. This includes identifying
the locations around the workstation where laser radiation levels may exceed
Class I and the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) boundaries. Remember that
the operator must be able to operate the machine from a Class I area, per
1040.10(f)(7), so special shielding may be required. See the notice for further
instruction.
Brochures and specification sheets must include a reproduction (color optional)
of a complete warning logotype or Class IIa warning statement as required on the
product [1040.10(h)(2)(i)].
Servicing information must contain [1040.10(h)(2)(ii)]:
•procedures for service with appropriate warnings to avoid exposure;
•a schedule of maintenance to maintain the product in compliance;
•a listing of controls that could increase the level of accessible radiation;
•identification of removable portions of protective housings;
•procedures to avoid exposure; and
•reproductions of required labels (color optional) and warnings.
At the discretion of the manufacturer, user and service information may or may
not appear in the same manual. Service procedures, however, must be clearly
identified as such. In many cases, the classification of a given procedure as
maintenance or service determines whether a safety interlock is required.

Medical laser products are laser products that are medical devices manufactured,
designed, intended, or promoted for in vivo irradiation of the human body for
diagnosis, surgery, therapy, or determining relative position of the human body.
Class IIIa, IIIb, and IV medical laser products must contain a means for
measuring the delivered exposure or treatment level of radiation, accurate
within ±20 percent. This requirement is not applicable to Class IIIa aiming
devices except ophthalmic application. The instruction manual must include a
procedure and schedule for recalibration of the measurement system. A modified
aperture label is also specified [1040.11(a)].
Please note that, according to the definition given in 1040.10(b)(26), a medical
laser product may not be a medical device. However, if you need information on
the medical device regulations, premarket approval and notification procedures,
investigational device exemptions, registration and device listing, please
contact DSMICA at 1-800-638-2041.
Surveying, leveling, and alignment laser products are generally used in
agriculture and in the construction industry. They are restricted to 5 mW
visible radiant power and to Class I for other wavelengths and pulses less than
3.8 x 10-4 seconds [1040.11(b)].
Demonstration laser products [1040.10(b)(13)] include:
•laser products promoted for classroom demonstration of optical phenomena;
•artistic displays and their associated apparatus;
•laser light show projectors; and
•laser light shows and displays themselves.
A general-purpose, scientific, medical or industrial laser product is not
considered to be a demonstration laser product when it is demonstrated to a
prospective purchaser.
Demonstration laser products are restricted in their outputs to Class IIIa with
its accompanying restrictions to Class I for short pulses and invisible
wavelengths [1040.11(c)]. Because these levels are too low for effective use in
commercial theatrical lighting effects, CDRH may grant variances (1010.4) to
manufacturers of laser light shows and display devices. As a condition of the
variance, the manufacturer must agree to adhere to several safety conditions to
provide a level of safety to the public equivalent to a fully compliant product.
Consult Appendix B, Clarification of Certain Laser Light Show Requirements, for
more information.
Class II and IIIa laser light show projection systems provide effective shows in
certain venues such as nightclubs and small theaters. Although Class I, II, and
IIIa laser light shows need not be reported to CDRH, manufacturers of the
projection systems must certify and report their products. CDRH has issued
Laser Notice # 40 (October 29, 1987) which provides detailed guidance with
operator's instructions, in order to assure safe installation and production of
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 12

safe shows. The notice discusses installation restrictions, scanning
safeguards, laser power measurements, specific requirements for user
instructions, and advertising.
It is mandatory that laser projectors never expose an audience to laser
radiation greater than Class I levels of radiation. A projector cannot be used
for audience scanning unless it is equipped with an adequate scanning safeguard.
See Appendix B for further clarification.

RECORDKEEPING, REPORTING, AND NOTIFICATION
RECORDKEEPING
The certification of compliance that the manufacturer places on the product must
be based upon a testing program that is adequate to ensure the claimed
compliance [1010.2(c)]. A thorough discussion of adequacy of testing programs
is contained in HHS Publication FDA 76-8036, "Quality Control Practices for
Compliance with the Federal Laser Product Performance Standard." If CDRH
believes a manufacturer is not operating in a state of control so as to assure
product compliance, the testing program may be disapproved, making further
introduction of the product into commerce illegal until such time as the testing
program is re-evaluated and approved.
Manufacturers are required to maintain records (1002.30) that include:
•a written description of the quality control procedures;
•results of tests or checks for compliance with the standard;
•results of life testing to substantiate that the product will not emit
increased levels of radiation with age as a result of deterioration and
that the product can be expected to remain in compliance when maintained
in accordance with the procedures given in the user and servicing
information;
•copies of written communications between the manufacturer and dealers,
distributors, and purchasers concerning radiation safety, including
complaints and instructions; and
•distribution of the products, to permit tracing in the event of recall. 3
Manufacturers must preserve the required records for a period of 5 years; must,
upon reasonable notice, permit FDA to inspect the records; and must submit
copies of records to CDRH upon request (1002.31).
Dealers and distributors must also maintain distribution records to permit
tracing in the event of recall (1002.40). Distributors may furnish the

Effective August 20, 1986, distribution records must be maintained for noncertified laser
products sold as components to original equipment manufacturers. See 1040.10(a)(3).

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 13

distribution records to the manufacturer or retain the records themselves.
Distributors who elect to maintain the records must:
•notify the manufacturer, in writing, of their intention to maintain the
records;
•maintain the records for a period of 5 years or, if they cease distribution,
furnish the required information to the manufacturer; and
•provide the information to the manufacturer when advised by the manufacturer
or by CDRH that the information is required for a product recall.

REPORTING

AND

NOTIFICATION

Manufacturers are required to furnish reports to CDRH to substantiate compliance
with the standard, to describe the testing program, and to provide other
information. Laser Product Reports are used to describe the:
•reported product and labeling;
•manner in which the product complies with the standard;
•testing program to assure compliance;
•life testing; and
•test equipment used.
The first submission of a Laser Product Report (1002.10) by a manufacturer was
originally designated an Initial Report, with all subsequent reports on new or
different models called Model Change Reports. Since these reports contain
essentially the same information, the single term, Product Report, is now used.
Changes in a reported model should generally be reported in a supplement to the
Product Report on that model.
Manufacturers are required to submit the Product Report prior to introduction of
the certified product into commerce. CDRH considers delivery of a product to a
prospective purchaser or for exhibition at a trade show to be introduction into
commerce. CDRH has issued a "Guide for Preparing Product Reports for Lasers and
Products Containing Lasers," and a "Reporting Guide for Laser Light Shows and
Displays." The appropriate Guide must be used and the report format must follow
that of the Guide [1002.7(b)].
An individual or firm that makes only one unit of a product on an occasional
basis is nevertheless considered to be a manufacturer and must certify and
report such units. The report may in some cases be briefer, especially in the
area of quality control procedures. However, the report must clearly describe
the product and how it complies. The manufacturer of such products is
encouraged to point out that the report is for a product manufactured on a onetime, one-unit basis.

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 14

A new or modified model belonging to a previously reported model family must be
reported in a Supplemental Report on that model family prior to its introduction
into commerce.
Several Laser Notices have been issued identifying certain categories of low
power laser products that have been exempted from certain reporting and
recordkeeping requirements. Notice # 36 (August 23, 1985) and # 41 (August 9,
1988) deal with products that are inherently Class I. A complete listing is
available from DSMA.
Class I, IIa, II, and IIIa laser products and laser products containing such
lasers will require: Product Report, Annual Report, test records,
manufacturer's distribution records, and dealer/distributor distribution
records. Note that for these classes no Supplemental Reports are required.
Furthermore, some Class I laser products have already been exempted from the
requirement for distribution records (see Notice to Industry dated August 9,
1988, Laser Notice # 41).

Class IIIb and IV laser products require all of the above plus Supplemental
Reports when the criteria requiring submission of Supplemental Reports are met.

Annual Reports (1002.13) summarize the records the manufacturer is required to
maintain (1002.30). Annual Reports must be submitted by September 1 of each
year for the year ending the preceding June 30. Each year, CDRH provides
guidelines for submission of Annual Reports that must be followed [1002.7(b)].
In addition, the Annual Report is the appropriate vehicle for identifying new
models for which Supplemental Reports are not required. If the new models do not
involve changes in radiation emission or performance requirements, or if they
have been exempted from reporting as a Product Report, then the manufacturer
need only identify them in their Annual Report, or in quarterly updates to the
Annual Report. Such model numbers should be reported in quarterly supplements
to the Annual Report. Quarterly updates should be clearly marked as such and
submitted prior to December 1, March 1, or June 1, as needed. Copies of the
Annual Report form to be followed are available from DSMA by calling 1-800-6382041.
Accidental radiation occurrences must be reported to CDRH by manufacturers
(1002.20), regardless of whether injury occurred. The report must include
identification of the product involved, the circumstances and details of the
incident, and actions taken to prevent recurrence.
Radiation defects or failure to comply with the standard must be reported to
CDRH (1003.10). Notification must also be provided to distributors and
purchasers.

RECALLS

Page 15

Manufacturers may be required to recall a laser product (1003), i.e., repair or
replace it or refund its purchase price, if the product fails to comply with the
standard or has a radiation defect (1003.2).
Notification to CDRH is required if the manufacturer becomes aware that a
product is defective or fails to comply (1003.10). Notification must be sent
immediately to CDRH and with reasonable promptness to distributors and
purchasers.
Notification to the manufacturer will be made if CDRH becomes aware (through
product inspection or report review) of a defect or failure to comply (1003.11).
The manufacturer will be advised of these findings and will be given a
reasonable time to refute the claimed defect or noncompliance.
Notification to distributors and purchasers is required (1003.21) if the
manufacturer does not successfully refute the alleged defect or noncompliance or
is not granted an exemption from the requirements for notification and repair.
CDRH will review the draft of the notification to avoid the need for a second
notification.
The manufacturer must also provide to CDRH a report (1003.20) stating:
•the total number of products so produced;
•the location of the violative products;
•an evaluation of the resultant hazards; and
•a corrective action plan (CAP) (1004).
Each corrective action plan is reviewed and may be approved with any necessary
changes or conditions. The manufacturer must then implement the approved plan.
FDA field offices monitor corrective actions for effectiveness.
An exemption from the requirements for notification and corrective action may be
requested if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the defect or noncompliance
does not create a significant risk of injury (1003.30 and 1003.31).
A manufacturer may not legally introduce products into commerce that have a
radiation defect or that fail to comply with the standard. Shipments of
violative products must cease when the manufacturer becomes aware of a defect or
noncompliance. Shipments of corrected products may be made following changes to
achieve compliance. Submission of a supplement to the Laser Product Report on
the product that details how the product now complies is required prior to
resumed introduction.

VARIANCES AND EXEMPTIONS
The regulations allow for variances and exemptions from all or part of the
standard and from the reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 16

A variance (1010.4) is permission to vary from one or more requirements of the
standard. Upon application by a manufacturer, the Director of CDRH may grant a
variance for a product if it is determined that the variance is so limited in
applicability that an amendment to the standard is not justified, or is of such
need that there is not sufficient time for amending the standard, and that
granting the variance is in agreement with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act. Specifically, a variance may be granted if:
•there are alternate but at least equal means of safety; or
•there are suitable means of safety and, further, either the product could not
perform its function if it were in compliance, or one or more requirements
of the standard are inappropriate for the product.
In requesting a variance, a manufacturer should carefully follow the format for
submission set forth in the regulations [1010.4(b)]. Failure to provide all the
required information may result in delay in issuance of the variance; the
variance is required before the product may be introduced into commerce.
Exemptions from the standard and from the recordkeeping and reporting
requirements have been granted to several Federal agencies (1010.5), including
the Departments of Defense and Energy, some NASA facilities, and NOAA, for
certain unique or classified products. Vendors to these agencies should inquire
through the contracting officers whether the products being purchased are
covered by the exemptions.
Manufacturers of certain specialized products may also be exempted from annual
reporting and recordkeeping (1002.50). Manufacturers who wish such an exemption
should apply by submitting, with the Laser Product Report, justification and
evidence showing that:
•the product cannot under any conditions emit levels of radiation that are
hazardous; or
•the product is produced in such small numbers that the need for continuous
reporting and recordkeeping is negated, and the product is to be used by
individuals trained and knowledgeable in the hazards of such use.
The Director of CDRH may also exempt manufacturers from any part of the
reporting and recordkeeping requirements if the exemption is judged to be in
keeping with the purposes of the FFDCA.

CLARIFICATION

OF

CERTAIN

LASER

LIGHT

SHOW

REQUIREMENTS

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (Center) is concerned that there are a
number of areas of confusion in the understanding of the requirements for Class IIIb and
IV laser light shows and devices. In addition, several of the conditions used in most
variances are not understood and are being ignored. This notice provides guidance to help
manufacturers understand (1) what a variance is, (2) who is or is not covered by a
specific variance, (3) when a variance must be amended, (4) what the various reporting and
notification conditions mean, (5) the role of the laser product reporting guide, the laser
light show reporting guide, and the notification letter, and (6) what certain
misunderstood variance conditions actually mean.
VARIANCE (21 CFR 1010.4)
A variance is a formal permission to deviate from a requirement of the regulations. For
laser light shows and devices, a variance permits use of laser radiation levels that
exceed the limits (Class IIIa) for demonstration laser products as specified in 21 CFR
1040.11(c). A variance for laser light shows and devices is generally granted based on a
determination that the product is required to perform a function which cannot be performed
with equipment in compliance with the standard and that suitable means of radiation safety
and protection will be provided. These suitable means are specified in the conditions of
the variance and constitute, together with the balance of the laser product performance
standard, an individual performance standard for a specific manufacturer of those specific
laser products that may be certified by the manufacturer under the variance. Several
points require additional comment.

1.The approval of a laser light show variance is limited to approval of the conditions of
the variance that specify the required means of radiation safety and protection that apply
to the laser products covered by the variance. This approval in no way constitutes FDA
approval, certification, or endorsement of those laser products produced under the
variance. Further, the variance is not a license for the manufacturer, because the
approval of a variance does not depend on a determination of the competence of the
manufacturer to meet the specified conditions. The manufacturer is responsible for
ensuring by suitable quality control/assurance procedures that each product complies with
all requirements of the variance and the laser product performance standard, and to so
certify in a label on the laser product. In order to meet this responsibility, it may
indeed be necessary for a manufacturer to expand his technical capabilities.
Manufacturers who fail to demonstrate basic technical capabilities essential to ensure
safety may have their variances revoked.
2.Some manufacturers do not understand clearly that there are two laser light show
products involved in any laser light show. One is the basic projection and central
control system which constitute the source of the laser light. The second product is the
laser light show itself which includes the basic projector and all the auxiliary
components (such as projection surfaces or screens, remote scanning components, mirror
balls, fixed mirrors, termination targets, etc.) in their final assembled configuration at
a given performance site. Both of these laser light show products are subject to the
laser standard, must be reported, and must be covered by an approved variance(s) if the
level of laser radiation emitted by the projector exceeds the limits of Class IIIa. Thus,
a laser light show projector manufacturer must have an approved variance under which a
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 20

Class IIIb or IV projector may be certified. Likewise, a laser light show/display
manufacturer must have an approved variance under which the Class IIIb or IV laser light
show/display may be certified. If the laser light show manufacturer also manufactures the
projector, then that manufacturer must have an approved variance under which both the
projector and the laser light show may be certified.
3.A variance is a special performance standard, not a general standard. As such, it is
limited to cover certain specific products and is only applicable to such products
produced by the variance holder. Thus, a variance is not transferrable from one
manufacturer to another. Also the holder of the variance may not introduce equipment that
was not specifically covered by the variance. For example, a laser projector manufacturer
(A), who has a variance covering his projector and his light shows incorporating that
projector and certain auxiliary equipment, cannot transfer the coverage of his variance to
light show manufacturer (B), who purchases the projector and incorporates it with
equipment he (B) already has, to make a light show. In such a case manufacturer (B) would
be required to obtain his own variance for laser light shows. Also, manufacturer (A)
could not incorporate other equipment unless this equipment is included in his variance.

VARIANCE AMENDMENTS [21 CFR 1010.4(b)(2)]

A variance may need to be amended and reports submitted if the product is changed. The
necessity of amending the variance is determined by whether the change(s) to the projector
or light show would be a substantial change that required changing the conditions of the
variance to achieve the required radiation safety and protection. Thus, when effects that
were not previously included in the variance application are added, or when the variance
was granted for a Class IIIb light show and a Class IV light show is being planned, or
when types of lasers and/or projectors other than those originally listed in the variance
application are incorporated, an application for an amendment to the variance should be
submitted to the FDA Division of Dockets Management using Form FDA-3147. The Center
recognizes that it may be difficult for the manufacturer to make the needed determination
in every case. In such a situation, the manufacturer is urged to contact the Electronic
Products Branch at (301) 594-3332 for assistance in determining whether an amendment is
required.
As a matter of policy, the Center encourages manufacturers to minimize the need for
amendments by making the initial variance application as broad as possible.

REPORTING (21 CFR 1002.10 and 1002.12)
In addition to the variance or variance amendment required for Class IIIb and IV laser
light show or display products, such products of all classes must be reported to the
Center. To satisfy this reporting requirement you must submit:
(1)a report on the laser projection system equipment, including any auxiliary
components, in accordance with the general reporting guide, "Guide for Preparing
Laser Product Reports," dated __???????__ ;
(2)a detailed report on the laser light show or display, including quality control or
testing procedures, set-up procedures, installation diagrams, and the types of
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 21

effects incorporated into the laser light show, in accordance with the "Reporting
Guide for Laser Light Shows and Displays (21 CFR 1002)" dated March 1980; and
(3)a notification to the Center, as soon as possible, containing the specific date(s) and
location(s) with complete addresses for each assembly and presentation of the
laser light show and the specific laser effects to be produced in each laser
light show.
The combination of all the information in the above submissions must be adequate for the
Center to determine what effects are being used in any given show, what relationships
exist between the locations of Class III and IV laser radiation levels and the locations
of people present at the laser light show, and that the projector and the show comply with
the conditions of the applicable variance(s) and the laser standard. If the information
submitted is inadequate to permit the Center to make such determinations, then the
reporting and notification requirements have not been satisfied.
In satisfying the reporting requirements indicated above, it is permissible to:
(1)Use the general reporting guide to provide the report required for all projectors,
projection systems, and auxiliary components. In your report you must describe those
aspects of the design of your product that satisfy specific requirements of the
standard and of your variance.
(a)If you are the manufacturer of the projector and the light show, then the general
reporting guide must be used to provide a complete report on the whole projection
system. This system must identify the auxiliary components in the projection
system and describe any aspects of the design of those components that satisfy a
requirement of the variance or the standard.
(b)If the projector or projection system was purchased and is certified by its
manufacturer, you may provide the information concerning the projector by
reference to the manufacturer's report on the projector or projector system
specifying the model number, and model name, and the Accession Number of that
report.
(c)If you have modified the projector or added auxiliary equipment such as mirrors,
mirror balls, remote scanners, screens, etc., the modified projection system must
be reported using the general reporting guide. As above, the projector
manufacturer's report may be referenced for any items of information that were
not affected by the modification(s).
(2)Use the Laser Light Show Report Guide (March 1980) to provide the following
information.
(a)Fixed effects repertoire, such as for a touring show:
• Set-up procedures.
•Quality control and testing procedures including checklists or test record
forms used on-site to assure compliance.

Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 22

•General description of all planned effects and the means employed to assure
their compliance.
•General diagrams of an installation including plan and elevation drawings
showing laser beam paths or scanned fields, audience and
performer/operator/worker locations, clearance dimensions, etc. in sufficient
detail to show the spatial relationship of the audience and of the
performers/operator/workers to regions where Class IIIb or IV levels of laser
radiation may be present. Sufficient information must be provided to show how
your laser light show complies with your variance conditions.
(b)Permanent and semi-permanent shows:
•The written quality control or testing procedures including any checklists and
test record forms used for set-up and subsequent performances to assure initial
and continued compliance.
•Specific description of the effects in the show and the means employed to
assure their compliance.
•Specific diagrams of the installation providing the same type of information
listed above for touring shows.
(c)Special Project Shows (such as a one-time engagement):
•Description of all proposed effects and the means for assuring compliance.
•Quality Control and testing procedures to cover all types of installation,
e.g., outdoor, indoor, etc., and all proposed effects.
•Although specific installation diagrams for such individualized shows may not
be possible at the time of reporting, provide as much detail as possible to show
that you understand how to comply with the conditions of your variance in the
location in which you plan to perform the show.
(3)Use the notification letter to provide the following information on a laser light show:

(a)Show schedule including the date(s), time(s), and location(s) (giving the full
address) for each show or for a complete tour. Each outdoor show must be clearly
identified as such.
(b)By reference to the appropriate laser light show report, indicate the effects
planned for the show(s).
(c)Diagrams of the installation providing the information requested above, if such
applicable diagrams have not been previously provided in a report. If diagrams
have been previously submitted, please specifically reference them.
The Center is willing to be flexible regarding which submission, the notification letter
or the laser light show report, contains specific information. However, the failure of
the total information provided in these submissions to describe the manner of compliance
Laser Compliance Guide (6/92)

Page 23

with the conditions of your variance is a violation of P.L. 90-602 and 21 CFR 1002.10 and
1002.12. Repeated failures to report or inadequate reporting will be grounds for
revocation of a variance. Also, failure to provide timely notifications of show schedules
and effects is a violation of a condition of your variance and may result in an amendment
requiring 30 days advance notice for all of your shows or, in the worst cases, revocation
of the variance.

CLARIFICATION OF CERTAIN VARIANCE CONDITIONS
1. Audience Scanning and Scanning Safeguards
Any scanning effect that may expose members of the audience to the scanned laser radiation
either directly from the projector or indirectly by nearly specular reflection from some
auxiliary component of the projection system is considered to be audience scanning. When
the scanned laser radiation has peak power levels above 5 mW, there is an acute risk of
injury to someone's eyes if the scanning were to stop or slow down to a rate that would
produce Class IIIb or IV levels of laser radiation. Thus a requirement for a scanning
safeguard is included in every variance that covers any type of scanning effect.
The scanning safeguard condition in the laser light show product variances is very similar
to the scanning safeguard requirement specified in the laser product performance standard.
However, the variance condition is more explicit in several respects. First, the
"accessible emission limit(s) which are applicable to the scanned laser radiation" are
specifically indicated, i.e., Class I limits apply to laser radiation in audience areas
and Class I or II limits apply for show personnel depending on whether or not the laser
light must be viewed by these personnel during the performance of their duties. Second,
the requirement that an adequate scanning safeguard must have a short enough reaction time
to prevent human exposure to laser radiation in excess of the applicable accessible
emission limit(s) is explicitly stated. Because of the high risk of injury to someone's
eyes, this latter item is considered to be a critical performance feature for any Class
IIIb or IV laser light show that would employ scanning effects directed into the audience.
Satisfying this condition has also proven to be a very difficult technical problem.
To understand why this is so, consider an audience scanning situation in which a 1 W beam
is scanning at rates sufficient to achieve laser radiation levels below the Class I limits
both for single pulses and for average power. If this beam were to stop, the time required
for the laser radiation to exceed the Class I limit would be 200 nanoseconds. The
reaction time of the entire scanning safeguard system from the detection of scan failure
to attenuation of laser radiation below the Class I limits would have to be less than 200
nanoseconds if it were triggered when the scanning stopped. We recognize that this
hypothetical situation is an extreme limit and that the effects of inertia and other
factors have not been considered. These factors may be taken into account if sufficient
information is provided by the manufacturer to show that the total reaction time needed
for the level of the scanned safeguard system is shorter than the minimum time needed for
the level of the scanned laser radiation to exceed the applicable emission limits. As of
this time, the Center has not received data to show that any scanning safeguard system is
adequate for audience scanning, although several manufacturers have discussed various
types of high-inertia scanning systems that seem promising.
In light shows that employ the reflection of a scanned laser beam off of a rotating mirror
ball, careful analysis of the configuration is needed to determine whether or not a

scanning safeguard is required on both the projector and the mirror ball. If either one
of the scanning systems could be stopped without exceeding the applicable accessible
emission limits, then that scanning system would not be required to have a scanning
safeguard. The Center's experience with laser light shows indicates that the projectors
scanning small diameter beams onto mirror balls generally need a scanning safeguard,
although the need for a scanning safeguard on the mirror ball depends on such factors as
the beam peak power and the minimum size of the scan pattern at the mirror ball.

Beam Stops/Overfilling Mirrors

In laser light shows that contain aerial beam patterns formed by projection to termination
points or reflection by one or more fixed mirrors to a termination point, adequate means
to terminate or contain any laser radiation must be provided for each remote mirror and
the final termination target. Of concern in this requirement is the assurance that laser
radiation that misses a mirror due to overfilling the mirror or beam movement will be
terminated by some suitable beam stop or beam containment and thus be prevented from
projection directly or by reflection into areas that may be occupied. In assessing
whether or not the mirror is overfilled it is necessary to consider the low-angle forwardscattered laser radiation that would project into areas that may be occupied and whether
this radiation would exceed the applicable limits in the occupiable area. If the forwardscattered laser radiation were to exceed the applicable limits it would have to be
terminated if it misses the mirror.
However, under the following conditions in some laser light shows, adequate protection may
be provided without the use of beam stops:
a.The areas of potential projection are occupied only by employees;
b.The employees are educated by the laser safety officer concerning the hazards; and
c.Control measures (posting warning signs and marking hazard areas) are implemented as
discussed in the next section.
The condition specifying the beam stop requirement suggests that the beam stop should
subtend an angle of 50 milliradians (3 degrees) from the projector. This is a suggestion.
If the beam and any forward scatter can be adequately terminated by a smaller beam stop,
that is acceptable.
In outdoor shows, the size of the beam stop can present considerable wind resistance and
may make the mirror unstable if attached to the same mount. Under such conditions,
independent mountings for the mirror and the beam stop may be needed.
The other requirement specified in the condition covering remote mirrors is that the
mounting must be secure. This covers two concerns. First, the mounting must be a sturdy
design that provides for a very positive locking of the mirror's orientation. Second,
there must be adequate protection in the context of the specific show or display to
prevent accidental misalignment of the mirrors by someone bumping into them or dropping
something on them. In some situations, there may have to be beam containment enclosures
or baffles to prevent a beam from a misaligned mirror from entering audience areas. The
Center's concern for adequate protection from accidental mirror misalignment increases
when the beams have a long projection range and the allowable angular deviation is quite
small.

Set-up Safety Control Measures

The condition requiring the use of minimum possible beam power and the use of control
measures in accordance with a recognized safety standard during set-up, alignment, and
testing procedures appears to be commonly misunderstood. Low beam power for these initial
procedures is generally used, but use of the control measures is overlooked in too many
cases. The manufacturer is responsible for becoming familiar with the control measures of
recognized laser safety standards (such as ANSI Z136.1) and applying them during set-up,
alignment, and testing procedures, and during the show, as well as to any areas that may
be occupied by anyone other than members of the audience. Such control measures are not
difficult, but do require some planning to implement. In general, all personnel not
needed for the alignment should be cleared from the projection area until the initial
alignment is done. With planning, a time slot can be agreed to in the contract and a
minimal interruption of the other aspects of the production set-up will be achieved. It
is considered important that the laser light show manufacturer implement such control
measures because failure to do so makes accidental radiation exposures much more likely to
occur.
