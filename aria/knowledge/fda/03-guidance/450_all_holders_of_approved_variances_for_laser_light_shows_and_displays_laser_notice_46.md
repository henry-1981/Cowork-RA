To: All holders of approved variances for laser light shows
and displays

Effective immediately, all outdoor laser displays within a
radius of 20 miles of any of the operating airports in Clark
County, Nevada are required to cease operation until the
manufacturers and or operators can demonstrate that they are
in compliance with the Recommended Interim Guidelines (RIGS),
issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and have
established a specific quality assurance program to assure
such compliance.

This letter amends all FDA approved variances applicable to
the production and operation of laser displays that include
projection into airspace in Clark County, Nevada.
Organizations involved in the assurance of air traffic safety
are expressing increased concern about the numbers of
instances in which the interiors of aircraft cockpits have
been illuminated by laser displays. This concern is
exacerbated by those displays that are in the Las Vegas area
because of the number of displays operating in close proximity
to the McCarran International Airport. However, the safety
considerations have much larger implications than the
situation that exists in Las Vegas. Impairment of a pilot’s
or copilot’s vision by exposure to the light of a laser
display is intolerable. It makes little difference if the
impairment is of short duration; all avoidable impairment
should and must be prevented. Although this letter addresses
displays in the Las Vegas area, we will not hesitate to extend
its coverage to other locales or nationwide if we obtain
information supporting the appropriateness of such action.

The quality assurance programs for the displays must be well
documented and at least address such parameters as radiant
power and energy, beam divergence, pointing accuracy, and
scanning specifications. We will advise the industry if we
become aware of any additional elements that are needed.
Accurate and timely measurements and recordkeeping are also
essential parts of the quality assurance program. Skilled
engineers or technicians may be necessary to perform these
tasks. Only if and when these conditions are met may
resumption of operations be considered. Resumption may not
occur until a detailed description demonstrating compliance
with the RIGS and the quality control program and its results
has been submitted to the FAA regional office and to this
office and has been evaluated. (®

Page 2 - All holders of variances for laser light shows and
displays

This Agency has been engaged in meetings with several other
Federal and local agencies, the military and industry. These
meetings have resulted in the dissemination of interim
guidance, Recommended Interim Guidelines (RIGS), issued by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that are to be used in
aeronautical studies of laser displays projecting into the
airspace. These guidelines are intended to prevent ocular
injury and also to prevent temporary visual impairment due to
flashblinding or dazzle.

The conditions imposed by this notice are in addition to those
already contained in approved variances.

I am sure that you share our concern for the flight safety of
the public. We must all do our parts to prevent the
occurrence of a tragedy that could cost hundreds of lives. Be
advised that the primary responsibility for the safety of a
laser display belongs to the manufacturer/operator of the
display. It is that party’s responsibility to be in control
of the quality of the projections and to be sure that the
equipment is operated in accordance with its specifications
and in compliance with the guidelines for safety.

Please recognize that the interim guidelines of the FAA are
interim and are subject to change as their science bases
develop or if events occur that indicate that the guidelines
are not effective in preventing future incidents involving
visual impairment of aviators. We are confident that you will
receive this notification in a spirit of cooperation and
commitment to the public safety. There have already been too
many instances of hazardous illuminations of aircraft by laser
displays. Steps must be taken now to assure that they are
stopped.

Sincerely yours.
