Premarket Approval Application and
Humanitarian Device Exemption
Modular Review
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The purpose of this guidance document is to provide industry and FDA staff with information
regarding the Premarket Approval Application (PMA) and Humanitarian Device Exemption
(HDE) modular review program and to outline the procedures for submitting or reviewing a
modular PMA or HDE.
Throughout this guidance document, the terms “we,” “us” “our” refer to FDA staff from the
Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research (CBER). “You” and “your” refers to the submitter.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In a traditional PMA 1 or HDE 2, the applicant submits all data, as outlined in 21 CFR 814.20 for
PMAs and 21 CFR 814.104 for HDEs, at the same time, regardless of when testing is completed.
FDA begins its review only upon receipt of all the required information. In 1998, FDA
1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
introduced an alternative regulatory pathway, which allowed a modular approach to PMA
submissions. On October 26, 2003, the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002
(MDUFMA), Public Law 107-250 was enacted. Section 209 of MDUFMA amended the Federal
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to codify the modular review approach. 3 As stated in
the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program guidance, applicants can also apply this
modular approach to HDEs.
The modular review approach is intended to provide a mechanism by which applicants may
submit non-clinical data and manufacturing information for review while still collecting,
compiling, and analyzing the clinical data using the final device design. Therefore, a modular
PMA or HDE is a compilation of sections or "modules" submitted at different times that together
become a complete application. The goal of this approach is to increase the efficiency of the
review process by allowing applicants to submit discrete modules of the application to FDA for
review soon after completing the non-clinical testing and analysis. Additionally, the modular
approach allows the applicant to potentially resolve any deficiencies noted by FDA earlier in the
review process than would occur with a traditional PMA or HDE application.
This modular review approach is recommended for products that are in early stages of the
clinical study. This modular review approach is not appropriate when the applicant is very close
to submitting an original PMA or HDE or when the device design is in a state of flux or likely to
change. FDA staff consider multiple scientific and regulatory approaches, consistent with least
burdensome requirements and principles, 4 to streamline regulatory processes during the review
of modular PMAs and HDEs.

III. Scope
The modular review program is an alternative to the preparation, submission, and evaluation of
traditional PMAs and HDEs. Because FDA believes that PMA and HDE supplements would
rarely be appropriate for modular review, the scope of this document is limited to applicants
pursuing approval of original PMAs and HDEs.

IV. Definitions
Shell is an outline and description of the contents for each of the modules that will comprise the
PMA or HDE. This document also lays out the timeline and submission plan of the individual
sections or “modules.”
Modular PMA or HDE is a compilation of sections or “modules” submitted following a predetermined and an agreed-upon timeline that, together, become a complete PMA or HDE
application after the final module is received.

Section 515(c) of the FD&C Act, as amended by Section 209 of MDUFMA.
See FDA’s guidance, “The Least Burdensome Provisions: Concept and Principles,” and sections 513(a)(3)(D)(ii),
513(a)(3)(D)(iii), 515(c)(5)(A), 515(c)(5)(B), and 515(c)(5)(C) of the FD&C Act.

Module is a discrete section of the PMA or HDE that can be submitted and reviewed
independently. A module is a set of elements, tests, information, etc., that addresses a select
discipline or group of disciplines (e.g., biocompatibility, non-clinical, and engineering bench
testing) of the device application. These disciplines can be grouped in each module at the
discretion of the applicant with review team concurrence, with the exception of manufacturing
and Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) information. The manufacturing and BIMO information
should be submitted in separate, standalone modules unless they are included as part of the final
clinical module.
Module Amendment is information an applicant submits to the FDA to modify a module that is
under review or closed. For example, an applicant’s response to a deficiency letter or updated
contact information can be submitted as an amendment to a module.

V.

User Fee Considerations for Modular Review

As discussed in the guidance “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and
Device Biologics License Applications,” the fee for a modular PMA with a valid eCopy is due
upon submission of the first module. If FDA receives the first module of a PMA prior to
payment, it will not be accepted for review until we receive payment 5 and FDA will notify the
applicant of this action by email. 6 FDA begins its review when the Office of Financial
Management notifies CDRH or CBER that payment has been received. For additional
information, see FDA’s guidance, “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions.” Lastly,
user fee refunds for modular PMAs are handled differently than traditional PMAs or for original
PMAs that were converted from modular PMAs. 7
Unlike traditional PMAs and modular PMAs, modular HDEs, like traditional HDEs, are not
subject to user fees. 8

Contact Review Group

Appendix I includes a flowchart of the steps ordinarily involved in modular review. The first step
should be contacting the Assistant Director/Branch Chief within the appropriate review division
in CDRH or the appropriate Review Office Regulatory Project Management Director in CBER
via email to indicate your intention to submit a modular PMA or HDE. For assistance in
identifying the appropriate review division and team, contact the Division of Industry and
Consumer Education (DICE) 9 for CDRH-regulated devices or CBER’s Office of

FDA believes early interaction with the appropriate division/team and continued communication
will optimize the opportunity for success of the modular PMA or HDE.

B.

PMA or HDE Shell
(1)

Content of a Shell

When you contact the appropriate Assistant Director/Branch Chief or Review Office Regulatory
Project Management Director (through email), you should include a draft of the proposed shell.
FDA recommends that applicants use the sample shell (Appendix II - Sample Shell) as a model
when designing shell proposals. In your proposal, you should describe the contents of each
module in sufficient detail to provide FDA with a complete understanding of the modules you
plan to submit. The shell proposal should address all elements required under 21 CFR 814.20 for
PMAs and 21 CFR 814.104 for HDEs, as well as the projected submission date of each module.
If the clinical trial period will be lengthy or the product development timeline is long, you should
carefully consider your schedule for submitting modules when developing your shell. Premature
submission of modules (i.e., prior to finalizing your device design) could result in changes to the
device that require you to submit additional data and FDA to re-evaluate closed modules.
FDA may not grant a proposal for a shell if the planned timing for modular submissions is
inappropriate. For example, if you are within 6 months or less of submitting the final module,
FDA believes modular review may not be appropriate because it may not allow sufficient time
for FDA to complete its review of all the modules before receiving the final module.
In addition, applicants should not plan to submit modules in close succession. The schedule for
submitting modules should allow enough time for the review division to complete review of one
module before the next module is received (i.e., at minimum 90 days). Submitting modules for
concurrent review undermines the purpose of the modular review program because the Agency
cannot review multiple modules on an abbreviated cycle. If you intend to submit several modules
at the same time or in close succession, FDA recommends that you submit a traditional PMA or
HDE instead.
The exception to this submission plan may be the manufacturing module. If resources permit, it
may be possible for this module to be reviewed concurrently with other modules. This timing
should be discussed with the review team during the shell review.

(2)

Informal Review of the Proposed Shell

The proposed modular shell should be discussed and agreed upon with the FDA review team
interactively before it is formally submitted to the Document Control Center (DCC).
Immediately upon receipt of an informal request for a PMA or HDE modular review, the
Assistant Director/Branch Chief or Review Office Regulatory Project Management Director
assigns the informal request to a review staff member. This individual is responsible for

communicating any FDA recommended changes and reaching agreement on the shell.
a. Determination that PMA or HDE Review is Appropriate for the Device
The first step of the informal review is confirming that PMA or HDE review is appropriate for
the device. The assigned reviewer answers a set of preliminary questions in the PMA Acceptance
Review Checklist, as found in the FDA guidance, “Acceptance and Filing Reviews for
Premarket Approval Applications (PMAs)” or the HDE Filing Review Checklist, as found in the
FDA guidance, “Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program,” respectively to determine
PMA or HDE eligibility. 11 Depending upon the answers to these preliminary questions,
regulation as a class III device may not be appropriate. If the responses to the preliminary
questions indicate that review of the modular proposal should not continue, the reviewer notifies
the applicant using the procedures identified in the guidance documents referenced above.
b. Review of Proposed Shell Contents
After confirming that a PMA or HDE is the appropriate regulatory pathway, the reviewer
assesses the contents of the proposed shell and communicates any recommended changes. If
agreement cannot be reached with the assigned reviewer within 30 days, contact the appropriate
Team and/or Division management.

(3)

Formal Submission of the Finalized Shell

After you reach agreement with FDA on the proposed shell, we recommend that you follow the
steps below to submit your finalized shell.
If you are submitting to CDRH, we recommend that you submit the finalized shell electronically
via the Customer Collaboration Portal (“CDRH Portal”) as described on the Send and Track
Medical Device Premarket Submissions Online: CDRH Portal webpage. Once submitted via the
CDRH Portal, the shell will be received by the CDRH Document Control Center (DCC).
Alternatively, the finalized shell may be mailed to the CDRH DCC. The current mailing address
for CDRH’s DCC is provided on the eCopy Medical Device Submission webpage.
If you are submitting to CBER, we recommend that the finalized shell be submitted
electronically through the FDA Electronic Submission Gateway. Alternatively, it can be
submitted through the CBER submission email inbox (150MB max) at
CBERDCC_eMailSub@fda.hhs.gov, or via mail to the CBER DCC. Additional information on
the FDA Electronic Submission Gateway and the current mailing address for the CBER DCC
can be found on the Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format for CBER-Regulated Products
webpage.
To facilitate the log-in process, you should prominently identify the name of the review staff
member and the respective Office and Division with whom you have been interacting in your
These questions are found under the “Preliminary Questions” section in both checklists; questions 1-7 in the PMA
Acceptance Review Checklist and questions 1-5 in the HDE Filing Review Checklist. FDA does not review the
entire checklist during this step.

cover letter. It may also be helpful to include in your submission a PDF copy of the email
correspondence where they provided concurrence on your proposed shell. After the FDA
receives your submission and assigns a unique document control number (shell number), the
review staff will confirm that the finalized shell is consistent with the agreed upon proposal and
issue an acceptance correspondence (e.g., email) within 15 days from receipt. You can then
submit modules for review, according to the agreed upon schedule.

(4)

Changes to the Accepted Shell

If you need to make changes to the shell after it has been formally submitted and accepted (e.g.,
device design modifications are made that necessitate additional or different testing or the
number of necessary modules increases or decreases), you should notify the review team via
email and provide an explanation of why the changes are necessary. After informally reviewing
these changes, FDA may wish to discuss them with you. Changes to the timing or the order of
the modules may be made after review team concurrence is received via email. For significant
changes to the content, title of each module, or number of modules, you should formally submit
the revised shell as an amendment as you did for the finalized shell.

C.

PMA and HDE Modules
(1)

Submission of Each Module

When submitting a module, you should clearly identify the submission as a module and
reference the previously assigned shell number and module title in the cover letter. FDA will
assign module numbers in sequential order as modules are received. As outlined in Appendix II
Sample Shell, you should include the following in every module:
•
•
•
•
•
•

cover letter, addressed to the review staff member, Office, and Division who reviewed
the shell;
table of contents;
executive summary of the testing and results included in the module;
a copy of or reference to FDA’s Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) designation letter (for
HDE modules);
a brief device description and principles of operation; and
bibliography (with references only to articles relevant to that module).

Duplication of some information between modules (e.g., device description) is necessary to
allow the review staff assigned to that module to review it in an efficient manner.

(2)

Time Frame for Reviewing a Module

FDA’s objective is to complete the review of each module and issue a deficiency letter or an
acceptance correspondence within 90 days of receipt of the module. The modular review is
intended to be interactive in nature, within reason. The review team may request minor
clarification or additional information from the applicant interactively, as needed, during the
review of each module. Deficiency letters notify the applicant of outstanding issues that need
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
clarification or additional information before completing the review of the module. An
acceptance correspondence notifies the applicant that all issues within the module have been
resolved. Each module can continue to be submitted within its projected submission date
identified in the shell regardless of prior modules’ review status in the series (e.g., awaiting
response to deficiency letter from a previous module). Changes to the projected submission date
for any module should be communicated to the FDA review team via email and agreed upon, as
noted in Section VI.B.(4).
FDA intends to review amendments responding to a module deficient letter under a 90-day
review clock. When FDA issues a module deficient letter, we stop the FDA review clock for the
module and place the module on hold. When FDA receives a complete response to the module
deficient letter, we consider it an amendment responding to a module deficient letter, the review
clock is reset, and the amendment is reviewed within 90 days. Submitting an unsolicited major
amendment, as described in 21 CFR 814.37(c)(1) for PMAs and 21 CFR 814.106 for HDEs, at
any time during the review of the PMA or HDE may result in a delayed response from FDA.

(3)

Incomplete Modules

The full benefit of modular review to both FDA and the applicant cannot be realized if module
submissions are incomplete. Therefore, you should complete all testing needed to support a
specific module before submitting it to FDA for review. In the event of an incomplete module
submission, FDA intends on issuing a deficiency letter to the applicant stating that the review
may not proceed until we receive the missing information. FDA intends to review each module
within a 90-day period, beginning upon submission of an amendment containing the missing
information.

(4)

Reopening a Closed Module

If you modify your device after FDA determines a module is acceptable, you should contact the
appropriate review staff to discuss and informally review the modification and any testing
needed to support it. If review staff believe the modification is a major change, you should
submit an amendment to each of the affected modules with a revised executive summary, change
description, list of testing repeated, and data generated to support the modification. This
amendment will reopen the relevant modules. As described above, FDA intends to issue a
deficiency letter or an acceptance correspondence within 90 days of receipt of the amendment. If
there are any changes to policies and regulations applicable to your device that occur after your
module submission, FDA recommends that you contact review staff to discuss if your module
should be updated and, if so, how these updates should be submitted. Updates that are not
submitted as an amendment should be included in the final module.

(5)

Submission of the Final Module

An applicant’s submission of the final module (i.e., final clinical data, proposed labeling, and
Summary of Safety and Effectiveness (SSED) for PMAs or Summary of Safety and Probable
Benefit (SSPB) for HDEs), plus the incorporation by reference of previously submitted modules,
will complete the modular application. You should clearly identify the final module submission
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
as the “COMPLETED MODULAR PMA or HDE” in the cover letter. You should specifically
reference (by shell and module titles) the modules that have been accepted by the FDA and
identify any modules with outstanding deficiencies. For the PMA or HDE to be complete, you
should provide responses to all outstanding deficiencies in the final module.
Upon receipt of the final module, FDA converts the completed modular application into an
original PMA or HDE and assigns it a PMA or HDE number.

(6)

Acceptance and/or Filing after Conversion to Original PMA
or HDE

Following the conversion of the completed modular application, review will proceed as an
original PMA or HDE where FDA makes its acceptance and/or filing decision. This decision is
based on whether the final module includes all the information necessary to complete the
application as required by 21 CFR 814.20 for PMAs and 21 CFR 814.104 for HDEs.
For a PMA, the FDA guidance “Acceptance and Filing Reviews for Premarket Approval
Application (PMAs)” describes the kind of information required under 21 CFR 814.20 that needs
to be submitted before FDA can file the application. FDA plans to use the information described
in this guidance in making acceptance and filing determinations. As for a traditional PMA, FDA
generally issues an acceptance or refuse to accept decision within 15 days of receipt of the final
module and, if accepted, a filing or non-filing decision within 45 days of receipt of the final
module. If FDA decides to file the PMA, the filing date is the date that the application became
complete, typically the receipt date of the final module. The 180-day "PMA clock" under 21
CFR 814.40 also begins on that date. If the Agency decides not to accept the PMA, FDA will
issue a correspondence noting the missing items. If the Agency decides not to file the PMA,
FDA will issue a non-filing decision to the PMA applicant.
For an HDE, the FDA guidance, “Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) Program,” describes
the kind of information required under 21 CFR 814.104 that needs to be submitted before the
FDA can file an HDE. For an HDE, FDA will issue a filing or non-filing decision within 30 days
of receipt of the final module. 12 If FDA decides to file the HDE, the filing date is the date that
the application became complete, typically the receipt date of the final module. The 75-day
“HDE clock” under 21 CFR 814.116 also begins on that date. If the Agency decides not to file
the HDE, FDA will issue a non-filing decision to the HDE applicant.

Appendix III – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
Contact the Assistant Director/Branch Chief or Review Office Regulatory Project Management
Director within the appropriate review division in CDRH or CBER for any specific questions
not covered in this FAQ.
1. What is the “sample shell”?
An example of a modular shell is provided in Appendix II of this guidance document.
FDA recommends that you follow this model whenever possible. Ideally, there should
be no more than 3-4 modules. However, we understand that there may be instances
when the recommended model is not suitable and should be modified. The review staff
will work with you to establish a shell that is acceptable to both parties during the shell
review.
2. What should I consider when deciding whether to submit a Modular PMA or HDE?
The intent of the modular review approach is to provide a mechanism by which
applicants can submit non-clinical data and manufacturing information for review while
still collecting, compiling, and analyzing the clinical data using the final device design.
FDA recommends that you carefully consider the timeline for the development of your
product and your commitment to pursuing FDA approval when deciding whether to
submit a modular PMA or HDE. FDA may not accept a PMA or HDE shell proposal if
the timing for submitting modules is inappropriate. For example, if you are within 6
months or less of submitting the final module, FDA believes modular review may not be
appropriate. Submitting a shell proposal within 6 months or less of submitting the final
module does not allow sufficient time for FDA to complete its review of all the modules
before receiving the final module.
If the clinical trial is lengthy or the product development timeline is long, you should
carefully consider your schedule for submitting modules when developing the shell.
Premature submission of modules could result in changes that require re-evaluation of
closed modules.
3. What is an appropriate length of time between submission of modules?
You should provide the approximate timing of the submission of each module to FDA
in the shell. Applicants who choose to participate in the modular review program should
submit modules at intervals (i.e., at minimum 90 days) that will allow the Agency
enough time to review the module, provide feedback, and close out the module prior to
the arrival of the next module. The exception to this may be the manufacturing module,
which can be reviewed concurrently with other modules if resources permit. Such
timing should be discussed with the review team during the shell review.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
4. What should I include with each module?
You should include the following in each module:
•
•
•
•
•
•

cover letter, addressed to the review staff, Office, and Division who reviewed
the shell;
table of contents;
executive summary of the testing and results included in the module;
a copy of or reference to FDA’s HUD designation letter (for HDE modules);
a brief device description and principles of operation; and
bibliography (with references only to articles relevant to that module).

In addition, you should submit complete information for each module (i.e., all testing
should be finished, and the results provided), which will enable FDA to review the data
and make a decision. Duplication of some information (e.g., device description) may be
necessary to allow the review staff assigned to that module to review it in an efficient
manner. If the module is incomplete, FDA intends on issuing a deficiency letter for the
module under review.
5. Does the Modular PMA or HDE include an RTA and/or RTF phase?
Modular PMAs and HDEs do not have RTA or RTF reviews. There is a preliminary
review conducted during informal review of the proposed shell to determine whether
a Modular PMA or HDE is an appropriate regulatory pathway. However, upon receipt
of the final module, FDA converts the completed modular application into an original
PMA or HDE. At that time, review proceeds with RTA and/or RTF review phases
before beginning substantive review, as done with traditional PMAs and HDEs.
6. Does the clinical module need to be submitted last?
The general intent of this program is to enable applicants to address issues, if present, with
the non-clinical data in each of the modules while the applicant simultaneously prepares
and collects clinical data using the final device design for the clinical module. For that
reason, it is highly recommended that the clinical module be the final module. BIMO
information can be submitted as its own module or as part of the clinical module. If you do
not plan to submit the clinical module as the final module, we recommend that you discuss
your modular plan with FDA to determine if it is appropriate, prior to submitting the
modular shell proposal.
7. Is interactive communication utilized during modular review?
Modular reviews are intended to be interactive in nature. The review team may ask for
clarification or additional information interactively via email, phone call, or informal
teleconference during each module review. However, we understand that certain
information may not be readily available at the time of our request. In this case, FDA
may make these requests in a deficiency letter that can be addressed as an amendment to
the current module or at the time of final module submission.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In CDRH, a reviewer from an Office of Health Technology (OHT) will be assigned as
the primary point of contact for each module. In CBER, both the Office of Compliance
and Biologics Quality and the Product Review Office review modules; therefore, you
should discuss points of contact with the appropriate regulatory project management
branch in CBER.
8. Can I request an extension of time to address all deficiencies identified in a deficiency
letter?
There are no formal extension requests for amendments. If you intend to address the
deficiencies prior to the submission of your final module, you should submit the
information in the form of an amendment to the relevant module. If deficiencies are not
addressed prior to submission of your final module, you should provide responses to the
deficiencies in the final module.
9. What happens to the outstanding modules when I submit my final module?
You should address any outstanding deficiencies from previously submitted modules
when you submit the final module. Once you submit the final module, FDA considers
the shell and its modules closed and converts the completed modular application into an
original PMA or HDE. All information from current and prior modules will be factored
into the review of the original PMA or HDE. FDA will then make its acceptance and
filing decisions for a PMA or a filing decision only for an HDE before proceeding with
substantive review.
10. When do I have to pay the user fee for a Modular PMA?
The fee for a modular PMA is due upon submission of the first module; see FDA
guidance “User Fees and Refunds for Premarket Approval Applications and Device
Biologics License Applications.” If FDA receives the first module of a PMA prior to
payment, it will be not accepted for review until we receive payment 13 and FDA will
notify the applicant of this action by email. 14 The 90-day review clock for the first
module starts on the date that FDA’s Office of Financial Management notifies CDRH or
CBER that payment has been received and a valid eCopy has been provided.
