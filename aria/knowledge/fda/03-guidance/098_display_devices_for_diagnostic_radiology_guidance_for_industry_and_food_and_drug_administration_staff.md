On June 14, 2023, FDA issued a guidance titled “Content of Premarket Submissions for Device
Software Functions.”1 This final guidance supersedes the Guidance for the Content of Premarket
Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices, issued on May 11, 2005. The final
guidance issued on June 14, 2023, provides information regarding the recommended
documentation sponsors should include in premarket submissions for FDA’s evaluation of the
safety and effectiveness of device software functions. In particular, the final guidance includes
information to help determine a device’s Documentation Level (formerly known as Level of
Concern). The purpose of the Documentation Level is to help identify the minimum amount of
information that would support a premarket submission that includes device software functions.
Within the framework of the superseded guidance, display devices intended for diagnostic
radiology were considered a device with a Minor Level of Concern. Based on the device’s risk in
the context of the device’s intended use, as discussed in the final guidance “Content of Premarket
Submissions for Device Software Functions,” display devices intended for diagnostic radiology
should generally address the recommendations for a Basic Documentation Level. The actual
Documentation Level for your device may vary based on the specifics of your device. For more
information about the Documentation Level and recommended documentation for a premarket
submission, sponsors are encouraged to review the guidance “Content of Premarket Submissions
for Device Software Functions.”

Display Devices for Diagnostic
Radiology
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

The FDA is issuing this guidance to assist industry in preparing premarket notification (510(k))
submissions for display devices intended for use in diagnostic radiology.
This guidance is intended to apply to current technologies; however, FDA may request new or
alternative test methods to fully evaluate the safety and effectiveness of future display
technologies. In such instances, we recommend that you contact FDA to determine the
appropriate regulatory pathway and testing for your device prior to submitting a 510(k). Please
see Section III. Scope for more details on the types of devices covered by this guidance
document.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standards referenced in this document,
see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database.1 For more information regarding use of
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
“Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices.”2
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended,
but not required.

II. Background
This guidance applies to display devices intended for diagnostic radiology as identified in
Section III. Scope, and currently classified under 21 CFR 892.2050 as class II devices.
This guidance document provides recommendations for the types of information you should
provide in your 510(k) submission for display devices intended for diagnostic radiology. This
information supplements the requirements for a 510(k) submission found in 21 CFR 807 Subpart
E, as well as recommendations provided in other FDA documents concerning the specific
content of a 510(k) submission, including FDA’s guidance entitled, “Format for Traditional and
Abbreviated 510(k)s”3 and FDA’s guidance entitled, “Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s.”4
This guidance supersedes a previously issued final guidance entitled “Display Accessories for
Full-Field Digital Mammography Systems-Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submissions” issued
on May 30, 2008.
This guidance was revised with minor updates to reflect the issuance of the final rule, “Medical
Devices; Medical Device Classification Regulations To Conform to Medical Software Provisions
in the 21st Century Cures Act” (86 FR 20278).5

III. Scope
This document recommends what to include in a 510(k) submission for display devices in
diagnostic radiology as identified by their classification regulation (21 CFR 892.2050) and
product code (PGY). These devices are classified as class II devices that are intended to be used
in controlled viewing conditions to display and view digital images for primary image
interpretation. Display devices for diagnostic radiology may also be referred to as soft-copy
displays or medical grade monitors. The classification regulation for these devices reads as
follows:
21 CFR 892.2050 Medical image management and processing system
a) Identification. A medical image management and processing system is a device that
provides one or more capabilities relating to the review and digital processing of medical
images for the purposes of interpretation by a trained practitioner of disease detection,
diagnosis, or patient management. The software components may provide advanced or
complex image processing functions for image manipulation, enhancement, or
quantification that are intended for use in the interpretation and analysis of medical
images. Advanced image manipulation functions may include image segmentation,
multimodality image registration, or 3D visualization. Complex quantitative functions

may include semi-automated measurements or time-series measurements.
b) Classification. Class II (special controls; voluntary standards – Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Std., Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
Std., Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) Test Pattern).
Typically, the 510(k) submission for display devices is separate from the 510(k) submissions of
other image acquisition or management devices (e.g., hardware/software for image acquisition or
image analysis). However, this guidance may apply when displays intended for diagnostic
interpretation classified under 892.2050 (product code PGY) are included as part of a 510(k)
submission along with other software and/or hardware.
This guidance does not apply to real-time displays that are part of the image acquisition device
classified under other regulations (e.g., the display on a fluoroscopy system classified under 21
CFR 892.1650 (e.g., product codes JAA, OWB, OXO, QHY, and RCC) or the display on an
ultrasonic pulsed Doppler imaging system classified under 21 CFR 892.1550 (e.g., product codes
PSV, IYN, and NCS)).
This guidance does not apply to medical image hardcopy devices under 21 CFR 892.2040.
This guidance does not apply to imaging software and software applications. For information on
these types of devices, please see FDA’s guidance entitled “Medical Device Data Systems,
Medical Image Storage Devices, and Medical Image Communications Devices.”6
This guidance does not apply to ophthalmic image management systems (product code NFJ)
classified under 21 CFR 892.2050; medical cathode-ray tube (product code DXJ) classified
under 21 CFR 870.2450; displays intended for whole-slide imaging and digital surgical or
anatomical pathology; or displays for non-diagnostic applications in radiology (e.g., displays at
the image acquisition workstation that are used by the technologist and not intended for
diagnostic image review).
This guidance also does not apply to displays in handheld or mobile devices, a certain subset of
which may be classified under 21 CFR 892.2050 (with product code PGY); for information on
these types of devices see FDA’s guidance entitled “Policy for Device Software Functions and
Mobile Medical Applications.”7
Sponsors may wish to submit a pre-submission to the appropriate review Division to receive
guidance for displays not covered by this guidance. For information on FDA’s pre-submission
process, see FDA’s guidance entitled “Requests for Feedback and Meetings for Medical Device
Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.”8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
You should evaluate the electrical safety of your device according to one or more of the most
recent FDA-recognized version of the following consensus standards, or any equivalent method
being used as an alternative to evaluate electrical safety:
·

ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1 Medical electrical equipment: Part 1: General requirements for
basic safety and essentional performance

For 510(k) submissions for display devices intended for diagnostic radiology, in lieu of
providing the actual electric safety test reports, you may simply submit a Declaration of
Conformity to an FDA-recognized consensus standard to indicate that your device has been
tested for compliance with the appropriate consensus standards. FDA may request to review the
actual test reports if the IFU, device description, and/or labeling for your device raises concerns
regarding the electrical safety. The features and design of your device will determine whether
other consensus standards are appropriate in addition to, or in place of the consensus standards
provided above. For more information on the use of consensus standards, please refer to section
514(c)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act and FDA’s website on the Standards and Conformity Assessment

·

Display controls,
Ambient light sensing,
Luminance calibration tools, and/or
Quality-control software.

Your 510(k) submission should include documentation for the software and firmware that you
have developed for use with your device. The kind of information that we recommend you
submit in your 510(k) is determined by the “level of concern,” which is based on the risks
associated with a potential software failure by your device. If the software/firmware is limited to
the four functionalities listed above, the level of concern may be considered minor. If your
device submission introduces or modifies more advanced software features than those features
listed above, you should consider contacting the relevant branch chief or submitting a PreSubmission to request FDA’s feedback on whether the software would be a minor, moderate, or
major level of concern. In most instances, the software documentation may be submitted in your
510(k) at a minor level of concern. When preparing the software documentation for your 510(k)
submission and for guidance on what information you should include based on the level of
concern, please see the following FDA guidance documents:

We recommend that you include a brief description of the test method(s) you have used to
address each performance aspect identified in Table 1 above. If you follow a suggested test
method, you may cite the method rather than describing it in your 510(k) submission. If you
modify a suggested test method, you may cite the method, but should provide sufficient
information to explain the nature of and reason for the modification. We recommend that you
provide a description of all proprietary measurement systems used for performing quantitative
tests, including the trade name, characteristics, and accuracy of the measurement tools.
For cases where the new device performs significantly lower than the predicate device on one or
more of the physical laboratory tests in Table 1, an additional study that further characterizes
underperforming features of the display may be necessary to demonstrate substantial equivalence
to a predicate device.

VIII.

Labeling

The following Section is intended to assist you in preparing labeling that satisfies FDA’s labeling
requirements under 21 CFR Part 801.15
A prescription device in compliance with 21 CFR 801.109 is exempt from section 502(f)(1) of
the FD&C Act that requires adequate directions for use by a lay person. As a prescription device,
your device must meet the labeling requirements for prescription devices under 21 CFR 801.109,
including a prescription use statement.
15

Although final labeling is not required for 510(k) clearance, final labeling must comply with the requirements of
21 CFR Part 801 before a medical device is introduced into interstate commerce. In addition, final labeling for
prescription medical devices must comply with 21 CFR 801.109. Labeling recommendations in this guidance are
consistent with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 801.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Your 510(k) submission must include proposed labels, labeling, and advertisements in sufficient
detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). We recommend that you submit clear and
concise instructions for use that delineate the technological features of your device and how your
device is to be used. Instructions should encourage local/institutional training programs designed
to familiarize users with the features of your device and instruct users on how to use your device
in a safe and effective manner.
FDA recommends that the labeling for review workstation displays intended for mammography
include the following statement:
Mammographic images with lossy compression must not be reviewed for primary image
interpretations. Mammographic images may only be interpreted using an FDA cleared
display that meets technical specifications reviewed and accepted by FDA.
In addition to meeting any requirements under 21 CFR Part 801, your device’s user manual
should include the following information, as appropriate:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

IFU as stated in your premarket submission;
Warnings and precautions (and any mitigation measures);
Overview of the device;
Principles of operation;
Directions for use (e.g., display controls and graphical user interface (GUI));
Technical specifications;
Performance specifications (summary of physical laboratory testing);
Cleaning information;
Hardware/software compatibility requirements;
Conformity to any voluntary consensus standards; and
Manufacturer’s contact information.

In addition, instructions for maintenance of the system performance (quality assurance
processes) should include:
·
·
·
·

A description of personnel authorized to service the system;
Recommended maintenance schedule;
Calibration procedures; and
A full description of recommended quality assurance testing (with action limits),
including detailed procedures for performing these tests, if applicable, and the frequency
of testing. You may use the latest recognized consensus standards version of NEMA XR
22: “Quality Control Manual” Template for Manufacturers of Displays and
Workstations Labeled for Final Interpretation in Full-Field Digital Mammography
(FFDM) for designing quality assurance tests.

A.

Performance Tests

The following provides additional details on the individual tests recommended in Section VII.
Physical Laboratory Testing, along with an explanation of what information should be included
for each test.
a. Spatial resolution: Measurements of the transfer of information from the image data to
the luminance fields at different spatial frequencies of interest typically done by reporting
the modulation transfer function. Non-isotropic resolution properties should be
characterized properly by providing two-dimensional measurements or measurements
along at least two representative axes.
b. Pixel defects: Measurements (count, types (e.g., sub-pixel or entire pixel, always-on,
always-off), and locations (map)) of pixel defects. This is typically provided as a
tolerance limit. Pixel defects can interfere with the visibility of small details in medical
images.
c. Artifacts: Evaluate for image artifacts such as ghosting and/or image sticking from
displaying a fixed test pattern for a period of time.
d. Temporal response: Measurements of the temporal behavior of the display in responding
to changes in image values from frame to frame. Since these transitions are typically not
symmetric, rise and fall time constants are needed to characterize the system. Slow
displays can alter details and contrast of the image when large image stacks are browsed
or in video, panning, and zooming modes.
a. For non-mammography displays, you should measure the rise and fall time
constants for 5–95% and 40–60% luminance transitions.
b. For mammography displays, you should measure the rise and fall time constants
at several (e.g., every 15 levels) grayscale intervals between 0 and 255.
e. Maximum and minimum luminance (achievable and recommended): Measurements of
the maximum and minimum luminance that the device outputs as used in the application
under recommended conditions and the achievable values if the device is set to expand
the range to the limit.
f. Conformance to a grayscale-to-luminance function (e.g., DICOM GSDF):
Measurements of the mapping between image values and the luminance output following
a target model response for 256 or more levels.
g. Luminance at 30° and 45° in diagonal, horizontal, and vertical directions at center and
four corners: Measurements of the luminance response at off-normal viewing related to
the target model for the luminance response.
h. Luminance uniformity or Mura test: Measurements of the uniformity of the luminance
across the display screen.
i. Stability of luminance and chromaticity responses with temperature and time of
operation (on-time): Measurements of the change in luminance and chromaticity
response with temperature and use time.
j. Spatial noise: Measurements of the spatial noise level as represented by the noise power
spectrum using an appropriate ratio of camera and display pixels. Spatial noise and
resolution affect the way images are presented to the viewer and can alter features that
are relevant to the interpretation process of the physician or radiologist.

10

k. Reflection coefficients: Measurements of the reflection coefficients of the display device.
Specular and diffuse reflection coefficients can be used as surrogates for the full
bidirectional reflection distribution function.
l. Veiling glare or small-spot contrast: Measurements of the contrast obtained for small
targets.
m. Color tracking: Chromaticity at different luminance levels of primary colors as indicated
by the color coordinates in an appropriate units system (e.g., CIE u’v’) and the color
gamut enveloped by the primary colors.
n. Gray tracking: Chromaticity at different luminance levels of gray shades, including the
white point, as indicated by the color coordinates in an appropriate units system (e.g.,
CIE u’v’) (see the recognized version of IEC 62536-1 Medical electrical equipment Medical image display systems - Part 1: Evaluation methods, and ISO/CIE 11664-5
Colorimetry - Part 5: CIE 1976 L*u*v* colour space and u', v' uniform chromaticity

Device Modifications

We recommend that you refer to FDA’s guidance entitled “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k)
for a Change to an Existing Device”16 for subsequent models of the same device family that have
previously received 510(k) clearance. You should perform regression testing and physical
laboratory testing in conformance with the relevant test consensus standards to verify that the
changes did not adversely impact image quality and ensure that the device conforms to
specifications as required under the Quality System Regulation (21 CFR 820.70). For example,
changes in the graphics driver, power supply, or upgrade in the calibration software are unlikely
to affect the safety and effectiveness of the device, and thus, such changes are unlikely to require
a new 510(k) submission under 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3), but sponsors should review the appropriate
regulations and consensus standards to determine whether a new 510(k) submission is necessary.
Sponsors should contact the appropriate FDA review Division with any questions about
modifications made to their devices.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Often, firms may make the same modification(s) to all of their display models. Instead of
submitting a separate 510(k) submission for each display model, FDA recommends submitting a
bundled submission for all impacted display models. Bundling is appropriate for devices that
present scientific and regulatory issues that can most efficiently be addressed during one 510(k)
submission review. For more information, please refer to FDA’s guidance entitled “Bundling
Multiple Devices or Multiple Indications in a Single Submission.”17
