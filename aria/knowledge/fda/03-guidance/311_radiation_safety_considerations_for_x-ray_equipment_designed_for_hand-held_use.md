Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Radiation Safety Considerations for X-Ray
Equipment Designed for Hand-Held Use
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

Introduction
The intent of this guidance is to advise manufacturers and FDA staff about safety procedures
and recommendations that should be provided to the end user to promote safe use of handheld x-ray equipment. In general, there are a number of regulations, consensus safety
standards, and radiation protection guidelines governing the performance and use of
diagnostic x-ray equipment. Diagnostic x-ray equipment manufactured for the US market
must meet the performance requirements described in Title 21 of the Code of Federal
Regulations, sections 1020.30 through 1020.33, which require manufacturers to provide
users with operational and safety information as well as to meet standards for equipment
performance.(1)
Internationally, radiation safety standards are provided by the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) in its collateral standard 60601-1-3.(2) Voluntary guidelines, particularly
relevant to handheld equipment, have been provided by the National Council on Radiation
Protection and Measurement (NCRP) for radiation protection in dentistry.(3) Many states
regulate the use of x-ray equipment under their own regulations based on the Suggested State
Regulations for the Control of Radiation, published by the Conference of Radiation Control
Program Directors (CRCPD).(4)
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory

requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

The Least Burdensome Approach
We believe we should consider the least burdensome approach in all areas of medical device
and electronic product regulation. This guidance reflects our careful review of the relevant
scientific and legal requirements and what we believe is the least burdensome way for you to
comply with those requirements. However, if you believe that an alternative approach would
be less burdensome, please contact us so we can consider your point of view. You may send
your written comments to the contact person listed in the preface to this guidance or to the
CDRH Ombudsman. Comprehensive information on CDRH's Ombudsman, including ways
to contact him, can be found on the Internet at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ombudsman/.

1. Issue
There are two basic sources of potential x-ray exposure to operators that should be addressed
during the use of hand-held diagnostic x-ray equipment:
•
•

Leakage radiation transmitted through the equipment housing and shielding that
surrounds the source assembly
Backscatter radiation from the patient and nearby structures.

2. Guidance
A primary consideration in any radiographic procedure is to reduce the dose to the patient as
well as to the operator as much as possible while still achieving the diagnostic goals. This
guidance briefly discusses the hazards unique to hand-held medical x-ray equipment,
clarifies applicable requirements, and makes recommendations for safe use of the equipment.

What are the exposure concerns with handheld x-ray systems?
The federal performance standard for diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components
did not anticipate hand-held x-ray systems at the time it was written. It therefore does not
address system performance attributes or protective measures in light of the operator’s
proximity to the source assembly and the patient. Because of such proximity, hand-held x-ray
systems pose increased operator exposure concerns due to leakage radiation and backscatter
radiation. The radiation exposure to the operator will be the sum of any radiation leaking
from the x-ray tube source assembly (leakage radiation) and any radiation that scatters from
the patient or any objects in the room that are in the x-ray field (backscattered radiation.)

What limits are placed on leakage and backscatter radiation?

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The applicable performance standard for a diagnostic source assembly, under 21 CFR
1020.30(k), limits radiation leakage from the x-ray source assembly to an air kerma of
0.88 mGy (corresponding to an exposure of 100 mR) in one hour at a distance of one meter
from the x-ray source when measured as specified in the standard.

How can leakage and backscatter radiation to the operator be
reduced?
•

Shield the unit housing as required by the federal standard.
Leakage radiation is of particular concern because the operator may be holding the x-ray
source assembly. Increasing the distance from the source may not be possible. Hand-held
x-ray equipment must incorporate into its design physical means to protect the operator
from leakage radiation with sufficient shielding surrounding the source assembly to
ensure compliance with 21 CFR 1020.30(k).

•

Provide external shielding or a means to increase distance between the operator and
the unit.
To reduce operator exposure to backscatter radiation, manufacturers of hand-held x-ray
equipment should incorporate physical means to provide operator shielding or allow
operation of the unit at a distance. For example, an external, physical shield may be
supplied with the equipment to be placed between the operator and the patient to
attenuate backscatter radiation. Additionally, you may provide a means to initiate x-ray
exposure using an equipment stand and remote switch from a distance to increase
distance between the operator and the unit during exposure.
Any product features designed into the equipment to protect the operator from radiation
exposure should be described in user information with instructions for their proper use.

•

Measure typical exposures near and around the unit.
Because operators will typically be closer than 1 m to the unit, exposure measurements at
distances closer than those required by the Federal standard become important.
Manufacturers of hand-held x-ray units should make and report exposure measurements
at distances near the unit, especially representative of positioning where the operator will
actually be in contact with or in close proximity to the unit during use. For example,
exposures at the location of handgrips and control devices are of particular interest to the
operator of the unit.
These data may be used to estimate an operator’s whole-body or partial-body radiation
dose for a single exposure or over an extended period of typical use. The data may be
compared to occupational exposure limits to ensure limits are not exceeded and allow
users to implement appropriate control measures based on an actual exposure assessment.

•

Identify necessary safety precautions as required by the Federal standard.
Under 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(1)(i) manufacturers must provide “adequate instructions
concerning radiological safety procedures and precautions which may be necessary
3

because of unique features of the equipment.” A unit that is hand-held constitutes a
unique feature that requires manufacturers to describe any safety procedures and
precautions necessary to reduce operator exposure. Safety precautions may include
designating a significant zone of occupancy and providing exposure information near the
unit as described in the IEC standard.(2)
Information on exposure levels near and around a hand-held unit should be included with
operator instructions to identify the unique exposure hazards posed by the equipment.
Providing exposure information will support any manufacturer’s precautions and allow
the operator to develop additional safe working practices to limit unnecessary exposure
during equipment use. Precautions may include wearing appropriate personnel
monitoring and protective equipment, such as a personnel exposure monitoring device or
lead-lined gloves and gowns. Procedural controls may be recommended to limit the
number of exposures initiated by a single operator over a period or time, or to limit use of
the hand-held unit without an equipment stand or remote switch in such circumstances
only as necessary.
Manufacturers may also include information describing exposure hazards and radiation
safety precautions appropriate for patients and other individuals present in the area
during examination (e.g., a person holding a child or other personnel assisting with
procedures).

3. Getting More Information
For additional information on state requirements applicable to hand-held x-ray systems, refer
to your state’s radiation control program regulations. The CRCPD website has a list of
contacts for each state (http://www.crcpd.org/links.asp). Please contact your state officials
on this subject. Another resource to consider is the Suggested State Regulations for the
Control of Radiation. Some state programs do not allow the use of hand-held x-ray
equipment.
