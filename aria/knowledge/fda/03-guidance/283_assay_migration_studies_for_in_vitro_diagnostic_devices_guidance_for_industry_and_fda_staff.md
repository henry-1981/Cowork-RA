Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro
Diagnostic Devices
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

I.

Introduction

This guidance outlines FDA’s regulatory approach for approval of Class III in vitro
diagnostic devices, as well as certain licensed1 or certain cleared2 in vitro diagnostic devices
in cases, when a previously approved, licensed, or cleared assay is migrating (i.e.,
transitioning) to another system for which assay performance has not been evaluated by
FDA.2 In this guidance the term “new system” refers to the system (assay, instrument, and
software) to which the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed/cleared
system. The term “old system” refers to the system (assay, instrument and software) which
was approved/licensed/cleared from which the assay is migrating to a currently
unapproved/unlicensed/uncleared system.
This guidance is focused on the study designs and performance criteria that should be
fulfilled in order for a sponsor to utilize the migration study approach in support of the
change. FDA will review information from the sponsor, including results of analytical and
comparison studies outlined in this guidance, as well as device descriptions and risk
analyses, to determine whether the use of the approved/licensed/cleared assay with the new
system may compromise safety and effectiveness of the assay. The guidance document
describes information that we recommend you include in a PMA (premarket approval
1 This guidance does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation

and Research (CBER).

This guidance can be used for 510(k) devices where the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family Policy
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm079185.htm)
does not apply (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests) and devices for which transitioning to a new system
presents specific concerns, either because of the nature of the analyte and indications, or because of the specific
technology used.

application) supplement, a BLA (Biologics License Application) supplement, or a 510(k)
(premarket notification). For devices regulated by OIR (Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and
Radiological Health, within CDRH), sponsors may contact OIR, and for those regulated by
CBER, sponsors may contact CBER to obtain feedback concerning study plans.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II. Background
The FDA believes that the assay migration study paradigm discussed in this guidance
provides a least burdensome scientific and regulatory pathway for manufacturers to transfer a
previously approved or licensed assay with full clinical data from an old system to a new
system (not approved. licensed, or cleared). The paradigm is suitable in cases when
sufficient knowledge can be derived from the documentation of design controls, risk
analyses, and prior performance studies on an old system.
If you make further modifications or iterations of the old or new system you should compare
back to the original old system that has full clinical data when performing new migration
studies. However, if the old system with full clinical data is no longer available please
contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division for further discussion.
The migration studies approach is related to the Replacement Reagent and Instrument Family
Policy that FDA uses for many Class I and Class II diagnostic devices.3 Similar to that
policy, migration studies rest on the premise that as platform changes are made throughout
the lifetime of an approved, licensed, or cleared assay, smaller and more focused analytical
and clinical data sets, along with prior knowledge of device design and performance, could
allow for a determination that the safety and effectiveness profile of the modified system has
not been compromised.
The assay migration study paradigm is practical, risk based, and consistent with FDA’s
Critical Path Initiative, which is intended to help bring new medical products to market
successfully and efficiently4. FDA believes that with proper control and review, migration
studies will meet regulatory thresholds for premarket review in a manner that will be least
burdensome for both companies and FDA while protecting public health.

III. Scope
This guidance is intended to be applied, where appropriate, to licensed donor screening tests5
and approved (Class III) in vitro diagnostic assays, as well as 510(k) cleared assays for which
migration to a new system presents concerns. Possible scenarios for assay migration are
when the assay is being transferred from a manual system to an automated or semi-automated
instrument system or from a semi-automated instrument system to a fully automated
instrument system, or from one automated instrument system to another (and vice versa for
all scenarios). A broad variety of methodologies may use the migration studies paradigm
depending on what is known about the two Systems involved. Assay transfer may be from
one approved, licensed, or cleared old system to a new system that has the same technical
characteristics. However, if scientific evidence suggests migration studies may not be
adequate to predict actual clinical testing performance on the new system, the assay
migration paradigm should not apply and FDA will recommend that traditional evaluation
studies be performed.
Assay migration studies are ideally suited for test systems for which the assay output (raw
signal) is a numeric result or is expressed as a signal to cutoff (S/CO). Devices for which a
numeric output is not available might be more difficult to analyze and may not be suitable
candidates for use of this approach.
Migration studies would not be applicable to the following devices or to system changes that
are generally considered significant, such as:
·

systems intended for over-the-counter use,

·

systems intended for prescription home use, or

·

devices that do not meet the Critical Considerations criteria stated below.

The FDA strongly recommends that sponsors discuss proposed migration studies with the
Agency early in the product design and testing process in order to determine if the proposed
changes are consistent with the considerations that would allow for focused testing. An early
contact with the Agency is especially recommended for an assay being transferred from a
manual system to an automated or semi-automated instrument system. For CBER licensed
devices, this contact may be through an IND, or protocol review, providing preliminary
protocols, data, and justifications prior to performing the migration studies. The size, nature,
5

FDA does not believe that this guidance is suitable for use in its entirety when immunohematology tests (e.g.,
blood grouping, blood group antibody detection and/or identification, crossmatching) are being migrated
because of the differences in assay methodology and results reading and interpretation as compared to the other
assays and systems described in this guidance. If you believe that your immunohematology reagents and
system can be evaluated using the criteria outlined in this guidance, contact the responsible review division in
CBER. Immunohematology products are reviewed in the Devices Review Branch, Division of Blood
Applications, Office of Blood Research and Review, CBER.

and scope of migration studies we recommend will depend on a detailed evaluation of the old
and new systems, the level of regulation appropriate for the product (e.g., PMA, BLA, or
510(k)), the performance characteristics of the assay, and the design and scope of the
analytical testing and clinical trials used to support approval, licensure, or clearance of the
assay on the old system.

IV. Critical Considerations for Determining Whether
The Migration Studies Paradigm May Apply To A
Particular Device
A sponsor should take into account the following critical considerations in determining
whether the migration studies approach is appropriate for a particular product, and describe
these considerations in the submission:
·

The intended use and indications for use for the new system should be unchanged
from the old system, except for inclusion of the new system.

·

Reagent and assay parameters (e.g., cutoff) should be unchanged, except for very
minor differences (such as small changes in incubation times) in order to optimize the
assay on the new system. However, the sponsor should provide evidence that the
changes do not compromise the assay’s performance.

·

Some assay technologies may not be good candidates for the migration studies
paradigm (e.g., assays with relatively high imprecision near the assay cutoff).

·

Assay and system technologies should remain unchanged. All biochemical (e.g.,
antibody and antigen interactions or DNA probe construct) and physical detection
(e.g., colorimetric, chemiluminescence, or dye binding) technologies should be
unchanged from the old system. Minor differences in hardware instrumentation may
be appropriate and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

·

There should be no expected change to the assay performance when run on the new
system. However, actual changes will be evaluated in the context of their impact on
the clinical use of the assay. Due to the limited number of positive and negative
samples, the migration studies approach is not appropriate to support changes in
clinical performance claims.

V. Additional Considerations
In addition to addressing each of the critical considerations noted in Section IV, you should
also include the information listed below to demonstrate the applicability of migration
studies to the transfer of the assay from the old system to the new system. The information
in your submission should include, but is not limited to, the following:

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

Device description, including functional block diagrams and hardware and software
components for both the old and new systems to allow an evaluation of the changes to
the new system when compared to the old system.

·

A similarities and differences table for a side-by-side comparison of assay parameters
and hardware/software functions, requirements and design.

·

A risk analysis of the new system (software/hardware/assay) using relevant guidance
6,7
documents.

·

Summaries of software data validating functional operation of alerts and alarms in
real or simulated circumstances.

·

System Operator Manual(s): If the new system was previously approved or licensed
with analytes other than the one under consideration, a new review of the System
Operator Manual may only be called for if changes have been made that impact
safety and effectiveness, or if there are assay-specific sections or changes.

·

Proposed modifications to the labeling that appropriately describe respective prior
data and new migration study information. The sponsor should consult with FDA
when determining whether a dual or separate package insert will be appropriate.
Inclusion of the old system’s analytical and performance data should be included
where appropriate.

In addition, the sponsor should include documentation on software and instrumentation for
the new system. When appropriate for the device, this documentation should meet all
recommendations for the appropriate Level of Concern.7 To further minimize risk, studies
should be performed on the final production model of the new system that is intended to be
marketed. Likewise, studies should be performed using the final release candidate of the
software and any differences between the release candidate and the final release should be
evaluated using a risk based approach and included in the submission for FDA review.
If you are using the migration paradigm to migrate an approved Class III assay to an
instrument that has not previously been cleared or approved, or to move an approved Class
III manual assay to an instrument not previously cleared or approved, you should submit
documentation describing the hardware and software design controls, including design
verification and validation, along with other appropriate Quality Systems documentation.

System information that FDA recommends including in premarket applications please also

part of the original class III assay approval process, then a site inspection may be conducted.

VI. Assay Migration Studies
This section outlines specific studies that may be appropriate to support assay migration for
in vitro diagnostic devices. Before preparing to use the migration studies approach, you
should determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative,
according to the definitions in this guidance. Specifically, for the purposes of this guidance,
qualitative assays are those that use numeric values (e.g., signal, S/CO), to determine
nominal categorical assay results (e.g., positive or negative). Quantitative assays determine
numeric values which are referenced to a measuring interval, and standards that allow
determination of analyte concentrations. Section VI.A below describes studies for
qualitative assays; Sections VI.B and VI.C address quantitative assays and semi-quantitative
assays respectively; and Section VI.D addresses point-of-care assays. Special considerations
for blood screening assays are covered in Appendix I, “Migration Studies for Blood Donor
Screening Assays.”

A.

Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays
1. Analytical Studies for Qualitative Assays
The evaluations described below are based on the idea that similar studies were
conducted previously for the old system. If the study design of the analytical studies
conducted for the old system were different from the design of the studies described in
this guidance, please contact the FDA for feedback. If you believe that some of the
studies outlined in this document do not apply to your particular device, you should
present your justification for FDA review.
We recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is
impractical, in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens
with archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical
samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific
samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as
much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss
appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative
specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.

a) Performance at Low Analyte Levels
You should evaluate the performance of the assay on the new system compared to the
old system at low analyte levels (e.g., with dilution panels and seroconversion
panels).
·

Where available, assay performance at low positive analyte levels using
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
dilution panels should be based on international standards (e.g., World Health
Organization (WHO) standards, Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) standards) and
compared with the old system.
·

If available and appropriate, test well-characterized seroconversion panels
similar in number and type to the panels originally used to support
approval/licensure/clearance. The seroconversion panels should be run on
both the old system and the new system.

b) Precision
This section describes precision study designs including panel composition.

(i) Composition of Precision Panel
The categorical result of a qualitative test is determined using the numeric test
data and a cutoff(s) (e.g., a numeric threshold), which define numeric ranges that
correspond to the final result categories. For a qualitative test with two
categorical results, a cutoff (one threshold) is used to define positive and negative
results of the test. When the observed numeric test data exceeds the threshold, the
final result is considered positive (or “reactive”, “detected”). When the observed
numeric test result is below the cutoff, it is considered negative (or “not reactive”,
“not detected”).
Qualitative assays discriminating between two classes of subjects (non-diseased
vs diseased) can fall into two groups: 1) assays used in situations where nondiseased subject samples have a true zero concentration of the analyte of interest,
and 2) assays used in situations where non-diseased subject samples have a
detectable analyte concentration. For the latter, the cutoff was chosen to optimize
clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay based on a clinical data set.
Appropriate precision panels for these two types of assays, as well as assays that
produce equivocal results, and/or have a re-test zone, are discussed in more detail
in (a)-(c), below:
(a) When non-diseased subject samples have a detectable amount of
analyte.
For the non-diseased subject samples that have a detectable amount of analyte
the cutoff of the assay is higher than the limit of the blank. A useful
characteristic of the cutoff is that a sample with a concentration (determined
by the mean signal to cutoff value from a large a series of replicate
measurements) at the cutoff yields a positive result 50% of the time and a
negative result 50% of the time when a large number of replicates of that
sample are run under stipulated conditions (see Figure 1 below). We denote
this concentration as C50.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Figure 1. Results of a qualitative assay (probability density function) for
a sample with a concentration at the cutoff measured multiple times.
For samples with concentrations exceeding C50, one expects to see positive
results more than 50% of the time, and similarly for samples with a
concentration below C50, one expects to see positive results less than 50% of
the time. In this guidance we refer to an analyte concentration that yields,
upon evaluating many replicates, a positive result 95% of the time (and a
negative result 5% of the time) as a Low Positive concentration (C95
concentration). We refer to a sample concentration which yields a positive
result 5% of the time (and negative result 95% of the time) as a High Negative
concentration (C5 concentration). Samples with concentrations of analyte
close to C95 and C5 as determined by the old system are recommended for the
within-laboratory precision (see CLSI8 document EP12). The panel should
consist of at least four members, as described below (also, see Figure 2):
·

A True Negative sample: a sample with a true analyte concentration of
zero.

·

A High Negative sample: a sample that repeatedly tests negative
approximately 95% of the time and positive 5% of the time by the old
system. One should expect that the same concentration tested by the
new system will also produce negative results approximately 95% of

8

Clinical Laboratory and Standards Institute. CLSI documents referenced in this guidance are listed in Section
XI of this document.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the time (C5 concentration as determined by the old system).
·

A Low Positive sample: a sample with an analyte concentration
around C95 as determined by the old system. Repeatedly testing this
sample by the old system should give a positive result approximately
95% of the time and a negative result 5% of the time. One should
expect that the same concentration tested by the new system will also
produce positive results approximately 95% of the time. Note that if
the LoB is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C95 is the same as
the LoD.

·

A Moderate Positive sample: a sample with a concentration close to
the cutoff, and at which one observes positive results by the old system
approximately 100% of the time (e.g., a sample with a signal
approximately two to three times the signal at the cutoff if the
cutoff=1.0, or a sample with concentration approximately two to three
times the 95% LoD if the cutoff is based on LoB).

Figure 2. Relationship between percent of positive results and the analyte
cutoff concentration.
For the details of how the C95 and C5 concentrations can be evaluated from the
previous precision studies of the old system, see Appendix II: Statistical
Notes, 1. For the precision study of the new system, it is not necessary to
have the High Negative and Low Positive samples at exactly C5 or C95 of the
old system. If the High Negative and Low Positive samples in the precision
study of the new system are close enough to the cutoff that the standard

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
deviation (or percent coefficient of variation (CV) is approximately constant
over the range around the cutoff, the C5 and C95 of the new system can be
evaluated from this precision study (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 1).
(b) When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte
concentration.
When non-diseased subject samples have a true zero analyte concentration
there are two types of assays: (1) assays for which samples with zero
concentration have a distribution of numeric signals and the cutoff of the
assay is the limit of blank (with some type I error, for example, 5%); and (2)
ultrasensitive assays for which samples with zero analyte concentration
almost always have a negative assay result (type I error is close to zero).
These two types of assays are discussed further in the two bullets below.
·

Consider assays where samples with zero analyte concentration have a
distribution of numeric signals and the limit of blank is used as a
cutoff. In this case the concentration C95 is the same as the limit of
detection (LoD) and zero concentration (no analyte present in sample)
is C5 as illustrated in Figure 3, below. The precision panel should
consist of at least the following three members: True Negative, Low
Positive (around LoD) and Moderately Positive.

Figure 3. Relationship between the percent of positive results and the
analyte concentration where True Negative samples produce numeric
results and the C95 concentration is the LoD of the assay.

·

For ultrasensitive assays that employ, for example, a signal
amplification methodology (e.g., real-time PCR), the following
approaches for precision panel members are recommended. For
ultrasensitive assays, the concentration range that spans High Negative
(around C5) to Low Positive (around C95=LoD) is narrow with respect
to the observed concentration range of clinical specimens. Due to this
narrow range, it may be difficult to prepare a sample with C5
concentration.
If less than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an
observed concentration less than C95, then samples at the C5
concentration could be excluded from the precision panel. In this
case, samples which compose the precision panel should include the
following concentrations: True Negative, Low Positive (around C95)
and Moderately Positive.
If more than 10% of all subjects positive by the old system have an
observed concentration less than C95, then samples which compose the
precision panel should include the following concentrations: True
Negative, Low Positive (around C95), samples in the range of C20 to
C80 and Moderately Positive as illustrated in Figure 4, below.

Figure 4. Relationship between the percent of positive results and the
analyte concentration for an ultrasensitive assay showing a narrow
concentration range between C5 and C95.
11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(c) When an assay with a numeric value produces an equivocal result and/or
has a re-test zone.
If your assay with numeric values produces an equivocal result and/or has a
re-test zone, then the assay has two cutoffs, E1 and E2:
If S/CO < E1 then the assay result is Negative
If E1 ≤ S/CO ≤ E2 then the assay result is equivocal or in the re-test zone
If S/CO > E2 then the assay result is Positive
As an example, the numeric values of the assay with equivocal results defined
as having S/CO from E1 to E2 are shown graphically in Figure 5, below.

Figure 5. Relationship of numeric values and result categories for an
assay with equivocal results.
The C5 and C95 concentrations for the old system are calculated for cutoffs E1
and E2 respectively using the same method as described in Appendix II:
Statistical Notes, 1. In this case, samples which compose the precision panel
should include the following concentrations: True Negative; near the
equivocal (and/or re-test) zone: near the C5 for cutoff E1 and near the C95 for
cutoff E2; and Moderately Positive.
In addition to the samples described for all panels (a-c) above, you should run the
appropriate control material (negative and positive controls) and calibrators in the
precision study.

(ii) Within-Laboratory Precision Study
We recommend that you conduct in-house within-laboratory precision studies (to
supplement the external site reproducibility studies described below in Section
VI.A.1.b.iii). When appropriate and justified, the in-house within-laboratory
precision study may not be necessary, such as (1) if you established that the new
system only needs to be recalibrated at relatively long time intervals (e.g., 6
months or more) and any other concerns can be appropriately addressed by the
reproducibility study, or (2) if the new system is recalibrated daily, so that

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
calibration cycle variability is inseparable from day-to-day variability (which is
assessed by the reproducibility studies described below) and any other concerns
can be appropriately addressed by the reproducibility study.
It may be sufficient to perform within-laboratory precision studies only on the
new system. However, if the study design or composition of the precision panel
of the old system precision study was very different from that described in this
guidance, it may be important to perform the precision study on the old system as
well. The within-laboratory precision study described below is based on CLSI
document EP05.
Sources of variability we recommend for the within-laboratory precision study are
at least 12 days of testing, with 2 runs per day, and 2 replicates of each sample per
run. These 12 days are not necessarily consecutive. If the system calibration
variation composes a significant portion of the total system variation, or the
calibration interval fits within the time frame of the studies, then at least 2
calibration cycles should be included in the study design; otherwise you should,
provide your rationale for not including an evaluation of the variation introduced
due to instrument calibration. For each cycle, days at the beginning and end of
the cycle should be included (e.g., 3 days at the beginning and 3 days at the end
for each cycle). You should include other additional sources of variability in the
design of the study, if they are important to the specific assay (e.g., operators,
lots, etc.). In such cases, overall modification to the variables might be possible
(e.g., spreading days of testing between different operators). If analytical and
clinical performance is similar across all matrices that are included in the intended
use of the old system, then establishing performance of the new system using the
most commonly employed matrix may suffice.

(iii) Reproducibility Study
We recommend you perform the reproducibility study based on a modification of
CLSI document EP05 on the new system. The panel composition and analyte
levels for this study should be the same as described above (in Section
VI.A.1.b.i). Sources of variability should include testing for at least 5 days, 2
runs per day, with 3 replicates of each panel member per run, at 3 laboratories of
which at least 2 are external sites. Other sources of variability might be
applicable if relevant to the specific assay (e.g. operators). If analytical and
clinical performance is similar across all matrices intended for use with the old
system, then establishing performance of the new system using the most
commonly employed matrix may suffice.
For each concentration level, similar information should be available for the old
system. Otherwise, you should perform a new reproducibility study for the old
system with study design and concentration levels as described in this section.

2. Comparison Studies for Qualitative Assays
You should perform comparison studies using comparison panels described below.
However, minor changes to the old system might not warrant performing all comparison
studies. The extent of the utility of these studies can be evaluated on a case-by-case basis
in consultation with the FDA.

a) Comparison Panels
For each analyte, the qualitative assay comparison panels should consist of the
following:
·

Panels of samples known to be positive or negative for a specific assay on the
old system (in order to evaluate the same assay on the new system). We
suggest that the positive and negative panels have at least 100 panel members
each.
Positive panel members should be prepared so that approximately 60%­
80% of the samples have analyte levels close to the cutoff. Of these
samples, approximately one half should be close to the C95 (or LoD) of the
old system and the other half should be Moderate Positive samples. The
remaining positive samples should evenly cover the full detection range of
the assay.
Negative panel members should be prepared so that approximately 30%­
40% are High Negatives (close to C5 of the old system). Because FDA is
assessing clinical effectiveness based upon the result agreement for the
assay performed on the two instruments, these samples can have an
analyte concentration below the cutoff such that repeat testing of these
samples should be negative approximately 95% of the time. Alternatively,
these High Negative samples may be obtained from archived clinical
samples giving a signal just below the cutoff. For ultrasensitive assays,
negative panel members should include at least 100 True Negative
samples.

·

If the assay produces an equivocal result and/or has a re-test zone, then the
assay has two cutoffs, E1 and E2. For the purpose of defining acceptable
concentration ranges of negative and positive panel members, consider the
lower bound of the equivocal or re-test zone as E1 and the upper bound as E2
noted below:
If S/CO < E1 then the assay result is Negative
If E1 ≤ S/CO ≤ E2 then the assay result is equivocal, or in the re-test zone.
If S/CO > E2 then the assay result is Positive

14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Positive panel members should be prepared so that approximately 60%­
80% of the samples have analyte levels close to the cutoffs. Of these
samples, approximately one half should be close to the C95, calculated
using E2 based on the precision of the old system, and the other half
should be Moderate Positive samples. The remaining positive samples
should evenly cover the full detection range of the assay. Among the
samples close to the C95, some samples should be in the equivocal zone
(and/or in the re-test zone), as defined by the old system.
Negative panel members should be prepared so that approximately 30%­
40% are High Negatives (close to the C5 calculated using E1 based on the
precision of the old system). Because FDA is assessing clinical
effectiveness based upon the result agreement for the assay performed
with the two systems, these samples can have an analyte concentration
below the cutoff such that repeat testing of these samples should be
negative approximately 95% of the time. Alternatively, these High
Negative samples may be obtained from archived clinical samples giving
a signal just below the lower bound of the equivocal or re-test zone (E1).
Among the samples close to the C5, some samples should be in the
equivocal (and/or re-test) zone as defined by the old system.
·

It is preferable to use non-contrived clinical samples to create the panel
members. However, where positive samples are not available or volumes are
low, you should work with the FDA to define acceptable sample types.
Positive panel members may be diluted in a clinical matrix in some cases.
Preferably, individual negative samples should be used for each dilution.
Spiked samples may be acceptable, but only from individual strong positives
in the appropriate clinical matrix (i.e., the same sample cannot be used to
prepare multiple panel samples).

·

Archived samples are acceptable if stored in accordance with the package
insert instructions. The samples should be randomized and masked.

b) Comparison Study Design
You should test the comparison panels on the old system at a minimum of one site.
This may be done in-house. However, we recommend use of at least two of the old
systems to better assess systematic differences between different old systems. The
new system should be tested at a minimum of three sites (one may be in-house) with
one or more reagent kit lots. Each panel member should be tested at least four times:
once with the old system and three times with the new system. You should send the
same positive and negative panels to each site, rather than dividing the panel between
the three sites. Three different builds with unique serial numbers of the new system
should be tested, one unique serial numbered system at each of the three sites.

3. Statistical Analysis of Data

15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend you include the information described in Sections a-c below for each of
the respective studies, in your submission:

a) Within-Laboratory Precision Study
·

For each sample tested, we recommend you present the mean value with
variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) for numeric values
for the new system. In addition, you should include the percent of values
above and below the cutoff for each sample. You should also provide an
estimation of C5 and C95 of the new system (see Appendix II: Statistical
Notes, 1).

·

For each analyte concentration, you should provide similar information for the
old system. You can obtain this information from the precision study you
originally used to demonstrate the performance of the old system, if the study
design and the analyte concentration levels are comparable to those used to
assess the new system. You can utilize information about variance
components (standard deviation and percent CV) from the precision study
found in the old system labeling. However, if the study design and analyte
concentrations for the old system are different from those described in this
document, a new precision study for the old system should be performed to
allow for comparison between systems.

·

For similar analyte concentrations, we recommend you provide repeatability
(within-run precision) and within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and
percent CV) of the New and old systems (precision profiles of the New and
old systems). In addition, you should provide the ratio of the standard
deviations of the New and old systems along with the 95% confidence interval
for this ratio. The confidence interval can be based on the F-statistic for a
ratio of variances (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2).

b) Reproducibility Study
·

For each analyte concentration level, we recommend you present the mean
value with variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) for the
new system, for each site separately and for all sites combined. In addition,
for each panel member, you should include the percent of values above and
below the cutoff, for each site separately and for all sites combined. You
should also provide an estimation of C5 and C95 of the new system, for each
site separately and for all sites combined.

·

For each analyte concentration level, we recommend you present similar
information for the old system. This information can be taken from the
precision study originally used to demonstrate the performance of the old
system if the study design and the analyte concentration levels are comparable
to those used to assess the new system. The information about variance
components (standard deviation and percent CV) can be obtained from the

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
precision study found in the old system labeling. If the study design and
analyte concentrations are different than those described in this document, a
new precision study for the old system should be performed.
·

For similar concentrations, you should provide repeatability (within-run
precision), within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and percent CV)
and reproducibility separately and combined over three sites for the new
systems and old system (precision profiles of the new system and old system).
In addition, we recommend you provide the ratio of repeatability standard
deviations along with 95% confidence intervals and the ratio of the
reproducibility standard deviations of the New and old systems. The
confidence intervals for the ratios can be based on the F-statistic for a ratio of
variances (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2).

c) Comparison Panels
·

You should provide a scatter-plot of S/CO or any other numeric values that
differentiate between positive (reactive) and negative (non-reactive) of the old
system (X-axis) vs. S/CO of the new system (Y-axis) with descriptive
statistics, for data generated at each site as well as for all sites combined.
Both axes should have the same scale, and the line of identity (y=x) should be
presented. The same scale on the axes should be applied to the data from each
site. In addition you should provide similar scatter plots for negative and
positive specimens separately.

·

You should provide an estimation of systematic differences between the
numeric values generated by the old system and the new system at each site
and for all sites combined (CLSI document EP09). You should perform the
appropriate regression analysis (Deming regression, see Appendix II:
Statistical Notes, 3), which accounts for the random errors associated with the
old and new system measurements and provide the 95% confidence intervals
of the slope and intercept from the regression analysis. The emphasis should
be placed on estimating the systematic difference between the numeric values
of the old and new systems around the cutoff. You should also calculate the
average systematic difference separately for the Negative, High Negative,
Low Positive and High Positive samples of the comparison panel.

·

We recommend that you present tables (e.g., with old system results defined
by the columns and new system results defined by the rows), for data derived
from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes,
4). For the qualitative assays with equivocal (and/or re-test zone), the results
of the comparison study should be presented in 3-by-3 tables from data
derived from each site and for all data combined (see Appendix II: Statistical
Notes, 5). Based on these tables, you should calculate positive and negative
percent agreements at each site along with the corresponding 95% two-sided
confidence intervals (for confidence intervals, see Appendix II: Statistical
Notes, 6). In addition, you should provide the positive and negative percent
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
agreements averaged over three sites with the corresponding 95% two-sided
confidence intervals. Because the same samples are used at all three sites, we
suggest that a bootstrap approach may be useful for calculating such
confidence intervals.
·

For qualitative assays with equivocal results (and/or a re-test zone), the
comparison study data should be analyzed as having three ordinal categories
(e.g., negative, equivocal, positive). Note that the purpose of a migration
comparison study is to evaluate the extent of differences between the numeric
values obtained from the old system and numeric values obtained from the
new system. While re-testing may be indicated in the package insert, this
additional testing is unnecessary to fulfill the migration comparison study
objective. The initial numeric values should be used in the numeric analysis.
For qualitative assays with equivocal results (and/or re-test zone), we
recommend that you present tables of agreement including positive, negative
and equivocal (and/or re-test) as categorical results for data derived for each
site and for all sites combined (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 5). Based
on the three-by-three tables of agreement, you should calculate positive and
negative agreements along with 95% two-sided confidence intervals, and
percents of different results by the new system for the equivocal results by the
old system for each site separately and for all sites combined. From the three­
by-three table, you should calculate the percent of equivocal (and/or re-test)
results reported by the new system that are discordant with the equivocal
results by the old system. For evaluation of the percents of different results
by the new system for the equivocal results by the old system that reflect the
natural variability between two measurements by the old system, you should
present an allowable total difference zone and perform calculations described
in Section VI.B.3.c, below (and in Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 7 and 10).

4. Acceptance Criteria for Qualitative Assay Migration Studies
In addition to the acceptance criteria for performance of the new system at low levels of
analyte and for seroconversion panels (if applicable), we recommend you apply the
following criteria to demonstrate that there are no changes to performance characteristics
that could affect the safety and effectiveness of the device:
·

The systematic difference between numeric values (e.g., signal output, S/CO) of
the new and old systems should be either not clinically significant and not
statistically significant, or, if statistically significant, should not be clinically
significant (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 8).

·

The ratio of standard deviations in the precision studies (reproducibility and
within-laboratory precision) of the old and new systems should be either not

18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
clinically significant and not statistically significant or, if statistically significant,
should not be clinically significant (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2 and 8).
·

Conceptually, the new system measurements can be considered comparable to the
old system measurements if the new system measurements of a sample are similar
to the repeated evaluations of the same sample when run on the old system. For
the old system measurements, one can expect high agreement between repeated
measurements for the samples with high concentrations of analyte giving
measurement results far from the cutoff, and some degree of discordance for the
samples with concentrations measuring close to the cutoff.
In the study using comparison panels, the lower limits of the 95% two-sided
confidence intervals for the positive and negative percent agreements between the
new system and the old system should be higher than 90% (see Appendix II:
Statistical Notes, 9). Discordant results between the Old and new systems can
only occur with samples close to the cutoff and not with moderate or high positive
samples by the old system (similarly, not with moderate or low negative samples
by the old system).

·

You should investigate any statistically or clinically significant differences found
between the two systems (e.g., in precision testing performance or any systematic
difference), and perform risk assessments to determine the percentage of the
intended use population that would be affected by such a difference.

B. Migration Studies for Quantitative Assays
1. Analytical Studies for Quantitative Assays
If you believe that some of the studies described in this section do not apply to your
particular device, you should describe your reasoning in detail in your application to
FDA. If the design of the analytical studies conducted for the old system were different
from those described in this guidance, please contact FDA.
We recommend that you use fresh clinical specimens for all analytical studies. If this is
impractical in some cases you may substitute or supplement fresh clinical specimens with
archived samples. If archived samples are not available, spiked or diluted clinical
samples may be used. In some instances, use of otherwise contrived matrix-specific
samples may also be appropriate; however these should mimic clinical specimens as
much as is feasible. We recommend that you contact FDA if you wish to discuss
appropriate sample types for these evaluations. The matrix of any of these alternative
specimens should be the same as that specified by the intended use of the old system.

a) Performance at Low Analyte Levels
For assays that were previously approved or licensed with a specified LoB (limit of
blank) and LoD (limit of detection), the same evaluations should be repeated with the

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
new system. The study should demonstrate that the LoB and LoD are very similar for
both systems (a protocol is described in CLSI document EP17). Specifically, the
sample with a concentration at the LoD (reported as “analyte detected” approximately
95% of the time, measured by the old system) should also be reported as “analyte
detected” approximately 95% of the time, if measured by the new system. See Figure
6 below regarding the LoD.

Figure 6. Relationship between the signal distributions from multiple
measurements of a blank sample and a sample with an analyte concentration at
the Limit of Detection.
The limit of quantitation (LoQ, or lower limit of measuring range) of the new system
should be estimated and compared with the LoQ of the old system (see CLSI
document EP17) and should be similar to that of the old system. The specification
criteria for the LoQ of the new system should be the same as for the old system. We
also recommend that the LoQ correspond to an analyte concentration level used in the
precision studies.

b) Precision
This section describes precision study designs including panel composition.

(i) Composition of Precision Panel
We recommend you evaluate samples with the following levels of analyte:
·

Lowest limit of the measuring range

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

A level of analyte below the medical decision point

·

Around the medical decision point

·

A level of analyte above the medical decision point

·

Upper limit of the measuring range.

In addition, you should run the appropriate control material and calibrators
associated with the test kit in the precision study.
If the assay has more than one medical decision point, then samples with
concentrations around these medical decision points should be evaluated. It is
understood that some assays will not have a specific medical decision point, but
rather a range of values; in such cases, the panel should contain samples scattered
throughout the measuring range of the assay.

(ii) Within-Laboratory Precision Study
We recommend that you conduct in-house within-laboratory precision studies (to
supplement the external site reproducibility studies described below in Section
VI.B.1.b.iii). When appropriate and justified, the in-house within-laboratory
precision study may not be called for, for example, (1) if the manufacturer
established that the new system only needs to be recalibrated at relatively long
time intervals (e.g., 6 months or more) and any other concerns can be
appropriately addressed by the reproducibility study, or (2) if the new system is
recalibrated daily, so that calibration cycle variability is inseparable from day-to­
day variability (which is assessed by the reproducibility studies described below)
and any other concerns can be appropriately addressed by the reproducibility
study.
It may be sufficient to perform within-laboratory precision studies only on the
new system. However, if the study design or composition of the precision panel
of the old system precision study was very different from that described in this
guidance, it may be important to perform the precision study on the old system as
well. The within-laboratory precision study described below is based on CLSI
document EP05.
Sources of variability for the within-laboratory precision study which we
recommend you include are at least 12 days of testing, with 2 runs per day, and 2
replicates of each sample per run. These 12 days are not necessarily consecutive.
If system calibration variation composes a significant portion of the total system
variation, or the calibration interval fits within the time frame of the studies, then
at least 2 calibration cycles should be included in the study design; otherwise you
should provide your rationale for not including an evaluation of the variation
introduced due to instrument calibration. For each cycle, you should include days
at the beginning and end of the cycle (e.g., 3 days at the beginning and 3 days at
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the end of each cycle, for each cycle). You should include other additional
sources of variability in the design of the study if they are important to the
specific assay (e.g., operators, lots, etc.). In such cases overall modification to the
variables might be possible (e.g., spreading days of testing between different
operators). If analytical and clinical performance is similar across all matrices
that are included in the Intended Use of the old system, then establishing
performance of the new system using the most commonly employed matrix may
suffice.

(iii)

Reproducibility Study

We recommend you perform the reproducibility study based on CLSI documents
EP05 and EP15 on the new system. The panel composition and analyte levels for
this study should be the same as described for the within-laboratory precision
study above (Section VI.B.1.b.ii). We recommend that sources of variability
should include testing for at least 5 days, 2 runs per day, with 3 replicates of each
panel member per run at 3 laboratories (1 in-house and 2 external sites). Other
sources of variability might be applicable if relevant to the specific assay (e.g.,
operators, etc.). If analytical and clinical performance is similar across all
matrices that are indicated for the old system, then establishing performance of
the new system using the most commonly employed matrix may suffice.
For each concentration level, similar information should be available for the old
system. If this is not the case, a new reproducibility study for the old system
should be performed with study design and concentration levels as described in
this section.

c) Linearity Study
We recommend that you evaluate linearity for the new system according to CLSI
document EP06. The degree of linearity can be quantified using the maximum
deviation from linearity (i.e., the delta described in CLSI document EP06). Your
linearity study results should demonstrate that the delta of the new system is not
greater than the observed delta in the linearity studies of the old system. You should
determine the appropriate number of replicates in the linearity study for the new
system based on the precision studies of the new system.

2. Comparison Studies
You should perform comparison studies using comparison panels. Relatively minor
changes to the old system might not warrant all comparison studies. The extent of the
utility of these studies can be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the
FDA.

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

a) Comparison Panels
For each analyte, the composition of the quantitative assay comparison panels should
consist of at least 180 samples9, including the following:
·

150 of the 180 samples should span the measuring range of the assay with
approximately equal numbers of samples at low, medium and high analyte
concentrations.

·

If the performance of the assay at low level concentrations is clinically
important, the remaining panel members should consist of at least 30 samples
(or about 15%-20% of the total) that should be patient samples with
concentration at or near zero. The zero-level samples may need to consist of
different matrices and/or be from persons with unrelated medical conditions.

·

It is preferable to use non-contrived clinical samples. However, where
clinical samples are not available, or volumes are low, pooling is a possible
strategy. If pooling would not be efficacious, then dilutions, made serially of
individual samples with a high analyte concentration diluted into appropriate
clinical matrices, can be used. Spiked samples are acceptable, if they are
prepared from individual samples with high analyte concentrations in clinical
matrices (i.e., the same sample should not be used repetitively).

·

Archived samples are acceptable if stored in accordance with the package
insert instructions. Samples should be masked, and randomized with respect
to the order in which they are run.

·

The panel should consist of appropriate analyte-specific members. For
example, different subtypes or strains of an infectious agent should be
included when applicable.

b) Comparison Study Design
You should test the comparison panels on the old system at a minimum of one site.
This may be done in-house. However, you may want to use more than one old
system to better assess instrument bias. The new system should be tested at a
minimum of three sites (one may be in-house) with at least one reagent kit lot. Each
panel member should be tested at least four times: once with the old system and three
times with the new system. You should send the same positive and negative panels to
each site, rather than dividing the panel between the three sites. Three different
builds of the new system should be tested, one at each of the three sites.

3. Statistical Analysis of Data

23

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

a) Within-Laboratory Precision Study
·

For each sample tested, we recommend you present the mean value with
variance components (standard deviation and percent CV) for the new system.

·

For each analyte concentration, you should present similar information for the
old system. This information can be taken from the precision study originally
used to demonstrate the performance of the old system if the study design and
the analyte concentration levels are comparable to those used to assess the
new system. The information about variance components (standard deviation
and percent CV) can be obtained from the precision study found in the old
system labeling. If the study design and analyte concentrations are different
than those described in this guidance document, you should perform a new
precision study for the old system.

·

For each analyte concentration, (using precision profiles of the New and old
systems) we recommend you provide 95% confidence intervals for
repeatability and within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and percent
CV) of the New and old systems In addition, we recommend you provide the
ratio of the repeatability standard deviations of the New and old systems and
the ratio of within-laboratory standard deviations along with the 95%
confidence interval for these ratios. The confidence interval can be based on
the F-statistic for a ratio of variances.

b) Reproducibility Study
·

For each sample tested, you should present the mean value with variance
components (standard deviation and percent CV) for the new system for each
site separately and for all sites combined.

·

For each analyte concentration level, you should present similar information
for the old system. This information can be taken from the precision study
originally used to demonstrate the performance of the old system if the study
design and the analyte concentration levels are comparable to those used to
assess the new system. The information about variance components (standard
deviation and percent CV) can be obtained from the precision study found in
the old system labeling. If the study design and analyte concentrations are
different than those described in this document, a new precision study for the
old system should be performed.

·

For similar concentration levels, you should provide repeatability (within-run
precision), within-laboratory precision (standard deviation and percent CV)
and reproducibility separately and combined over three sites for the new
systems and old system (based on precision profiles of the new system and old
system). In addition, you should provide the ratio of repeatability standard
deviations along with 95% confidence intervals and the ratio of the
reproducibility standard deviations of the New and old systems. The

24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
confidence intervals for the ratios can be based on the F-statistic for a ratio of
variances (see Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 2).

c) Comparison Panels
·

You should provide a scatter-plot of numeric values of the old system (X­
axis) vs. numeric values of the new system (Y-axis) with descriptive statistics
for data at each site, as well as for all sites combined. Both axes should have
the same scale and the line of identity (y=x), and the same scale on the axes
should be applied to the data from each site.

·

You should provide an estimation of systematic differences between absolute
numeric values by the New and old systems (CLSI document EP09) for each
site and for all sites combined. You should perform an appropriate regression
analysis (such as a Deming regression) which accounts for the random errors
associated with the Old and new system measurements, and provide the 95%
confidence intervals of the slope and intercept from this analysis. We
recommend that, for the data from each site and for the combined site data,
you draw the regression line on the corresponding scatter plots and plot the
fitted lines (for each site and all sites combined) on the same corresponding
figures. Using the regression equation, you should calculate the systematic
bias at all medically important points along with 95% confidence intervals.

·

Conceptually, the new system measurements can be considered comparable to
the old system measurements if the new system measurements of a sample are
similar to the repeated evaluations of the same sample when run on the old
system. Using the reproducibility results of the old system, one can construct
limits or boundaries that define where 95% of the differences between two
repeated measurements by the old system are inside of these limits (see
Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 10). These limits define an Allowable Total
Difference (ATD) zone (see CLSI document EP21) for differences between
new system and old system measurements. It is anticipated that no less than
95% of the sample results will fall within the ATD zones (see Figure 7,
below). For details see Appendix II, Statistical Notes, 11.

25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

ATD (≥ 95% of
samples in study)

Figure 7. Allowable Total Difference Zone.

·

You should calculate (i) the percentage of the samples at low, medium, and
high concentration ranges that fall within the ATD zone at each site and
averaged over three sites, (ii) the percentage of samples over the entire range
that fall within the ATD zone with a lower limit of 95% one-sided confidence
interval at each site, and (iii) the percentage of samples over the entire range
that fall within the ATD zone averaged over three sites using a bootstrap
technique, you should provide the 95% one-sided confidence interval for the
percentage of the samples over the entire range that fall within the ATD zone
averaged over three sites.

4. Acceptance Criteria for Quantitative Assay Migration Studies
In addition to the acceptance criteria for LoB, LoD, LoQ (see section VI.B.1.a) and
linearity (see section VI.B.1.c), we recommend that you apply the following criteria:
·

The systematic difference between numeric values of the new and old systems
should be either not clinically significant and not statistically significant, or if
statistically significant, it should not be clinically significant. (See Appendix II:
Statistical Notes, 8).

·

The ratio of standard deviations in the precision studies (reproducibility and
within-laboratory precision) of the old and new systems should be either
clinically and statistically insignificant, or if statistically significant it should not
be clinically significant. (See Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 8).

26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

The percentage of the observations over the entire range that fall within the ATD
zone should be close to 95% with a lower limit of the 95% one-sided confidence
interval higher than 90%. The percentages of the observations that fall within the
ATD zone for the low, medium, and high ranges should approach 95% for each
range. (See Appendix II: Statistical Notes, 11).

·

If applicable, the percent of positive results by the new system among zero-level
samples should be consistent with a Type I error of LoB of the old system across
three sites. (Type I error is the probability of having True Negative samples, i.e.,
those with zero analyte concentration, give values that indicate the presence of
analyte. Usually, Type I error is set as 5% or less).

·

You should investigate any differences found between the two systems and
perform a risk assessment to determine what percentage of the intended use
population would be affected by these differences.

C. Migration Studies for Semi-Quantitative Assays
Semi-quantitative assays are those which are neither qualitative nor quantitative. An
example of a semi-quantitative assay is one with a few ordinal categories (negative, trace, +,
++, +++) where the order of categories contains information used during the interpretation of
the assay results. Another example of a semi-quantitative assay is an assay which has
continuous numeric values but does not have a linearity property, and, therefore is not
quantitative. The types of the analytical and comparison migration studies depend on the
nature of the semi-quantitative assay. If your semi-quantitative assay has multiple cutoffs,
the performance of the new and old system should be evaluated near each cutoff separately
(e.g., precision and systematic differences at each cutoff). You should contact the
appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER Division to obtain recommendations about migration
studies for your particular semi-quantitative assay.

D. Migration Studies for Point Of Care (POC) Assays
Before preparing to use the migration studies approach for a POC assay, you should
determine whether the assay is quantitative, qualitative or semi-quantitative, according to the
definitions in this guidance. The migration studies should be conducted in the hands of
intended users of the POC assays. You should contact the appropriate FDA CDRH or CBER
Division to obtain recommendations about migration studies for a POC device.

VII. Other Studies
Depending upon the unique characteristics of the qualitative, quantitative or semiquantitative assay being migrated to the new system, the following studies may be called for.
If not previously conducted for the old system, they should be performed for the new system.

If you determine that a study described below is not applicable for your system, you should
describe your reasoning in detail in your application to FDA. FDA will consider such
explanations on a case-by-case basis particularly for manual to semi-automated or automated
system migrations.
·

Carry-over or cross-contamination studies: The importance of repeating these studies
on a new system can be ascertained by a thorough analysis of the new system. As
mentioned in Section V of this document, block diagrams and side-by-side
comparison tables would be beneficial in this determination. Changes to specific
physical features such as a change in sample pipettor design or the layout of the new
system could indicate the need for new carry-over studies. If a carry-over study for
the new system is appropriate and the new design is sufficiently similar to the old
system, the new study can be the same as previously used for the old system.
Samples with high positive concentrations of analyte should be tested alternating with
analyte-negative samples in patterns dependent on the operational function of the
instrument. The concentration of analyte in the high positive samples should exceed
95%-99% or more of the results normally obtained in clinical samples from diseased
patients in the intended use population. This testing should be done over multiple
runs (at least 5 runs are recommended by the Commission of European
Communities10).

·

Matrix equivalency and recovery studies: Presumptively, because there are no
changes to the assay, there should be no new effects on the assay performance due to
different matrices unless physical alterations of the new system could create such an
effect. Similarly, recovery studies should not be affected by the migration of an assay
from an old to a new system.

·

Interfering substances studies: Presumptively, with no changes to the assay, there
should be no new effects on the assay performance due to interfering substances.

·

On-board reagent/calibrator and sample stability studies: Unless there are physical or
process changes to the new system, presumptively, there should be no effect on assay
performance due to on-board reagent or sample stability.

·

Cross-reactivity studies: Presumptively, as there are no changes in assay components,
a migration to a new system should have no effect on the existing cross-reactivity.

·

Hook effect studies: Presumptively, because there is no assay change, the parameters
of the hook effect should be the same, unless physical alterations in the new system
could create such an effect.

diagnostic medical devices [Official Journal L 131 of 16.05.2002].

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
·

Verification of kit control material and calibrators: Presumptively because there is no
change to the assay, the control results and calibration ranges should remain the
same, unless physical alterations in the new system could create new effects.

·

If new analyte-specific information requires new studies to bring the assay’s
performance characteristics up-to-date, please contact FDA for guidance.

VIII. Molecular Assays
There are specific criteria that are unique to nucleic acid tests (NAT) and therefore NATs
present additional specific concerns over serological and antigen assays:
·

When appropriate, you should provide testing with panels showing a rise in viral titer
over time from serial bleeds (viremic profile). Similar to seroconversion panels, they
should have a minimum number of days between bleeds and begin with at least one
negative bleed. They should be of clinical relevance to the appropriate individual
marker.

·

Carryover studies: Because of the increased risks of carryover due to the
amplification methodologies utilized in molecular testing (e.g., PCR, TMA), you
should perform carryover studies for all NAT migration studies.

·

Sample stability: Because of the nature of DNA and especially RNA, careful attention
should be given to the stability of samples in relation to on-board storage and
manipulation.

·

Sample processing: The processes of purification and extraction of DNA or RNA
from clinical samples is critical to the success of molecular tests. You should
evaluate any additions or modifications associated with the new system that could
affect these processes.

·

Validation of control material and calibrators: You should perform these studies on
the new system due to the sensitive nature of molecular assays.

·

For molecular assays detecting multiple analytes, please contact FDA for further
discussion.

IX. Regulatory Outcomes
·

Should the acceptance criteria noted in Sections VI.A.4 or VI.B.4 above be met, it
would be appropriate for the sponsor to claim that the new system does not
compromise the results as compared to the old system. It would not be appropriate to
claim improved performance characteristics. It would also not be appropriate to
compute clinical performance claims for the new system based on the migration

29

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
studies described here, since these studies are analytical, rather than clinical. Should
you wish to develop more extensive claims, the migration studies paradigm would not
be an appropriate scientific approach.
·

X.

If the acceptance criteria are not met and the aberrant performance could affect
clinical management, you will be asked to perform a complete clinical study
presenting the clinical performance of the assay on the new system.

Glossary

For the purposes of this document the following definitions are used. HTD referenced terms
are based on the CLSI Harmonized Terminology Database.
C5: a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under
stipulated conditions are 95% negative (or 5% positive) (see CLSI EP12-A2).
C95: a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under
stipulated conditions are 95% positive (see CLSI EP12-A2).
C50: a concentration at which repeated tests of a sample with this concentration under
stipulated conditions are 50 % positive (or 50% negative). Under ideal circumstances, C50
will exactly equal the cutoff established by the manufacturer.
Calibrators: a substance or device that is based on a reference preparation or in which the
analyte concentration or other quantity has been determined by an analytical procedure of
stated reliability. Calibrators are used to calibrate, graduate, or adjust a measurement [HTD].
Carry-over: amount of analyte carried by the measuring system from one sample reaction
into subsequent sample reactions, thereby erroneously affecting the apparent amounts in
subsequent samples [HTD].
Control material: a device, solution, or preparation intended for use in the quality control
process to monitor the reliability of a test system and to evaluate its performance within
established limits.
Cross-reactivity: the ability of a drug, metabolite, a structurally similar compound other
than the primary analyte, or even unrelated compound to affect the assay [HTD].
Cutoff value (CO): for a qualitative test, the threshold above which the result of the test is
reported as positive and below which the result is reported as negative.
High negative sample (C5): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to the C5 as
determined by the old system. This term is equivalent to a “weak negative sample” for
example as used in the guidance document “Recommendations for CLIA Waiver
Applications for Manufacturers of IVDs”,
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm070890.pdf.
Hook effect (high dose hook effect): effect of a suboptimal antigen-antibody reaction in
which either the antibody or antigen is in excess resulting in an incomplete, or blocked
reaction leading to a decreasing signal response at very high levels of analyte. It is used
interchangeably with “prozone effect,” [HTD].

30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Interfering substances: endogenous (e.g., blood components, acidic polysaccharides) or
exogenous (e.g., talc, anticoagulant) substances in clinical samples that can cause falsepositive or false-negative results in a test system [HTD].
Limit of blank (LoB): highest measurement result that is likely to be observed (with a stated
probability) for a blank sample (a sample with concentration at or near zero) (CLSI EP17-A;
[HTD]).
Limit of detection (LoD): the lowest concentration of analyte that can be reported to be
present at a specified level of confidence, although perhaps not quantified to an exact value.
Similarly, an amount of analyte in a sample for which the probability of falsely claiming the
absence is β (type II error) given a probability α (type I error) of falsely claiming its presence
(CLSI EP17-A; [HTD])
Limit of quantitation (LoQ): the lowest amount of analyte in a sample that can be
quantitatively determined with {stated} acceptable precision and {stated, acceptable}
accuracy, under stated experimental conditions (CLSI EP17-A; [HTD]).
Linearity: ability (within a given range) to provide results that are directly proportional to
the concentration (amount) of the analyte in the test sample [HTD].
Linearity studies: studies to determine the analyte concentration range over which the
testing systems results are acceptably linear.
Low positive sample (C95): a sample with a concentration of analyte close to C95 as
determined by the old system. This term is equivalent to “weak positive sample” for
example as used in the guidance document “Recommendations for CLIA Waiver
Applications for Manufacturers of IVDs”,
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm070890.pdf.
Measurand: particular quantity subject to measurement. The term “measurand” and its
definition encompass all quantities while the commonly used term “analyte” refers to a
tangible entity subject to measurement [HTD].
Measuring interval (measuring range): set of values of measurands for which the error of a
measuring instrument is intended to lie within specified limits. The range of values (in units
appropriate for the analyte [measurand]) over which the acceptability criteria for the method
have been met; that is, where errors due to nonlinearity, imprecision, or other sources are
within defined limits (CLSI EP06-A, [HTD]).
Medical decision level (medical decision point): a level or concentration at which a test is
interpreted for patient care and treatment.
Moderate positive sample: a sample with a concentration close enough to the cutoff and at
which one can anticipate positive results by the old system approximately 100% of the time.
Negative percent agreement: the proportion of samples negative by the old system for
which the results by the new system are negative (see FDA guidance titled “Statistical
Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests” at

31

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm071287.pdf).11
New system: an unapproved/unlicensed system (assay, instrument, and software) to which
the assay is migrating from a previously approved/licensed system.
Old system: an approved/licensed system (assay, instrument and software) from which the
assay is migrating to a currently unapproved/unlicensed system.
Positive percent agreement: the proportion of samples positive by the old system for which
the results by the new system are positive. (See FDA guidance “Statistical Guidance on
Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests”,
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDo
cuments/ucm071287.pdf).
Qualitative assay: assay in which nominal properties of measurand are identified.
Quantitative assay: assay in which the amount or concentration of an analyte is measured
and expressed as a numeric quantity value in appropriate measurement units.
Repeatability: closeness of the agreement between the results of successive measurements
of the same measurand carried out under the same conditions of measurement (See CLSI
EP05 [HTD]).
Reproducibility: closeness of agreement between the results of measurements of the same
measurand and carried out under changed conditions of measurement. Reproducibility
conditions are conditions where test results are obtained with the same method on identical
test items in different laboratories with different operators using different equipment and can
include additional variables such as days, replicates, and runs (See CLSI EP05 [HTD]).
Risk analysis: systematic use of available information to identify hazards and to estimate the
risk. Risk analysis includes examination of different sequences of events that can produce
hazardous situations and harm [HTD].
Semi-quantitative assay: assay which is neither qualitative nor quantitative (such as an
assay with a few ordinal categories; negative, trace, +, ++, +++).
Spiked sample: a clinical sample to which exogenous analyte has been added to create
specified levels of signal.
Systematic difference: a mean of the measurand on the new system minus a value of the
same measurand as performed on the old system that would result from an infinite number of
measurements carried out under the stipulated condition (based on HTD).
Within-laboratory precision: precision over a defined time and operators, within the same
facility and using the same equipment; calibration and reagents may vary. Formerly, the
term “total precision” was used in CLSI EP05 [HTD].

11

The general definition from the cited guidance is adapted in this guidance since the cited guidance refers to
clinical subjects, whereas this guidance does not involve subjects, but rather specimens or samples. In addition,
the term “non-reference standard” in the cited guidance is analogous to “old system” in this guidance; the term
“test” in the cited guidance is analogous to “new system”.

Appendix I - Migration Studies for Blood Donor Screening
Assays12
1. Introduction
Blood Donor Screening Assays for infectious agents, reviewed under Biologics License
Applications (BLA), are generally held to stringent standards of sensitivity and specificity.
Typically, clinical studies for licensure of products such as HIV assays involve testing of
over 1000 known positives and 6000 to 10,000 low risk individual samples (or pools)
collected from the intended use population. Consequently, FDA recommends larger study
sizes for migrating blood screening assays to new systems.
Otherwise, except as specifically noted below, the same considerations apply to blood
screening assays as described for qualitative assays in Section VI.A of this document,
“Migration Studies for Qualitative Assays.”
a. Performance at Low Analyte Levels
For immunoassays, FDA recommends that at least 20 seroconversion panels, or as many
as are available (whichever is less) be studied, comparing the new and the old systems
head to head. For nucleic acid tests (NAT), FDA recommends the head-to-head testing
of as many seroconversion panels as were tested for licensure of the old system (typically
10). Both qualitative results and numeric signal (e.g. signal output, S/CO ratios) should
be compared.
b. Precision Study (Within-Laboratory Precision)
FDA recommends that sponsors compare the new and old systems in a Precision Study as
outlined in Section VI.A.1.b.
c. Reproducibility Study
FDA recommends that sponsors compare the new and old systems in a Reproducibility
Study essentially as outlined in Section VI.A.1.b.iii. However, FDA recommends
including in the panel at least one truly negative sample (i.e. not just a positive sample
diluted to below the cutoff), and that testing be performed at three sites, one of which
may be in-house.
2. Comparison Panels
a. Positive Panel Members
A positive comparison panel should consist of approximately 100 positive samples, to
include 60-80 specimens with signals <3X the cutoff for an immunoassay or analyte
concentrations <3X the 95% LoD for a NAT. Authentic clinical specimens are preferred:
however, specimens may be diluted to the recommended range in negative matrices
(individual, not pooled) if clinical specimens are not available. The panel should be
tested on the new system at three sites, one of which can be in-house. This panel should
12 Appendix 1 does not apply to immunohematology tests licensed by CBER.

35

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
also be tested at least once on the old system (this can be in-house). We recommend use
of at least two of the old systems to better assess systematic differences between old
systems. The data should be analyzed by S/CO regression and analysis of bias using
scatter-plots or similar graphical presentations, as described in Section VI.A.3.c.
b. Negative Panel Members
Option 1: A negative comparison panel should consist of 3000 known negative samples
(or pools), or specimens obtained from a low risk study, with adequate follow-up. The
panel should be tested on the new system, distributed over three sites, one of which may
be in-house (e.g., 1/3 at site one, 1/3 at site two & 1/3 at site three). The data should be
analyzed for agreement of the point estimate of specificity (with the 95% confidence
interval) for the new system with the original point estimate of specificity (with the 95%
confidence interval) from the original trial of the old system.
Option 2: As an alternative option, the sponsor may wish to test head to head on the old
and new systems at three external sites the highest 10% of negative specimens from the
original clinical trial of the assay on the old system, if the specimens have been stored
under conditions defined in the instructions for use of the assay.
3. Acceptance Criteria
Except as noted above, the same acceptance criteria as recommended in Section VI.A.4 also
apply to blood donor screening assays.
Additionally, sponsors may recommend statistical analysis protocols based on estimating
false positive and false negative ratios from the negative and positive comparison panel
studies, respectively. Sponsors interested in this approach should determine an appropriate
model for the S/CO distribution of each panel (positive or negative) together with a proposed
method of analysis.
4. Interfering Substances and Conditions
Only substances and conditions that represent a reasonable risk of interference in the new
system should be studied. For instance, interfering conditions such as hemolysis or
hyperlipidemia might influence pipetting or washing steps and should be included in
migration studies. Conversely, it would seem unlikely that cross-reactivity of, for instance,
an HIV NAT assay with HTLV would likely be influenced by migration to a new system.
Each interfering substance/condition may be tested in-house using a panel of approximately
10 Low Positives with signals <3X the cutoff for an immunoassay or analyte concentrations
<3X the 95% LoD for a NAT. (These studies can be performed by spiking the analyte at the
level described above in negative specimens (for the analyte) with interfering
substances/conditions).
Each interfering substance/condition may be tested in-house using a panel of approximately
10 True Negatives.
Because migration studies extend the life of individual assays and new information becomes
available over time, it is important to update the performance characteristics of the assay
during migration of the assay. Based on the type of data considered for the original assay,
36

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
examples of new information that may trigger additional study are newly recognized
potentially interfering substances or conditions, or new variants, or new recombinants.

Appendix II - Statistical Notes
1. Evaluation of C5 and C95 using Precision Studies
Consider that an assay (qualitative or quantitative) has a numeric output in which higher
values indicate higher levels of the analyte and analytical variation about the C 50 is
approximately normal (or approximately normal after appropriate transformation). If the
standard deviations (SD) in the precision studies of the old system for concentrations around
the cutoff value are almost constant, then:
C95 = C50 +1.645 x SD, and
C5 = C50 – 1.645 x SD
For example, if the cutoff for optical density (OD) value is 1.00 and the SD around the cutoff
is approximately 0.10, then C95 is approximately 1.16 OD (=1.00+1.645 x 0.10) and C5 is
approximately 0.84 OD (=1.00 -1.645 x 0.10). In other words, a sample with an actual OD
of 1.16 produces positive results (above 1.00) approximately 95% of the time and a sample
with an actual OD of 0.84 produces negative results (below 1.00) approximately 95% of the
time.
If the coefficient of variation (CV) in the precision studies of the old system for
concentrations around the cutoff value are almost constant, then
C95 = C50 + 1.645 x CV x C95 and C5 = C50 – 1.645 x CV x C5. From here,
C95 = C50 / (1 – 1.645 x CV) and
C5 = C50 / (1 + 1.645 x CV).
For example, if the cutoff has an OD value of 1.00 and the %CV around the cutoff is
approximately 10% (i.e., CV=0.10), then C95 is approximately 1.20 OD and C5 is
approximately 0.86 OD.
If the limit of blank (LoB) is used as a cutoff, then the concentration C 95 is the same as the
limit of detection (LoD) and zero concentration is C5 (see CLSI EP17).
2. Calculating Confidence Interval for the Ratio of the Standard Deviations
Let σ2New and σ2Old be true variances and SD2New and SD2Old be estimated variances. Consider
the expression F = [SD2New/ σ2New ] / [SD2Old/ σ2Old ] which follows an F distribution with
degrees of freedom df=ν1 (numerator) and df=ν2 (denominator): F(ν1, ν2).13 For a level of
confidence α, let F(1-α/2, ν1, ν2) and F(α/2, ν1, ν2) be critical values that
Prob {F(α/2, ν1, ν2) <[SD2New/ σ2New ] / [SD2Old/ σ2Old ] < F(1-α/2, ν1, ν2)} = 1-α;
13

ð Prob {(1/F(1-α/2, ν1, ν2)) * (SD2New / SD2Old ) < σ2New / σ2Old < (1/F(α/2, ν1, ν2)) *
(SD2New / SD2Old )} = 1-α;
Therefore, the interval from (1/F(1-α/2, ν1, ν2)) * (SD2New / SD2Old ) to (1/F(α/2, ν1, ν2)) *
(SD2New / SD2Old }is a two-sided 95% confidence interval for σ2New / σ2Old . To find a
confidence interval for the ratio of standard deviations σNew / σOld, take square roots. Note
that the F distribution has the property that F(1-α/2, ν1, ν2) = 1/F(α/2, ν2, ν1).
For determination of degrees of freedom, you should refer to CLSI EP05. For example, for a
precision study conducted with 3 sites, 5 days per site, 2 runs per day and 3 replicates per
run, the estimate of SD of repeatability for one run has 2 degrees of freedom (=3-1) and the
estimate of SD of repeatability for all thirty (=3*5*2) runs has 60 degrees of freedom
(=3*5*2*2).
3. Deming and Passing-Bablok Regressions
Ordinary least squares regression analysis supposes that one of the methods is without
random measurement error, and the standard deviation of the error distribution of the other
method is constant through the measurement range. An assumption about the absence of a
random measurement error is not fulfilled in the migration comparison study data because
both methods, X and Y, are subject to random measurement errors; therefore, Deming and/or
Passing-Bablok regression analyses are recommended. An assumption of a constant standard
deviation of X and Y methods through the entire measurement range does not hold for most
of the assays. For example, very frequently, the standard deviation increases as the
concentrations increases. In situations like this, weighted Deming regression can often be
used.
The analysis of the numeric values in the migration comparison study data should include an
appropriate type of Deming regression (e.g., weighted) for each site separately and for all
sites combined.
To apply a Passing-Bablok regression analysis, the comparison study data should adhere to
the following requirements: CVY / CVX = β where β = the slope (it is assumed that X and Y
have approximately the same random measurement errors). In an article by Passing, H. and
Bablok, W.14, the authors performed simulations to investigate how inequality in the random
measurement error of X and Y affects Passing-Bablok regression. The authors found that if
0.67<CVY/CVX <1.5 then Passing-Bablok regression is acceptable. If 1.5<CVY/CVX <2.5
(or 0.4<CVY/CVX<0.67) and precision of X is less than 7% then Passing-Bablok regression
is acceptable.
When applying regression analysis of study data for all sites combined, note that only one
measurement per sample is reported from the old system (X data), while an average of three
measurements (one per study site) is reported for the new system (Y data). In the case of
combined data, the CV of the average of Y is less because the average of Y is more precise

Studies and Determination of Sample Sizes” in J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem., Vol. 22, 1984, pp.431-445,

than one measurement of Y. So, when combining data from all sites, the CV of the average
of the Y measurements is calculated as the standard deviation of the Y data divided by the
square root of 3 (CV of average Y = CVY * 0.58).
In addition to the Deming regression, you could also include Passing-Bablok regression
analysis for each site separately. If the precision of X is less than 7% then, in addition to the
Deming regression analysis for the combined data, present Passing-Bablok regression
analysis for the combined data.

6. Calculating Score Confidence Intervals for Percentages and Proportions
The following are additional recommendations for performing statistical analyses of
percentages or proportions. Confidence limits for positive percent agreement and negative
percent agreement can be calculated using formulas for calculating a confidence interval for
a binomial proportion. There are several different methods available. We suggest that either
a score method described by Altman, et al. (Altman D.A., Machin D., Bryant T.N., Gardner
M.J. eds. Statistics with Confidence. 2nd ed. British Medical Journal; 2000) or a ClopperPearson Method (Clopper CJ, Pearson E. Biometrika 1934; 26:404-413) be used.
An advantage with the score method is that it has better statistical properties and it can be
calculated directly. So with n=100 samples and 96/100=96% agreement, the score lower
confidence bound is 90.2% whereas the Clopper-Pearson lower confidence bound is 90.1%.
In this document, we have illustrated the reporting of confidence intervals using the score
approach. For convenience, we provide the formulas for the score confidence interval for a
percentage. Note that the lower bound of a two-sided 95% score confidence interval is the
same as the lower bound of a one-sided 97.5% score confidence interval; and the lower
bound of one-sided 95% score confidence interval is the same as the lower bound of a twosided 90% score confidence interval.
A two-sided 95% score confidence interval for the proportion of A/B is calculated as:

100% Q1  Q2  / Q3 , 100% Q1  Q2  / Q3  , where the quantities Q1, Q2, and Q3 are
computed from the data using the formulas below. For the proportion of A/B:
Q1  2  A  1.96 2  2  A  3.84

Q2 1.96 1.96 2  4  A  (B  A) / B  1.96 3.84  4  A  (B  A) / B

Q3  2  (B  1.962 )  2  B  7.68
In the formulas above, 1.96 is the quantile from the standard normal distribution that
corresponds to 95% confidence. For calculation of 95% one-sided score confidence interval,
use 1.645 in place of 1.96 in the formulas above.
7. Allowable Total Difference For Qualitative Assays with Equivocal (and/or Re-testing
Zone) Results

Based on the reproducibility of the old system for the samples close to the zone of equivocal
results (and/or the re-test zone), you can establish an allowable total difference zone as
presented in Figure 8 below where E1 and E2 are the cutoffs for the zone of equivocal results.
In Figure 8, r is a result of one measurement for a sample with a result below the cut-off E1
and repeated measurements are below E1 with high probability; likewise R is a result of one
measurement for a sample with a result above the cut-off E2 and repeated measurements are
above E2 with high probability.

results. Light gray: Negative results by New System, Medium gray: Equivocal

You should calculate the percentages of the samples with Negative, Equivocal, and
Positive results by the new system that fall within the five concentration ranges defined
by the old system: below r, r-E1, E1-E2, E2-R, above R.

9. Acceptance Criteria for Positive and Negative Percent Agreements.

For a panel of 100 samples which test positive by the old system, and of which 96 also test
positive by the new system (96 out of 100), the lower limit of the 95% two-sided score
confidence interval is above 90%. For 30 samples with values close to C95, the 95% twosided confidence interval for 26/30 (87%) is 70.3% to 94.7%. If, for example, among the 30
samples with low positive concentrations (concentrations close to C95 by the old system),
only 25 samples test positive by the new system, then the percent of positive results by the
new system for the samples close to the cutoff is statistically different from 95% (83%
(25/30) with 95% CI: 66.4% to 92.7%). It should be noted that if the percent agreement is
96% or higher at each of three sites, then the lower confidence bound exceeds 90% and a
formal calculation of the 95% lower confidence bound may not be needed. The lower bound
of the confidence interval for overall agreement is bigger than the smallest of the lower
bounds calculated at each site and may be used to demonstrate that the agreement criteria has
been met.
10. Calculation of Allowable Total Difference

For each sample of the Comparison panel, calculate the differences between the new system
result (Y) and the old system result (X), Y-X (based on CLSI EP21). Also calculate (X+Y)/2.
Plot the difference between Y and X, Y-X, against their mean (Y+X)/2 (Bland-Altman plot)15.

in Medical Research 1999; 8; p.135-160.

On the Bland-Altman plot of (Y-X) vs. (Y+X)/2, provide the Allowable Total Difference
(ATD) zone around the axis, (Y+X)/2. The ATD zone is established in such a way that 95%
of differences between the old system result and the repeated result by the old system fall
within the ATD. The ATD zone is expressed as:
± 1.96• 2 •CV•(Y+X)/2 = ± 2.77•CV•(Y+X)/2 for larger values of old system and ±
1.96• 2 •SD = ± 2.77•SD for the low values of old system where CV and SD are the
reproducibility characteristics of the old system (see Establishing SD and percent CV for ATD
Based on the Performance of the old system below). A hypothetical example of the ATD
zone on the Bland-Altman plot is provided below (Figure 9):

provided below.

By the appropriate transformation, a similar ATD zone can be presented on the plane of new
system values (Y) against old system values (X), see Figure 7. The expressions of the lines
of the ATD zone on the plane Y vs. X are the following:
Lines parallel to the diagonal of the ATD zone:
Y  X 1.96  2  SD =X  2.77  SD, if 0  Y+X  2  A

For CV≤10% and when each sample in the comparison panel is measured one time by the old
system, lines for the “expanding” part of the ATD zone are:

For CV>0.10 or when each sample is measured more than one time by the old system, an
approach based on a ratio of two normal variables is recommended.16 Examples of ATD

presented in table below:

Establishing SD and percent CV for ATD Based on the Performance of the Old System
For an individual measurement Xi of a given sample by the old system, there is a following
expression: Xi = Xtruei + Mean-Bias + Random-Biasi +εi where deviation of Xi from the true
value Xtruei is composed of a mean bias, a random matrix-related interference component, and
a random measurement error17,18. Because there are no changes in the assay, it is anticipated
that the random matrix- related interferences in both systems are the same. Then the
difference between new system and old system measurements of the same sample depends
on a random measurement error.
Establishing standard deviation (SD) for the Allowable Total Difference (ATD) zone should
be based on consideration of possible variance between the two measurements of the same
sample by the old system obtained at different sites. For this, consider the precision profile
of the reproducibility study with the between-site component of variance. Another
hypothetical precision experiment for the old system can produce a slightly higher SD than in
this precision experiment. In order to address this, the observed SD may be multiplied by the
appropriate factor (factor = (1  1/(4  f )) 1 

2
f  5%
( f ) , f is a degree of freedom of the

estimated SD).
For example, if the degrees of freedom of the SD in the precision study of the old system
were 40, then the appropriate factor is 1.236 and the expected maximum observed SD can be
as high as 0.148 (=0.120 *1.236). After the appropriate SD or percent CV is established for
each concentration in the precision study, the ATD zone can be obtained by smooth
interpolation.

11. Number of Samples in the Allowable Total Difference Zones

For 150 samples with 95% of the observations (143 /150) falling in the ATD zone, the lower
limit of the 95% one-sided confidence interval is above 90%.
