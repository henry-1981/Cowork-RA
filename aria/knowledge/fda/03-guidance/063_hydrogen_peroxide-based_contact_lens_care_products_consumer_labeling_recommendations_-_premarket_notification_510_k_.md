Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

FDA is issuing this guidance to provide labeling recommendations for hydrogen peroxide-based
contact lens care products (HPCPs) submitted in premarket notification (510(k)) submissions.
These labeling recommendations are important because misuse associated with these devices has
resulted in serious eye injuries. FDA believes that the labeling recommendations in this guidance
may help manufacturers develop labeling with information about specific risks and directions for
use of the HPCPs in conjunction with a user’s prescribed contact lenses. These labeling
recommendations are intended to promote the safe and effective use of HPCPs and ensure that
consumers receive and understand information regarding the benefits and risks associated with
the use of the device.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background

Hydrogen peroxide-based contact lens care product solutions, as well as other multipurpose
solutions, both clean and disinfect contact lenses by breaking up and helping to remove trapped
debris, protein, fatty deposits, and microorganisms. Unlike other multipurpose solutions,
hydrogen peroxide-based contact lens care product solutions are generally preservative-free,
which makes them a suitable option for those who are allergic or sensitive to the preservatives
found in multipurpose solutions. They are not risk-free, however, and should be used by
following appropriate labeling considerations. 1 Consumers should be aware of these
considerations prior to choosing, and while using, this type of medical device.
To implement section 520(l) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act, which
contains specific provisions on transitional devices (i.e., those devices regulated as drugs before
the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 became law), FDA published a rule proposing to
reclassify HPCPs from class III (premarket approval) to class II (special controls). 2 The final rule
reclassifying HPCPs was published on June 6, 1997, 3 amending 21 CFR 886.5918 and 21 CFR
886.5928 to classify rigid gas permeable contact lens care products and soft contact lens care
products as class II, respectively. FDA also issued a guidance document, “Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Guidance Document for Contact Lens Care Products,” 4 and a subsequent addendum
“Contact Lens Care Products Labeling.” 5 These documents include details regarding, among
other things, the labeling of contact lens care products.
The safety and effectiveness of HPCPs when used as directed has been well established in the
last few decades; however, FDA has become aware of an increase in the number of adverse
event reports related to the misuse of these products. Consumers have reported adverse events
ranging from irritation to severe burning and stinging of the eyes and even blindness with the use
of HPCPs. The reports received to date indicate that the packaging is not easily distinguishable
from other lens care products, which FDA believes has likely resulted in improper use. FDA
convened a meeting of the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory
Committee and the Risk Communication Advisory Committee on March 17, 2017, to discuss
additional measures to mitigate the potential risk for misuse of these devices. 6 While the rate of
adverse events reported to the FDA is relatively low compared to the estimated number of HPCP
users, the number of reports likely underestimate the actual occurrence of such events. The
meeting covered a range of important issues, including appropriate labeling and packaging of
these products, and the importance of clearly communicating the risks of misuse to the consumer

See 61 FR 14277 (April 1, 1996). With the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, transitional
devices were classified in class III by operation of the statute, unless later classified by FDA in class I or II. See
FD&C Act § 520(l)(1).

public. The Panel emphasized a need for simplicity and clear messaging in terms of warnings
and instructions for use, in addition to the ability to identify the bottles by utilizing a red tip and
red cap as already used on most HPCP solutions. The Panel also recommended a redesign and
standardization of the labeling so that it is different from other contact lens care products. In light
of the well-documented low compliance rate among consumers with recommended lens care
practices, 7 as well as the reasons outlined above, FDA is providing recommendations concerning
the content and format of labeling for these devices. FDA believes the labeling content and
format recommended in this guidance provides at least the same level of protection of the public
health and safety as the labeling details contained in “Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance
Document for Contact Lens Care Products” 8 and its addendum “Contact Lens Care Products
Labeling.” 9

III. Scope

This guidance document applies to all HPCPs. These devices are classified under 21 CFR
886.5918 and 21 CFR 886.5928 with the product codes listed in the table below:
Product Code
MRC
LPN

Table 1: Applicable Product Codes
Product Code Name
Regulation Number
Products, Contact Lens Care, Rigid Gas
21 CFR 886.5918
Permeable
Accessories, Soft Lens Products
21 CFR 886.5928

Although not in the scope of this guidance, the Panel also suggested making a change in the
bottle shape, size, color, tactile features or other characteristics that would distinguish HPCPs
from other contact lens care products that do not contain hydrogen peroxide. While FDA does
not intend to recommend the type of bottle to be used to contain HPCP solutions, FDA
recommends, to the extent possible, containers should appear distinct from those of multipurpose
solutions or other products without hydrogen peroxide, which could minimize potential product
selection errors and product misuse.
Based on the adverse event reports and feedback obtained during the March 2017 Panel Meeting,
device misuse may be exacerbated if the directions for use and warnings or precautions in the
device labeling are not clear. FDA believes that these problems can be mitigated by emphasizing
and simplifying important warnings and directions for use on the bottle and carton labeling for
HPCP solutions. The inclusion of such information should also be helpful in developing labeling
with adequate information for use under 21 CFR 801.5. For example, FDA believes the
appropriate design and standardization of labeling would help inform consumers of device risks,
thereby increasing the likelihood of appropriate device use and helping to mitigate against device
misuse.

Since these recommendations are based on known safety issues, FDA recommends that this
information be considered for inclusion as current product labeling is updated, and that labeling
included as part of future premarket submissions for HPCPs incorporate the recommendations.
For currently marketed HPCPs, manufacturers should evaluate their labeling changes according
to FDA’s guidance, “Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.” 10
This guidance is not intended to include a complete listing of all labeling components for
HPCPs. This guidance should be used as a complement to FDA’s “Guidance on Medical Device
Patient Labeling,” 11 (hereafter referred to as the “Patient Labeling guidance,” which describes
FDA’s current thinking on making medical device patient labeling understandable to and usable
by patients), existing regulations, and other relevant guidance documents containing additional
labeling recommendations. This guidance also complements FDA’s guidance “Premarket
Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Contact Lens Care Products” 12 and its addendum
“Contact Lens Care Products Labeling.” 13 This guidance provides recommendations that are
specific to HPCPs and may assist in complying with some special controls.

IV. Specific Consumer Labeling Recommendations
General Considerations
Contact lens care products, including HPCPs, are subject to the general labeling requirements for
all medical devices outlined in 21 CFR 801. The premarket notification submission must include
proposed labeling in sufficient detail to satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 807.87(e). Consumer
labeling for HPCPs includes information contained on the package insert, carton, and bottle, and
is directed to the contact lens wearer. The consumer labeling for HPCPs should instruct the
consumer on product care to ensure contact lenses are used safely and effectively, to identify
potential risks and benefits, and to explain what to expect when these care products are used. The
labeling should contain sufficient information to describe the device, its intended use,
precautions, warnings, and contraindications.
Consumer labeling should be written in simple, plain language that does not exceed the eighthgrade reading level. Regardless of the reading level, poorly designed text can still be confusing
and misleading. The consumer labeling should be directed to users and potential consumers of
HPCPs and should address the following questions:
•
•
•

How do Hydrogen Peroxide-Based Contact Lens Care Products work?
How should I use Hydrogen Peroxide-Based Contact Lens Care Products correctly?
What are the risks associated with Hydrogen Peroxide-Based Contact Lens Care
Product use?

Who should I contact if there is a problem?

The lay language should provide a balanced presentation of adverse events and the risks and
benefits of the device. It should not introduce implied or actual statements regarding performance
that are unsubstantiated or that may be misleading to consumers. In order to increase the
likelihood that the consumer labeling is read and understood by the consumer, we recommend
that manufacturers consider placing consumer labeling on their website to help consumers obtain
the most up-to-date information.
We recommend that consumer labeling contain the information in the sections outlined in the
Patient Labeling guidance. The sections suggested in the Patient Labeling guidance may be
adapted as appropriate for HPCPs and should enable the consumer to easily find and understand
information that answers the questions identified above. The recommendations in this guidance
are intended to supplement and enhance the information that is often already identified in
labeling for these device types. To the extent the recommendations in this document depart from
previously issued recommendations in the 2010 guidance, “Contact Lens Care Products
Labeling,” 14 this document supersedes those previous recommendations as applied to hydrogen
peroxide-based contact lens care products under product codes MRC and LPN. This guidance
presents FDA’s format and content recommendations for specific labeling components, and FDA
has provided examples of each in the appendices to help illustrate the recommendations.
Alternative approaches may be appropriate where they remain aligned with the intent of
promoting the safe and effective use of HPCPs.

Suggested Format and Content of Consumer Labeling
(1) Package Insert Labeling
To help manufacturers develop appropriate labeling and to mitigate the safety issues related to
HPCP misuse, FDA is providing the following recommendations for the package insert labeling.
The package insert should include the following information where applicable. An example of
package insert labeling is provided in Appendix A.
a. General Instructions and Description
FDA believes that the package insert should include general instructions and description as
outlined below:
•
•
•

14

A section that describes the general process involved with the use of HPCPs including: a
description of the disinfecting and neutralization process, and whether it is a one-step or
two-step process.
A statement to read the instructions carefully and to retain the information for future use.
The trade name and identification of the active ingredient(s) (optional, list of inactive
ingredients), sterility status, and when applicable, a description of the contents (e.g., case,
disk or tablet) and any additional components. FDA believes that prominent text

•
•

identifying that the product contains 3% hydrogen peroxide should be included in this
section.
A description of the function of the device (i.e., how the device works in relation to the
contact lenses). When applicable, the actions may also be listed with the indications for
use.
The indications for use statement as described in the submission.

b. Contraindications
Contraindications describe situations in which the device should not be used because the risk of
use of the device clearly outweighs any reasonably foreseeable benefit. FDA recommends that
manufacturers include all contraindications specific to the device. For example, such
contraindications may include a statement identifying that the device should not be used if
allergic to any ingredient in the device. If there are no contraindications, a statement may be
provided noting that there are no known contraindications.
c. Warnings
FDA recommends that manufacturers prominently display (e.g., using emphasized text)
appropriate warnings regarding how to avoid known hazards associated with the use of HPCPs.
These warnings may alert consumers to the possibility of serious adverse reactions, situations
which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury, and steps that should be taken if
they occur. FDA believes such warnings include the following examples of (1) general warnings
and (2) additional warnings.
General Warnings
FDA believes general warnings should include the following information:
•
•
•
•
•
•

A statement that the solution should only be used with the case provided and warn
against the use of flat lens cases.
A statement identifying the minimum time to ensure the completion of the neutralization
process prior to lens insertion and a statement that unneutralized disinfecting solution
should not be put into the eye.
Directions for when unneutralized solution does come in contact with the eyes.
A statement that warns against the reuse of the neutralized HPCP solutions.
A statement that warns against rinsing your lenses with the HPCP solution prior to
insertion, which would cause severe burning or stinging.
A statement that warns against directly squirting the HPCP solution into the eyes and
against use as an on-eye lens rewetting solution.

The statements above, wherever possible, should also warn consumers of the risks associated
with putting HPCP solution into the eye directly or indirectly (e.g., severe burning and stinging).
Additional Warnings
FDA recommends that manufacturers include warnings emphasizing that it is essential for
consumers to follow all labeling instructions for proper use of contact lenses and lens care
products. FDA recommends such additional warnings include the following instructions for use
and warnings pertaining to contact lens wear:
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

•

•
•
•
•

•
•

•

•

•

A statement warning against reuse or “topping off solutions.” Reuse may reduce effective
lens disinfection and could lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness. “Topping
off” is the addition of fresh solution to solution that has been sitting in the lens case. A
statement referencing the use of fresh, sterile or unexpired solution each time you use
your contact lenses should be included. Graphics warning against reuse or topping off of
solution are also recommended.
A statement against storing your lenses or rinsing your lens case with water or any nonsterile or expired saline solution (e.g., these practices may lead to ocular infections).
A statement that warns against risks associated with contact lens exposure to water from
showering, swimming in pools, lakes, or oceans (e.g., may harbor microorganisms that
lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness).
A statement that warns against using inappropriate liquids to disinfect your lenses, since
not using the recommended disinfectant may lead to severe infection, vision loss or
blindness.
A statement that warns of the risks associated with using solutions past their discard date
since the performance of solutions have not been tested past their discard date. The
discard date refers to the time you can safely use the contact lens care product after the
bottle has been opened. It is not the same as the shelf-life/expiration date, which is the
last date that the product is still effective before it is opened.
A statement that warns of the potential contamination of the solution, which may reduce
the effectiveness of solutions and result in contamination of lenses (e.g., avoid touching
surfaces or transferring solutions).
A statement that warns of the risks associated with ingestion of hydrogen peroxide, which
may occur if small children have access to the product. A statement should be added
advising consumers to seek immediate medical attention if ingested and/or promptly
contact their eye care practitioner.
When applicable, a statement that warns of possible effects associated with rubbing rigid
gas permeable (RGP) lenses with peroxide solution (e.g., that may result in skin
discoloration). A statement should be added advising consumers to wash and rinse their
hands after rubbing RGP lenses.
When applicable, a statement that warns against ingestion of neutralizing tablets that may
result in upset stomach and vomiting. A statement should be added advising consumers
not to ingest tablets and to seek immediate medical attention if ingested and/or promptly
seek medical assistance or a poison control center.
When applicable, statements against improper use of neutralization tablets that may result
in inadequate neutralization. Statements should be added advising consumers of
situations that may result in inadequate neutralization or disinfection (e.g., crushing a
neutralizing tablet, number of times a neutralizer disk may be used).

Non-Product Specific Warning
Additionally, FDA recommends that manufacturers include a non-product specific warning that
specifies that consumers should follow the directions of the eye care practitioner and all labeling
instructions for proper use and care of both their lenses and lens care products, including the lens
case since problems with contact lenses and lens care products could result in serious injury to
the eye. FDA recommends that this warning also include the following information:
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•
•

•
•

Specifying that daily wear lenses are not indicated for overnight wear and that clinical
studies have shown that there is an increased risk for serious adverse reactions when
worn overnight.
Specifying that extended wear lenses should be regularly removed for cleaning and
disinfection or disposal and replacement as prescribed by the eye care practitioner, and
that clinical studies have shown that there is an increased incidence of serious adverse
reaction in extended wear contact lens wearers compared to daily wear contact lens
wearers. Studies have also shown that the risk of serious adverse reactions increases the
longer extended wear lenses are worn before removal for cleaning and disinfection or for
disposal and replacement.
Specifying that studies have also shown that smokers who wear contact lenses have a
higher incidence of adverse reactions.
Specifying that if the consumer experiences eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision
changes, or redness of the eye, that they should remove their contact lenses and contact
their eye care practitioner.

d. Precautions
FDA recommends that precautions include information for the safe and effective use of the
device by the consumer to mitigate minor or moderate injury. Listed below are examples of
general precautions that pertain to all HPCP solutions and specific precautions for neutralizing
products. FDA believes such precautions include the following:
General Precautions
• A statement that consumers should always wash and dry their hands prior to
manipulating lenses because residual dirt, oils, and/or contamination may result in
subsequent stinging or ocular infection.
• A statement that consumers should never use generic hydrogen peroxide not specifically
intended for use with contact lenses or mix HPCP solutions because this may result in
insufficient disinfection, neutralization, and/or damage to contact lenses.
• Statements that consumers should never reuse solutions, should always use fresh,
unexpired solution, and should never store lenses in used neutralized solution for longer
than stated in the directions for use because this will help ensure sufficient disinfection
and avoid subsequent contamination.
• Statements regarding activities during or after use of HPCP solutions that may reduce the
product effectiveness, enhance deterioration and/or cause lens damage. These activities
may include: shaking/inverting the lens case during disinfection, failure to discard the
contents of the bottle “X” months after first opening, failure to keep the bottle closed
when not in use, failure to store the bottle at a certain temperature and/or range, failure to
keep the lenses immersed in the storage solution when not worn; and heating the solution
or contact lenses.
Precautions for Neutralizing Products
FDA recommends the inclusion of statements regarding activities during or after use of
neutralizing tablets that may reduce the product effectiveness, enhance deterioration and/or cause
lens damage. These activities may include: using tablets that appear to be broken, chipped, or
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
discolored; using tablets from packages that are torn or punctured; substituting neutralizing
components; and using neutralizing tablets in a heat disinfection unit.
e. Adverse Reactions
FDA recommends that the package insert labeling should inform consumers about the potential
adverse reactions associated with the use of the product and that eye problems, including corneal
ulcers, can develop rapidly and lead to loss of vision. The package insert labeling should also
include a statement that if a consumer notices any adverse reactions (e.g., stinging and burning,
eye discomfort, excessive tearing, among others), they should immediately remove lenses.
Statements should be added to the package insert advising the consumer on instructions for lens
removal thereby reducing the potential for ocular damage. The package insert labeling should
also include statements that consumers immediately contact their eye care practitioner if
problems persist or worsen, to seek immediate professional care, and to report all adverse events
to the manufacturer. A statement should be added to inform the consumer that they can also
report adverse events to FDA Medwatch. This is important to diagnose or document any adverse
events associated with the product.
f. General Directions for Use
FDA recommends all directions for use contain the major steps of the process (e.g., rinse with
solution, fill provided container, and soak) to ensure proper use of HPCP solutions. Each step
should be briefly described using simple language for easy understanding. The use of graphics in
device labeling has been shown to contribute to better comprehension. 15 As such, FDA
recommends that simple graphics, where appropriate, should be included. In order to provide a
complete set of directions for consumers, FDA recommends that these directions include the
following:
•
•

•
•

Instructions for safe handling of contact lenses to minimize residual dirt, oils, and/or
contamination, which may result in subsequent stinging or ocular infection.
Specific, detailed directions based on the lens type (e.g., soft and RGP lenses) to convey
important differences in the cleaning/disinfection regimen. FDA recommends
reemphasizing warning statements regarding not putting HPCP solution into the eye
because unneutralized hydrogen peroxide exposure may result in corneal burns, redness
and stinging (see Appendix A for examples for soft lenses and for RGP lenses).
Information for lens case care and replacement. This is important to ensure that users
appropriately clean and care for the lens case as they have been shown to be a source of
microbial contamination.
Information regarding how the product is supplied (e.g., sterile, quantity of contents, type
of packaging, lot number), distributor/manufacturer name and address, and the date the
labeling was printed. This is important to allow traceability and identification for adverse
event reporting or for consumer questions.

(2) Carton Labeling
In order to highlight warnings, precautions, and to minimize crowding, FDA recommends that the
directions for use should not be included in carton labeling. However, a statement should be
added directing users to follow directions on the bottle and in the package insert. FDA also
recommends that the carton labeling contain a prominent red banner (e.g., at least 1 inch in
height where possible) encircling the top of the carton that includes text emphasizing that the
HPCP solution should not be put into the eyes. We also recommend that manufacturers include
two identical statements, such as “DO NOT PUT IN EYES” or similar statement, that span the
circumference of the carton with associated graphics, in emphasized font. The banner should be
similar to the banner placed on the bottle. FDA recommends a minimalist approach to the content
of the carton labeling and font sizes consistent with the Patient Labeling guidance, which aligns
with 2017 Panel recommendations. An example of carton labeling is provided in Appendix B.
a. Manufacturer and Product Information
HPCPs are over-the-counter devices and labeling must comply with 21 CFR 801.60 - Principal
display panel, as well as 21 CFR 801.61 - Statement of identity and 21 CFR 801.62 - Declaration
of net quantity of contents. In addition, the labeling must comply with 21 CFR 800.12 – Contact
lens solutions and tablets; tamper-resistant packaging, and 21 CFR 800.10 – Contact lens
solutions; sterility, and should also contain the following recommended information:
Principal Display Panel (see 21 CFR 801.60):
• Product Trade Name [including emphasis on “3% Hydrogen Peroxide [Solution]”
(e.g., in prominent text)] (see Patient Labeling guidance for recommendations on
font sizes for Headings)
• Actions and Indications (see 21 CFR 801.61; e.g., cleans, disinfects)
• Lens Compatibility (i.e., the type of lenses for which the device may be used)
• Net Quantity Contents (21 CFR 801.62)
• Sterile
Outer Carton Panels
• Special Storage Conditions (e.g., store at room temperature)
• A statement referring customers to the bottle and package insert for information on
proper use of the product
• Tamper-Resistant Statement (21 CFR 800.12)
• A statement to keep product out of the reach of children
• [Insert information on whom to contact for concerns, adverse reactions, and
additional information: [Distributed by/Manufactured by/Manufactured for] Address
including zip code, website, and phone number.]
• Lot Number
• Expiration Date
• Product Information:
o Description (i.e., Active Ingredients)
o Package contents (e.g., a lens case is included)
• A statement referring customers to consult the package insert for complete safety
information
10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

Website and social media connections (e.g., Quick Response (QR) code, website
link) to manufacturers and FDA (e.g., “Hydrogen Peroxide Solution”
https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/contact-lenses/hydrogen-peroxide-solution)

b. Contraindications
FDA recommends that the same contraindications that are included in the package insert labeling
as outlined in Section IV.B.1.b of this guidance also be included on the carton labeling.
c. Warnings
To minimize overcrowding, FDA recommends that manufacturers include only those warning
statements in the carton labeling that inform the consumers of the risks associated with HPCP
solution that is not neutralized. This is important because unneutralized hydrogen peroxide
exposure may result in corneal burns, redness and stinging. Statements using emphasized text
(e.g., red and bold text) should be added to the warnings section on the carton to highlight these
concerns, but bold text should be limited to emphasize key details only. In addition, FDA
recommends that consumers be referred to the package insert for a complete list of warnings.
Manufacturers should include the following statements/warnings with associated graphics on the
carton labeling to inform consumers of the risks associated with unneutralized hydrogen
peroxide:
•
•
•
•
•
•

A statement that the solution should only be used with the case provided and warn
against the use of flat lens cases.
A statement identifying the minimum time to ensure the completion of the neutralization
process prior to lens insertion.
A statement that warns against rinsing your lenses with the HPCP solution just prior to
insertion, which would cause severe burning or stinging.
A statement that warns against directly squirting the HPCP solution into the eyes and
against use as an on-eye lens rewetting solution.
The statements above, wherever possible, should also warn the consumer of the risks
associated with inserting HPCP solution into the eye (e.g., severe burning and stinging).
A statement that the product contains hydrogen peroxide and that users should follow all
directions on the bottle and in the package insert to avoid injury.

Since most non-hydrogen peroxide contact lens care products are used with flat lens cases that
do not neutralize hydrogen peroxide, consumers may be confused regarding the need for the
special neutralizing case provided with HPCP solutions. Therefore, to increase the likelihood that
consumers understand these risks, and to emphasize the need for the neutralization of hydrogen
peroxide, FDA recommends manufacturers include additional warnings, including graphics,
against the use of flat lens cases on the top left and right carton flaps (in emphasized text), in
addition to the body of the carton labeling. This labeling recommendation is consistent with the
2017 Panel recommendations, which advised graphics on the opening flap of the box since this
warning is the first message consumers encounter as they open the product.

d. Precautions
FDA recommends that carton labeling only include precautions for the safe use of the device by
the user to mitigate minor or moderate injury. These may include precautions that warn against
the use of generic hydrogen peroxide or activities that may result in inadequate neutralization of
hydrogen peroxide prior to use. FDA recommends that manufacturers should include a
statement that refers consumers to the package insert for a complete list of precautions.

(3) Bottle Labeling
To help manufacturers develop bottle labeling that is clear, simple and consistent across products
and to help mitigate the safety issues for HPCPs, FDA is providing the following labeling
recommendations, which also align with recommendations provided at the 2017 Panel Meeting.
FDA recommends that the bottle’s design include a red cap and red tip as an indication that the
solution should not be instilled directly into the eyes. 16,17 FDA recommends that bottle labeling
consist of three equal-sized panels with a prominent red banner (e.g., at least 1 inch in height
where possible) encircling the top of the bottle that includes text emphasizing that the HPCP
solution should not be put into the eyes. We recommend manufacturers include two identical
statements such as “DO NOT PUT IN EYES” or similar statement, in emphasized font that span
the circumference of the bottle with associated large graphics (e.g., an image of bottle squirting
in the eye crossed out). The red banner on the bottle labeling should be consistent with the
banner on the carton labeling. Please see Appendix C for an example of the bottle labeling.
To minimize overcrowding, the bottle label should include the minimum information needed for
consumers to safely use the product and include the product information, directions for use, and
warnings. The labeling text should be written using clear, simple and concise language. FDA
recommends font sizes consistent with the Patient Labeling guidance. FDA recommends the
bottle labeling contain the following information:

b. Directions for Use
The directions for use should contain the major steps of the process (e.g., rinse with solution, fill
provided container, and soak) as referenced in the package insert. Each step should be briefly
described using simple language for easy understanding. Simple graphics, where appropriate,
should be included to aid in understanding.
c. Contraindications
FDA recommends that all known contraindications specific to the device be included on the
bottle labeling as identified in the package insert section IV.B.1.b of this guidance.
d. Warnings
To minimize overcrowding, FDA recommends that manufacturers only include warning
statements that inform the consumer of the risks associated with unneutralized HPCP solution
(e.g., severe burning and stinging) on the bottle labeling. As noted previously, this is important
because unneutralized hydrogen peroxide exposure may result in corneal burns, redness and
stinging. Statements using emphasized text (e.g., red and bold text) should be added to the
warnings section to highlight these concerns and any key details. In addition, clear warnings with
associated graphics should be added to aid in understanding of how consumers may be exposed
to unneutralized hydrogen peroxide. Manufacturers should include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

A statement that the solution should only be used with the case provided and warn
against the use of flat lens cases.
A statement identifying the minimum time to ensure the completion of the neutralization
process prior to lens insertion.
A statement that warns against rinsing your lenses with the HPCP solution just prior to
insertion, which would cause severe burning or stinging.
A statement that warns against squirting the HPCP solution into the eyes.
The statements above, wherever possible, should also warn the consumer of the risks
associated with inserting HPCP solution into the eye (e.g., severe burning and stinging).

Appendix A: Package Insert Labeling Example
This section provides an example of a package insert for an HPCP, as described in Section
IV.B.1.
GENERAL
Hydrogen peroxide placed directly into the eyes or onto contact lenses prior to insertion
can cause stinging, burning, and corneal damage. When using hydrogen peroxide, the
disinfecting process must be followed with neutralization. The neutralization of hydrogen
peroxide into water and oxygen makes it safe to put your lenses back into the eyes.
Neutralization can be either a one-step or two-step process. The one-step process
neutralizes the lenses during the disinfecting stage, while the two-step process neutralizes
the lenses after the disinfecting stage.
Some storage cases have a neutralizer built-in, making it a simple one-step process. With
other cases, a neutralizing tablet that comes with the hydrogen peroxide-based contact
lens care product solution must be added. This is the two-step process.
IMPORTANT - Please read carefully and keep this information for future use.

•
•

[TN] Solution is neutralized only with the special [TN] Solution case. NEVER
use a flat lens case. It will cause severe burning and stinging!
NEVER soak lenses in [TN] Solution for less than [X] hours to ensure
completion of the neutralization process prior to lens insertion. It may cause
severe burning and stinging. DO NOT PUT [TN] DISINFECTING SOLUTION
THAT HAS NOT BEEN NEUTRALIZED IN YOUR EYE. Should
unneutralized [TN] solution get in your eye, remove your lenses immediately,
flush (wash) your eyes with a large amount of water or sterile saline for a few
minutes. If burning and/or irritation persist, seek assistance from an eye care
professional.
DO NOT REUSE NEUTRALIZED HYDROGEN PEROXIDE SOLUTION.
NEVER rinse your lenses with [TN] Solution and put them in your eyes! It will
cause severe burning and stinging!
The red dropper tip indicates that [TN] solution should not be put directly or
indirectly in your eye. NEVER squirt [TN] Solution into your eyes or use as an
on-eye lens rewetting solution! It will cause severe burning and stinging!

ADDITIONAL WARNINGS:
• You should not reuse or “top off” old solution left in your lens case since solution
reuse reduces effective lens disinfection and could lead to severe infection, vision
loss, or blindness. “Topping off” is the addition of fresh solution to solution that has
been sitting in the lens case.
• Do not store your lenses or rinse your lens case with water or any non-sterile or
expired saline solution. Use fresh, sterile or unexpired saline solution so you do not
contaminate your lenses or lens case. Use of non-sterile or expired solution can lead
to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness.
• Water can harbor microorganisms that can lead to severe infection, vision loss, or
blindness. If the contact lenses have been exposed to water, such as when showering,
swimming in pools, lakes, or oceans, you should discard them and replace them with
a new pair. You should ask your eye care professional for recommendations about
wearing your lenses during any activity involving water.
• Never use water, saline solution, or rewetting drops to disinfect your lenses. These
solutions will not disinfect your lenses. Not using the recommended disinfectant can
lead to severe infection, vision loss or blindness.
• Using peroxide solutions beyond the discard date could result in contamination of the
solution and can lead to severe infection, vision loss, or blindness.
• To avoid contamination, DO NOT touch tip of container to any surface. Replace cap
after using.
• To avoid contaminating your solution, DO NOT transfer to other bottles or
containers.

the coating, the tablet may begin to neutralize the [TN] Disinfecting Solution before
adequate disinfection occurs.
[When applicable] DO NOT use [TN] Neutralizer disk for more than [X] uses or [X]
months of daily use. [Note: Uses and time period should be determined by testing
data.]
PROBLEMS WITH CONTACT LENSES AND LENS CARE PRODUCTS COULD
RESULT IN SERIOUS INJURY TO THE EYE. Follow your eye care practitioner's
directions and all labeling instructions for proper use and care of your lenses and lens
care products, including the lens case. Eye problems, including corneal ulcers, can
develop rapidly and lead to loss of vision. Daily wear lenses are not indicated for
overnight wear and should not be worn while sleeping. Clinical studies have shown
the risk of serious adverse reactions is increased when these lenses are worn
overnight. Extended wear lenses should be regularly removed for cleaning and
disinfection or for disposal and replacement on the schedule prescribed by your eye
care practitioner. Clinical studies have shown that there is an increased incidence of
serious adverse reactions in extended wear contact lens users as compared to daily
wear contact lens users. Studies have also shown that the risk of serious adverse
reactions increases the longer extended wear lenses are worn before removal for
cleaning and disinfection or for disposal and replacement. Studies have also shown
that smokers who wear contact lenses have a higher incidence of adverse reactions. If
you experience eye discomfort, excessive tearing, vision changes, or redness of the
eye, immediately remove your lenses and promptly contact your eye care practitioner.
All contact lens wearers should see their eye care practitioner as directed.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS:
• Always wash and dry your hands before handling your lenses.
• DO NOT USE OVER-THE-COUNTER GENERIC HYDROGEN PEROXIDE.
Generic hydrogen peroxide solutions are not intended for ophthalmic use and may
contain ingredients not tested for ocular safety or toxicity. Use of generic hydrogen
peroxide may cause severe burning and stinging if not neutralized before use. In
addition, generic hydrogen peroxide may contain ingredients that cause
DISCOLORATION OR DAMAGE TO YOUR CONTACT LENSES.
• Do not mix or substitute other hydrogen peroxide-based contact lens care products or
lens cases as inadequate neutralization of hydrogen peroxide may cause severe
burning and stinging.
