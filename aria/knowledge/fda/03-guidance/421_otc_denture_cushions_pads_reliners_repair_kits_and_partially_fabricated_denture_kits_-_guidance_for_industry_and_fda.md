Guidance for the Preparation of Premarket Notifications
for OTC Denture Cushions or Pads, OTC Denture Reliners,
OTC Denture Repair Kits, and Partially Fabricated Denture Kits
1.0 INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to the manufacturers of OTC denture
cushions or pads, OTC denture reliners, OTC denture repair kits, and partially fabricated
denture kits on the information desired for a more thorough and consistent preparation of
a Premarket Notification submission (510(k)).
The development of this document is based on information recommended for a complete
and adequate review by the Dental Devices Branch. The use of this document for the
preparation of a 510(k) for OTC denture cushions or pads, OTC denture reliners, OTC
denture repair kits, and partially fabricated denture kits does not ensure FDA clearance of
a device, and certain 510(k) submissions may require additional information not contained
in this document. However, use of this document will help to ensure that the basic
elements are present to conduct an evaluation of substantial equivalence.
This guidance is subject to revision depending upon development of new technological
information and/or changes in regulatory requirements.

Standards
Medical device manufacturers may elect to rely upon recognized voluntary consensus
standards during the design and testing phase of their devices. We recognize that
consensus standards, such as ISO standards, undergo periodic review and are subject to
revision. FDA has published a document entitled “Guidance on the Recognition and Use
of Consensus Standards” which provides guidance to industry and FDA reviewers on the
use of recognized consensus standards, including declaration of conformity to the
standards, during the evaluation of premarket submissions (Federal Register/Volume 63,
No. 37/Wednesday, February 25, 1998). This document and related lists of recognized
standards are on the Internet at FDA’s web site “http://www.FDA.gov/cdrh”.

2.0 GENERAL INFORMATION
510(k) Summary or 510(k) Statement. In accordance with the Safe Medical Devices
Act of 1990 and 21 CFR Part 807.87(h), the applicant must submit either: (1)A summary
of the safety and effectiveness information in the premarket notification submission upon
which an equivalence determination could be based (i.e., a “510(k) summary”); or (2)a
statement that safety and effectiveness information will be made available to interested
persons upon request (i.e., a “510(k) statement”). The summary or statement should be
clearly identified as a “510(k) summary” or a “510(k) statement”.
Truthful and Accurate Statement. As required by 21 CFR Part 807.87(j), the applicant
must also provide a Truthful and Accurate Statement that all data and information
submitted in the premarket notification is truthful and accurate and that no material fact
has been omitted.
Indications for Use Form. On January 1, 1996, FDA began requiring that all 510(k)
submitters provide on a separate page and clearly marked “Indications for Use” the
indications(s) for use of their device and the device trade name.

The New 510(k) Paradigm
On March 19, 1998, new procedures for the submission of 510(k)’s became effective.
These procedures are collectively called the “New 510(k) Paradigm.” More information
on the New 510(k) Paradigm is available at the following Website address:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ode/parad510.pdf

3.0 DEVICE DEFINITIONS
An OTC denture cushion or pad is a prefabricated or noncustom made disposable
device that is intended to improve the fit of a loose or uncomfortable denture, and is
available for purchase over the counter. The device is made of wax-impregnated cotton
cloth that the patient applies to the base or inner surface of a denture before inserting the
denture into the mouth and discarded following one day’s use (class I); or the device is
made of a material other than wax-impregnated cotton cloth or is not intended to be
discarded following one day’s use (class III). See 21 CFR Part 872.3540.

An OTC denture reliner is a device consisting of a material such as a plastic resin that is
intended to be applied as a permanent coating or lining on the denture base. The device is
intended to replace a worn denture lining and is available for purchase over the counter.
See 21 CFR Part 872.3560.

An OTC denture repair kit is a device consisting of a material such a resin monomer
system of powder and liquid adhesives, intended to be applied permanently to a denture to
repair cracks or breaks. The device is available for purchase over the counter. See 21
CFR Part 872.3570.

A partially fabricated denture kit is a device composed of connected preformed teeth
that is intended for use in the construction of a denture. A denture base is constructed
using the patient’s mouth as a mold, by partially polymerizing the resin denture base
materials while the materials are in contact with the oral tissues. After the denture base is
constructed, the connected preformed teeth are chemically bonded to the base. This is a
prescription device and is not available over the counter. See 21 CFR Part 872.3600.

4.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
•

State the classification name and the trade name of the device.

•

Submit a detailed description of your product and its indication(s) for use.

•

Clearly specify whether a single paste or two paste (base/catalyst) system is employed,
and all components of the system or kit.

•

Provide a descriptive or table comparison of the similarities and differences to a legally
marketed predicate device in terms of intended use, chemical composition, physical
characteristics, mechanical properties, safety and effectiveness.

5.0 CHEMICAL IDENTITY
•

Provide the complete material formulation, identifying the individual components by
percentage, to a sum of 100%.
•
•

Note the function of each chemical component.
Do not omit any chemical component nor provide generalizations under a
vague description such as “polymer compound.”

6

•

Provide the specific chemical name, and not a proprietary or trade name, or
abbreviated chemical name.

•

Disclose all the pigments or other colorants used in the formulation.

•

Include the material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each chemical component, a
diagram of the chemical structure and the molecular formula of the finished
material, and the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number if available.

6.0 PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL PROPERTIES
The denture base material should be compared to the predicate material in terms of:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Color Stability (Clear, Translucent, etc.)
Hardness (Knoop, HK)
Linear Shrinkage (%)
Peak Temperature of Polymerization (°C)
Porosity (bubbles or voids visible at 40 cm)
Solubility (mg/cm2)
Strength (Transverse Deflection, mm)
Water Absorption (mg/cm2)

If the physical properties of the denture base material conform to a consensus standard for
performance testing, the specific standard should be referenced as follows:
Denture base material

ANSI/ADA Specification No.

Denture Base Polymers
Denture Cold-Curing Repair Resins
Denture Base Temporary Relining Resins

#12
#13
#17

A summary should be provided of the methodology and results of all bench testing that
has been conducted. The quantitative test results for your materials testing should
compared to those of predicate impression materials.

7.0 BIOCOMPATIBILITY TESTING
Biological evaluation of medical devices is performed to determine the potential toxicity
resulting from contact of the component materials of the device with the body. The device
materials should not, either directly or through the release of their material constituents:
(1)Produce significant adverse local or systemic effects; (2)be carcinogenic; or (3)produce
adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Therefore, evaluation of any new device
intended for human use requires data from systematic testing to ensure that the benefits
provided by the final product will exceed any potential risks produced by device materials.
The ISO standard, ISO-10993, Part 1 uses an approach to test selection that is very
similar to the Tripartite Guidance used in the past by FDA. It also uses a tabular format
(matrix) for laying out the test requirements based on the various factors discussed above.
The matrix consists of two tables, “Initial Evaluation Tests for Consideration” and
“Supplementary Evaluation Tests for Consideration.” To harmonize biological response
testing with the requirements of other countries, FDA has recognized the ISO standard.
Reviewers in the Office of Device Evaluation will accept data developed according to
ISO-10993, Part 1, with the matrix as modified and presented in Blue Book Memorandum
#G95-1 entitled “Use of International Standard ISO-10993, “Biological Evaluation of
Medical Devices Part-1: Evaluation and Testing.”
Manufacturers are advised to begin discussions with the Dental Devices Branch prior to
the initiation of expensive, long-term testing of any new device materials to ensure that the
proper testing will be conducted, and to avoid unnecessary tests.
Biocompatibility testing is indicated when the product contains a “new” or
nonconventional chemical component, and for which the safety or effectiveness of the
resulting formulation is in question. A material may be considered new based upon several
factors, such as methods of manufacture, sterilization, duration of body exposure, etc.
The biocompatibility tests should be performed on the finished product, i.e., in a form as
close as possible to what the patient will be exposed to.
The following tests have been identified as necessary for the evaluation of substantial
equivalence in such a case. This is a list of the minimum testing which should be
addressed in a regulatory submission.
-In Vitro Cytotoxicity
-Ames Test for Mutagenicity
-Mucus Membrane Irritation (hamster’s pouch)
-Sensitization Test in Guinea Pigs, and
-Carcinogenicity (if tumorigenic potential has not been previously documented)

For details on how to conduct these tests, refer to an appropriate international standard
such as: American National Standard/American Dental Association Document No. 41 for
Recommended Standard Practices for Biological Evaluation of Dental Materials,1982; or
ISO/TR: 1984(E), Biological Evaluation of Dental Materials, 1984.

8.0 LABELING
It is important to the consumer that the labeling for the OTC denture cushions or pads,
OTC denture reliners, and OTC denture repair kits bear clear, accurate, and complete
information for use concerning any relevant indications, method of preparation, hazards,
contraindications, and precautions in their use.
As set forth in 21 CFR Part 801.405, recommended warning statements include:
Denture Reliners, Pads, and Cushions:
Warning—For temporary use only. Long term use of this product may lead to
faster bone loss, continuing irritation, sores, and tumors. For Use Only Until A
Dentist Can Be Seen.
Denture Repair Kits:
Warning—For emergency repairs only. Long term use of home-repaired dentures
may cause faster bone loss, continuing irritation, sores, and tumors. This kit for
emergency use only. See Dentist Without Delay.

Include in the 510(k) submission for OTC denture cushions or pads, OTC denture reliners,
OTC denture repair kits, and partially fabricated denture kits, the proposed package labels
and labeling, including any promotion and advertising information. Labeling refers to the
package label plus other written, printed, or graphic material that accompanies the device
or that is placed on either the device or any of its wrappers or containers. Advertising
may be considered labeling, especially if it accompanies the device. The labeling must bear
adequate directions for use and any warnings needed to ensure the safe use of the device.
See sections 201(k) and (m) and 502(f)(1) and (2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act.
