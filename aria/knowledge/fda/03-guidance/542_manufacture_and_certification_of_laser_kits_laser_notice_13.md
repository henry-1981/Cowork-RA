To: All Manufacturers and Potential Manufacturers of Laser Products

SUBJECT: Manufacture and Certification of Laser Kits, 21 CFR
1040.10 and 1010.2

BACKGROUND AND QUESTION: A laser product is sold in kit form, complete
with labels and instructions, such that the product will comply with the
standard when properly assembled. How must such a product be identified
and certified as complying with the standard?

RESPONSE: All laser products sold in kit form must meet all of the
applicable requirements of the performance standard for laser products
when properly assembled according to manufacturers' instructions.

For purposes of identification and certification the date of manufacture
of a kit is considered to be that date on which the manufacturer assembles
the components as a complete package for shipment. Because portions of
the performance standard may be added to or changed and become effective
at a later date, this particular date establishes the last date on which
the manufacturer has control of a specific product and therefore determines
the applicable requirements.

As with all laser products manufactured on or after the effective date of
the standard, these products, when assembled properly, must have affixed
an identification label as specified in 21 CFR 1010.3 and a certification
label as specified in 21 CFR 1010.2. The certification label may indicate
that the product complies with all applicable HEW standards under the
Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 (or HEW radiation
performance standards, 21 CFR Subchapter J) in effect on the date of
Imanufacture shown when assembled in accordance with the manufacturer's
instructions. .

The manufacturer has the responsibility to assure compliance throughout
the useful life of the product under reasonably foreseeable conditions of
assembly and use. Therefore, the following criteria are offered for
evaluating a product of kit design:

1. The design should be such that it would be unlikely that an
untrained assembler could make mistakes or omissions in assembly
that would lead to noncompliance with the standard. In addition,
the manufacturer should pretest the product design with maximized
jaser radiation levels and supply the purchaser with the appropriate
labels.

2. The instructions for assembly should be such that an untrained
assembler could follow them and produce a finished laser product
which would be and remain in compliance with the standard. All
assembly operations that are of importance to radiation safety
should be clearly identified. Where careful adherence to directions
is necessary to assure compliance, clear instructions to take the
necessary care in assembly should be provided. Where alterations
or omissions could lead to noncompliance, the instructions should
provide clear warning against such alterations or omissions.
