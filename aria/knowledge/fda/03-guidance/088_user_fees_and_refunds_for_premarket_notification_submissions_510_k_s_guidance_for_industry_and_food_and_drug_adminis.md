Introduction 
 
The Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022
1 
(MDUFA V), amended the Federal 
 
 
 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to authorize FDA to collect user fees for the 
 
review of certain premarket submissions received on or after October 1, 2022, including 
 
 
premarket notification submissions (510(k)s).
2 
The additional funds obtained from user fees 
 
 
 
 
will enable FDA, with the cooperation of industry, to improve the medical device review 
 
process to meet certain performance goals and implement improvements for the medical 
 
 
device review process as outlined in the letter from the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services to Congress.
3 
 
 
The purpose of this guidance document is to identify: (1) the types of 510(k)s subject to user 
 
fees, (2) exceptions to user fees, and (3) the actions that may result in refunds of user fees 
 
that have been paid. This document incorporates the impact of process improvements from 
 
MDUFA V. 
 
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities. 
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed 
 
only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The

II. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) 
1. 
Are all 510(k)s subject to user fees? 
Most 510(k) submissions are subject to user fees. Section 738(a)(2)(A)(viii) of the FD&C 
Act, requires the submitter to pay a user fee for any 510(k) (Traditional, Abbreviated, or 
Special4) that you submit to FDA, unless you qualify for one of the exceptions listed below. 
You will not have to pay a user fee for your 510(k) if: 
• your submission is reviewed by an FDA-accredited third party5 who submits it to 
FDA with the third party’s recommendation concerning whether your device is 
substantially equivalent to a legally-marketed predicate; see section 738(a)(2)(B)(iv) 
of the FD&C Act; or 
• your submission is for a device intended solely for a pediatric population; see section 
738(a)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the FD&C Act;6 or 
• you are a state or federal government entity and your device will not be distributed 
commercially; see section 738(a)(2)(B)(iii) of the FD&C Act. 
Refer to the Appendix for a summary of when a 510(k) is subject to user fees (Table 1). 
2. 
What are the 510(k) user fees? 
User fees for the current fiscal year are established under section 738 of the FD&C Act and 
shown on the FDA MDUFA User Fees website at https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee­
programs/medical-device-user-fee-amendments-mdufa. 
4 These terms are explained in “The 510(k) Program: Evaluating Substantial Equivalence in Premarket 
Notifications [510(k)],” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance­
documents/510k-program-evaluating-substantial-equivalence-premarket-notifications-510k, “The Abbreviated 
510(k) Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance­
documents/abbreviated-510k-program, or “The Special 510(k) Program,” available at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/special-510k-program, 
respectively.
5 See section 523 of the FD&C Act. For general information concerning third-party review of 510(k)s, see 
“510(k) Third Party Review Program,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda­
guidance-documents/510k-third-party-review-program .

3. 
How do I pay my user fee(s)? 
As outlined below, there are three ways you may submit your user fee.7 Be sure to include 
the Payment Identification Number (PIN, beginning with MD)8 and the FDA P.O. Box on 
your check, bank draft, or U.S. Postal Money Order. Also, you should include a printed copy 
of your User Fee Cover Sheet (Form FDA 3601, accessible through FDA’s User Fee System 
at https://userfees.fda.gov/OA_HTML/fdaCAcdLogin.jsp) with your payment. 
1) Preferred method – Credit Card or Electronic Check (ACH): FDA has partnered with the 
U.S. Department of the Treasury to utilize https://www.pay.gov/, a Web-based payment 
system, for online electronic payment. You may make a payment via electronic check or 
credit card after submitting your cover sheet. To pay online, select the “Pay Now” button. 
Credit card transactions for cover sheets are limited to $24,999.99. 
2) Check: All paper checks must be in U.S. currency from a U.S. bank and made payable to 
the Food and Drug Administration. Please write your unique PIN, from the upper right-
hand corner of your completed Medical Device User Fee cover sheet, on the check and 
mail the check to the appropriate address listed below. FDA will not be able to process 
your payment correctly without your cover sheet PIN. 
Check payments by mail: 
Food and Drug Administration 
P.O. Box 979033 
St. Louis, MO 63197-9000 
Note: In no case should payment be submitted with the 510(k). 
Check payments delivered by a courier service: 
U.S. Bank 
ATTN: Government Lockbox 979033 
1005 Convention Plaza 
St. Louis, MO 63101 
Note: This address is for courier delivery only. If you have any questions concerning 
courier delivery, contact US Bank at (314) 418-4013. 
3) Wire Transfer: Please include your submission’s unique PIN, from the upper right-hand 
corner of your completed Medical Device User Fee cover sheet, in your wire transfer. 
Without the PIN your payment may not be applied to your cover sheet and review of your 
submission will be delayed. 
The originating financial institution may charge a wire transfer fee. Please ask your 
financial institution about the fee and include it with your payment to ensure that your 
cover sheet is fully paid. 
7 Additional information regarding payment of user fees is available at 
https://userfees.fda.gov/OA_HTML/mdufmaFAQ.html.

4. 
If FDA has indicated that my device is eligible for third-party 
review, and my 510(k) was reviewed by a third party, but 
FDA later determines that my device is not eligible for 
review by the third party, will I have to pay a user fee? 
No. You do not have to pay a user fee if FDA had indicated your device is eligible for third-
party review but determines during the course of review of the third-party submission that 
your device is not appropriate for third-party review. Among the reasons FDA may later 
determine that a particular device is not appropriate for third-party review are:9 
• The device requires clinical data to demonstrate substantial equivalence; see section 
523(a)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act. 
• The device or combination product requires multi-Center review or consultation (e.g., 
510(k)s for drug/device combination products). 
5. 
If my 510(k) was reviewed by a third party, will I have to 
pay a user fee if my device was not eligible for review by the 
third party? 
Yes. If you employ a third-party reviewer to review a device that is not eligible for third-
party review, the exception is not applicable and you will have to pay the appropriate 510(k) 
user fee in effect for your submission. 
Please refer to FDA’s guidance 510(k) Third Party Review Program10 for a list of factors 
used in determining device type eligibility for the third-party review program. 
9 Each third-party review of a 510(k) must meet the statutory eligibility requirements set out in section 523 of 
the Act. The two criteria identified here are the two most likely to be subject to errors of interpretation.

6. 
What are the circumstances when FDA will refund my user 
fee payment? 
Statutory exception: If we determine that you have mistakenly paid a fee for a type of 510(k) 
that does not require a fee because of a statutory exception (see FAQ 1 and Appendix 1 
(Table 1)), FDA will refund your payment for that submission upon request. 
Failure to supply a valid electronic copy (eCopy) or an electronic submission template: See 
FAQ 9 and Appendix 1 (Table 2). 
Withdrawal of submission if acceptance criteria are not met: See FAQ 10 and Appendix 1 
(Table 2). 
Withdrawal of an electronic submission template which did not pass technical screening and 
is placed on hold: See FAQ 11 and Appendix 1 (Table 2). 
7. 
What are the circumstances when FDA will not refund my 
user fee payment? 
4) Your 510(k) submission is accepted for review: After the user fee is paid and a 
valid eCopy is provided to FDA, FDA intends to conduct an acceptance review of 
your submission within 15 calendar days, as detailed in the FDA guidance, 
“Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s.”11 If the 510(k) submission is accepted for 
review, we will not refund your user fee payment. 
5) Your 510(k) submitted via eSTAR has passed technical screening: After the user 
fee is paid for a 510(k) submitted via the electronic Submission Template And 
Resource (eSTAR),12,13 FDA intends to conduct a virus screening and technical 
screening of your submission within 15 calendar days, as detailed in the FDA 
guidance “Electronic Submission Template for Medical Device 510(k) 
Submissions.”14 If the 510(k) submission passes the technical screening process, 
we will not refund your user fee payment. 
11 https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/refuse-accept-policy-510ks 
12 For more information see FDA guidance “Electronic Submission Template for Medical Device 510(k) 
Submissions,” available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance­
documents/electronic-submission-template-medical-device-510k-submissions, and FDA’s website regarding the 
eSTAR program (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/voluntary-estar­
program). This website provides current information regarding the eSTAR program for CDRH and CBER. 
13eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission template that is currently available to facilitate the 
preparation of 510(k) submissions as eSubmissions. For simplicity, the electronic submission created with this 
electronic submission template is often referred to as an “eSTAR.”

6) Device is exempt from 510(k) requirements of the Act: If you submit a 510(k) for a device 
that is exempt from the requirements of section 510(k) of the FD&C Act, we will not 
refund your fee payment. It is your responsibility to review the classification 
regulations15 that pertain to your device and to determine whether a regulation exempts 
your device from the 510(k) requirements. Consultation with FDA personnel before 
submitting 510(k)s for products that may not require review will serve to conserve both 
FDA and industry resources.16 
7) Not a device: If you submit a 510(k) for a product that FDA determines does not meet 
the definition of a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, or is not a combination 
product with a device constituent part, we will not refund your fee payment. 
8) Change or modification to a device: FDA reviews all 510(k) submissions, including 
those for a change to a legally marketed device, for determination of substantial 
equivalence. 17 Therefore, FDA does not intend to refund user fees if, for example, a 
manufacturer later decides that the change may not have been of a type that required a 
new 510(k) and wishes to withdraw the submission. FDA encourages manufacturers who 
intend to modify a legally marketed device to consult the FDA guidance, “Deciding 
When to Submit a 510(k) for a Change to an Existing Device.”18 Also, note that a 
guidance document applicable to a specific type of device would supersede the above 
referenced general guidance document. 
In addition, in order to obtain information regarding the class in which a device has been 
classified or the requirements applicable to a device, a manufacturer may submit a request 
under section 513(g) of the FD&C Act. For more information on submitting a 513(g) 
Request for Information, please see the FDA guidance “User Fees for 513(g) Requests for 
Information.”19 
8. 
Do I have to pay for a new submission if I previously 
received a Not Substantially Equivalent (NSE) 
determination for my device? 
Yes, unless a statutory exception applies. Any new submission for a device found NSE is 
15 See 21 CFR parts 862-892. 
16 Among the resources to help you ascertain whether your device is exempt by regulation are the Division of 
Industry and Consumer Education (DICE) for CDRH and the Manufacturers Assistance and Technical Training 
Branch (MATTB) for CBER, the CDRH or CBER review staff; and product classification resources on the 
CDRH website, available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/overview-device-regulation/classify-your­
medical-device. DICE can be reached by phone at (800) 638-2041 or (301) 796-7100, or by email at

As described in the FDA guidance, “FDA and Industry Actions on Premarket Notification 
(510(k)) Submissions: Effect on FDA Review Clock and Goals,”21 if we determine your 
device is NSE for one of the following three reasons: 
• no predicate device, as defined in 21 CFR 807.92(a)(3), exists, 
• your device has a new intended use compared to the predicate, or 
• your device has different technological characteristics that raise different questions of 
safety and effectiveness;22 
You have three options: (1) You may petition for Evaluation of Automatic Class III 
Designation (De Novo classification request under section 513(f)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, 
(2) submit a humanitarian device exemption (HDE) application, or (3) submit a premarket 
approval application (PMA), HDEs are not subject to user fees.23 However, if you submit a 
PMA or De Novo request, FDA will assess the PMA or De Novo user fee at the time of the 
submission (https://www.fda.gov/industry/fda-user-fee-programs/medical-device-user-fee­
amendments-mdufa). 
We may determine that your device is NSE based on the fact that the performance data 
provided in your submission did not demonstrate your device to be at least as safe and 
effective as a legally marketed device of that type. You may submit a new 510(k) if you 
believe you have additional data showing that your device is substantially equivalent to a 
legally marketed predicate device. Because FDA considers this submission a new 510(k), we 
will assess the fee in effect for a 510(k) at the time of the new 510(k) submission. This 
information is summarized in the Appendix (Table 3). 
9. 
If FDA considers my 510(k) withdrawn because I failed to 
supply a valid electronic copy (eCopy) or an eSTAR, will 
FDA refund my fee payment? 
Yes. Section 745A(b) of the FD&C Act  provides statutory authority to require eCopies or 
submission solely in electronic format (e.g., eSTAR) after issuance of final guidance.24 As

outlined in FDA’s guidance “eCopy Program for Medical Device Submissions,”25 if FDA 
receives an eCopy that cannot be accepted because it does not meet our technical standards, 
the omission or reasons for that failure will be communicated to you in writing to aid in your 
creation of a valid replacement eCopy. If a valid eCopy of an original submission is not 
received within 180 calendar days of this notification, the submission will be deleted from 
our system and FDA will refund the fee paid upon request. If you decide not to submit a 
valid replacement eCopy of your original submission in response to the eCopy hold 
notification, you may send a written request to withdraw your submission before receiving a 
deletion letter and request a refund of the fee paid. FDA intends to follow a similar process 
should an eSTAR be submitted that does not pass an automatic verification process.26 
Note that your fee will not be refunded if you fail to provide a valid eCopy or an eSTAR for 
a response to an additional information request after the 510(k) has been accepted for review 
(see FAQ 16 and Appendix 1 (Table 2)). 
10. If acceptance criteria are not met for my 510(k) submission, 
will FDA refund my user fee payment? 
Yes. FDA intends to conduct an acceptance review of your submission as detailed in the 
FDA guidance, “Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s.”27 If FDA refuses to accept your 
submission, you will be notified within 15 calendar days of receipt that your submission has 
not been accepted. You may submit additional information to the 510(k) submission to 
address the reasons for the refusal without submitting a new user fee. Alternatively, you may 
request to withdraw the submission and request a refund of the fee paid if you decide not to 
provide additional information. See FAQ 17 below for more information on how to request a 
refund. 
11. Will FDA refund the user fee if I submit a 510(k) using 
eSTAR, the eSTAR does not pass technical screening and is 
placed on hold, and I withdraw the 510(k) submission? 
Yes. You will be notified within 15 calendar days of receipt if your eSTAR does not pass 
technical screening and is placed on hold. You may submit additional information to the 
510(k) submission to address the reasons for the technical screening hold without submitting 
a new user fee. Alternatively, you may request to withdraw the submission and request a 
refund of the fee paid if you decide not to provide additional information.

12. Will FDA refund the user fee if I submit an eSTAR and the 
eSTAR passes technical screening? 
No. Given that an electronic submission properly prepared with an electronic submission 
template (e.g., eSTAR)) should represent a complete submission,28 eSTARs are not 
anticipated to undergo a refuse to accept (RTA) process.29 However, FDA intends to employ 
a virus scanning and technical screening process for an eSTAR. The technical screening 
process is anticipated to occur within 15 calendar days of FDA receiving the 510(k) eSTAR. 
FDA intends to begin the technical screening for 510(k) electronic submissions after 
confirmation of user fee payment. If the eSTAR is not complete when submitted, FDA will 
notify the submitter via email30 and identify the incomplete information, and the 510(k) will 
be placed and remain on hold until a complete replacement eSTAR is submitted to FDA. 
FDA will not refund user fees paid for eSTARs that have passed technical screening. 
13. Do I have to pay an additional fee if I submit additional 
information to a pending 510(k)? 
No. There are no fees when you submit additional information to a 510(k) for which FDA 
has not yet rendered a final decision. However, if you submit unsolicited additional 
information that constitutes a new indication for use or new or different technology, (i.e., 
changes that would typically require submission of a new 510(k)),31 you will be required to 
submit a new 510(k) and pay the associated fee. 
14. Will FDA refund the user fee if I withdraw my 510(k) after 
it has been accepted for review? 
No. The FD&C Act does not identify withdrawal of a 510(k) submission under substantive 
review as a basis for a refund; see section 738(a)(2)(D) of the FD&C Act. Although the 
FD&C Act provides FDA limited authority to provide a partial refund when a premarket 
application, premarket report, or supplement 32 is withdrawn after filing,33 that authority 
does not extend to 510(k) submissions. 
28 After a submitter completes all necessary sections in their eSTAR file correctly, the status message at the top 
of the PDF will indicate “eSTAR Complete” to represent a complete submission. 
29 For more information on the RTA process, please see “Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s,” available at 
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/refuse-accept-policy-510ks.

15. Must I pay a new user fee if I withdraw and resubmit my 
510(k) after it has been accepted for review (or my eSTAR 
passes technical screening)? 
Yes. If you withdraw your 510(k) submission after it has been accepted for review (or, for an 
eSTAR, after it passes technical screening), and resubmit at a later time, you must pay the fee 
in effect at the time of the new submission. 
16. If FDA considers my 510(k) withdrawn after it has been 
accepted because I failed to supply requested information, 
will FDA require a new user fee if I resubmit my 510(k)? 
Yes. If you fail to respond to an FDA request for additional information within the specified 
timeframe, FDA will issue a notice of withdrawal stating that it considers your 510(k) to be 
withdrawn.34 You must pay the 510(k) fee in effect at the time of the new 510(k) submission. 
17. If eligible, how do I request a refund? 
To facilitate the Agency’s orderly issuance of refunds, you should submit a written request35 
for a refund to the appropriate Center in FDA within 180 calendar days after the fee was due. 
For devices regulated by CDRH, requests for refunds should be submitted to the current 
mailing address displayed on the website https://www.fda.gov/cdrhsubmissionaddress.
