Recommendations for Labeling Medical
Products to Inform Users that the Product
or Product Container is not Made with
Natural Rubber Latex
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

1. Introduction
The purpose of this guidance is to make recommendations on the appropriate language to
include in the labeling of a medical product to convey that natural rubber latex was not used
as a material in the manufacture of the product, product container, and/or packaging. FDA is
concerned that statements submitted for inclusion in medical product labeling, such as “latexfree,” “does not contain natural rubber latex,” or “does not contain latex” are not accurate
because it is not possible to reliably assure that there is an absence of the allergens associated
with hypersensitivity reactions to natural rubber latex in the medical product. Use of these
terms may give users allergic to natural rubber latex a false sense of security when using a
medical product. FDA is recommending that a consistent, scientifically accurate statement be
used by all manufacturers who wish to convey that natural rubber latex was not used as a
material in the manufacture of a medical product, its container and/or packaging.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2. Scope
This guidance document applies to all FDA regulated medical products (i.e., devices, drugs,
biologics, and veterinary products) for which: (1) natural rubber latex or synthetic derivatives
of natural rubber latex were not used as materials in their manufacture; or (2) any container
and/or packaging was not made with natural rubber latex or synthetic derivatives of natural
rubber latex. This guidance contains labeling recommendations for manufacturers who wish
to include a statement in medical product labeling indicating that natural rubber latex or
synthetic derivatives of natural rubber latex were not used as manufacturing materials in the
medical product, its container and/or packaging.

3. Background
Contact with devices containing natural rubber has been associated with anaphylaxis in
individuals allergic to natural rubber latex proteins. 1 Our medical device regulations include
provisions that require certain labeling statements on medical devices if the device or device
packaging is composed of or contains natural rubber that contacts humans. See 21 CFR
801.437. The biologics regulations (21 CFR 610.61(l)) require that the package label or
package insert declare the presence of known sensitizing substances, but do not specifically
mention natural rubber latex. Specific regulations for labeling of natural rubber latex content
in medical products or their containers do not exist for drugs or veterinary products.
At this time there are no regulations requiring a company to state that natural rubber latex
was not used as a material in the manufacture of a medical product, its container and/or
packaging. However, some manufacturers have included the promotional statements “latexfree” or “does not contain latex” in medical product labeling to inform users that natural
rubber latex, dry natural rubber or synthetic derivatives of natural rubber latex were not used.
FDA believes that these labeling statements are not sufficiently specific, not necessarily
scientifically accurate and may be misunderstood or applied too widely, and therefore, it is
inappropriate to include such statements in medical product labeling.
First, the term “latex” in the labeling statements “latex-free” and “does not contain latex”
could refer to natural rubber latex or synthetic latex (not derived from natural rubber latex).
Labeling statements that do not clearly state the material of concern are not sufficiently
specific and therefore should not be included in medical product labeling.
Second, users may consider the terms “free” and “does not contain” to mean that the medical
product is completely devoid of natural rubber latex. However, there are no analytical
methods currently available that can identify all proteins and components in natural rubber
latex that may lead to allergic reactions in medical product users. In addition, the use of the

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
term “free” or “does not contain” does not address the potential for accidental contamination
of a medical product and/or its container with natural rubber latex during or after
manufacturing.
Although there are a number of tests to measure the various compounds related to natural
rubber latex allergies, FDA is aware of no test method or combination of test methods
available at this time that can demonstrate the absence of proteins or components from
natural rubber latex that may cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. A brief
description of three currently available test methods used to assess levels of total protein or
natural rubber latex proteins in medical products are provided below:
1. ASTM D5712 – Standard Test Method for Analysis of Aqueous Extractable Protein
in Natural Rubber and its Products Using the Modified Lowry Method.
This is an FDA- recognized standard. 2 The purpose of this test method is to
determine the protein content in natural rubber latex materials. This test method does
not specifically measure antigenic or allergenic natural rubber latex proteins, but
rather the total aqueous extractable protein content in the sample.
2. ASTM D6499 – Standard Test Method for the Immunological Measurement of
Antigenic Protein in Natural Rubber and its Products.
This is an FDA- recognized standard2. The purpose of this test method is to
determine the amount of antigenic protein in natural rubber and its products using
rabbit antisera specific for natural rubber latex proteins. However, the standard
clearly states that “Although this method detects antigenic proteins, it should not be
considered as a measure of allergenic proteins. Correlation of protein/antigen levels
with the level of allergenic proteins has not been fully established.”
3. ASTM D7427 – Standard Test Method for Immunological Measurement of Four
Principal Allergenic Proteins (Hev b 1, 3, 5 and 6.02) in Natural Rubber and its
Products Derived from Latex.
This standard has not been recognized by the FDA as of the time of issuance of this
guidance. The purpose of this test method is to determine the amount of four specific
known natural rubber latex allergenic proteins. (At least thirteen natural rubber latex
allergens have been identified.) Per the test method, “the sum of the four allergen
levels shall be viewed as an indicator of the allergen burden and not as a measure of
the total allergen content that can be released from the product.”

FDA recognizes national and international consensus standards for use in development of medical products. A
database of all recognized standards can be found at:

The specificity and sensitivity of currently available analytical methods are not sufficient to
demonstrate that a medical product is completely “free” of natural rubber latex proteins
which have primarily been associated with causing severe allergic reactions (Type I allergic
reactions). FDA recognizes that the complete absence of all natural rubber latex allergens is
unlikely to be necessary for the safe use of medical products by individuals with natural
rubber latex allergies. Threshold allergen levels, exposure below which no adverse reaction
occurs in the majority of sensitive individuals, have been identified for some non-natural
rubber latex allergens (e.g., hymenoptera venoms and specific foods).
However, threshold allergen levels are unavailable for natural rubber latex-allergic
individuals. For example, there are at least 13 distinct allergens identified for natural rubber
latex allergy and the sensitivity to each varies, not only among individuals, but among groups
of individuals (e.g., health care providers, industry workers, children with
meningomyelocele). Furthermore, thresholds are likely to be route-specific and multiple
routes of exposure (e.g., respiratory, percutaneous, oral, and parenteral) have been implicated
in natural rubber latex sensitization and reactivity. There is no one threshold level of
exposure that can be considered safe, but rather many levels that are a function of the
allergen, the risk group, the exposure route, the immune status of the individual and, perhaps,
other factors as yet unidentified. Therefore, any preventative strategy should address the
possible different threshold levels for sensitization and for triggering a reaction in an at-risk
individual.
Ideally, all threshold levels should be established for each allergen under all conditions, and
the lowest threshold level identified for each. This information is unlikely to become
available without a concerted scientific effort. Even if this is achieved, the correlation of data
from ASTM methods D5712 (total protein), D6499 (overall allergen levels), and D7427 (four
specific allergens) to the established minimum threshold levels would be uncertain.
For the reasons stated above, FDA finds that the use of statements, such as “latex-free,”
“does not contain latex,” or other similar labeling statements are, at this time, not
scientifically supportable.
FDA strongly recommends that these statements not be used in medical product labeling.

4. Recommended Labeling Statement
Currently, there are no regulations requiring a manufacturer to state that natural rubber latex
was not used as a material in their medical product, its container and/or its packaging. If a
manufacturer elects to include a statement in medical product labeling indicating that natural
rubber latex or synthetic derivatives of natural rubber latex were not used as materials in the
manufacture of their medical product and container, FDA recommends the use of the
statement “Not made with natural rubber latex.” If this statement is made without any
qualification, it would apply to the medical product, its container, and any packaging. In
certain cases, statements regarding “not made with natural rubber latex” may be appropriate
only for certain components. In this case a manufacturer may elect to make a statement that
4

the specific component is not made with natural rubber latex. For example, if the particular
presentation or part of the presentation (e.g., vial stopper or syringe) is not made with natural
rubber latex, FDA recommends the statement “The <vial stopper> is not made with
natural rubber latex.”
These statements “Not made with natural rubber latex” and “The <vial stopper> is not
made with natural rubber latex” communicate that natural rubber latex was not used as a
material in the finished product or as a material in a specific component, respectively. At the
same time, the statement does not make the unsupportable claim that the medical product is
“free” of or “does not contain” natural rubber latex (i.e., materials or contamination), which
may promote a false sense of safety to users who are allergic to natural rubber latex. Finally,
use of a consistent scientifically supportable labeling statement will reduce confusion among
FDA staff, medical product manufacturers, and medical product users.
Manufacturers who currently include statements such as “latex-free” or “does not contain
latex” in medical product labeling should update their medical product labeling to show the
recommended labeling statement “Not made with natural rubber latex” or “The <vial
stopper> is not made with natural rubber latex” as appropriate. Alternatively,
manufacturers should consider removing “latex-free” type statements from medical products,
their containers, and packaging. Manufacturers may contact the Center that regulates the
medical product for guidance on the appropriate regulatory mechanism to update the labeling.
