qO: Manufacturers, Distributors and Importers of Condom Products
On February 13, 1989, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a
statement of policy regarding the marketing of condom-like products (a.k.a.
*Novelty Condoms*), Thie letter revioes and supersede8 that policy.
Condoms are medical devices which many conapmers rely upon for
contraception and prevention of eexually trbnemitted diseasee (STD's),
especially AIDS. Therefore, condoms or products that can'be used as
condoms, must comply with specific condom leak testing requirements as well
as other regulatory requirements for medical devices. Some marketers have
misinterpreted the 1989 policy and believe kt permits the marketing of
condoms as novelty i t e m even though they dp not comply with these
requiremente. Theee novelty products frequbntly consist of a condom
packaged or labeled for adult humor. They are traditionally sold in adult
entertainment shops. This eituation has ca sed confusFon and may result in
the use of these noncompliant products by ctnsumers with the expectation
that they are effective in preventing pregnbncy and STDs.
Products that can cover the penis with a closely fitting membrane and
otherwise have the appearance of a condom are regarded as condoms
regardless of packaging or labeling. These:producte, by form and function,
meet the definition of a condom as defined in 21 CFR 884.5300 and must
therefore comply with all requirements for condoms including leak testing,
compliance with Good Manufacturing Practicep regulations, manufacturer
registration, product listing, and pre-market notification and clearance.
In order t o market a condom-like product which is not subject to the above
requiremente, the product cannot be usable as a condom in any way. For
example, a condom could be rendered unusable by removing the cloeed end;
shredding the aides; eealing the roll in ouch a way that' it cannot be
unrolled, or.by some other method rendering.it equally unusable. Labeling
a functional condom as a novelty is not sufficient.

Questions concerning this policy can be directed to Mr. Byron L. Tart by
writing to the letterhead address or phoning (301) 594-4639.
