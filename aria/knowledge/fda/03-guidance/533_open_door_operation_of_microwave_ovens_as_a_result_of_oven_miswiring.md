Open Door Operation of Microwave Ovens as a Result of
Oven Miswiring

Recently t h e r e have been three incidents in consumer locations i n which
t h e microwave oven operated with t h e door open due t o oven miswiring.
These incidents have resulted i n expensive oven r e t e s t i n g and r e c a l l
programs. It has a l s o been learned that several workers a t one manuf a c t u r i n g location had accidently been exposed t o microwave radiation i n
several instances during oven t e s t i n g , due t o oven miswiring t h a t res u l t e d i n t h e continued operation of t h e oven a f t e r t h e daor was opened.
The Bureau i s g r e a t l y concerned that future incidents such as these
could occur and r e s u l t i n t h e exposure of individuals t o high l e v e l s of
microwave energy. To reduce t h e p o t e n t i a l f o r such open door operation,
due t o miswiring of t h e oven c i r c u i t r y , t h e Wtreau strongly recommends
that all manufacturers consider i n s t i t u t i n g design f e a t u r e s t h a t will, (1)
preclude andagous accidental miswiring -of microwave ovens, o r (2) if
miswiring occurred, prevent t h e u n i t from operating with t h e door open.
It i s recommended t h a t all manufacturers consider:
1. Locating one safety interlock on t h e n e u t r a l side of t h e l i n e
and another on t h e high side of t h e l i n e .

Locating t h e monitor c i r c u i t a s t h e l a s t c i r c u i t branch i n
2.
p a r a l l e l with t h e high voltage transformer, o r making t h e "hot"
A.C. l i n e connection t o t h e monitor c i r c u i t t h e l a s t connection p r i o r
t o connection with t h e primary of t b e power t r a n s f o m e r .
Performing a f a i l u r e mode e f f e c t s a n a l y s i s on each unique
3.
design t o i d e n t i f y c r i t i c a l connections and wires where t h e accident& interchange would r e s u l t i n e l e c t r i c a l l y by-passing a l l
s a f e t y interlocks and t h e monitor.

4.
Designing c r i t i c a l wire terminal connect p i n t s so a s t o
mechanically preclude accidental interchange of these wires t o
any unsafe configuration.
Covering t h e terminals ',of c r i t i c a l wires with i n s u l a t i o n t o
5.
prevent any loose wire from being a b l e t o contact another point
t h a t might r e s u l t i n by-passing t h e s a f e t y i n t e r l o c k o r monitor
circuit.

6.

Using wire t i e s t o l i m i t t h e degree o f movement of any Kire

t h a t could becone disconnected.

I n s t i t u t i n g other design features that would prevent t h e m i s wiring of u n i t s o r prevent u n i t s t h a t are miswired from operating
with t h e door open.
Manufacturers must be caref'ul not t o introduce design changes t h a t could
r e s u l t i n noncompliance with t h e Federal perforinance standard. It i s
requested t h a t proposed changes be .submitted t o t h e Bureau f o r review
p r i o r t o incorporating t h e changes on production models- It may a l s o be
appropriate t o submit prototype u n i t s t o the Bureau f o r evaluation.

It i s equally important t h a t c e r t a i n good quality c o n t r o l p r a c t i c e s be .
observed t o help prevent these undesirable conditions. The Bureau i s
hereby requesting t h a t all manufacturers now i n s t i t u t e , if not already
a p a r t of t h e i r q u a l i t y control and t e s t i n g program, a s p e c i f i c t e s t of
each u n i t t o determine t h a t t h e u n i t w i l l cease operating when t h e door
i s opened, and t h a t it cannot be r e s t a r t e d , when t h e door is open. Any
t e s t that provides positive indication of magnetron shutdown upon l a t c h
r e l e a s e o r door opening w i l l be acceptable.
The t e s t must a l s o include an attempt t o r e s t a r t t h e u n i t while t h e door
i s unlatched. This should be attempted both with t h e u n i t programed and
not programed ( f o r operation)for d i g i t a l units, and Kith and without time
on t h e timer f o r nondigital u n i t s , i f t h e s t a t u s of t h e s e c o n t r o l s could
a l t e r t h e p o s s i b i l i t y of s t a r t i n g with t h e door openW
e recognize t h a t these t e s t s require care i n order t o prevent t h e
exposure of t h e operator t o high l e v e l s of microwave energy- I n each
case t h e door should be unlatched slowly and t h e operator i n s t r u c t e d t o
terminate t h e t e s t imnediately if a problem i s noted. Also a mechanical
stop i s recommended t h a t would allow t h e door t o be unlatched and opened
s l i g h t l y but which would prevent t h e door from opening t o a p o s i t i o n
t h a t would allow hzzardous l e v e l s of microwave energy t o leak from t h e
oven.
Regardless of t h e type of t e s t performed t h e t e s t must be conducted at a
point on t h e production t h a t i s subsequent t o any assembly, adjustment
o r r e p a i r of t h e u n i t t h a t could a l t e r t h e oven wiring. A l l o p e r a t o r s
must be instructed t o immediately report any findings o f open door
operation t o t h e proper quality control person so t h z t t h e d e f e c t i v e
u n i t czn be analyzed t o determine t h e cause of t h e f a i l u r e . Manuf a c t u r e r s should take corrective action t o prevent f u t u r e incidents.
Since t n e f a i l u r e could be t h e r e s u l t of a defective wiring component
t h a t i s assembled in-house o r purchased from a vendor, it i s recommended
t h a t t h e assemblers of kuch components receive a d d i t i o n a l t r a i n i n g and
assenbly a i d s t h a t , w i l l help prevent defective wiring components. Units
of t h e components should be inspected on a sampling o r 100% b a s i s p r i o r

t o being s e n t t o the production line- I f a defective component is found
i n a l o t , then t h a t l o t should be rejected o r 100 per c e n t t e s t e d p r i o r
t o allowing t h e components t o be sent t o t h e assembly l i n e . Where
sampling i s used, l o t s received a f t e r a rejected l o t should be t e s t e d
under a tightened sampling schedule u n t i l t h e r e s u l t s allow f o r r e t u r n
t o a normal sampling schedule.
Please i n s t i t u t e any design and t e s t i n g program change-s necessary t o prevent
open door operation, The Wlreau would welcome other suggestions which
could help prevent such incidents.
