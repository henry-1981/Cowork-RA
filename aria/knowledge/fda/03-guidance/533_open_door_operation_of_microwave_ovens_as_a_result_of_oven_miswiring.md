Subject: 
Open Door Operation of Microwave Ovens as a Result of 
Oven Miswiring 
Recently there have been three incidents in consumer locations in which 
the microwave oven operated with the door open due t o  oven miswiring. 
These incidents have resulted in expensive oven retesting and recall 
programs. It has also been learned that several workers at one manu- 
facturing location had accidently been exposed t o  microwave radiation i n  
several instances during oven testing, due t o  oven miswiring that re- 
sulted i n  the continued operation of the oven after the daor was opened. 
The Bureau is greatly concerned that future incidents such as these 
could occur and result i n  the exposure of individuals t o  high levels of 
microwave energy. 
To reduce the potential for such open door operation, 
due t o  miswiring of the oven circuitry, the Wtreau strongly recommends 
that all manufacturers consider instituting design features that will, (1) 
preclude andagous accidental miswiring -of microwave ovens, or (2) if 
miswiring occurred, prevent the unit from operating with the door open. 
It is recommended that all manufacturers consider: 
1. 
Locating one safety interlock on the neutral side of the line 
and another on the high side of the line. 
2. 
Locating the monitor circuit a s  the l a s t  circuit branch in 
parallel with the high voltage transformer, or making the "hot" 
A.C. 
l i n e  connection t o  the monitor circuit the l a s t  connection prior 
t o  connection with the primary of tbe power transfomer. 
3. 
Performing a failure mode effects analysis on each unique 
design t o  identify critical connections and wires where the ac- 
cident& interchange would result i n  electrically by-passing a l l  
safety interlocks and the monitor. 
4. 
Designing critical wire terminal connect p i n t s  so as t o  
mechanically preclude accidental interchange of these wires to 
any unsafe configuration. 
5 .  
Covering the terminals ',of c r i t i c a l  wires with insulation to 
prevent any loose wire from being able t o  contact another point 
t h a t  might result in by-passing the safety interlock o r  monitor 
circuit . 
6 .  
Using wire t i e s  t o  limit the degree of movement of any Kire 
that could becone disconnected.

7. 
Instituting other design features that would prevent the m i s -  
wiring of units or prevent units that are miswired from operating 
with the door open. 
Manufacturers must be caref'ul not t o  introduce design changes that could 
result i n  noncompliance with the Federal perforinance standard. It i s  
requested that proposed changes be .submitted t o  the Bureau f o r  review 
prior t o  incorporating the changes on production models- It may also be 
appropriate t o  submit prototype units t o  the Bureau for evaluation. 
It i s  equally important t h a t  certain good quality control practices be . 
observed t o  help prevent these undesirable conditions. 
The Bureau is 
hereby requesting that all manufacturers now institute, if not already 
a part of their quality control and testing program, a specific t e s t  of 
. 
each unit t o  determine that the unit w i l l  cease operating when t h e  door 
is opened, and that it cannot be restarted, when the door is open. 
Any 
t e s t  that provides positive indication of magnetron shutdown upon latch 
release or door opening w i l l  be acceptable. 
The t e s t  must also include an attempt t o  restart the unit while the door 
i s  unlatched. 
This should be attempted both with the unit programed and 
not programed (for operation)for digital units, and Kith and without time 
on the timer for nondigital units, i f  the status of these controls could 
a l t e r  the possibility of starting with the door open- 
We recognize that these t e s t s  require care in order t o  prevent the 
exposure of the operator t o  high levels of microwave energy- I n  each 
case the door should be unlatched slowly and the operator instructed t o  
terminate the t e s t  imnediately if a problem is noted. 
Also a mechanical 
stop i s  recommended that would allow the door t o  be unlatched and opened 
slightly but which would prevent the door from opening t o  a position 
that would allow hzzardous levels of microwave energy t o  leak from the 
oven. 
Regardless of the type of t e s t  performed the t e s t  must be conducted at a 
point on the production that is subsequent t o  any assembly, adjustment 
or repair of the unit that could a l t e r  the oven wiring. 
A l l  operators 
must be instructed t o  immediately report any findings of open door 
operation t o  the proper quality control person so thzt the defective 
unit czn be analyzed t o  determine the cause of the failure. Manu- 
facturers should take corrective action t o  prevent future incidents. 
Since tne failure could be the result of a defective wiring component 
that is assembled in-house o r  purchased from a vendor, it is recommended 
that the assemblers of kuch components receive additional training and 
assenbly aids that,will help prevent defective wiring components. 
Units 
of the components should be inspected on a sampling o r  100% basis prior

to being sent t o  the production line- I f  a defective 
in a l o t ,  then that l o t  should be rejected or 100 per 
t o  allowing the components to be sent to the assembly 
Ovens 
component is found 
cent tested prior 
line. 
Where 
sampling is used, l o t s  received after a rejected l o t  should be tested 
under a tightened sampling schedule until the results allow for return 
t o  a normal sampling schedule. 
Please institute any design and testing program change-s necessary t o  prevent 
open door operation, 
The Wlreau would welcome other suggestions which 
could help prevent such incidents.
