This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA
or Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding
on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements
of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the
FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I. Introduction
FDA is issuing this guidance to provide industry and agency staff with recommendations for
the suggested format and content of an Abbreviated 510(k) submission for early growth
response 1 (EGR1) gene fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test system for specimen
characterization devices and recommendations for addressing certain labeling issues relevant
to the review process specific to these devices.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

92

II. Scope

93

The scope of this document is limited to the devices identified in 21 CFR 864.1870 as:

94
95
96
97
98

An early growth response 1 (EGR1) gene fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) test
system for specimen characterization is a device intended to detect the EGR1 probe target on
chromosome 5q in bone marrow specimens from patients with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The assay results are intended to be
interpreted only by a qualified pathologist or cytogeneticist. These devices do not include

automated systems that directly report results without review and interpretation by a
qualified pathologist or cytogeneticist. These devices also do not include any device
intended for use to select patient therapy, predict patient response to therapy or to screen for
disease as well as any device with a claim for a particular diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring or
risk assessment.

A. Content and Format of an Abbreviated 510(k)
An Abbreviated 510(k) submission must include the required elements identified in 21 CFR
807.87, including the proposed labeling for the device sufficient to describe the device, its
intended use, and the directions for its use. In an Abbreviated 510(k) for this device, FDA
may consider the contents of a summary report to be appropriate supporting data within the
meaning of 21 CFR 807.87(f) or (g); therefore, we recommend that you include a summary
report. The summary report should describe how this guidance document was used during
the device development and testing and the methods or tests used. The report should also
include a summary of the test data or description of the acceptance criteria applied to address
the risks identified in this document, as well as any additional risks specific to your device.
This section provides suggestions about how to compose your Abbreviated 510(k)
submission, including a suggested order and headings.
1.

Coversheet
The coversheet should prominently identify the submission as an Abbreviated 510(k)
and cite the title of this guidance document.

2.

Proposed labeling
Include proposed labels, labeling, and advertisements sufficient to describe the
device, its intended use, and the directions for its use. 21 CFR 807.87(e). Refer to
the section titled “Labeling” for specific information that you should include in the
labeling for this type of device.

3.

Summary report
The special controls for an Early Growth Response 1 (EGR1) Gene Fluorescence insitu Hybridization (FISH) Test System for Specimen Characterization have been
outlined in regulation 21 CFR 864.1870. The Abbreviated 510(k) submission should
include a summary report in tabular format that contains the information required by
these special controls as well as confirmation that the studies have been conducted
and met the appropriate pre-specified acceptance criteria. These studies are listed
below with additional explanatory information intended to provide clarity about the
content of the submission.

Patient samples derived from the intended use population (e.g., patients with acute
myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) should be used in these studies.
When this is not possible, spiked normal samples or samples derived from
representative positive and negative cultured cells may be appropriate; however,
using spiked or cultured cell samples as the only matrix in the evaluation may not
provide an accurate assessment of the performance characteristics. Appropriate assay
controls should be used when conducting the performance studies.
6.

Clinical Validity
You must include documentation that demonstrates the clinical validity of the device.
21 CFR 864.1870(b)(1)(xxviii). The documentation must include data from clinical
studies, a minimum of two peer-reviewed published literature references using the
specific device seeking marketing clearance, or both. 21 CFR 864.1870(b)(1)(xiiixvii). Documentation for the clinical studies and peer–reviewed published literature
references cited must include the following elements:
A) Documentation that the sponsor’s probe was used in the literature reference
B) Number & type of specimens
C) Target population studied
D) Upper reference limit
E) Range of positive probe results
21 CFR 864.1870(b)(1)(xiii-xvii). The information should be summarized in tabular
format (See Table 2 for an example of how the information may be formatted).
If you use peer-reviewed published scientific literature references to support the
510(k) submission, then a declaration should be provided in the Abbreviated 510(k)
submission that the literature supports the device’s claims. Supportive peer-reviewed
published literature should use the same product for which you are seeking clearance
and contain valid safety and effectiveness data. Any unpublished data safety and
effectiveness data that you have for your device should be provided in the 510(k)
submission. You should cite only relevant published literature for the defined clinical
setting where product was used and identify specimen matrices.

B. Labeling
The 21 CFR 809.10(b)(12) compliant labeling must include a statement summarizing the
data identified in 21 CFR 864.1870(b)(1)(xiii)-(xviii) and a description of the studies
supporting the information, including the pre-specified acceptance criteria for these
performance studies, justification for the pre-specified acceptance criteria, and whether the
pre-specified acceptance criteria were met. 21 CFR 864.1870(b)(2).
The 21 CFR 809.10 compliant labeling must include:
i)
ii)
iii)

A warning that reads “The assay results are intended to be interpreted only by a
qualified pathologist or cytogeneticist.”
A warning that reads “This device is not for high-risk uses such as selecting therapy,
predicting therapeutic response or disease screening.”
A warning that reads “The use of this device for diagnosis, monitoring or risk
assessment has not been established.”

21 CFR 864.1870(b)(3). The labeling should also include specific instructions and the
clinical training needed for the safe use of the device.
If peer-reviewed published scientific literature references are used to support the Abbreviated
510(k) submission, then you should include a statement in the labeling that reads "Cited
literature may discuss device uses that have not been approved or cleared by FDA."
