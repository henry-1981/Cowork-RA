This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s Good
Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if such approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both. This guidance will be
updated in the next revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

I.  GENERAL CONTENT OF A REVIEW
1. Follow the “Third Party Review: An Instruction Manual for Conducting Reviews of
Premarket Notifications” supplied to Third Parties.
2. Follow the “Device Labeling Guidance” in the ODE Blue Book.
3. Use and modify as appropriate the boilerplate review memo in the ODE New Reviewer
Training Manual.


NAME:  EXT.v5             DATE: 2/21/97

II.  DESCRIPTION OF PREDICATE(S) AND DEVICE UNDER REVIEW
1. Identify the type of bones to which the device is to attached (i.e., bone construct
classification) and the types of frame and pin configurations (i.e., the frame limb access and
frame pin configuration) as defined by ASTM F 1541 (see appendix 1 for examples of
possible choices).
2. Compare the intended use of the device to the predicate(s).  21 CFR 888.3030 describes
external fixation devices as single/multiple component metallic bone fixation appliances and
accessories (product code KTT) that “...are used for fixation of fractures of the proximal or
distal end of long bones, such as intracapsular, intertrochanteric, intercervical, supracondylar,
or condylar fractures of the femur; for fusion of a joint; or for surgical procedures that
involve cutting a bone.”  Limb lengthening and use in fixation of the hand have also been
identified as preamendment intended uses.  Any other intended uses should be removed or
supported by clinical data. 
External fixation pins are classified in 21 CFR 888.3040 and have the following product
codes: HTY (pin, fixation, smooth), JDW (pin, fixation, threaded) and JEC (component,
traction, invasive).
3. Devices labeled for use in the spine or for dynamitization during bone healing, and devices
which have a structural rigidity significantly lower than the predicate device or which claim
MRI compatibility will not be reviewed by third parties.  These complex issues require
special analysis of the risks, and mechanical and/or animal testing may be necessary which is
beyond the scope of this document.
4. List and classify each of the fixator elements (i.e., parts or components) as defined by STM F
1541.  Possible choices and the suggested order that the components may be listed are given
in appendix 2.
5. In addition to the above list, describe each device component as outlined in the checklist of
material and design parameters in appendix 3.
III.  COMPARE THE PREDICATE(S) AND DEVICE UNDER REVIEW
1. Compare the intended uses, design, materials, properties, etc. of the device under review to
the same parameters of a predicate device, listing all similarities and differences between the
two devices. 
2. Give reasons why each difference does or does not add new or increased risks and complications,
based on current engineering technology and clinical results published about external fixators as
well as based on what has been previously cleared by FDA.  Common complications involving
external fixation devices include the following (Johnson, E.E., page 251):
1.
pin-tract infection,
2.
ring sequestrae,
3.
prolonged healing,
4.
distraction of the fracture site,
5.
delayed union,
6.
bone fracture.


NAME:  EXT.v5             DATE: 2/21/97

3.
Identify potential benefits of the new device compared to predicate devices.
4.
Use the above information to justify test requirements as described below. 
IV.  DEVICE TESTING
The reviewer is responsible for assessing the information required to determine safety and
effectiveness based on the particular design parameters of the device under review.  The
following are examples of tests that have been required for previous devices submitted to FDA. 
However, new information may suggest a different approach.  The reviewer should justify test
requirements and conclusions based on supportive references.  If testing of the device is
necessary as described below, a summary of the methods and results should be organized as
suggested in appendix 4.
1.
A device which has essentially the same design and materials as the predicate should not
require testing unless there is new information which raises safety and effectiveness
concerns.
2.
The smooth or threaded fixation pin components (or their equivalent) that contact body
tissues are always metal and are generally medical grade CoCrMo, Ti6Al4V or 316 LVM
stainless steel.  Other types of pin materials or combinations of materials should
demonstrate a biological response at least as good as a predicate or substantially
equivalent device when tested according to ISO 10993 for Medical Devices.
3.
If the new device does not have the same or a higher estimated rigidity compared to the
predicate device based on dimensions (given that the materials in the predicate have the
same or higher elastic modulus compared to the new device) rigidity should be evaluated
either in bench testing or in an animal model.
4.
The static load to failure of the entire construct is only necessary for new designs in
which the rigidity of the construct significantly differs from predicate designs.
5.
If any interconnection design is not similar to a predicate design, loosening between parts
at that interconnection should be evaluated.  Cyclic loading is preferred, though static
loading may be considered acceptable if properly rationalized.  If the loads applied at the
interconnection can be demonstrated to be the same as expected clinical loads, only the
two joined parts need to be included in the test.
6.
If the design under review has any stress risers not present in the predicate design, fatigue
testing of the assembly should be performed, or a rationale for why such testing is not
necessary should be presented.


NAME:  EXT.v5             DATE: 2/21/97
4
7.
Any reasonably known and available animal or clinical data about devices containing
similar materials and designs should be summarized in a table.  Additional animal or
clinical data may be required if the bench testing methods or results of other tests raise
concerns.

DISEASE/USE
Open and closed fracture fixation, nonunions, limb lengthening, soft and hard tissue
deformities or defects.  This material is for nickel sensitive patients.
REASON FOR APPLICATION:  Change in materials (from 316 LVM SS to Ti-6Al-4V)
DECISION       SE
The change in material did not significantly affect the rigidity or fatigue properties of the device.  The static
strength was lower for the  Ti-6Al-4V wire, however:
Even the xxxx N failure load of the Ti alloy wire exceeds 3 times body weight (2000 N) by 900 N, i.e.,
xx% of 2000 N. 
More than one wire is used in parallel, so the load is shared.

COMPARABLE PREDICATE DEVICES
As required by 21 CFR 807.87 (f), the device under review in this 510k is compared for substantial
equivalence to a legally marketed predicate device which was found to be substantially equivalent in a 510k
(predicate device), viz., Kxxxxxx Xxxxxxxx External Fixation System:   components 1-3 described above but
made of 316 LVM SS.
The differences in the design (compared to predicate devices) do not raise new types of safety and
effectiveness questions (risks) not seen before in similar devices.  The same risks occur in both devices.
TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS: 
Possible clinical complications/risks for the device under review may include the following:
1.
pin-tract infection,
2.
ring sequestrae,
3.
prolonged healing,
4.
distraction of the fracture site,
5.
delayed or non-union,
6.
bone fracture.
Non-union of the original fracture and resorption of bone after fracture fixation often initiate these
complications so the external fixator submitted in this 510k was evaluated to determine the likelihood of non-
union or bone resorption by the following tests:
RIGIDITY (OR DEFLECTION) MEASUREMENTS
Xsss, X.; Yyyyyyyyy, Y. 1996 measured the stiffness of the external fixator wires to determine the clinical
significance of differences in materials.  Testing was conducted at Zzzzzzzz 01/96.  The 10 test samples were
Ti-6Al-4V 1.8 mm wire under a tension of xx or yyy Kg.  The 10 control samples were SS with the same
characteristics.  Samples were loaded normal to the wire axis in a pseudo 3 point bending at x mm/min at the
center of the wire.  Each sample was loaded x times and the final rigidity used in comparisons.  The rigidity of
the test and control samples was xx +- x.x and yy +- y.y N/mm respectively.  The z% difference in stiffness
between the two types of wire was not significant.
STATIC FAILURE OF THE DEVICE
This testing determines the static load to failure of the entire construct.  Xxxxx, X.; Yyyyyyyyy, Y. 1994 (page
4) measured the strength of external fixator wire.  Samples were loaded in parallel to the wire axis in tension
at x mm/min.  The results for the Ti test and SS control samples were xxxx and yyyy N


NAME:  EXT.v5             DATE: 2/21/97
14
respectively.  The SD was xxx and yy N respectively, so the Ti wire load to failure was significantly below
that of the SS wire.  The lower Ti wire strength may not be a problem for two reasons:
Even the xxxx N failure load of the Ti alloy wire exceeds 3 times body weight (2000 N) by 900 N, i.e.,
yy% of xxxx N. 
More than one wire is used in parallel, so the load is shared.
FATIGUE FAILURE AND LOOSENING BETWEEN PARTS
Xxxxx, X.; Yyyyyyyyy, Y. 1994 (page 4) evaluated the cyclic fatigue strength of external fixator wire. 
Samples were loaded normal to the wire axis in 3 point bending at xx-yyy N (z Hz) at the center of wire until
failure.  Failure of the Ti test and SS control samples occurred after xxxxx and yyyyy cycles respectively for
the 1.8 mm wires.  The difference was not significant.
THERMAL NECROSIS DUE TO DRILLING THE WIRE THROUGH THE BONE
Xxxxx, X.; Yyyyyyyyy, Y. 1994 (page 4) measured bone temperatures during drilling of external fixation wire
through simulated bone (Last-A-Foam) to determine any differences in results due to differences in materials.
Testing was conducted at Zzzzzzzz 05/01/94. Samples were loaded xx N during drilling along the wire axis. 
The Ti wire and SS wire heated the bone model to xx and yy C, but the SD was around x and y C respectively,
so there was no significant difference. 
Differences between the two materials may have made a difference in the amount of heat generated if
lubricant or real bone were used.  Therefore, I do not feel this test accurately determines any differences
between the SS and Ti wires.  The actual temperatures should be lower if lubricant is used, but the effect of
not using real bone is unknown.  This test is not critical to safety and effectiveness, so I do not recommend
requesting further information.
SUMMARY OF INFORMATION SUPPORTING DECISION/RECOMMENDATION:
This device has equivalent intended use, has similar promotional claims, conforms to similar standards, and
has equivalent technological characteristics to predicate devices.

CONTACT HISTORY:
The following is a chronological listing of all requests for information made by Xxx Yyyyyyy to the firm
regarding this 510k, followed by a summary of the firm's response in their next correspondence (the firm's
response is indented below each request):
As per 21 CFR 807.87(h), I advised Xxx Xxxxx 7-29-96, 2 pm that there was insufficient information to
make a determination concerning substantial equivalence.  I then requested the following information:
1.
The Ti wire load to failure was significantly below that of the SS wire.  Discuss the effect of this on
clinical outcomes.
FDA received an adequate response to this request.
2.
Provide information on differences in fixator rigidity using SS versus Ti wire.  The device under
review is made out of a material with a lower modulus compared to the predicate, which may result in
a lower rigidity.  Rigidity affects bone resorption and union of the fracture.  Too little rigidity may lead
to instability and nonunion.
FDA received an adequate response to this request.
