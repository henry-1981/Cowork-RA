Design Considerations for Devices
Intended for Home Use
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

I.

Introduction

This guidance is intended to assist manufacturers in designing and developing home use
devices that comply with applicable standards of safety and effectiveness and other
regulatory requirements. Devices used in the home or other non-clinical environments are
associated with unique risks created by the interactions among the user (often a layperson),
the use environment, and the device. This guidance identifies several factors that
manufacturers of home use devices should consider, especially during device design and
development, and provides recommendations for minimizing these unique risks.
Throughout this guidance the term “you” refers to manufacturers as defined in 21 CFR
820.3(o). For convenience the definition is restated here: Manufacturer means any person
who designs, manufactures, fabricates, assembles, or processes a finished device.
Manufacturer includes, but is not limited to, those who perform the functions of contract
sterilization, installation, relabeling, remanufacturing, repacking, or specification
development, and initial distributors of foreign entities performing these functions.
For additional information or questions about the FDA-recognized standards referenced in
this guidance document, please contact CDRH’s Standards Program.1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidance describes the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

II.

Background

For a variety of reasons, use of devices outside professional healthcare facilities is on the
rise. First, the United States population is aging, and the elderly are more likely to live with
chronic diseases that require daily medical care at home. Second, due to medical
advancements, many individuals with chronic diseases are living longer but are dependent on
home medical care. Finally, an increasing focus on reducing healthcare costs for patients of
all ages has spurred the growth of the home health care market. Integral to the home health
care market are home use devices. Although home use devices provide significant benefits to
patients and families, including quality of life improvements and cost savings, they are also
associated with unique risks. These risks result from interactions among the user, the use
environment, and the device, and can greatly affect user and patient safety.
Due to the increasing prevalence of home use devices, minimizing the risks they posed can
greatly improve the public health. With this in mind, FDA developed the following
considerations that can help manufacturers reduce or minimize common risks posed by home
use devices. These risks are best addressed at the design stage. Failure to adequately consider
potentially hazardous situations during the design of home use devices may result in
inappropriate use, use error, or incompatibilities between the use environment, the user, and
the device. This could cause the device to malfunction, possibly contributing to death or
serious injury.
When developing a new home use device, you should take the considerations in this
guidance document into account and, to the extent possible, reduce or minimize risk to
acceptable levels through device design (sometimes referred to as “designing risk out of the
device”). For any premarket submission to FDA, you should ensure that the device is
suitable for home use and provide in the submission data that demonstrate how you
considered and addressed the relevant hazards and risks, such as the ones mentioned in this
guidance document. This can help FDA determine whether applicable safety and
effectiveness requirements have been met.
Following the recommendations in this guidance can help you develop a device that is best
suited to the home use environment, which should decrease the occurrence of adverse events
by minimizing the risks to patient and user safety.

III. Scope
This guidance provides recommendations for minimizing the risks associated with home use
devices by considering the user, the use environment, the device or system, human factors,
and labeling. This guidance applies to both prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medical
devices, including any class I, II, or III devices intended for home use.2 The
recommendations in this document apply whenever you are designing or developing a home
use device, as defined in Section IV of this document. This guidance also provides
recommendations regarding postmarket considerations. These recommendations should also
be considered when you are designing a device that is likely to be used in the home, even if
the device is not intended solely for home use. Review this guidance for the factors that may
be applicable to your device type.

IV. Definitions
The following definitions apply for purposes of this guidance document (Please note the
definitions below are not intended for use outside this guidance document.):
A home use device is a medical device labeled for use in any environment outside a
professional healthcare facility. This includes but is not limited to outdoor environments,
office environments, schools, vehicles, emergency shelters, and independent living
retirement homes. If the device is intended to be used in professional healthcare facilities
and also outside those facilities, it meets this definition.
A user is a lay person such as a patient (care recipient), caregiver, or family member who
directly operates or handles a device or provides assistance to the patient in using the device.
Lay is a nonprofessional or professional person without relevant specialized training (e.g.,
lay operator, lay responsible organization).
A qualified healthcare professional is a licensed or non-licensed healthcare professional
with sufficient skills and experience with the use of a device to aid or train someone to use
and maintain the device.
A professional healthcare facility is either –
(1) any environment where personnel with medical training are continually available
to oversee or administer the use of medical devices. This includes, but is not
limited to, hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, emergency medical
services, clinics, physicians’ offices, and outpatient treatment facilities; or
(2) a clinical laboratory.

Sponsors of home use in vitro diagnostic tests to diagnose HIV are advised to contact CBER to discuss issues
related to those tests.

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
A clinical laboratory3 is a facility that (1) performs testing on materials derived from the
human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or
treatment of any disease or impairment of, or assessment of the health of, human beings; and
(2) has been certified to perform such testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendments of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 263a) in accordance with 42 CFR part 493, or has met
equivalent requirements as determined by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services in
accordance with those provisions.

V.

Environmental Considerations

When designing a home use device, you should account for the range of environments in
which it might be used and the applicable environmental conditions noted below. These
conditions should be addressed with all devices that will be used in a home or non-clinical
setting. The labeling of the device should include warnings against using the device in
environmental conditions that would raise safety or effectiveness concerns; however,
managing risk by device design is preferable to managing risk through labeling. FDA
recommends that, in your premarket submission for your device design, you include a
summary of the efforts you took to account for the following considerations, if they pertain to
the intended use environment for your device. If some of the items do not pertain to the type
of equipment you are designing, then you will not have to consider them in your device
design.

A.

Location

Home use device design should permit the device to operate in its intended use location(s)
(e.g., urban/suburban/rural, school/office/retail environments, and train/plane/car). Consider
where the device will be used and how these locations would affect the user and the device’s
ability to function and operate safely and effectively. For example, older buildings can have
outlets that do not meet current electrical code or a limited number of outlets. See section
VII-E-4 for further guidance. Home use device design should take into account the
characteristics of the environment in which the device is intended to be used and stored. Your
device design should permit the device to move in and out of the environment, as well as
move from place to place within the environment (e.g., from room to room). Crowded use
environments can interfere with device use and movement, present tripping hazards, or
increase the likelihood that device parts will bump into or get tangled with objects in the
environment. In addition, the device may not operate in a certain physical location if it relies
on a wireless signal that may be unavailable.

B.

Contaminants

Home use device design should permit the device to be operated in a non-sterile
environment. The risk that the device could be affected by contaminants such as vermin,
pets, tobacco smoke, and household chemicals should be mitigated as much as possible by
3

See also 21 CFR 610.40(f).

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
designing the device to minimize the ingress of fluids, solids, and airborne particles that
would affect device operation.

C.

Water Supply

You should specify the type of water that is required to properly operate the home use
device, e.g., well water or treated water. For additional information on keeping water safe,
see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Web site on emergency preparedness
and response.

D.

Temperature

Home use devices should be designed for the anticipated temperature range in the intended
use environment, especially those that are portable and might be exposed to fluctuations and
extremes in temperature.

E.

Dampness and Humidity

Home use devices should be designed for the variability in humidity levels that are expected
to be present in the intended use environment, especially those that are portable and might be
exposed to fluctuations and extremes in humidity.

F.

Atmospheric Pressure Changes

Home use devices should be designed to operate properly within a range of atmospheric
pressures such as lower pressures that occur in the mountains and during air travel.

G.

Air Flow

Home use device design should ensure that air flow will be adequate for proper device
operation.

H.

Travel and International Use

Design of portable home use devices should anticipate that users will travel—internationally
as well as domestically—with their medical devices and may use a variety of transportation
modes as they travel. For electrical home use devices, you should provide information in the
labeling on the adaptability of the device to the electrical supplies and voltage rates of other
countries, and whether an adapter may be used to operate the device. Given that electrical
power varies by country, electrical converters and battery back-up may be necessary to
operate the device in a country outside the United States. Labeling should also include
information on how users can get help if the device malfunctions while they are away from
home.

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In designing the device, you should also anticipate that users, including users of any bodyworn medical devices, may be required to pass through security screening systems while
traveling. These systems continue to evolve but currently include backscatter X-ray and
millimeter wave technologies. You should consider whether these systems can interfere with
the operation of the device. In addition, if users must undergo a security pat-down to avoid
the automated screening system, you should consider how the procedure might affect bodyworn medical devices, such as a continuous blood glucose sensor. In the instructions for use
(IFU), consider referring the user to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Web
site which includes information about procedures for travel with medical equipment.

I.

Fluid Exposure

You should consider what the device can safely tolerate when it is subject to fluid spills or
submersion, as well as the amount of fluid that the device can be exposed to without
affecting its safe use.

J.

Storage

You should provide information to the user about proper storage of the device and its
components and accessories. For example, this could include, but is not limited to, keeping
the device out of sunlight, keeping it at a proper temperature control, and keeping it dry
between uses.

VI. User Considerations
The users of home use devices are different from the health care professionals who typically
operate medical devices in a professional health care facility. Home users can have a large
range of physical, sensory, and cognitive capabilities and disabilities, and emotional
differences that should be considered in your home use device design. If the home use
device is not designed for ease of use and understanding, you increase the likelihood of
misuse and non-use of the device. Home use devices should be designed to prevent
reasonably-foreseeable misuse. You should consider that children or adults might interact
with the device in inappropriate ways.
The following personal characteristics can affect device use and should be considered in the
design of the device. Note that some home use devices are designed to diagnose or treat
medical conditions that can cause functional impairments; therefore, it is important to design
those devices to be usable by individuals with impairments. You should account for the
following characteristics of your intended users in your device design. If a premarket
submission is required, it should identify your intended users and include a summary of the
actions you took to account for these characteristics.

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

A.

Physical

You should design for users with a range of physical sizes, mobility, dexterity, coordination,
flexibility, strength, and stamina.

B.

Sensory/Perceptual

You should design for users with a range of vision and hearing abilities and tactile
sensitivities. In your home use device design, you should consider the visibility of the device
interface under a variety of ambient lighting conditions, the visibility of any alarm signals
and whether they will be differentiated from other sounds in the environment, the types of
feedback mechanisms that will operate while the user is interacting with the device, and
whether any perceptual issues might affect the user’s ability to use the device properly,
which could include handling the device and the manner in which it touches the user.

C.

Cognitive

You should design for users with a range of abilities to process information and literacy
levels, and consider the potential that users might have some type of cognitive impairment
that could affect how they interact with the home use device. Consider the amount of
experience the users might have with a type of device and with similar devices, and how able
and willing they might be to learn and adapt to using a new device.

D.

Emotional

You should design for users who may be providing care for a loved one who is unable to use
the device unassisted. Whether a person is providing care to others or performing self-care,
he or she can be dealing with a new diagnosis or condition along with the need to operate a
medical device, which can be overwhelming and cause anxiety for the user.

VII. Design Considerations
The Quality System regulation (QS regulation)4 describes requirements intended to help
ensure that finished medical devices have a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
For example, it requires that you establish and maintain procedures to control the design of
the device to ensure that specified design requirements are met. This guidance document
provides recommendations on technical issues to consider during the design and
development of home use devices. This section outlines certain aspects of design control that
are particularly important for home use devices.
Under 21 CFR 820.30 -- Design Controls, a manufacturer must establish procedures to
ensure that device design will translate into a device that performs properly according to its
4

21 CFR Part 820.

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
intended use and user needs.5 Design control requirements of the QS regulation apply to
design and development of the device as well as its packaging and labeling (e.g., Instructions
for Use), and its cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization procedures. When establishing
design controls for home use devices, you should take into account considerations related to
device performance and user needs in the home environment, which are discussed in detail
below. For more information about creating and implementing design controls, we
recommend that you refer to FDA’s guidance Design Control Guidance for Medical Device
Manufacturers (March 11, 1997).
You should consider developing a risk management plan. This risk management plan should
describe the process for identifying hazards, estimating and evaluating the known risks,
controlling the risks, and monitoring the effectiveness of the controls. In your risk analysis,
special attention should be paid to the possible causes of use-related errors and failures, as
home use devices are exposed to more hazards than are present in professional health care
facilities and present greater potential for harm caused by user error.
Your risk management plan should also include elements to control risk that can enhance the
ease of use for the intended user population based on human factors engineering methods
(see Section VIII). You should first strive for the highest level of risk control possible by
designing risk out of the system to the greatest extent possible. Methods to control risk and to
enhance ease of use also include designing the device to reduce or minimize risks,
developing protective measures in the device itself (e.g., an automatic shutoff), or providing
information for safety. It is important to note that labeling alone generally does not offer
sufficient risk control for the home use environment because warning labels, especially
lengthy ones, can be ignored by or confusing to the user. Accounting for the considerations
described in this document will help mitigate risk and guide device design so that it is
appropriate for the intended user and use environment. We recommend that you review
ANSI/AAMI/ISO14971:2007/(R) 2010, Medical devices – Application of risk management
to medical devices.
Software plays a critical role in the operation of some devices. For these devices, you should
focus on developing device and software architecture and algorithms for performance, error
detection, control, and recovery. When developing a home use device, you should broaden
your existing concept development and preliminary testing processes to account for the needs
of home users and requirements for straightforward device operation, obvious interface
layouts, and appropriate alarm methods. If software upgrades are required, you should
consider how this will be performed in the home environment with the lowest risk to the user
and least burden on you.
For software in general, we recommend that you review:
·

IEC 62304 First edition 2006-05, Medical device software – Software life cycle
processes and the identical standard ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62304:2006.

in Medical Devices (May 11, 2005).

Lock-out Mechanisms

FDA recognizes that lockout mechanisms can be used for controlling access to certain device
functions, such as preventing the patient from changing settings entered by the health care
professional or caregiver. However, the safety of home use devices should not depend solely
on such mechanisms. Before using a lock-out mechanism as the only mechanism to reduce
or prevent patient harm, you should first rule out other design solutions. However, if a lockout mechanism is the only mechanism available to reduce or prevent patient harm, it should
be used.

B.

Maintenance

Home use devices might require routine maintenance for continued optimal performance.
We recommend that you minimize the requirements for maintenance to the extent possible.
When required, maintenance procedures should be easy to follow, clearly explained, and
have a logical flow.

C.

Calibration

Home use devices should be designed without the need for calibration, but if that is not
possible, the device should be designed to require minimal calibration by the user.
Calibration instructions should be step-by-step and preferably provide the user with any
feedback necessary to complete the calibration process. This could also include an indication
on the device that states that it is calibrated, when it was last calibrated, and when the next
calibration is needed.
When the performance of the device depends on the use of calibrators, the traceability of the
values assigned to these calibrators should be assured through a quality management system.
If the device calibration needs to be done by a trained professional, you should indicate
whether the device can remain in the home or has to be calibrated in another location. You
should refer to available consensus standards and FDA guidance documents particular to the
type of device that you are designing to review specific calibration requirements.

D.

Mechanical

Because some home use devices are portable and will be moved around frequently, it is
critical to test them to see how they function after impact with the ground or other objects.
Devices should have a minimal number of parts that could be detached or fall off and present
an inhalation, swallowing, or tripping hazard.

The standard ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11:2011 Medical electrical equipment - Part 1-11:
General requirements for basic safety and essential performance – Collateral standard:
Requirements for medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems used in the
home healthcare environment includes information on mechanical strength for both transit
operable and non-transit operable electrical medical devices. The medical device and its
parts, including mounting and other accessories, should have adequate mechanical strength
so that they can withstand stress caused by normal use that includes pushing, dropping, rough
handling, freefall, vibration, and impact with the ground or another object. If the device will
be used while the user is in transit, the device should have adequate mechanical strength and
durability to withstand normal transport conditions on trains, road vehicles, cycles, ships, and
aircraft. FDA also recommends that you review ASTM D4169-09, Standard practice for
performance testing of shipping containers and systems, for mechanical strength in the
design of medical devices. For portable medical devices that are intended to be used only
with a carrying case, the case should be tested along with the device.

E.

Electrical Issues

Design of home use devices that use electricity should take into account that some use
environments might have unreliable sources of electricity and poor electrical grounding. The
General Standard ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1:2012 (edition 3.1), Medical electrical equipment
– Part I: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance includes
information regarding the following electrical issues related to medical devices:

1. Supply Mains
If your device operates from the supply main, you should consider using the applicable
specifications of ANSI/AAMI ES60601-1:2012 (Edition 3.1) and ANSI/AAMI HA60601--1-11:2011. The latter specifies voltage ranges over which life-supporting medical devices and
medical devices that are not life-supporting should provide their basic safety and essential
performance. The following standards have specifications regarding short-term voltage
interruptions and specifications regarding long-term interruptions of the supply mains:
ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 Fourth edition 2014-02, Medical electrical equipment, Part
1-2: General requirements for basic safety and essential performance – Collateral
standard: Electromagnetic disturbances – Requirements and tests.6

2. Internal Electrical Power Source

FDA’s recognition of the 2014 version of the IEC 60601-1-2 is available at
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfstandards/detail.cfm?standard__identification_no=34000.
Please note that the 2014 version of the IEC 60601-1-2 standard includes a transition period through December
31, 2018 as noted in FDA’s recognition. You may consider using IEC 60601-1-2:2007 during this transition
period. FDA’s recognition of the 2007 version of the IEC 60601-1-2 is available at
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfstandards/detail.cfm?standard__identification_no=33996.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If device operation depends on an internal electrical power source (e.g., batteries), the
instructions for use (IFU) should describe the typical operation time or number of procedures
and the typical service life of the power source. If the device uses a rechargeable power
source, the IFU should explain whether the device can be used while it is charging. If the
internal power source is replaceable, the IFU should explain the replacement process
procedure. If a device operates on battery power, you should inform the user how long he or
she can expect the device to work on a fully charged battery. To the extent possible, the
device should notify the user in advance that the battery will need to be recharged or replaced
soon. The design should consider that the user might not routinely recharge the device or
might select inexpensive batteries that could otherwise result in suboptimal performance.

3. Permanently Installed Devices
If a device is to be permanently installed in a home, the labeling should include clear
information and specifications about proper protective grounding and recommend that the
installation should be performed by a qualified professional.

4. Outlets and Adapters
You should inform the user if the device should not share an outlet with another electrical
device or be connected to an outlet controlled by a wall switch. You should also consider
whether surge protectors, extension cords, or ground fault interrupters are appropriate for use
with your device and inform the user accordingly. As some plugs are not compatible with
some outlets in the home, your IFU should inform the user about the type of adapter, if any,
that can be used and how to use it safely with the device.7

5. Power Outages
If a device requires AC power to operate, you should consider providing or identifying backup power options, such as a battery or generator. You should also provide instructions in the
device labeling for emergency contact information in the event of a power outage (e.g.,
manufacturer, power supply company, or clinical care provider, as appropriate). If the device
cannot operate without a backup power supply, this should be noted either on the device or in
the warnings section of the IFU. The manufacturer could also identify alternative means of
providing the same or similar treatment that does not require using an electrical device. The
IFU should disclose the continued device use time or number of procedures available
following a loss or failure of the electrical power supply. If you provide a backup power
source with your device, your IFU should specify how long the user should expect the device
to work on backup power.

6. Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)

NOTE: ANSI/AAMI HA 60601-1-11:2011 specifies that equipment intended for home healthcare use a twopronged plug or be battery powered.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the ability of a device to operate properly in the
presence of electromagnetic disturbances that are expected to occur in the environments of
intended use without introducing excessive electromagnetic disturbances into that
environment. FDA recommends that you consider using the FDA-recognized
ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 Edition 4:2014-02 standard, which describes EMC testing and
includes tests for immunity of the device to outside electromagnetic disturbances in the use
environment and also for emissions from the device into that environment. If you use
ANSI/AAMI/IEC 60601-1-2 Edition 3:2007 during the transition period to Edition 4 that
ends December 31, 2018, you should be aware that electromagnetic disturbance in the home
healthcare environment can exceed the default test levels for the hospital environment that
are specified in Edition 3. You should design your device intended for home use to be
immune to disturbance levels that can be expected in the home healthcare environment.8
You should provide summary information in your premarket submissions to FDA describing
the testing that was performed and how it was conducted, the device functions and modes
that were tested, the pass/fail criteria used, reference standards and any deviations or
allowances that were taken, any device modification needed to pass the testing, and
appropriate labeling. Device manufacturers should consider appropriate levels of testing in
accordance with the risks presented by the environments of intended use in addition to the
general immunity testing specified in the standards.
You should also note possible sources of disturbance for electrically powered medical
devices in the use location(s) that could be near or in contact with other objects that would
interfere with their performance, such as large electric motors or amateur radio transmitters,
radio and television transmitters, radar, anti-theft systems (including demagnetizers), stereo
speakers, cell phone, and radio frequency identification (RFID).

7. Wireless Technology
If a device incorporates radio frequency (RF) wireless technologies, the device description in
the premarket submission should contain a complete description of the exact wireless
technology used, frequency and frequency band, output power, functions, including any
alarm conditions communicated wirelessly, performance, and risk management. Compliance
of RF wireless technologies with applicable technology standards and Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) rules does not necessarily alleviate home use device
safety and effectiveness concerns. Any submission for a device that includes RF wireless
technology should address the areas of concern listed in FDA’s guidance Radio Frequency
Wireless Technology in Medical Devices (August 13, 2013). Particular points to address
8

Although not a requirement, the Agency generally finds testing to the following immunity tests levels
acceptable for the home environment based on FDA’s experience with home use devices: Electrostatic
Discharge (ESD): ± 8 kV contact discharge, ± 15 kV air discharge; Power frequency magnetic fields: 30 A/m at
50 Hz or 60 Hz; Conducted RF: 3 V r.m.s outside industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) and amateur radio
bands between 0.15 MHz and 80 MHz, 6 V r.m.s. in ISM and amateur radio bands between 0.15 MHz and 80
MHz; Radiated RF: 10 V/m, 80 MHz to 2.6 GHz. You may provide justification for testing to alternative
levels.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
include quality of service needed, data integrity, coexistence, security, and EMC of the
wireless signals based on the use of the data intended by the manufacturer.
Due to the increased use of RF wireless technology that operates in shared frequency bands,
if applicable, you should carefully address RF wireless coexistence through testing the device
with other common applications of RF wireless technology that can be expected to be present
in the environment of use. If it can be expected that two or more similar devices will be
operating wirelessly in close proximity (e.g., mobile or body worn devices located in a
waiting room or the same room of a home), the ability to operate properly under these
conditions should also be tested.

8. Alarm Systems
Alarm systems are of particular concern for home use devices because noise and other
distractions inside and outside the home can interfere with the users’ ability to be made
aware of an alarm signal. For example, users can have hearing impairments, including the
inability to hear specific frequencies. Device alarm systems with high or medium-priority
alarm signals should be designed to be perceived in environments typically found in the
home. If the alarm system incorporates wired or wireless connections to other locations, the
entire device system should be designed and tested to mitigate risks from loss or degradation
of these connections.
Alarm signals may not apply to all devices. If the need for an alarm applies to your device,
FDA recommends that you provide alarm signals in at least two of the three following
modes: visual, auditory, tactile. This alarm signal could be localized to the area where the
device is being operated or in another location, which is known as a distributed alarm system.
For example, the alarm could sound in another room or in a remote location where it is being
monitored. FDA recommends that you consider using the following standard:
·

IEC 60601-1-8 Edition 2.1 2012-11, Medical electrical equipment; Part 1-8; General
requirements for basic safety and essential performance; Collateral Standard:
General requirements, tests and guidance for alarm systems in medical electrical
equipment and medical electrical systems.

VIII. Human Factors
To understand the hazards associated with the use of a medical device in the home, it is
necessary to have an accurate and complete understanding of how a device will be used.
Understanding and optimizing how people use and interact with technology is the subject of
human factors engineering.
Human factors engineering offers well-established methods to identify design issues that
could affect medical device safety and efficacy. One particularly effective human factors
method is to conduct “usability” testing. In a typical usability test session, representative
device users perform selected tasks under conditions of simulated (not actual) use in an
appropriately realistic environment. Depending on the nature of the device and the goals of
13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the test, the test environment could range from a conference room to a sophisticated, highfidelity simulation of the expected use environment or an actual home. Testing early in the
design process and then several more times as the design evolves is an effective way to
prevent user interaction problems from persisting into the later stages of the design process,
at which point effective solutions to problems may be more limited and more expensive to
implement.9 Following the formative stage of design development, FDA recommends that
you conduct a human factors validation study.10
We recommend that you consult FDA’s guidance on this topic, Applying Human Factors and
Usability Engineering to Medical Devices (February 3, 2016), that represents FDA’s
approach on this topic.
Additionally, you may refer to relevant U.S. and international standards, such as:

A.

·

ANSI/AAMI HE 75:2009, Human factors engineering—Design of medical devices.

·

ANSI/AAMI/IEC 62366:2007/(R) 2013, Medical devices—Application of usability
engineering to medical devices.

User Training and Certification

When designing devices, you should take into account that users may not understand
multiple steps, may receive minimal training or teaching on how to operate these devices,
and may not be able to understand multiple warnings and precautions. In addition, users may
not understand the need to calibrate, clean, and maintain the device. User training may be
critical for safe operation of home use devices.
We recommend that you consider the need for training as you determine the complexity of
your home use device. The content and time needed for successful training depends on
factors specific to the device. We suggest you validate the effectiveness of your training
program.
For many devices, the user may also need a care partner to help operate the device safely and
to provide monitoring of the patient while the device is being used. We recommend that you
outline the responsibilities of the care partner, the caregiver, and the care recipient during the
training sessions and provide instructions to users on emergency procedures, such as the
procedures necessary if a serious adverse event occurs. We recommend that you provide
guidance to the user on any retraining or recertification that is needed for safe operation of
the device and indicate how frequently this needs to be done.
FDA recommends that you review AAMI TIR49:2013, Design of training and instructional
material for medical devices used in non-clinical environments.
9

Such testing may be subject to IDE requirements in section 520(g) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR Part 812 and
the human subject protection requirements in 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 depending on the nature of the testing.
10
Such a study may also be subject to the IDE and human subject protection requirements referenced above.

IX. Labeling
Labeling for home use devices must address all applicable requirements in 21 CFR Part 801
and 809.10. Labeling considerations should be for both prescription and OTC devices. In
general, the IFU for the user should be simple, concise, and easily understood. Instructions
written for the user should be written in a narrative format, and pictures may be helpful to
explain instructional steps. Although instructions, labeling, and training can influence users
to use devices safely and effectively, use of such material assumes that the user will
remember or refer back to the information. These approaches are less effective than
designing the system so that it is inherently apparent to users. The device’s labeling should
include contraindications that clearly explain why any individual should not use the device,
and clear warnings of all hazards that cannot be designed out. Using the same terms
throughout the labeling to identify the device avoids confusion for the user. Labeling on
devices should be simple, visible, and clear and readily understood by the user; it should also
be able to withstand defacement or wear. In addition to developing clear and effective
labeling for the device, you should consider situations when the device may be separated
from the labeling and what end users need to do to access the labeling, such as finding it on a
Web site or calling someone who may be able to help them with safe device operation.
In addition to the labeling requirements found in 21 CFR Part 801 and 809.10, you may
obtain information for developing labeling for home use devices from the following
documents:
·

Labeling of Home-Use In Vitro Testing Products: Approved Guideline, Clinical and
Laboratory Standards Institute, GP-14 (June, 1996).

·

FDA’s guidance Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the
Magnetic Resonance (MR) Environment (December 11, 2014).
FDA recommends that implanted devices include labeling that encourages patients to
register the conditions under which the implant can be scanned safely with the
MedicAlert Foundation or equivalent organization.

·

FDA’s Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling (April 19, 2001).

·

FDA’s guidance Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) for Devices Indicated for
Nocturnal Home Hemodialysis (April 15, 2008).

A.

Handling the Device in an Emergency

FDA recommends that manufacturers of life-supporting and life-sustaining care devices for
the home have plans for providing emergency service and supplies during natural disasters
and public health emergencies. You may refer to FDA’s booklet Home Use Devices: How to
Prepare for and Handle Power Outages for Medical Devices that Require Electricity (2011).
The booklet provides information that a user should have in the event of a power outage,
including a contact telephone number for the manufacturer. The booklet advises the user that
he or she keep all of his or her device information in one place that is readily accessible, such
as on the refrigerator or on a device identification card that the user carries. The booklet
recommends that users contact their local power companies and their local social services
departments to be put on lists for special attention when public health or safety emergencies
happen. The booklet also advises users to look for signs of damage to the device and how to
identify the circumstances under which the device or its accessories should not be used.
Refer to the following sources for additional information about handling the device in an
emergency:

B.

·

Department of Homeland Security’s Web site: Prepare for Emergencies Now:
Information for People with Disabilities.

·

FDA’s Web site about medical device safety in emergencies: FDA Offer Tips about
Medical Devices and Hurricane Disasters.

Disposal

The IFU should include information concerning the proper disposal of the device and its
accessories. You should provide proper warnings and precautions regarding safe disposal of
waste products when using the device in the home environment and help the user understand
the difference between biological waste and regular waste. If the device or accessories
require professional assistance to dispose of biological or biohazardous waste, the IFU
should state that the user should make proper arrangements for safe waste disposal.

C.

Hygienic Maintenance

Home users do not have easy access to the cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilization supplies
that are readily available in professional health care facilities. Ideally, home use devices
should be designed to be cleaned, disinfected, or sterilized with readily available supplies and
use simple techniques. If a home use device or its accessories require cleaning, disinfection,
or sterilization prior to use, FDA recommends that you describe in the labeling for your
device or system the complete cycles and methods for cleaning, sterilizing, or disinfecting
the system. FDA’s guidance on this topic Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care
Settings: Validation Methods and Labeling (March 17, 2015) represents FDA’s approach on
this topic.

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If a medical device or its accessories require professional hygienic maintenance prior to reuse, contact information for those services should be provided in the labeling and IFU. A
technical description for hygienic maintenance requirements in the labeling and IFU should
include methods to clean, disinfect, sterilize, rinse, dry, handle, and store the device before
and after any type of service procedure, as well as indicate what steps are required if a device
is transferred to another user. The IFU should also cover how to obtain consumable or
disposable supplies.
For medical device reuse information written for the user, see FDA Offers Tips About
Medical Devices and Hurricane Disasters: Reuse of Medical Devices.
For more information on hygienic maintenance information on reprocessed single-use
devices, see FDA’s guidance Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002,
Validation Data in Premarket Notification Submissions (510(k)s) for Reprocessed Single-Use
Medical Devices (September 25, 2006).
FDA also recommends that you refer to ANSI/AAMI HA60601-1-11:2011 section 7.5.2,
Additional requirements for professional hygienic maintenance, in the design of medical
devices.

X. Postmarket Considerations
A.

Customer Service

If you already have in place a toll-free technical assistance telephone number, email address,
or Web site address for users regarding questions about use and maintenance of the device, or
if the device is life-supporting or life-sustaining and you have a person available 24 hours a
day to talk with users, it is important to keep these systems in place. Information obtained
through technical assistance is valuable data to be captured for analysis within your quality
system.

B.

Medical Device Reporting

The Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulation11 requires you to submit reports to the
FDA whenever you become aware of information that reasonably suggests that a device you
market may have caused or contributed to a reportable death or serious injury, or has
malfunctioned and the malfunction would be likely to cause or contribute to a reportable
death or serious injury should it recur.
For the FDA Form 3500A, instructions for completing specific items on the form, and the
coding manual see MedWatch: The FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting
Program.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
For additional guidance on the MDR regulation and the reporting requirements refer to
FDA’s guidance Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers (March, 1997). You should
also see FDA’s draft guidance Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers (July 9, 2013).
FDA’s draft guidance represents FDA’s proposed approach on this topic.

XI. Conclusion
By taking into consideration the physical environment, the user, the user interface, including
device design, labeling and instructions for use, and by utilizing human factors, you can
produce devices that suit the home use environment and are thereby more likely to provide
reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for their intended use. By including
descriptions of your efforts to take into account the various factors outlined in this guidance
document in your premarket submissions, you can better assure that your devices meet
applicable safety and effectiveness requirements. Designing your home use device in this
manner should result in a safer and easier-to-use device, minimize use error, and reduce the
likelihood that adverse events will occur—the preferred outcome of a well-designed medical
device.
