On February 2, 2024, FDA published the final rule to amend the Quality System (QS) regulation
in 21 CFR part 820 (89 FR 7496, effective February 2, 2026). The revised 21 CFR part 820 is
now titled the Quality Management System Regulation (QMSR). The QMSR harmonizes quality
management system requirements by incorporating by reference the international standard
specific for medical device quality management systems set by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO), ISO 13485:2016. The FDA has determined that the requirements in ISO
13485 are, when taken in totality, substantially similar to the requirements of the QS regulation,
providing a similar level of assurance in a firm’s quality management system and ability to
consistently manufacture devices that are safe and effective and otherwise in compliance with
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
This guidance document was issued prior to the final rule issued on February 2, 2024. While this
guidance discusses recall procedures and requirements, manufacturers should be aware that the
QMSR includes updated quality management system requirements that may impact recall-related
processes for medical devices or combination products.
FDA encourages manufacturers to review the current QMSR to ensure compliance with the
relevant regulatory requirements.

Guidance for Industry
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) on
this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You
can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.
To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for this guidance as listed on the
title page.

I.

Introduction:

This guidance document is intended to provide guidance and recommendations to FDAregulated industry regarding what information firms should give to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and how they should notify their customers about product recalls. This
guidance is intended to assist those members of industry regulated by the FDA in handling most
aspects of a product recall, as well as some removals and corrections which do not meet the
definition of a recall under 21 CFR 7.3. The guidance includes a checklist of documentation and
information that industry can provide to the FDA that will be used by FDA to evaluate, classify,
monitor and audit product recalls. Various statutory provisions and regulations, described below,
authorize the FDA to require recalls of certain products in particular circumstances. Additionally,
subpart C of part 7 of FDA regulations (21 CFR 7.40-59) provides general guidance for the
voluntary recall of products, including those recalls initiated by a firm on its own and at the
FDA's request. This guidance provides more specific recommendations and applies to voluntary
and, to the extent that the guidance does not conflict with statute or regulation, mandatory recalls
of all FDA-regulated products (i.e., food, including animal food; drugs, including animal drugs;
medical and radiological devices and products; cosmetics; tobacco products; and biological
products.)
Certain statutory provisions authorize mandatory recalls of infant formula (FD&C Act § 412(e)(g) [21 U.S.C. § 350a(e)-(g)]), medical devices (FD&C Act § 518(e) [21 U.S.C. § 360h(e)]),
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
food (FD&C Act § 423 [21 U.S.C. § 350l]), tobacco products (FD&C Act § 908(c) [21 U.S.C. §
387h(c)]), electronic products (FD&C Act § 535 [21 U.S.C. § 360ll]), controlled substances
(FD&C Act § 569D [21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-8d]), and biological products (Public Health Service
Act § 351(d) [42 U.S.C. § 262(d)]). Additionally, FDA regulations set forth specific
requirements for mandatory infant formula recalls (subpart E of 21 CFR part 107), medical
device corrections and removals (21 CFR part 806), mandatory device recalls (21 CFR part 810),
electronic product notifications and corrections (21 CFR parts 1003 and 1004) and mandatory
recalls for human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (subpart F of 21 CFR part
1271). In addition to the requirements in these statutory provisions and regulations, the
guidance's specific recommendations may also be useful for these types of recalls. In the context
of a mandatory recall, those conditions in the guidance that are set forth in a statute and/or
regulation are requirements, rather than recommendations.
The FDA believes that expediting recall activities is vital . Recalling firms are urged to notify the
appropriate FDA Division Recall Coordinator (DRC) or Center contact as soon as a decision is
made that a recall is appropriate and, if feasible, prior to the issuance of a notice to the public or
written communications to customers. To locate your recall coordinator, please check the
following website: https://www.fda.gov/safety/industry-guidance-recalls/ora-recall-coordinators.
After the decision to recall is made, we recommend that you establish communication with a
DRC or Center contact and submit the information outlined in this guidance to your FDA contact
as soon as possible. We also recommend that you submit information as it becomes available to
you rather than waiting until all applicable information is ready. This will allow the FDA the
opportunity to review and comment on your recall strategy and to offer guidance and assistance
in your recall process.
FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the FDA's current thinking on a topic and should be
viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.
The use of the word should in FDA's guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

o

Geographic areas of distribution, including foreign countries.

o

A direct account list (name, address, city, state, contact name, phone number) to
the DRC. At minimum, the list should include the "ship to" addresses. If
available, provide a copy of this list in a sortable electronic spreadsheet format
(e.g., a Microsoft Excel file.) When feasible, you should include other relevant
fields in the spreadsheet that might help facilitate follow-up by FDA (e.g., lot
numbers, shipment dates) You should include any foreign customers and federal
government customers (e.g., USDA agencies, Department of Veterans Affairs,
Department of Defense).


Indicate what the list represents (i.e., all customers who were shipped
recalled product; all customers who were sold recalled product; all
customers who may have been shipped or sold recalled product because it
was sold to them within the applicable time period). Most FDA-regulated
products are subject to regulations that require distribution
recordkeeping. 3 To the fullest extent available or required, as applicable,
you should provide an exact distribution list (not a "may have" list) for the
recalled lot(s).

o

Was product sold under a government contract? If yes, provide the contract

that:
o

"Ship to" customers can retrieve the product from their location.

3

For various requirements related to distribution recordkeeping see, e.g., 21 CFR 211.196 (human and animal
drugs); 21 CFR 820.160 (medical devices); 21 CFR 117.139 (human food) 21 CFR 111.475 (dietary supplements);
21 CFR 106.100(g) (infant formula); 21 CFR 113.100(f) (low acid foods); 21 CFR 114.100(d) (acidified foods); 21
CFR 507.38 (animal food); 21 CFR 226.110 (Type A medicated articles); 21 CFR 225.202 (medicated animal feed);
21 CFR 1270.35(c) (human tissue); 21 CFR 1271.265(e) (human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based
products); and 21 CFR 1.980(k) and 800.55(k) (post administrative detention recordkeeping).

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
o

"Bill to" customers, if responsible, can initiate the sub-recall. 4

10. RECALL STRATEGY. We recommend you provide the following:
o

Indicate the level in the distribution chain to which you are extending the recall.
(e.g., wholesale, retail, pharmacy, or consumer/user, such as patient or physician)


If your recall only extends to the wholesale/distributor level, then we
recommend that you explain your rationale for not recalling to
retail/pharmacy/user level.

o

Indicate the scope of the recall (i.e., which lots are affected). Indicate your
strategy for expanding the scope of the recall should additional lots be shown to
be affected.

o

Indicate the method of recall communication (e.g., mail, phone, facsimile, email). We recommend that you include a written communication so customers
will have a record of the recall and your instructions.

o

When your customers of the recalled lot(s) can be quickly determined with
accuracy and completeness (e.g., via distribution records), we recommend
directing recall communications to only those customers who received the
recalled lots. Although indiscriminately sending the notification to all customers
may be simpler, this practice desensitizes customers to recall notices, many of
whom receive hundreds of inapplicable recall notices per year. If used, indicate
how written communications will be sent to customers (e.g., e-mail, overnight
mail, first class mail, certified mail, facsimile).

o

If initial communication is made by phone, provide a copy of the phone script.

o

If you have a web site, consider posting the recall communication on the web site
as an additional method of customer notification about the recall. (Note: This is
not recommended as a sole means of customer notification.)

o

Provide what you have instructed customers to do with the recalled product.

o

Identify a recall contact for each customer and address recall communications to
those recall contacts to reduce the potential for the communication letter to get
misdirected.

4

Sub-recalls occur when a consignee further distributes a recalled product without changing the product. A subrecall is an action taken by that consignee to notify its own accounts.

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
o

If the product should be returned, refunded, or replaced, explain the mechanics of
such process.

o

If this recall will create a market shortage that may impact consumers, explain the
situation and provide any draft plan to address the shortage.

o

Describe your recall effectiveness check strategy. Include your strategy for how to
track and identify your customers who fail to respond to your recall
communications, and what additional steps you will take to notify non-responsive
customers.

o

Determine and provide your course of action for out-of-business customers of the
recalled product.

o

Provide a proposed method for destroying the recalled product, if applicable.

o

If the product can be reconditioned (brought into compliance with the law),
explain how and where the reconditioning will take place. Please provide details
of the reconditioning plan to your FDA contact before implementation. All
reconditioning must be conducted under any applicable current good
manufacturing practices.


Describe how the recalled (i.e., pre-reconditioned) product will be
segregated and identified so it is not confused with reconditioned product.
Reconditioned product needs to be similarly distinguished from product
subject to recall that has not been reconditioned.

In addition, we recommend that:
o

You contact your FDA DRC prior to product destruction. The FDA will review
your proposed method of destruction and may choose to witness the destruction.

o

You and your customers keep adequate documentation of product destruction
(regardless of whether destruction was witnessed by an FDA investigator).

o

Field corrections (e.g., product relabeling) be performed by recalling firm
representatives, or under their supervision and control. We do not recommend that
a disinterested party such as a wholesaler or retailer be responsible for field
corrections. For drug recalls: misbranded drugs for re-labeling should be returned
to the recalling firm.

o

You contact your DRC prior to releasing reconditioned goods.

III. Recall Notice to Direct Account Consignees
1. For guidance on issuing public warnings, please reference FDA's guidance on Public
Warning and Notification of Recalls Under 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C (issued in
February, 2019
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Safety/Recalls/IndustryGuidance/UCM592851.pdf)
2. GUIDANCE FOR WRITTEN RECALL COMMUNICATIONS TO DIRECT
ACCOUNT CONSIGNEES: Recall communications should be flagged in large bold
print "URGENT: [insert "FOOD," "DRUG," "MEDICAL DEVICE," etc.]
RECALL [or CORRECTION]." If used, envelopes should be similarly flagged. The
terms "market withdrawal" or "stock recovery" should not be used because they have
separate regulatory definitions and do not accurately convey the definition of a recall. 5
The FDA recommends that you include the following information in a written recall
communication to your direct account consignees:
a. PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION:


Include an accurate and complete description of the product and any codes
used to identify the product, e.g., lot/unit numbers, expiration date, serial
numbers, catalog numbers, model numbers, UDI, and UPC codes.



Consider including a copy of the product label with the recall
communication. This could be helpful in identifying and removing the
recalled product.

b. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:


Identify the reason for the recall and any potential health hazard(s)
associated with it. Ensure the statement is clear, directly conveys the risk,
and prompts an urgent response by the reader.

c. DEPTH OF THE RECALL:


The recall communication should clearly identify the depth to which the
recall is to extend (e.g., wholesale, retail, consumer or user level). For
example, if the recall is to the retail level, a statement should read "This
recall should be carried out to the retail level."



If the product could have been further distributed by your direct account
consignees to their customers, then you should include instructions to subrecall. Sub-recall instructions should also include a statement about the
depth of the recall, e.g., "If you have further distributed this product,

5

See 21 CFR 7.3(g), (h), (j), and (k) for the definitions of “recall,” “correction,” “market withdrawal,” and “stock
recovery,” respectively.

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
please identify your customers and notify them at once of this product
recall. This recall should be carried out to the retail level."


If your direct account consignees are instructed to conduct subrecalls, we recommend that you provide them with the date range
that the recalled product was distributed. Wholesalers/ distributors
may need this information to identify customers they shipped/sold
recalled product to.



If applicable, consider providing a sub-recall letter with your
communication package for your direct account consignees to
further notify their sub accounts. This better ensures that the
information provided to sub accounts is accurate and complete.

d. INSTRUCTIONS:




Your recall instructions to your direct account consignees should be clear.
For example:


Remove product from sale



Cease distribution



Sub-recall (if appropriate)



Return or correct product

Include a return response card/form. Your direct account consignees
should be asked to indicate whether they followed every instruction on the
return response card/form. Include a space for the consignee’s signature
and date.

We recommend that you provide examples of all recall communications (including letters,
attachments, envelope) to your DRC.
3. IMPORTANT: All customers in the distribution chain should be notified of the recall,
preferably in writing. Here are some examples of why this is important.
a. In the case of a human drug recall, the FDA does not believe it is appropriate
for a sales representative to visit a doctor's office and remove product without
notifying the physician or responsible staff of the recall. Physicians may be
treating patients that may suffer or have suffered some adverse effect from the
drug subject to recall. With knowledge of the recall and the reason for the recall,
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
the physician can better evaluate a patient's condition and provide appropriate
patient care.
b. In the case of products sold at retail stores, the FDA does not believe it is
appropriate for a product salesperson or broker representative to remove product
from retail shelves without informing store management of the recall. Failure to
inform store management of the recall could result in product that is in storage, in
transit to the store, or returned by customers, being offered for sale at a later time.
The salesperson or broker representative may not have knowledge of or access to
the recalled products stored in back rooms. Recalled products that are in-transit to
the store could inadvertently be sold to customers. Recalled products returned by
customers could inadvertently be placed back on store shelves.

IV. Evaluation of the Recall
1. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RECALL:
You should ensure that your recall is effective. Therefore, we recommend that you consider
effectiveness checks for every recall. The purpose of an effectiveness check is to verify your
recall communication was received by your direct account consignee, and that they understood
and followed the recall instructions. The effectiveness check should also verify your recall
reached the appropriate level in the distribution chain.
Your effectiveness check is a means of evaluating the effectiveness of your recall. If your
effectiveness checks indicate that the recall communication was not received and/or its
instructions were not followed, then you should take steps to make the recall effective. These
steps may involve using alternative means of contacting your customers or sending out a follow
up communication that better identifies the product, better explains the problem and/or provides
better instructions to the consignees.
Note: In addition to reviewing the effectiveness checks conducted by a recalling firm, the FDA
may also contact a percentage of the firm’s customers (a process referred to as audit checks) as a
means of assessing whether the recalling firm and its customers are carrying out the recall. If
FDA's audit checks determine the recall to be ineffective, the recalling firm (or sub recalling firm
if such is the case) will then be requested by FDA to take appropriate actions, such as re-issuing
recall communications.
2. RECALL STATUS REPORTS:
You will be asked to provide Recall Status Reports to your DRC after initiating a recall (usually
on
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
a monthly basis but more frequently when indicated). Your Recall Status Reports should usually
include the following information:
- Dates and method of customer notification
- Number of customers notified
- Number of customers that responded
- Quantity of recalled product returned or otherwise accounted for
- Number of customers that did not respond (FDA may ask for the identity of such customers)
- Estimated time frame for completion of the recall
- Details of your recall effectiveness checks
3. ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM THAT RESULTED IN THE RECALL:
It is important to attempt to establish the root cause of a problem that results in a product recall
so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken. We recommend that you provide the root
cause information to your DRC or appropriate Center contact.
4. CORRECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE ACTIONS TO PREVENT FUTURE
OCCURRENCES OF THE PROBLEM:
We recommend that you explain to the FDA the corrective and preventive actions planned or
underway that will prevent a similar problem from recurring. You should provide this
information to your DRC or appropriate Center contact.
5. TERMINATION OF THE RECALL:
We recommend that you evaluate your recall for termination when all possible customer
responses have been received and it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the recall
has been removed and proper disposition or correction has been made commensurate with the
degree of hazard of the recalled product. A final Recall Status Report and documentation of
recalled product disposition should be provided to your DRC, after which the FDA will consider
formal termination of the recall action. See 21 CFR 7.55 Termination of a recall.
Note: Upon receipt of termination information, the DRC may prepare a recall termination
document for center and/or division management concurrence. When concurrence is obtained,
the FDA division office will notify the recalling firm that the FDA considers the recall
terminated.
