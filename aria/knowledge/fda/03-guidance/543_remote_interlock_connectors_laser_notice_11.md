TO: ALL MANUFACTURERS AND POTENTIAL MANUFACTURERS OF LASER PRODUCTS

SUBJECT: Response to Question Concerning Requirement for Remote Control
Connectors, 21 CFR 1040.10(£) (3)

BACKGROUND AND QUESTION: A company manufactures a laser product which
is operated from a battery or from an AC converter. The manufacturer
desires to know if the connection to the battery or converter box meets
the requirement for a remote control connector since both battery and
converter box are portable and provide a means for quick disconnection.

RESPONSE: A primary electrical power cable connector for connection to
the power line mains, battery, or converter box (if present) does not
satisfy the requirement in the performance standard for a remote control
connector (21 CFR 1040.10(b) (30) and (f£)(3)). The requirement states
that when the terminals of the connector are not electrically joined,
human access to all laser and collateral radiation from the product
..-Shall be prevented. This language implies that human access would be
possible when the terminals are electrically joined (simple connection
between them). Connecting the terminals to the battery or supply mains
cannot be considered as electrically joining in the sense used in the
-standard (21 CFR 1040.10(£)(3)). The connector is to be for the connection
of an optional remote interlock switch or other appropriate control
external to the product. The remote control connector should be a
separate, independent performance feature which 4s readily identifiable
for that purpose.

The connector may be supplied with a shorting plug to complete the
circuit. The plug is left in place when the user does not wish to use

the remote control feature; the connector, however, provides a convenient
means of connection if the use of the remote control feature is desired.
However, for a remote control connector to be considered satisfactory,
the necessary mating plug for connecting the optional remote interlock
switch or other appropriate control should be available commercially.
