Dental Impression Materials –
Performance Criteria for Safety and
Performance Based Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for dental impression materials in support of the
Safety and Performance Based Pathway. Under this framework, submitters (you) planning to
submit a 510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for dental impression
materials will have the option to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to
support substantial equivalence, rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject
device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized consensus standard(s) referenced in this
document, see the FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. If submitting a Declaration
of Conformity to a recognized standard, we recommend you include the appropriate supporting
documentation. For more information regarding use of consensus standards in regulatory
submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled “Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus
Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.”
This guidance is being implemented without prior public comment because FDA has determined
that prior public participation for this guidance is not feasible or appropriate (see section
701(h)(1)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and 21 CFR
10.115(g)(2)). FDA has determined that this guidance document presents a less burdensome
policy that is consistent with public health. This guidance document is being implemented
immediately, but it remains subject to comment in accordance with the Agency’s good guidance
practices.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Background
In September 2019, FDA issued a guidance to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter could
demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device. In order to identify the specific set of
performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s comparison to an appropriate predicate
for a given device-type, FDA has determined that the performance criteria represent performance
that meets the performance of one or more existing, legally marketed devices of that device type.
Specifically, FDA relied on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature,
and analyses of data available to FDA on legally marketed dental impression materials to
determine the performance criteria and associated testing methods that could support a finding of
substantial equivalence for dental impression materials as described in this guidance. FDA
recognizes that in some cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing
against an appropriate predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of
performance and technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate
performance criteria established by FDA. Accordingly, we concluded that the optional devicespecific Safety and Performance Based Pathway utilizing the performance criteria identified in
this guidance provides a less burdensome policy consistent with the public health.

III. Scope/Device Description
The devices that are the subject of this guidance are dental impression materials intended to
provide models for study and for production of restorative prosthetic devices, such as gold inlays
and dentures. These devices are Class II and are regulated under 21 CFR 872.3660, with the
product code ELW.
The following are outside the scope of this guidance:
· Optical impression systems for CAD/CAM under 21 CFR 872.3661 (product code KZN,
NOF, QJK)
· Resin impression tray material under 21 CFR 872.3670 (product code EBH)
· Preformed impression tray under 21 CFR 872.6880 (product code EHY)
· Impression tube under 21 CFR 872.6570 (product code KCQ)
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The devices that fall within the scope of this guidance document are dental impression materials
such as alginate or polysulfide intended to be placed on a preformed impression tray and used to
reproduce the structure of a patient's teeth and gums. Dental impression materials are intended to

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
provide models for study and for production of restorative prosthetic devices, such as gold inlays
and dentures. These devices are for prescription use only.
Device Design Characteristics:
The following types of dental impression materials are within the scope of this guidance and are
defined in the FDA-recognized version of ISO 4823 Dentistry - Elastomeric impression and bite
registration materials:
— Type 0: putty consistency;
— Type 1: heavy-bodied consistency;
— Type 2: medium-bodied consistency;
— Type 3: light-bodied consistency; and
— Type B: bite registration materials.
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to make a determination regarding eligibility into the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage you to submit a Pre-Submission to engage in discussion with
FDA prior to submission of the 510(k) as described in FDA guidance Requests for Feedback and
Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program.

IV. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, we do not expect you to provide direct comparison testing
against a legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DOC)1) recommended below for each test or
evaluation. Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions
under the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary. Unless otherwise identified in the sections below, test information
such as results summary, test protocols, and complete test reports should be submitted as part of
the 510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway. For
additional information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please
see FDA’s guidance Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench Performance
Testing Information in Premarket Submissions.

When you provide a DOC you are certifying that you are in conformance with that standard as defined in the
guidance Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices.

Biocompatibility Evaluation

7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of FDA’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, referred to in the rest of this document as the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
surface devices in contact with mucosal membrane with a limited contact duration of ≤24 hours
and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance.
· Cytotoxicity
· Sensitization
· Oral Mucosa Irritation
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry or in manufacturing processes are not
expected to impact the biological response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially
equivalent biocompatibility, if documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the FDA
Biocompatibility Guidance is also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below. As described in the FDA guidance Safety
and Performance Based Pathway, if a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria
identified by FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate
for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway program; however, the previously established
510(k) programs in which direct performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are
conducted, including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated 510(k)s, remain available.

ISO 10993-1 Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and
testing within a risk management process
ISO 7405 Dentistry – Evaluation of biocompatibility of medical devices used in
dentistry (this standard is an application of ISO 10993-1 to dental devices)

Performance Criteria: All direct tissue contacting components of the device and devicespecific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological response.
Performance Criteria Source: The FDA Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of

toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the FDA Biocompatibility Guidance.
For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device control
samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform as
expected.
