SUBJECT: Emitted Laser Beam as Emission Indicator for
Class II and Class IIIa Laser Products.

BACKGROUND :

The Federal Performance Standard for Laser Products requires, (21 CFR
1040.10(f) (5) (i)), that Class II and Class IIIa laser systems incorporate
an emission indicator that provides a visible or audible signal during
emission of accessible laser radiation in excess of the accessible emission
limits of Class I. Paragraph 1040.10(f£) (5) (iv) requires that any visible
signal used as an emission indicator be clearly visible through protective
eyewear designated specifically for the wavelength (s) . -

It is often necessary for the operator to observe the emitted beams of
certain types of visible laser products in order for the products to
perform their intended functions, i.e. to observe the path of the beam when
the product is used for leveling, pointing or aiming. It is also believed
to be very unlikely that laser safety eyewear would be used in conjunction
with Class II or Class IIIa laser products.

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has made known that
it intends to propose amendments to the standard under which neither beam
attenuators nor emission indicators would be required for laser systems
that are now classified in Class II or Class IIfa. This proposal would
bring the CDRH standard into agreement with the standards of the
International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 825-1:1994, and the American
National Standards Institute, ANSI Z136.1:1993, on this requirement. The
administration of these requirements has been 'a burden to the industry and
to the CDRH from which..little or no significant protection of the public
safety results. ae .

POLICY:

The CDRH will not object to the use of the emitted laser beam as the
indication of emission of visible laser radiation from Class II and
Class IIIa laser products.
