This guidance was written prior to the February 27, 1997 implementation of FDA’s
Good Guidance Practices, GGP’s. It does not create or confer rights for or on any person
and does not operate to bind FDA or the public. An alternative approach may be used if

such approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable statute, regulations, or both.
This guidance will be updated in the next revision to include the standard elements of GGP’s.

Guidé'for OXYGEN CONSERVING DEVICE 510(k) Review

73 BZD 868.5905 Non—continuous Ventilator Class: II

I. DEVICE SPECIFICATIONS

A.

Use

1.

The labeling should include a statement and description of the
types of oxygen sources to be used with the oxygen conserving
device (i.e., hospital wall source oxygen, USP bottled oxygen, and
oxygen produced by an oxygen concentration device).

Prior 510(k)’s have established that the device can be used with
an oxygen source for a patient who requires supplemental oxygen
for disease states such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) or Emphysema. Should be used only when nasal oxygen
cannula is prescribed.

Specification Criteria

i.

What are the electrical power source requirements of the device?
Does the device operate on wall socket AC only? Is there a
battery back-up in case of power failure?

What is the maximum pressure that the oxygen source can deliver to
the conserving device for functionality? Is the upper limit for
pressure specified (i.e., Can be used with oxygen supplies that
output up to 25 psi)?

What type of valve is used to restrict the flow of oxygen during
the expiratory portion of the respiratory cycle? Is the valve
normally open or normally closed in the resting position? In case
of a device failure of any type, will the valve permit or restrict
the flow of oxygen to the patient?

Does the Oxygen Conserver have any effect on the normal flow rate
from the oxygen source to the patient in the valve open condition?

Can the conserver be used with oxygen supply sources that deliver
varying flow rates, i.e., in the range of 0.5 to 10 lpm?

Does the device contain safeguards against electrical spark
generation (i.e., reverse bias diode to restrict current flow
after valve solenoid opening or closing or other method)? Will
the safeguard protect against ignition of the enhanced oxygen
environment? Does the device contain moving metal parts? Are
there safeguards against spark generation for these parts?

7. Is the device solid-state controlled and hard wired or does the
device contain a microprocessor? Does the microprocessor
controlled device conform to the moderate software concern
guidance document?

8. Is the sensitivity of the inspiratory effort well outlined and
sensitive enough to give an accurate account of inspiration?
(approximately 1 cm H,0 negative pressure).

C. Alarms

1. Does the device contain a power failure or low battery alarm?

2. Does the device utilize a flow failure alarm?

3. If the device is software controlled, is there an alarm package
for microprocessor failure? Is the design fail-safe; Is there an
alarm alarm?

II. LABELING

1. Oxygen conserving devices are prescription devices and must be
labeled in conformance to 21 CFR Section 801.109. Both the device
and its labeling will bear the prescription legend.

2. Does the device contain the standard warning labels for any device
associated with an increased oxygen concentration above 21%?

3. Does the device provide an accurate and complete description of

the device and its output parameters?
