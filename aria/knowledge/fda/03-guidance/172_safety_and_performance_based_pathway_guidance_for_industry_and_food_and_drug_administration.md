Safety and Performance Based
Pathway
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides FDA’s current thinking on expanding the concept of the Abbreviated
510(k) Program for demonstrating substantial equivalence for premarket notification (510(k))
submissions. The intent of the guidance is to describe an optional pathway – the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway – for certain, well understood device types, where a submitter
would demonstrate that a new device meets FDA-identified performance criteria to demonstrate
that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Background
For the purposes of determining substantial equivalence, section 513(i)(1)(A) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) provides that:
[W]ith respect to a device being compared to a predicate device, that device has the same
intended use as the predicate device and that the Secretary by order has found that the
device –
(i) has the same technological characteristics as the predicate device, or
(ii) –

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
(I) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted that
the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device contains information,
including appropriate clinical or scientific data if deemed necessary by the
Secretary or a person accredited under section 523, that demonstrates that the
device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and
(II) does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the
predicate device.
Through guidance, FDA has explained and clarified how it makes substantial equivalence
decisions.1 As described in that guidance, the 510(k) program has undergone a number of
statutory changes since its inception and FDA has adapted its implementation of the program in
response to changing statutory requirements and the evolving medical device landscape. For
example, FDA established alternative programs for demonstrating substantial equivalence: The
Special 510(k) and the Abbreviated 510(k). The Abbreviated 510(k) submission program relies
on the use of guidance documents, special controls, and FDA-recognized consensus standards to
facilitate 510(k) review.2 The current 510(k) program reflects the current statutory framework
and FDA’s implementation of that framework through regulation, guidance, and administrative
practice.
Congress has also amended the FD&C Act to add what are known as the “least burdensome”
provisions for medical devices,3 some of which are specific to the 510(k) process.4 Their general
purpose is to ensure FDA requests the minimum information necessary to adequately address a
regulatory question or issue through the most efficient manner at the right time. 5
This guidance focuses on the decision point of the substantial equivalence analysis that requires a
510(k) submitter to demonstrate that, despite technological differences, its device is as safe and
effective as a legally marketed device. FDA recognizes that, in some cases, demonstrating this
through direct comparison testing may create greater burdens for 510(k) submitters than applying
an alternative approach, such as the approach described in this guidance, if appropriate. For
example, in some cases, it may be more burdensome for a submitter to conduct testing against an
appropriate predicate device to demonstrate equivalence for the necessary set of performance and
technological characteristics than to demonstrate their device meets appropriate performance
criteria established by FDA. Therefore, consistent with FDA’s mandate in section 513(i)(1)(D)

of the FD&C Act to consider the least burdensome means of demonstrating substantial
equivalence, this guidance expands the concept of the Abbreviated 510(k) Program by
explaining how substantial equivalence for certain device types may be demonstrated in a way
that is less burdensome, but at least as robust. Use of this expanded program may also make the
review of 510(k) submissions more efficient, thereby reducing burdens on the Agency and
possibly review times for individual submissions. At the same time, this approach satisfies the
statutory standard for demonstrating substantial equivalence.

III. Policy
Under section 513(i)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, substantial equivalence is rooted in comparisons
between new devices and predicate devices. However, the FD&C Act does not preclude FDA
from using performance criteria to facilitate this comparison. If a legally marketed device
performs at certain levels relevant to its safety and effectiveness, and a new device meets those
levels of performance for the same characteristics, FDA could find that the new device is as safe
and effective as the legally marketed device. Instead of reviewing data from direct comparison
testing between the two devices, FDA could support a finding of substantial equivalence based
on data showing the new device meets the level of performance of appropriate predicate
device(s). Under the approach expanded in this guidance, a submitter could satisfy the
requirement to compare its device with a legally marketed device6 by, among other things,
demonstrating that the device’s performance meets established performance criteria.
Performance expectations may be described in FDA guidance, FDA-recognized consensus
standards,7 and/or special controls.8 In some cases, these performance criteria may be explicitly
defined, while in others, the acceptable outcomes may be described qualitatively, such as for
biocompatibility. Device types that are eligible for third party review in addition to being
appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway (see Section III.A) would remain
eligible for the 510(k) Third Party Review Program.9
In order to identify the specific set of performance criteria appropriate to satisfy a submitter’s
comparison to an appropriate predicate for a given device-type, FDA would ensure that those
performance criteria represent performance that meets the performance of one or more existing,
legally marketed devices of that device type. Thus, by demonstrating that a new device meets the
identified performance criteria, a submitter could demonstrate that the new device is at least as
safe and effective, as a legally marketed device, in accordance with sections 513(i)(1)(A)(ii)(I)
6

See 21 CFR 807.87(f).
A submitter may base a Declaration of Conformity on testing and analysis performed in-house or on testing
performed by a third party, such as a testing laboratory or certification body. See FDA Guidance “Appropriate Use
of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical Devices,” available at
https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/appropriate-use-voluntary-consensusstandards-premarket-submissions-medical-devices.
8
A device must comply with any applicable special controls regardless of which 510(k) pathway is used (see section
513(a)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act), but there may be instances where conformance to special controls, FDA-recognized
standards, and/or FDA-established criteria would also be sufficient to demonstrate a device is as safe and effective
as a legally marketed device.
9
The 510(k) Third Party Review Program is described at the following Web Site: https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/premarket-submissions/510k-third-party-review-program. The list of devices eligible for Third Party
Review is available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfThirdParty/current.cfm#4.

and 513(i)(1)(D) of the FD&C Act. Note that direct comparison of a new device with a legally
marketed device would remain available under a Traditional or Special 510(k) pathway, as
appropriate, including for those devices also eligible for the 510(k) Third Party Review Program.
The policy in this guidance is an expansion of the approach FDA has long applied through the
Abbreviated 510(k) Program. When submitting an Abbreviated 510(k), a submitter uses
conformity to FDA-recognized consensus standards, FDA guidance, and/or special controls to
demonstrate some of the performance characteristics necessary to support a finding of substantial
equivalence. In the optional program described here, the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, a submitter would use robust versions of those same mechanisms, which contain all the
performance characteristics necessary to support a finding of substantial equivalence for a device
type, rather than using direct predicate comparison testing to support a finding of substantial
equivalence for some of the performance characteristics.
FDA believes that use of performance criteria is only appropriate when FDA has determined that
(1) the new device has indications for use and technological characteristics that do not raise
different questions of safety and effectiveness than the identified predicate, (2) the performance
criteria align with the performance of one or more legally marketed devices of the same type as
the new device, and (3) the new device meets all the performance criteria. Although FDA may
recommend test methodology for the performance criteria, a submitter may choose to use an
appropriate testing methodology other than what is specified or recommended to demonstrate the
performance characteristics. (See Section III.C for discussion on FDA review of protocols and
underlying data in such circumstances.) All performance criteria for use of the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway will be publicized through FDA guidance developed for purposes
of this program, which may reference FDA-recognized consensus standards, FDA guidance, and
special controls. If a device cannot rely entirely on performance criteria identified by FDA to
demonstrate substantial equivalence for its submission, it is not appropriate for this program;
however, we emphasize that the previously established 510(k) programs in which direct
performance comparisons against appropriate predicates are conducted, including Traditional,
Special, and Abbreviated 510(k)s, remain available to submitters.

A. Devices Appropriate for the Safety and Performance
Based Pathway: Intended use and technological characteristics
FDA plans to provide information about the types of devices to which the performance criteria
would apply in the guidance establishing the performance criteria. Such information may include
the relevant product code(s), appropriate intended uses, and appropriate indications for use. FDA
also intends to maintain a list of device types appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway on the FDA website (see Section III.B. for additional information). In addition, in
individual submissions for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA will continue to
require the identification of predicate device(s) for the intended use and technological
characteristics decision points of the substantial equivalence analysis. Clarifying the set of
devices for which the performance criteria are appropriate in guidance and having submitters
identify a predicate of the same device type will help ensure that a new device that utilizes this
program has (1) the same intended use as and (2) technological characteristics that do not raise
different questions of safety and effectiveness from the predicate device.
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

If you have questions about whether your new device is within a type identified by FDA as
appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, specifically (1) whether your new
device is within the scope of devices to which the FDA-identified performance criteria are
intended to apply or (2) whether its indications for use or technological characteristics raise
different questions of safety and effectiveness than a predicate device, we recommend that you
seek feedback from the appropriate Office or Division on the appropriateness of using the
performance criteria. FDA believes that it will typically be able to make these determinations
without reviewing data, as long as the device clearly falls within the types FDA has identified as
appropriate for utilizing this program. However, where FDA determines that additional data are
necessary to make these determinations, the Agency may, on a case-by-case basis, review that
data before determining whether or not the device is appropriate for this Safety and Performance
Based Pathway.

B.

Identification of performance criteria

FDA intends to maintain a list of device types appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway on the FDA website for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,10 accompanied by
the guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each device type, as well as the
testing methods recommended in the guidances where feasible, and any other relevant
information. These guidance documents may reference consensus standards, or portions of
consensus standards, recognized by FDA under section 514 of the FD&C Act, as well as special
controls established for that device type and relevant FDA guidance. Performance criteria in
FDA-recognized consensus standards that have not been identified in FDA guidance for use in
the Safety and Performance Based Pathway should not be used in this program. When selecting
from established performance criteria and test methodology in standards or guidance and when
establishing new performance criteria and test methodology through guidance, FDA intends to
rely on the experience and expertise of FDA staff, information in literature, and analyses of data
available to FDA on existing devices within a device type to determine the performance criteria
and associated testing methods that could support a finding of substantial equivalence for a given
device type. FDA will ensure that these criteria represent performance levels that are at least
equivalent to the performance of legally marketed devices of the type to which they apply.
However, because it is FDA’s responsibility to determine whether a new device reviewed under
the 510(k) program is substantially equivalent, the final determination will be FDA’s. We
reemphasize that the previously established 510(k) programs in which direct performance
comparisons against predicates are conducted, including Traditional, Special, and Abbreviated
510(k)s, remain available to submitters, as appropriate.

C.

FDA review of data

The amount and type of information necessary to support a finding of substantial equivalence
under the Safety and Performance Based Pathway are summarized in Table 1. To support an
FDA finding of substantial equivalence through this program, FDA expects a submitter to
demonstrate that the new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria by submitting a
10

Available at https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/premarket-notification-510k/framework-safety-andperformance-based-pathway
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Declaration of Conformity to an FDA-recognized consensus standard,11 testing protocols, a
results summary, and/or underlying data (i.e., complete test report), as appropriate. When the
performance criteria and testing methodologies are in an FDA-recognized standard (identified in
the relevant FDA guidance) and the submitter uses the specified methods to establish that its new
device meets the performance criteria, a Declaration of Conformity should be sufficient to
support a finding of substantial equivalence, unless noted otherwise in the relevant Safety and
Performance Based Pathway guidance. When FDA establishes performance criteria and
recommends or specifies the use of testing methodologies from an FDA-recognized standard,
submitters using the recommended or specified testing methodologies should provide a results
summary demonstrating that the FDA-identified performance criteria have been met in addition
to a Declaration of Conformity. When FDA establishes performance criteria and recommends or
specifies testing methodologies that are not in existing FDA-recognized consensus standards, and
the submitter uses such methods, the submitter should also submit a testing protocol describing
the test methodology and a results summary demonstrating that the FDA-identified performance
criteria have been met. When no testing methodology is specified or recommended, or when a
submitter chooses to use a testing methodology other than the methodology specified or
recommended, submitters should submit a complete test report to FDA.
Consistent with FDA policy for all 510(k) submissions, for all 510(k) submissions under the
Safety and Performance Based Pathway, FDA may request and review underlying data
demonstrating that a new device meets the FDA-identified performance criteria and testing
methodology, as necessary.
If data provided by the submitter do not show that the new device meets the performance criteria
FDA has identified for the device type, FDA would not be able to find that the new device is
substantially equivalent through this program. As previously mentioned, submitters could still
use other available 510(k) programs to demonstrate substantial equivalence.

Modifications to the list

As discussed above, FDA intends to maintain a list of device types appropriate for the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway on the FDA website, accompanied by the guidances that identify
the performance criteria and testing methods recommended for each device type, and any other
relevant information. FDA intends to revise the list of appropriate device types on our website
with additional device types and may revise the corresponding performance criteria and testing
methodology in guidance over time as appropriate and in accordance with FDA’s Good
Guidance Practices (21 CFR 10.115). FDA intends to periodically review the applicable criteria
and guidances in order to ensure they remain appropriate to the device type. FDA may modify or
12

This refers to FDA-recognized consensus standards indicated in the relevant Safety and Performance Based
Pathway guidance for use for a particular device type. As stated in section III.B., performance criteria in FDArecognized consensus standards that have not been identified in FDA guidance for use in the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway should not be used in this program.

remove an entry from the list, particularly where new information indicates that the performance
criteria in the identified guidance do not fully support a substantial equivalence determination. In
such a case, we intend to either remove that device type from the list or note on the list that
additional testing may be necessary while the underlying source(s) of the performance criteria
are updated. Changes to the list, i.e., when a device type is removed from the list or an updated
final guidance is issued, would apply prospectively to devices for which a 510(k) has not yet
been submitted. The clearance for devices that have been cleared via the Safety and Performance
Based Pathway prior to the removal of a device type from the list of appropriate device types
would not be affected by the change to the list. Such devices may be subject to other action, as
appropriate, to address the reason for the modification or removal from the list, for example, if
there was a safety concern.

Appendix. Submission Recommendations for a 510(k) in the
Safety and Performance Based Pathway
Safety and Performance Based 510(k)s must comply with the content requirements for premarket
notifications submitted in support of substantial equivalence decisions at 21 CFR 807.87. This
appendix provides recommendations on how to apply the recommendations in the general 510(k)
Format Guidance to the format and content of a Safety and Performance Based 510(k) that uses
the approach described in this guidance. These recommendations are also intended to ensure that
the elements recommended in FDA’s guidance “Refuse to Accept Policy for 510(k)s” (RTA
Policy Guidance)17 are appropriately included in your submission.
Consistent with the RTA Policy Guidance, we recommend that you include the section headings
listed, preferably in the sequence outlined below, when submitting a Safety and Performance
Based 510(k) in accordance with this guidance. In some instances, the information in a particular
section may not apply to your device. To assist review staff, we recommend you retain the
section headings in the sequence listed. If you believe a section does not apply, we recommend
you include the section and state “This section does not apply” or “N/A” under that heading with
a rationale for why the section does not apply. For example, if your device does not contain any
software, we recommend you state, “This section is not applicable because the subject device
does not contain software” in Section 16 titled “Software.”

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
The RTA Policy Guidance provides recommendations for each of these sections. In addition, we
recommend the following for sections 9, 12, and 13-20:
9. Declarations of Conformity and Summary Reports
To demonstrate your device meets the relevant performance criteria, you should include,
depending on the circumstances described in Section III.C.:
·
·
·
·

A declaration of conformity to the standard;18
results summary or a summary report if recommended in any relevant device-specific
guidance;
testing protocols; and/or
complete test report demonstrating that the new device meets the FDA-identified
performance criteria.

Which of these approaches is appropriate will depend on the underlying source for the
performance criteria and testing methods, including whether they are contained in an FDArecognized standard identified in the relevant Safety and Performance Based Pathway guidance
or established or recommended/specified by FDA in such guidance (See Table 1).
12. Substantial Equivalence Discussion
In the substantial equivalence section, we continue to recommend that you identify the predicate
by providing its trade name, model number, name of the 510(k) submitter/holder, and 510(k)
number, if available.
We recommend that you provide a comparison between your device and the predicate in terms of
indications for use and technology.
If you choose to use the Safety and Performance Based Pathway, we do not expect you to
provide direct comparison testing against a legally marketed device for performance
specifications. Any testing you conduct in accordance with standards or guidance should be as
described in sections 9, 12, and 13-20, as applicable.
13 - 20. Proposed Labeling, Sterilization and Shelf Life, Biocompatibility, Software,
Electromagnetic Compatibility and Electrical Safety, and Performance Testing – Bench,
Animal, and Clinical, as applicable
We continue to recommend that submitters of 510(k)s through the Safety and Performance
Based Pathway provide the information as you would in a traditional 510(k) for the sections on
Proposed Labeling, Sterilization and Shelf Life, Biocompatibility, Software, Electromagnetic
Compatibility and Electrical Safety, and Performance Testing, except that FDA would not expect
your information to describe direct comparison testing against the predicate device. Instead, FDA
