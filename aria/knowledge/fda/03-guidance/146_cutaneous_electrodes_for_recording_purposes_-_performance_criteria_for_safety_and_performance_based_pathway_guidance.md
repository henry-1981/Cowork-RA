Cutaneous Electrodes for Recording
Purposes – Performance Criteria for
Safety and Performance Based
Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for cutaneous electrodes in support of the Safety
and Performance Based Pathway. 1 Under this framework, submitters planning to submit a 510(k)
using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for cutaneous electrodes for recording
purposes will have the option to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to
support substantial equivalence, rather than a direct comparison of the performance of the subject
device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 2 For more information regarding use of
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices. 3
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are

cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope/Device Description
The cutaneous electrodes that are the subject of this guidance are non-invasive, single use
electrodes intended to be used on normal, healthy, clean, intact skin for recording purposes.
These devices are Class II and are regulated under 21 CFR 882.1320, with the product code
GXY (Electrode, Cutaneous).
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
The cutaneous electrodes that fall within the scope of this guidance document are intended for
non-invasive recording purposes only. These devices are intended to be applied directly to a
patient’s skin to record physiological signals (e.g., electroencephalogram, electromyography).
These electrodes should be applied only to normal, intact, clean, and healthy skin with an
electroconductive media.
Cutaneous electrodes with the following intended uses are not eligible for the Safety and
Performance Based Pathway via this guidance:
• To deliver stimulation
• For use in an MR environment
• For an intended use regulated by a different regulation (e.g., 21 CFR 870.2360, 21 CFR
878.4400)
• To be reused (i.e., not single use)
• Dry electrodes (i.e., no electroconductive media is used)
Device Design Characteristics:
The cutaneous electrodes that fall within the scope of this guidance document are designed for
non-invasive use on intact skin. A cutaneous electrode may incorporate electroconductive media
(e.g., pre-gelled). If the cutaneous electrode does not incorporate electroconductive media in its
design, the cutaneous electrode should successfully meet the Testing Performance Criteria
(described in this guidance) with the legally marketed electroconductive media (21 CFR
882.1275) intended to be used with electrode. The electrode should be used with
electroconductive media. Please note that this guidance document’s scope does not cover
electroconductive media devices (21 CFR 882.1275). Additionally, this guidance document does
not include needle electrodes (21 CFR 882.1350).
The electrode design (e.g., size, shape, type) should be commensurate to the site of application
and the intended use, as these attributes may affect the safety and effectiveness of the recording.
Additionally, the size and spacing of the electrodes should be appropriate for the indicated
patient population (e.g., children, adults).
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Pathway, we would encourage sponsors to submit a Pre-Submission 4 to engage in discussion
with FDA prior to submission of the 510(k).

III. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, you do not need to provide direct comparison testing against a
legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g., Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) identified for each test or evaluation below.
Unless otherwise identified in the submission information sections below, test information such
as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should be submitted as part of the
510(k) as described in FDA’s guidance Safety and Performance Based Pathway. 5 For additional
information regarding the submission of non-clinical bench testing information, please see

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
any connector in a cable or electrode lead wire having a conductive connection to a
patient shall be constructed in such a manner as to comply with subclause 56.3(c) of the
following standard: International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 601-1 Medical
Electrical Equipment Part 1 – General requirements for safety (1988, amendment No.1,
1991, amendment No. 2, 1995). However, FDA believes conformance to applicable
subclauses in the currently FDA-recognized version of the ES 60601-1 Medical
Electrical Equipment Part 1 – General requirements for basic safety and essential
performance (2005, MOD) standard would provide the same level of protection of the
public health and safety from unintended electrical shock as the FDA performance
standard in 21 CFR 898.12, and that conformity to this currently FDA-recognized
standard would be sufficient to meet the performance standard in 21 CFR
898.12. Therefore, firms may submit a DoC to this currently FDA-recognized standard. 7
Submission Information: DoC
Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of CDRH’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, 8 referred to in the rest of this document as the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
“Surface Devices” with intact skin contact, and you should assess the endpoints below per
Attachment A of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance.
• Cytotoxicity
• Sensitization
• Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if
documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below and require submission of a Traditional,
Special, or Abbreviated 510(k).

8.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance. For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device
control samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform
as expected, as specified above for the subject device samples.
Submission Information: Refer to CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
