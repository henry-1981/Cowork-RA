previously revised on 02/1995.

This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on this topic. It
does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind FDA or the
public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the
telephone number listed on the title page of this guidance.
I. Introduction:
This CPG provides guidance to FDA staff on the submission of regulatory action recommendations for
self-hypnotic tape recordings which are misbranded because of false or misleading medical claims in the
accompanying promotional literature, and the lack of adequate directions for lay use on these
prescription devices.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidance describes the Agency's current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only as
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of the word
should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or recommended, but not required.
II. Background:
FDA has both seized self-hypnotic tape recordings and issued regulatory letters to manufacturers
concerning such recordings because the intended use of the tapes (gathered from both the tapes and
their labeling) made them devices within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act's definition of a
device. The Center's position is that the tapes are misbranded because of false or misleading medical
claims in the accompanying promotional literature. Furthermore, the center *affirms* that these tapes
are prescription devices and adequate directions for lay use cannot be written for these devices.

Hypnotherapy is a recognized medical modality useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Tape
recordings used in conjunction with hypnotherapy which are intended for use in the mitigation,
treatment, and cure of disease and other medical conditions are "devices" as that term is defined in
Section 201(h) of the act.
Tape recordings labeled only for behavior modification, self-improvement, habit correction, learning
techniques, and simple relaxation are not considered to be devices unless they are also labeled for
medical or therapeutic use.
III. Policy:
The Agency will not object to the distribution of tape recordings provided the labeling and the text of
the recordings do not contain claims for specific disease conditions or therapeutic use. The intended use
of the tape recordings as medical devices can be established from the labeling and statements made in
the tapes themselves that the tapes have therapeutic and medical usefulness.
Tape recordings, the labeling and text of which claim that the tapes are effective as a form of
hypnotherapy (including self-hypnosis) and are intended for use in the mitigation, treatment or cure of a
specific disease or medical condition, will be regarded as misbranded devices when sold for lay use.
Examples of objectionable claims for lay use are listed below:
Acne and skin problems Birth Control of Allergies Emotional health Enuresis Hair loss Hearing Loss High
blood pressure Hyperactive children *or Adults* Improving vision Insomnia Menstrual Control Migraine
headaches Pain Control Psychic healing Wart Removal
IV. Regulatory Action Guidance:
Refer to Compliance Policy Guide *120.500*, Health Fraud - Factors in Considering Regulatory Action.
Please Note: The Health Fraud definition includes the "... promotion, advertisement, distribution or sale
of articles, intended for human or animal use ...") for guidance. The appropriate division within the
Office of Medical Device and Radiological Health Operations (OMDRHO) program should consider
submitting a recommendation for misbranding to the *Center for Devices and Radiological Health
(CDRH), Office of Compliance* when tapes with such claims are offered for lay use.
V. Specimen Charges:
The appropriate charges are 502(a), in that the labeling is false or misleading because the articles are
not effective for such use and 502(f)(1) in that the articles fail to bear adequate directions for use since
adequate directions for use cannot be written for use by laymen of the articles for the purposes for
which the devices are intended and they are not exempt from the requirements of section 502(f)(1) of
the act and 21 CFR 801.109.
For Rx use, appropriate division within OMDRHO should contact the CDRH, Office of Compliance for
guidance before submitting a recommendation.
