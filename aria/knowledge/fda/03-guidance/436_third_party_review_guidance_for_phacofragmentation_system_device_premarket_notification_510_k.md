I. INTRODUCTION
A. Guidance Introduction and Purpose
This document reflects the current review guidance for the Phacofragmentation
System device. It is based on 1) current scientific knowledge, 2) clinical
experience, 3) previous submissions by manufacturers to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and 4) the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, the
Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 as amended, and FDA regulations in the Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR). Following advances in science and medicine, and
any new amendments by the Congress to the device acts, these review criteria will
be reevaluated and revised as necessary.
This document is an adjunct to the CFR and other FDA Guidance documents for
the preparation and review of 510(k) submissions. It does not supersede those
publications, but provides additional clarification on what is necessary before
the FDA can clear a device for marketing. The submission must provide evidence
(21 CFR 807.92 (a)(3)) that the device is SUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT to
a device legally marketed in the United States. In some cases, the performance of
the device can be established by comparison of the device to a standardized
reference method, in addition to the comparison to a legally marketed device.
The primary reference for the information required in a premarket notification
(510(k)) for a device is found in 21 CFR 807.87. Substantial equivalence to a
legally marketed device is to be established with respect to, but not limited to,
intended use, design, energy used/delivered, materials, performance, safety,
effectiveness, labeling, and other applicable characteristics.
B. Product Introduction
The Phacofragmentation System device is described in the FDA regulation, 21
CFR 886.4670 (a) as "an AC powered device with a fragmenting needle intended
for use in cataract surgery to disrupt a cataract with ultrasound and extract
the cataract".
C. Regulatory Background
The invention and use of the Phacofragmentation System Device for cataract
removal in 1967 by Charles Kelman, M.D. predates the May 28, 1976 effective
date of the Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
FDA has classified this generic type of device as a Class II medical device
and regulates it under the provisions of Subchapter H, Part 807, Subpart E of
the Medical Device Regulations. This provision is known as "Premarket

Page 4
Notification Procedures" and is more commonly referred to as "510(k)". The
latter refers to that part of the Medical Device Amendments legislation which
pertains to devices which have been in commercial distribution prior to the
inception of the Medical Device Regulations.
II. DESCRIPTION OF DEVICE
The invention of the Phacofragmentation System device provided an alternative in
the surgical technique employed for cataract removal. The device allows for the
use of a small incision on the order of 3.0 millimeters or less which helps to
eliminate many of the wound healing complications associated with other surgical
methods of cataract removal requiring larger size incisions. The small dimension
incision has been reported in the medical literature to provide for rapid healing and
visual recovery by patients. The terms used to describe this device,
"phacofragmentation and phacoemulsification", are employed interchangeably to
describe a process which consists of the application of ultrasonic energy combined
with the mechanical action of the vibrating tip applicator (phaco tip) to the
cataractous lens of the eye. The lens undergoes fragmentation and emulsification
and is rapidly removed from the eye by aspiration.
The Phacofragmentation System device is complex in terms of its engineering
design. The system includes: the console for controlling the functions and for
powering the device; an irrigation line and system for supply of irrigating solution
to the operative site; an aspiration line and system for removing the fragmented
lens, which also removes solution from the operative site; and, the
phacofragmentation handpiece for fragmenting and emulsifying the cataractous
lens. The console may contain microprocessor control of the functions, fluidic
connections, disposable fluid aspiration drainage cassettes, automated irrigation
functions, remote control functions and other features. Although complex, the
phacofragmentation system provides the following basic functions:
(1) Phacofragmentation of the cataractous lens - This is accomplished by the
action of the phaco tip, a hollow needle located centrally in the device
handpiece. The phaco tip is piezoelectronically oscillated longitudinally at
an ultrasonic frequency of about 40,000 hertz. When the device is used in the
phacofragmentation mode both irrigation and aspiration occur simultaneously.
The irrigating solution enters the eye via a collinear axial lumen, which encircles
the phaco tip. The irrigation flow rate is adjustable and pressure limited to
25.0 millimeters of mercury. The fragmentation process is the result of
combined mechanical and ultrasonic action induced by the oscillating phaco tip.
The cataractous lens and its fragments are engaged by the phaco tip during the
procedure due the pump suction at the phaco tip orifice and assures for a very
efficient surgical procedure. The electromechanical ultrasonic oscillation of the

Page 5
phaco tip generates a significant volume of heat; therefore, to preclude adverse
thermal tissue effects, these devices incorporate cooling mechanisms.
(2) Aspiration of fluid containing "emulsified" and fragmented cataractous
lens material - This is accomplished by means of a constant volume peristaltic
or venturi type pumping system. The aspirated material is collected in a
"drainage bag". Various positions of the device foot pedal control allow for
simultaneous irrigation and aspiration, or simultaneous aspiration, irrigation
and phacofragmentation. When the phaco tip lumen engages a piece of the
fragmented cataractous lens, the lumen opening may be occluded, if the lens
fragment is large, causing the pump-induced vacuum to build up. The vacuum
build up generally causes the occluding fragment to be aspirated; if the fragment is
too large, the hand piece vent may be employed to release the fragment, thereby
breaking the vacuum. Most phacofragmentation systems are designed to preclude
excessive vacuum build up, because it could cause collapse of the anterior chamber
of the patient eye.
(3) Irrigation of the operative surgical site - This is accomplished through
the use of a bottled source of irrigating solution, which is connected via tubing
through the device console to the operative handpiece; the handpiece contains a
lumen which allows the solution transport access to the surgical site. Normally,
the solution bottle is suspended on an intravenous (IV) "pole" attached to the
device housing. The bottle must be carefully positioned so that the "zero point" of
the IV pole is located at the level of the patient eye. For proper gravity induced
solution flow, the fluid level of the bottle is set at 65.0 centimeters above the zero
point. The flow of solution is controlled by a physician through a solenoidactivated pinch valve, which applies or releases pressure on the connective tubing.
The solenoid-activated pinch valve is located within the device console and is
controlled by the device foot pedal control.
Phacofragmentation System devices are generally furnished with a variety of
handpieces. These handpieces generally fall into three functional classes: irrigation
only, irrigation and aspiration only, and phacofragmentation with
simultaneous irrigation and aspiration. Irrigation only handpieces may be
furnished in a number of configurations to provide for various surgical functions,
such as one with a bent tip for use in anterior and posterior capsulotomy or one
with provisions for attachments, such as a cystotome or capsule polisher. The
irrigation and aspiration only handpiece is generally used after the
phacofragmentation process has been completed. It is used to remove remaining
residual tissue. Tips are furnished in various lumen sizes, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7
millimeters. Some Phacofragmentation System devices are provided with a
vitreous aspiration and cutting handpiece. This device is also a Class II medical
device and is subject to another FDA review guidance document. The addition of

Page 6
this type of handpiece would make the Phacofragmentation System device
multifunctional and therefore would convert the device to a combination device.
Combination devices are not currently eligible for Third Party review.
Phacofragmentation System devices are designed with many technologically
advanced features, such as vacuum and irrigation/aspiration select switches,
programmable microprocessor controls, modularized fluidic connections with
disposable cassettes, automated IV irrigation pole components, and provisions for
remote control of the device from outside the sterile operative environment. These
features must be carefully reviewed during the process of establishing the
substantial equivalence of this generic type of device.
III. CLASSIFICATION AND TIER OF DEVICE
This device has been placed in Class II under section 513 of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Devices such as the Phacofragmentation System
device are often placed in Tier II. The appropriate panel is the Ophthalmic
Devices Panel and the device classification is located in Part 886 of 21 CFR
(Code of Federal Regulations). The device is specifically identified under
regulation number 886.4670.

Guidance on sterility issues is described in the ODE Bluebook Memo K90-1
"510(k) Sterility Review Guidance (2/12/90)." A copy may be obtained from
DSMA.
It should be noted that the Phacofragmentation System device often has labeling

Page 12
sterilization instructions for "flash sterilization" by autoclaving. Flash sterilization
may not be the sole method cited in the device sterilization instructions; it may be
included along with other traditional steam or other methods of sterilization. The
manufacturer is required to provide adequate instructions for flash sterilization
including the autoclaving parameters, such as the recommended time, temperature
etc., and whether or not the device should be wrapped.
The Association for Practitioners in Infection Control (APIC) and the Center for
Disease Control (CDC) have established definitions and guidelines for the selection
and use of disinfectants. Both APIC and the CDC have identified this
device as critical. It should be noted critical items are objects which enter sterile
tissue or the vascular system. Critical devices must be free of all microorganisms,
including bacterial spores, and require sterilization that is expected to destroy all
microorganisms and bacterial spores. Sterilization can be performed using steam
under pressure, radiation, ETO gas, and chemical sterilants.
Attached to this document is a checklist form which may be utilized to assist
in the review of 510(k) submission for the Phacofragmentation System Device.

M. Summary of Equivalence
A Summary of Equivalence comparing similar devices that are legally marketed in
the United States must be provided. This includes devices in commercial
distribution prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of the Medical Devices
Amendments, and any new Class I, or Class II devices introduced subsequently.
The summary should clearly review similarities and differences between the device
proposed for marketing clearance and the predicate device to which it is
claimed to be substantially equivalent. It may be appropriate to present this
material in table form.
The device comparison should include the following considerations: intended
use, design (e.g., hardware, software, configuration, materials specifications,
mechanical and electrical specifications), sterilization method, biocompatibility
factors, and any other device factors of similarity between the proposed and
predicate devices and which form the basis for the claim of substantial
equivalence.
The application should clearly state whether the substantially equivalent device is a
pre-amendments device or a device which has a prior history of processing via the

Page 14
510(k) regulatory mode. If the device has a 510(k) history, the document control
number for previously cleared device(s), if known, should be cited in the
application.
DEVICE MODIFICATION - For changes or modifications of existing devices that
could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or for
marketing a device with a new indication for use, the 510(k) should include a
detailed description and rationale for the changes.
The submission must show that the applicant has considered the possible effects
of the change on the safety and effectiveness of the device, as described in 21 CFR
807.87(g).
Valid scientific evidence must be provided to demonstrate that these differences do
no affect the safety and effectiveness. This may include the same types of testing
delineated in part K Performance Data, above. Certification should be provided
regarding compliance with voluntary standards, if appropriate.
Additional guidance concerning device modifications is available in the draft FDA
guidance titled, "Deciding When to Submit a 510(k) for Change to an
Existing Device 1/10/97)." A copy of this document may be obtained from
DSMA.
DEVICE KITS - If this device is to be marketed as a kit, all components of the
kit must be described. The following is a recommended wording for a certification
describing the components:
I certify that the following components of my kit are either (1)
legally marketed pre-amendments devices, (2) exempt from premarket
notification (consistent with the exemption criteria described in the
classification regulation(s) and the limitations of exemptions from
Section 510(k) of the act (e.g. 862.9)), or (3) have been found to be
substantially equivalent through the premarket notification process for
the use(s) for which the kit is intended (i.e., I am not claiming or
causing a new use for the component(s)).
I further certify that these components are not purchased in "bulk" but
are purchased in finished form, i.e., they are packaged, labeled, etc.,
consistent with their pre-amendments, exemption, or premarket
notification criteria and status.
If the applicant cannot make the certification statement above (first paragraph) for
each component of the kit, the components should be itemized without a pre-

Page 15
amendments, exemption, or premarket notification status. These kit components
will undergo premarket notification review in parallel with the total kit review.
If the applicant cannot make the above referenced certification statement (second
paragraph) for each component of the kit, these components should be itemized
with a statement about whether they are pre-amendments, exempt, or have been
found substantially equivalent through the premarket notification process. The
applicant should describe how they are further processed (e.g., sterilized /
resterilized, packaged/repackaged, labeled/relabeled, etc).
If the kit contains components which are subject to regulation as drugs, a
substantially equivalent determination will not apply to the drug component(s) of
the device. Information on FDA requirements for marketing the drug
component(s) in the kit can be obtained from the Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research's Division of Drug Labeling Compliance at (301) 295-8063.
If the kit contains sutures, evidence must be provided that the sterilant employed
for the kit does not come into contact with the sutures during the sterilization
process. If sutures are components of the kit, the following conditions are
required:
1. The labeling, packaging, and method of sterilization of the sutures cannot
be changed without prior notification, review, and approval by FDA.
2. The suppliers of the sutures used in the kit cannot be changed
without prior notification, review, and approval by FDA.
VI. TRUTHFUL AND ACCURATE STATEMENT
The submitter must provide a Truthful and Accurate Statement. This is a
statement that the submitter believes to the best of his/her knowledge, that all data
and information submitted in the premarket notification are truthful and accurate
and that no material fact has been omitted as described in 21 CFR 807.87.
