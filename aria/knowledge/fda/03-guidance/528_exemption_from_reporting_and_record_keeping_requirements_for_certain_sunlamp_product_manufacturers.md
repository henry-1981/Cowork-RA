Exmptian £ran Reporting and Recordkeeping 
ts for 
Certain Sunlamp Product Manufacturers 
BACKGROUND: 
The regulations in 21 CFR 1002 pranulgated under the 
Radiation Control f o r  H e a l t h  and Safety A c t  of 1968 require, amng other 
things, that a manufacturer of an electronic product subject to a 
performance standard sutxnit an initial report, annual reports, and model 
change reports, as applicable, to the D i r e c t o r ,  Bureau of Radiological 
H e a l t h  (21 CFR 1002 .lo, 1002 .ll and 1002-12) . Fmthermre, a manufacturer , 
of an electronic product subject to a perfomce standard is required 
to mint- 
certain records including a description of the quality 
control procedures with respect to the prcduct's radiation safety, r e s u l t s  
of life testing and capies of written c a m n i c a t i o n s  between the manufacturer, 
dealers, distributors and purchasers regarding radiation safety (21 CFR 
1002.30 (a) 1 and preserve such records f o r  a period of 5 years £ran the date 
of the record (21 CFR 1002.31(a)), 
The Bureau's experience in the e n f o r m t  of the performance 
standard 
for sunlamp p r d u c t s  (21 CE'R 1040.20) indicates that the above referenced 
reporting and recordkeeping requirertrtnts seem to be an overburden for an 
individual or fh 
who manufactures on a one time or infrequent basis a 
small nunher of sunlamp products (usually less than 10) f o r  his awn use. 
FSrapthg this type of marmfacturer £ran the referenced reporting and 
recordkeeping requirerrrents under certain conditions would not carrpranise 
the spirit or purpose of the Act since FDA can determine c q l i a n c e  
through product inspections. 
EXEWTICkJ: 
Any person who manufactures less than 10 sunlamp products for 
use in their am carnercial suntanning facilities is hereby exempted 
under the authority of 21CFR 1002.50 £ran the requirements of 21 CFR 
1002.10, 1002.11, 1002.12, 1002-30 and 1002.31 provided t h a t  such person 
n o t i f i e s  the D i r e c t o r ,  Division of Capliance, that less than 10 sunlamp 
products are being manufactured for the use of that person and provides 
the D i r e c t o r  with the name and address of t h e  manufacturing location.
