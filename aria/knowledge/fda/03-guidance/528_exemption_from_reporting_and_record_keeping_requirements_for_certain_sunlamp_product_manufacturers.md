BACKGROUND:

.

The Bureau's experience in the e n f o r m t of the performance standard
for sunlamp p r d u c t s (21 CE'R 1040.20) indicates that t h e above referenced
r e p o r t i n g and recordkeeping requirertrtnts seem t o be an overburden for an
individual or f hwho manufactures on a one time or i n f r e q u e n t basis a
small nunher of sunlamp products (usually less than 10) f o r his awn use.
FSrapthg this type o f marmfacturer £ r a n the r e f e r e n c e d r e p o r t i n g and
recordkeeping requirerrrents under certain c o n d i t i o n s would n o t carrpranise
the s p i r i t or purpose of the Act since FDA can determine c q l i a n c e
through product inspections.
Any person who manufactures less than 10 sunlamp products for
u s e in their am carnercial suntanning facilities is hereby exempted
