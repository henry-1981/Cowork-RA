Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

Introduction

On June 10, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a final rule entitled
“Electronic Products; Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray Systems and Their Major
Components” (70 FR 33997; subsequently referred to as “the rule”), which amended the
performance standard for diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components. FDA has
prepared this Small Entity Compliance Guide in accordance with section 212 of the Small
Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (Public Law 104-121, as amended by Public Law
110-28) to assist small entities to comply with these changes in the performance standard, which
became effective June 10, 2006.1 A subsequent amendment to the Radiological Health

For further clarification on aspects of the performance standards for diagnostic x-ray equipment (21 CFR 1020.30
and 21 CFR 1020.32), see FDA’s guidance entitled, “Policy Clarification for Certain Fluoroscopic Equipment
Requirements” (available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policyclarification-certain-fluoroscopic-equipment-requirements ).

Regulations (88 FR 3638;2 January 20, 2023), removed certain reporting requirements for
diagnostic x-ray systems and their major components and the current version of this guidance
reflects these changes.
In general, FDA’s guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities.
Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should be viewed only
as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. The use of
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, but
not required.

II. Questions and Answers on the Rule
1.

To which products does this rule (21 CFR 1020.30; 1020.31; 1020.32;
1020.33) apply?
The rule applies to all medical diagnostic x-ray systems and their major
components. This scope of application includes radiographic, fluoroscopic, and
computed tomography (CT) diagnostic x-ray systems. The amendments added
coverage of Image Receptors that are electrically powered or connected with the
x-ray system manufactured on or after June 10, 2006 and fluoroscopic Air Kerma
Display Devices manufactured on or after June 10, 2006 to the list of components
of a diagnostic x-ray system.

2.

What new definitions were added to 21 CFR 1020.30(b)?
a) Air kerma means kerma in air (see definition of Kerma).
b) Air kerma rate (AKR) means the air kerma per unit time.
c) Automatic exposure rate control (AERC) means a device which automatically
controls one or more technique factors in order to obtain at a preselected
location(s) a required quantity of radiation per unit time.
d) C-arm fluoroscope means a fluoroscopic x-ray system in which the image
receptor and the x-ray tube housing assembly are connected or coordinated to
maintain a spatial relationship. Such a system allows a change in the direction
of the beam axis with respect to the patient without moving the patient.
e) Cumulative air kerma means the total air kerma accrued from the beginning of
an examination or procedure and includes all contributions from fluoroscopic
and radiographic irradiation.
f) Fluoroscopic air kerma display device means a device, subsystem, or
component that provides the display of AKR and cumulative air kerma

4

required by section 1020.32(k). It includes radiation detectors, if any,
electronic and computer components, associated software, and data displays.
g) Fluoroscopic irradiation time means the cumulative duration during an
examination or procedure of operator-applied continuous pressure to the
device, enabling x-ray tube activation in any fluoroscopic mode of operation.
h) Fluoroscopy means a technique for generating x-ray images and presenting
them simultaneously and continuously as visible images. This term has the
same meaning as the term ‘‘radioscopy’’ in the standards of the International
Electrotechnical Commission.
i) Isocenter means the center of the smallest sphere through which the beam axis
passes when the equipment moves through a full range of rotations about its
common center.
j) Kerma means the quantity as defined by the International Commission on
Radiation Units and Measurements. The kerma, K, is the quotient of dEtr by
dm, where dEtr is the sum of the initial kinetic energies of all the charged
particles liberated by uncharged particles in a mass dm of material; thus
K=dEtr/dm, in units of J/kg, where the special name for the unit of kerma is
gray (Gy). When the material is air, the quantity is referred to as ‘‘air kerma.’’
k) Last-image-hold (LIH) radiograph means an image obtained either by
retaining one or more fluoroscopic images, which may be temporally
integrated, at the end of a fluoroscopic exposure or by initiating a separate and
distinct radiographic exposure automatically and immediately in conjunction
with termination of the fluoroscopic exposure.
l) Lateral fluoroscope means the x-ray tube and image receptor combination in a
biplane system dedicated to the lateral projection. It consists of the lateral xray tube housing assembly and the lateral image receptor that are fixed in
position relative to the table with the x-ray beam axis parallel to the plane of
the table.
m) Mode of operation means, for fluoroscopic systems, a distinct method of
fluoroscopy or radiography provided by the manufacturer and selected with a
set of several technique factors or other control settings uniquely associated
with the mode. The set of distinct technique factors and control settings for the
mode may be selected by the operation of a single control. Examples of
distinct modes of operation include normal fluoroscopy (analog or digital),
high-level control fluoroscopy, cineradiography (analog or digital), digital
subtraction angiography, electronic radiography using the fluoroscopic image
receptor, and photospot recording. In a specific mode of operation, certain
system variables affecting air kerma, AKR, or image quality, such as image
magnification, x-ray field size, pulse rate, pulse duration, number of pulses,

5

source-image receptor distance (SID), or optical aperture, may be adjustable
or may vary; their variation per se does not comprise a mode of operation
different from the one that has been selected.
n) Non-image-intensified fluoroscopy means fluoroscopy using only a
fluorescent screen.
o) Radiography means a technique for generating and recording an x-ray pattern
for the purpose of providing the user with an image(s) after termination of the
exposure.
p) Solid state x-ray imaging device means an assembly, typically in a rectangular
panel configuration, that intercepts x-ray photons and converts the photon
energy into a modulated electronic signal representative of the x-ray intensity
over the area of the imaging device. The electronic signal is then used to
create an image for display and/or storage.
q) Source-skin distance (SSD) means the distance from the source to the center
of the entrant x-ray field in the plane tangent to the patient skin surface.
3.

What additional information is required by 21 CFR 1020.30(h)(5) to be
provided to users regarding the imaging systems?
Imaging system information. For x-ray systems manufactured on or after June 10,
2006, that produce images using the fluoroscopic image receptor, the following
information shall be provided in a separate, single section of the user’s instruction
manual or in a separate manual devoted to this information:

4.

i.

For each mode of operation, a description of the mode and detailed
instructions on how the mode is engaged and disengaged. The
description of the mode shall identify those technique factors and
system controls that are fixed or automatically adjusted by
selection of the mode of operation, including the manner in which
the automatic adjustment is controlled. This information shall
include how the operator can recognize which mode of operation
has been selected prior to initiation of x-ray production.

ii.

For each mode of operation, a descriptive example(s) of any
specific clinical procedure(s) or imaging task(s) for which the
mode is recommended or designed and how each mode should be
used. Such recommendations do not preclude other clinical uses.

How has the warning label (21 CFR 1020.30(j)) on the control panel
changed?

6

Warning label. The control panel containing the main power switch shall bear the
warning statement, legible and accessible to view:
‘‘Warning: This x-ray unit may be dangerous to patient and operator
unless safe exposure factors, operating instructions and maintenance
schedules are observed.’’
5.

How have the minimum HVL requirements (21 CFR 1020.30(m)) changed?
The minimum HVL requirements for all x-ray systems (except dental systems
designed for use with intraoral image receptors) manufactured on or after June 10,
2006, have been increased as specified according to 21 CFR 1020.30(m), Table 1.
