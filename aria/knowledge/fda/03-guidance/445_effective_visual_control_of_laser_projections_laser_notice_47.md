TO: All Holders of Approved Variances for Laser Light Shows and
Displays.

SUBJECT : Effective Visual Control of Laser Projections.

BACKGROUND :

All variances issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for laser
light shows contain the following condition in Attachment A of the
variance:

"All laser light shows shall be under the direct and personal control
of a trained, competent operator(s). The operator(s) shall:

(a) be an employee of the variance holder who shall be
responsible for the training and conduct of the operator;

(b) be located where all beam paths can be directly observed
at all times; and

(c) immediately terminate the emission of light show
radiation in the event of any unsafe condition and, for
open air shows, at the request of any air traffic control
officials."

The requirements of clauses (b) and (c), that the operator shall be located
where all beam paths can be directly observed at all times and that laser
emissions can be terminated in the event of any unsafe condition, are basic
principles for effective visual control. These general principles have
usually been sufficient when applied to laser light shows or displays with
limited projection ranges such as indoor displays where the projection
paths do not extend beyond the range of effective visual control.

However, in the case of outdoor laser light shows and displays, unterminat-
ed projections into airspace may be used. While one may be able to look
along the direction of a beam path, the operator can only see objects
effectively for a limited distance.

POLICY:

Effective immediately, the requirements in clauses (b) and (c) of the above
condition are interpreted more specifically to require that the operator
have effective visual control of all the beam paths at all ranges for which
the laser emission levels are a hazard for injury to the eye or for major
temporary visual impairment such as flashblindness.

The FDA, in consultation with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA),
the industry, and other interested parties has determined that the
reasonable range of effectiveness for visual aircraft observers to spot
small, minimally lit planes or helicopters in clear air and the conditions
typically encountered in outdoor laser light show operations is three miles
horizontal range from the laser projector. This is the range of effective’
visual control for aircraft observers. FDA has further determined that
projection of laser emission levels which are capable of producing flash-
blindness beyond the range of effective visual control for the means used
to detect approaching aircraft is inconsistent with the variance
requirements cited above.

The FAA accepts, as a requirement for the Sensitive Flight Zone, a
Sensitive Zone Exposure Limit (SZEL) of 100 pw/om? maximum irradiance
(equivalent to 25 pJ/cm? maximum radiant exposure in one quarter second or
less). This is published in the FAA Order (FAAO) "Procedures for Handling
Airspace Matters," 7400.2D Change 1, used in aeronautical studies of
proposed entertainment and advertisement outdoor laser operations submitted
to the FAA. This limit is intended to protect against flashblindness.

Therefore, laser beams projected into navigable airspace shall not have an
irradiance or radiant exposure in excess of the SZEL (100 pwW/om? or 25

pJ/cm?) at horizontal ranges in excess of the reasonable range of

effectiveness for the means used to detect possible aircraft intrusions
into the projection space.

We understand that this may limit the beam power and/or require a MINIMUM
beam divergence to be implemented.

It should be understood that assuring compliance with the SZEL makes the
determination of minimum beam divergence and maximum beam power critical
determinations in the assurance that the laser show or display is in
compliance with the conditions of the variance. Other parameters such as
pointing accuracy, minimum required scanning specifications, and adequate
scanning safeguards (when applicable) are also significant for assuring
compliance. We will advise the industry if we become aware of any
additional elements that are needed. These determinations shall be made
using well documented and defensible test procedures. Accurate and timely
measurements and recordkeeping are also essential parts of the
manufacturer’s testing program which is in accordance with good
manufacturing practices. Skilled engineers and/or technicians may be
necessary to perform these tasks.

Measurements of beam characteristics must clearly identify whether beam
diameter and divergence are determined using 1/e- or 1/e?-values.
Whichever value may be reported, the 1/e-divergence value shall be used to
determine that the irradiance limit is not exceeded.

The FDA has been engaged in meetings with other Federal and local agencies,
the military, and concerned industries. These meetings have resulted in
the dissemination of interim guidance, the Recommended Interim Guidelines
(RIGS), which were adopted by the FAA and issued in their Order 7400.2D;
Change 1, effective March 11, 1996. These guidelines are intended to
prevent ocular injury and also to prevent temporary visual impairment due
to flashblinding, dazzle, or glare.

The conditions given by this notice more specifically define requirements
that are already implicit in all currently approved variances.

I am sure that you share our concern for the flight safety of the public.
We must all do our parts to prevent the occurrence of a tragedy that could
cost hundreds of lives. Be advised that the primary responsibility for the
safety of a laser display belongs to the manufacturer/operator of the
display. It is that party’s responsibility to be in control of the quality
and safety of the projections and to be sure that the equipment is operated
in accordance with the conditions of their variance and in compliance with
all applicable guidelines for safety.

Please recognize that the policy guidance in FAAO 7400.2D is subject to
change as the science develops or as events require the disemination of new
information for the prevention of future incidents involving visual
impairment of aviators. We are confident that you will receive this
notification in a spirit of cooperation and commitment to public safety.
