Investigational Device Exemption (IDE)
Guidance for Retinal Prostheses
Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking
on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not
operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach
satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss
an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this
guidance. If you cannot identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number
listed on the title page of this guidance.

1. Introduction
This guidance is intended for FDA reviewers and members of industry who intend to submit
an investigational device exemption (IDE) to the FDA to conduct feasibility and/or pivotal
human clinical trials of their retinal prostheses in the United States to support a premarket
approval (PMA) or a humanitarian device application (HDE).
This document provides guidance about developing pre-clinical and clinical tests of retinal
prosthetic devices. This guidance describes pre-clinical tests that you should conduct to
characterize device safety before initiating any clinical testing.
This device-specific guidance document should be considered in addition to other FDA
publications on marketing or IDE applications and is not a replacement for those documents.
The CDRH Device Advice website
(http://www.fda.gov/http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Ho
wtoMarketYourDevice/default.htm) has additional information about PMA (21 CFR 814),
HDE (21 CFR Part 814 Subpart H), and IDE (21 CFR Part 812) submissions.
We recommend that you use this document as you develop data to support an IDE
application. The pre-clinical and clinical tests mentioned in the guidance represent FDA’s
current thinking based on the information available at this time. Given the limited history
with devices in this field, additional information may become available at a later date that
suggests alternative test methods or functional assessments that may be more appropriate to
assess the safety and effectiveness of retinal prostheses. For this reason, we strongly suggest
the sponsors of such devices submit a Pre-Submission to facilitate discussion of clinical trial

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

designs, pre-clinical test protocols, and proposed indications for use for any specific retinal
prosthesis.
This guidance cites a number of voluntary consensus standards which are recognized by
FDA. You may access a list of the FDA-recognized standards from the CDRH web site at
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfStandards/search.cfm. See Appendix A
for a list of the voluntary standards referenced in this guidance. You may also consult FDA’s
guidance “Recognition and Use of Consensus Standards”
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm077274.htm).
For the purposes of this guidance, “you” refers to the sponsor of the IDE investigation and
“we” refers to FDA.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidance documents describe the Agency's current thinking on a
topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that
something is suggested or recommended, but not required.

2. Scope
This document is limited to retinal prostheses, (i.e., visual prosthetic devices implanted on or
beneath the retina, and those on or beneath the outer surface of the globe), that use electrical
stimulation to provide some level of visual perception for persons suffering from
degenerative retinal conditions.
This document does not apply to prostheses that stimulate the optic nerve or other higher
brain areas such as the visual cortex or the lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, prostheses
that incorporate drugs or biological products may be combination products. The FDA Center
with regulatory responsibility for a combination product is determined by the primary mode
of action of the product and in some circumstances may not be CDRH. For additional
information on combination product jurisdiction or to submit a Request for Designation,
please refer to the FDA Office of Combination Products (see
http://www.fda.gov/oc/combination).
FDA believes that the devices addressed by this guidance document are significant risk
devices as defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m). Sponsors intending to use these devices in a clinical
investigation in the United States must therefore submit an IDE application to FDA and
obtain FDA and IRB approval of the application before beginning the investigation (21 CFR
812.20(a)). In addition to the requirement to obtain an FDA-approved IDE (21 CFR Part
812), sponsors of such studies must comply with the regulations governing institutional
review boards (IRBs) (21 CFR Part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR Part 50).

3. Device Description
3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Your IDE application must include the complete investigational plan or, where appropriate, a
summary of the investigational plan (21 CFR 812.20(b)(2)). In your investigational plan you
should include a description of the prosthetic device and its functional components (21 CFR
812.25(d)). Your description should include:
•

pictorial representations,

•

engineering drawings,

•

block diagrams of circuits, and

•

block diagrams of software interfaces.

The block diagrams of the circuits should trace signal flow, processing, and logic of
operation at the system level and the circuit level as appropriate.
Your description of each functional component should include:
•

a complete set of electrical schematics,

•

a complete set of mechanical drawings,

•

detailed drawings and descriptions of all components including material composition
and coatings,

application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), cable conductors, and cable insulation
layers or associated coatings.

a. Video Camera/Transducer and Attachments
If your device utilizes a component to capture a picture of an image, we recommend you
describe the following:
•

the type of photosensor or video input and processor used with the retinal implant,

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

the resolution and configuration of its sensors, sensor location, low-light sensitivity,
field of view, and ability to encode contrast in the visual scene,

•

any eye tracking capabilities, and

•

the means of attaching any external connectors, transmitters, telemetry coils, visual
processors, and spectacles.

We also recommend you describe the effects of coil distance and eye movements on
telemetry data transmission during use.

b. Device Accessories
We recommend that you describe all device accessories used for programming, clinical
fitting, testing, or home use of your device. You should include pictorial representations,
engineering drawings, block diagram circuits, and block diagrams of software interfaces for
accessories such as user controls, eye trackers, programming interfaces, software, cameras,
spectacles, video processors, cables, connectors, and projection equipment. In addition, we
recommend you describe the type of battery used in the device.

c. Manufacturing Process
You should provide a description of the manufacturing and inspection steps related to
achieving critical specifications for the device, including the final device acceptance criteria.

4. Risk Analysis
You must include in your investigational plan a description and analysis of all increased risks
to which subjects will be exposed by the investigation, as well as the manner in which these
risks will be minimized (21 CFR 812.25(c)). You should describe in the IDE application the
method you used to conduct this risk analysis and, in so doing, include sufficient detail to
support the chosen method.
To fulfill this risk analysis requirement, we recommend that you perform a Failure Mode and
Risk Analysis summary on the electronic components and circuitry. Your Failure Mode and
Risk Analysis summary should identify and assess the risks due to any potential electronic
hazards/failures, the potential severity of these risks, and how to eliminate or reduce them.
We recommend you supply a traceability matrix showing how you validated your risk
mitigation features in the electronics of your visual prosthetic device.

5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

5. Content and Format of Test Data
a. Table of Contents
We recommend you include a table of contents at the beginning of the submission that lists
the specific tests that were performed.

b. Tests Performed, Data Summaries, and Conclusions
For each test performed, you should state the study objective, method (protocol) used, results,
and conclusions. As applicable to your device, the report should contain:
•

minimum measured value (min),

•

maximum measured value (max),

•

mean, and

•

standard deviation (std. dev.) of the test data.

We also recommend that you provide a narrative summary of your conclusions for each test
conducted and explain whether the results support the safety and performance of your device.

6. Pre-clinical Tests
If you provide information on nonclinical laboratory studies in your IDE application, you
must state whether such studies complied with 21 CFR Part 58, Good Laboratory Practice for
Nonclinical Laboratory Studies (21 CFR 812.27(b)(3)). If such studies were not conducted in
compliance with these regulations, you must state the reason(s) for noncompliance (21 CFR
812.27(b)(3)).
We recommend including the following testing information in your application. If you choose
not to include any of the following information, you should explain why you believe such
information is not relevant to your device.

a. Materials and Biocompatibility
You should completely describe the material compositions used in your retinal prosthetic
device. For all implant material or material contacting the subject, you should provide
detailed specifications for the formulation or chemical composition, particularly for materials
with no history of intraocular or implant use. We recommend that you use generic names to
describe the formulations of all device materials.
You should provide material biocompatibility profiles for all subject-contacting device
components, as described in the FDA guidance Use of International Standard ISO-10993,
Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing

6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm080735.htm). We recommend that you document the biocompatibility of the device and its
associated insertion tools by conducting appropriate tests with the finished device or a
facsimile that has undergone similar manufacturing processing, including sterilization.
Literature and/or test references for the same material which has undergone the same
manufacturing process are generally acceptable. You should also include histology
evaluations, where applicable.
Bacterial Endotoxin Testing
We recommend that you provide bacterial endotoxin test results on implanted device
components using a validated test method that includes inhibition and enhancement
testing, such as USP 34:2011, <85> Bacterial Endotoxins Test, or AAMI
ST72:2002/(R)2010, Bacterial endotoxins - Test methodologies, routine monitoring,
and alternatives to batch testing.
Leachables Testing
We recommend that you determine the stability of the retinal prostheses material
components in a saline environment through detection and quantification of possible
degradation products from hydrolysis and changes in physical appearance. The test
device should consist of the implant including all external material components (e.g.,
polymers, metals, ceramics, coatings, etc.) used in the construction of the finished
device. Your extraction study should be designed to evaluate the stability of these
materials in a saline environment at 35 °C for a period of at least five years or at an
elevated temperature for a similar equivalent exposure. The saline media should be
qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed at the end of the extraction for possible
extractable components of the test material(s). The results should be evaluated to
assess the risk for potentially harmful effects from the extractable components and
they should be recorded in the device risk assessment.
Pyrogen Testing
The implant and its insertion devices should be tested for material-mediated
pyrogenicity using the Rabbit Pyrogen Test (USP <151>) unless justification can be
given. For device materials, firms should assess the risk of the presence of nonendotoxin pyrogens. See FDA’s Guidance for Industry:Pyrogen and Endotoxins
Testing: Questions and Answers (available at
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/uc
m314718.htm).

b. Animal Tests
We recommend that you conduct animal testing on an active finished device (one that can be
turned off) to establish adequate safety before commencing a substantive human trial. We
also recommend that you design a staged testing approach that includes evaluation of several
animals which are implanted long term.
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Since implantation may induce failure modes not predicted by device bench testing, we
recommend that animal studies evaluate the ocular tissue biocompatibility of the implanted
prosthetic device and its associated components and stimulation arrays. The unimplanted eye
may be used for comparison. The animal study test reports should include the following
items:
•

study protocol and objective,

•

study design including the species, strain and number of animals used,

•

stimulation levels and rates used (if present),

•

visually evoked response testing (if present) such as electroretinograms or visually or
electrically evoked potentials, and

•

histology of the eye and retina with particular attention to regions of device
implantation or attachment.

We also recommend you provide an analysis of the animal testing data and a description of
any modifications made to the device as a result of this testing.
Acute Tests
You should test the prosthesis electrodes to stimulate the retina near their maximal limits in
an animal model for a period of 24 hours. The animal may be sedated. After testing, you
should perform a gross pathological and a detailed histological examination of the eye and its
layers.
Long-Term Tests
You should implant the final form of the fully functional retinal prosthetic device in the eye
of a model animal for at least 6 months. The device does not have to be activated and
stimulating for the entire duration of implantation to verify device functionality. It may be
appropriate to test the device (have it active and stimulating) only within the first 2 weeks
after implantation and again just before explantation to characterize the functionality of the
device.
After explantation, you should examine the eye and its layers histologically for any pathology
associated with the implant. We also recommend you evaluate the explanted device at a
magnification sufficient to detect any failure mechanisms such as corrosion or insulation
degradation.

c. Electrode Stimulation Tests
You should report the stimulation testing range and limits for the electrodes in the array. For
each electrode tested, we recommend you describe the following items:
•

the range of stimulation values you plan to test in subjects,
8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

whether the pulses are current- or voltage-regulated,

•

whether the stimulation is bipolar or monopolar,

•

the pulse charge densities to be tested in mC/cm2 per phase,

•

the charge/phase delivered,

•

the pulse sequence and polarities, for example, monophasic or biphasic,

•

the frequencies of pulse/train stimulation you plan to test,

•

the waveforms and duration/phase of the pulses/pulse trains you plan to test,

•

the resistance of the electrodes,

•

the maximal voltage delivered per pulse,

•

whether the pulses are capacitively coupled, charge-balanced or asymmetric, the
charge recovery method and,

•

the leakage resistance of the electrodes to the stimulator case, if applicable.

We recommend you also describe briefly how the maxima of the above stimulation
parameters will overlap in subject tests on single electrodes. For example, you should
describe the maximal pulse charge density, pulse frequency, and stimulus duration of the test.

d. Durability Tests
We recommend you plan for and begin to conduct the durability testing described below.
Prior to initiating human studies you should be able to provide an estimate of the following
parameters:
Design Lifetime and Performance Durability Tests
We recommend that you describe the design lifetimes for both the implanted and external
device components. We recommend that you design the implanted components of your
device to withstand a minimum of 5 years simulated use or provide a rationale for a shorter
duration. We also recommend that you address the durability of the stimulation electrodes by
conducting a series of accelerated lifetime tests to evaluate the durability of the
electrodes/electrode arrays to electrical stimulation toward the prosthetic design lifetime. In
addition, we recommend that you perform these tests at the maximal stimulation rate in a
saline bath at 37oC or higher.
You should also assess the durability of the implant by performing a series of accelerated
lifetime tests. These tests should evaluate the durability of the complete implant, mounts,
bands, and telemetry coils (if present) to maximal rate stimulation, power reception, and
telemetry. In addition, we recommend you assess the durability of the external device

9

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

components by performing a series of lifetime tests on the external visual processor
electronics, optical sensors, and telemetry coils (if present).
Calculation of Estimated Lifetimes
We recommend that you relate the assessment of device lifetime to the results of the tests
conducted, which may include stress, hermeticity, corrosion, fatigue test analysis, and any
other tests necessary to evaluate potential device failure modes. You should include
documentation about how the estimated device lifetime was derived from the tests conducted.
We recommend you describe all failure modes and effects found in your device tests, and the
criticality of any failures found.
Hermeticity Tests
A key factor in determining the lifetime durability of the prosthetic device is maintaining
device hermeticity. We recommend you supply data on the design to be used in the clinical
study using accelerated lifetime tests. You should test the device until failure. We also
recommend you evaluate the hermeticity of your complete device using product lifetime
immersion tests in a saline solution at 37oC or higher. Tests that evaluate the items listed
below may be done concurrently.
Evaluation of Coating Durability
For devices and associated cable assemblies coated with water-resistant films, we
recommend you provide a study demonstrating that your coating remains effective after
immersion testing. With coatings that are critical to device function, the test should be of a
sufficient temperature and duration to detect coating failures. We also recommend you report
any cracks, delamination, or scratches, and their observed dimensions. You should
substantiate the level of magnification that you use in your inspection method, based on the
size of the defect that would cause device failure.
Potential for Corrosion
We recommend that you evaluate the potential for corrosion in designs that allow
micromotion between components, such as cable interconnects or suture holes that may
disrupt an associated insulation coating or passive film.
Welding and Bonding Patency Tests
We recommend that you validate the adequacy and reliability of any welding or bonding
processes used in device fabrication, and their inspection methods. We also recommend you
describe the inspection process of how device hermeticity of the case (if present) and cabling
is validated and determined. Last, we recommend that you describe any validation tests
performed such as helium leak tests or impedance spectroscopy.

10

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Flexion Testing
We recommend you conduct tests of your retinal prosthesis that simulate the actual forces
experienced under flexion when it is mounted in its intended location on or in the eye. We
recommend you conduct the tests in saline, at 37oC or higher.
•

To assess surgical insertion stresses, we recommend that you demonstrate how your
device and its cables will withstand surgical implantation, suturing, and any folding.

•

We also recommend that you explain the clinical relevance of the loading conditions
used for the accelerated flexion testing.

•

You should also assess flex stresses exerted during normal eye movement. We
recommend you perform long-term durability testing that models the physiological
loads and boundary conditions that your retinal prosthesis and its cables are likely to
experience in its intended ocular location, under normal visual function and daily
saccadic eye movement.

e. Electronics
We recommend you supply accurate specifications and fabrication data supporting the
design, thermal dissipation, electronic circuitry, ASIC, interconnects, cabling, and
transmission coils of the implant.
Eye Orientation and Radio Frequency Link Safety
If the unit uses an external power source and signal, you should supply documentation
showing that power is received by the implant through the full range of eye rotational angles.
We also recommend you include safety data documenting how the device responds to loss of
power or signal in response to excessive rotation of the eye.
Eye Movements
If your device contains a camera or optical sensor not mounted directly to the eye itself, you
should document how your device will respond to the subject's eye movements.
Safeguards
You should describe the safety features built into the device such as electromagnetic
interference (EMI) rejection filters, direct current leakage detection, recovery from power
loss, electrode stimulation limits, error logs, hardware watchdogs and resets to validate
proper device function.
Batteries
We recommend you describe the type of battery used in the device, its composition, location,
and indicate the projected battery life. You should indicate whether the battery is disposable

11

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

or rechargeable, and how the battery is replaced. In addition, you should describe any
protection circuitry against inserting the battery with incorrect polarity or shorting.
Mobile Unit Controls
We recommend you describe how the portable subject controller of your retinal prosthesis
addresses usability, if applicable (i.e., human factors):
•

audible machine state indicators or warnings,

•

tactilely discernable instrument controls,

•

impact resistance,

•

presence of an accessible safety or power cutoff switch,

•

water and perspiration resistance, and

•

ease of battery insertion for replacement.

We recommend you review the FDA guidance on human factor design in instrument control,
Medical Device Use-Safety: Incorporating Human Factors Engineering into Risk
Management-- Identifying, Understanding, and Addressing Use-Related Hazards
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm094460.htm).

f. Software
We recommend you describe in detail the physician fitting software, device programming,
patient software controls, and protections against excessive stimulation levels. We also
recommend you describe how the software is configured for home use and user adjustment.
We recommend you address the following issues, as applicable to your device:
•

any fail-safes,

•

resets and presets,

•

software validation tests,

•

power down/recovery,

•

low power situation,

•

device feedback of proper function,

•

software limits on device outputs, and

•

any protection against user or clinician programming error.

12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

In addition, we recommend you validate all patient and clinician software as described in
Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical
Devices
(https://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/
GuidanceDocuments/ucm089593.pdf). The kind of information we recommend you submit
is determined by the “level of concern,” which is related to the risks associated with software
failure. The level of concern for a device may be minor, moderate, or major. The Software
guidance describes how you should assess the level of concern for an individual device. You
should also refer to the guidance, General Principles of Software Validation
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/u
cm085281.htm).

g. Visible and Electromagnetic Radiation, and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) compatibility
We recommend you demonstrate reasonable assurance that use of the device results in neither
serious bodily injury nor device malfunction or failure due to electromagnetic emission or
interference. We suggest you also describe the radiopacity of the unit and its associated
implanted components.
Visible or IR Emission
If the device or any of its components emit visible or infrared (IR) radiation into the eye, we
recommend you evaluate the radiation levels and compare them to levels noted in ISO 150041,2:2007 Ophthalmic instruments - Fundamental requirements and test methods or ISO
10939:2007 Ophthalmic instruments - Slit-lamp microscopes or equivalent.
If diffuse illumination of the eye is employed by the device (e.g., IR illumination for pupil
tracking), we recommend you document that the irradiance does not exceed ANSI
RP27.1:2005 or- RP27.3:2007 standards: Recommended Practice for Photobiological Safety
for Lamps and Lamp Systems-or equivalent.
Electromagnetic Compatibility
We recommend you evaluate your retinal prosthesis for compatibility with electromagnetic
interference from various field strength MRI scanners, metal detectors, high voltage sources
and devices emitting strong magnetic fields. Other devices that should be evaluated if
applicable include common wireless communication devices, diathermy units, and cardiac
defibrillators.
For electromagnetic compatibility testing of the external device components, we recommend
you follow IEC 60601-1-2 Medical Electrical Equipment - Part 2: General Requirements for
Safety; Electromagnetic Compatibility – Requirements and Tests (General) or an equivalent
method. Also refer to “Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)” on FDA’s website.
(http://www.fda.gov/RadiationEmittingProducts/RadiationSafety/ElectromagneticCompatibilityEMC/default.htm)

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

MRI Compatibility
We recommend that you inform the subject and the dispensing physician of any MRI or EMC
exposure hazards and incompatibilities associated with the retinal prosthesis such as metal
detectors, radiofrequency identification (RFID), wireless devices, or subways, among others.
h. Sterilization and Packaging
We recommend that you describe the sterilization process for each part of the retinal
prosthesis, such as the implant component and surgical insertion tools. Portions of the device
that are implanted or that contact breached skin or tissue should be sterilized to a sterility
assurance level (SAL) of 10-6. Whenever possible, the device should be sterilized in its final
package.
We recommend that you describe the validation of each sterilization process, with reference
to any sterilization standards you have followed. You should describe the packaging for each
device or component and include package integrity testing to support the ability of the
packaging to maintain sterility in the as-manufactured state and over the stated shelf life. The
device should also be demonstrated to withstand aging in its sterile package.
If the device is sterilized by ethylene oxide, ethylene oxide residual levels for the intraocular
portion of the device should be consistent with the levels specified for intraocular lenses in
ANSI/AAMI/ISO 10993-7 Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices - Part 7: Ethylene
Oxide Sterilization Residuals.
We recommend you use the following sterilization and packaging standards for devices
sterilized by the applicable method:
•

ANSI/AAMI/ISO 17665-1:2006 Sterilization of health care products - Moist heat Part 1: Requirements for the development, validation, and routine control of a
sterilization process for medical devices.

•

7. Clinical Tests
We recommend you provide a written overview in your IDE application of all anticipated
phases of the clinical investigation, outlining the studies you plan to conduct at each phase
and describing any plans to pool data from more than one phase. Specifically, you should
provide a detailed description of the initial feasibility study (i.e., study to refine clinical
metrics or device design) and provide an overview of your later phase studies, if these
studies are already in the planning stages. We recommend that you plan to follow subjects
for three years or longer.
We recommend that surgery be performed only to implant the test device and not
simultaneously correct other ocular conditions to avoid compromising demonstrations of
clinical safety or effectiveness in your IDE studies. If device implantation will be performed
simultaneously with other procedures because it is deemed necessary for patient safety and
for the evaluation of the device, justification should be provided to account for potential
confounding introduced by the second procedure in the analyses of the study endpoints.

a. Clinical Protocol
Since IDE clinical testing generally follows a phased approach, the sections on clinical
testing and device labeling will have different levels of importance for feasibility study
protocols compared to pivotal studies of the final device design intended to support a
marketing application.
For each planned clinical study we recommend you provide:
•

the indications for use, which should include the target population,

•

the study type [e.g., pivotal, expansion (continuation of a feasibility or pivotal study),
or feasibility trial],

•

the design of the study, including objectives, any masking, randomization, and
controls or shams used for comparison,

•

the total time planned for subject follow-up,

•

the number of subjects you plan to enroll (sample size),

•

the number of investigational sites, both inside and outside the U.S.,

•

the subject inclusion and exclusion criteria including:
o a defined age range for participants and the range of visual acuities and
visual conditions considered acceptable for subject enrollment. A
cognitive assessment is recommended in order to provide consideration for
psychosocial factors such as subject coping/adjustment ability, family
support, expectations of their participation, and ability to communicate
and participate in all aspects of research.

15

o other health-related conditions, medications, etc., that would confound
study outcomes, or may be contraindicated for the proposed procedure
resulting in exclusion from the study. We recommend that you document
the reasons for not enrolling subjects who were screened under the
protocol.
•

primary safety and effectiveness endpoints described as specific objective clinical
targets, and other endpoints such as optical evaluation of the placement of the
electrode array near the retinal tissue.

•

a study plan detailing tests and testing methodologies, and the stimulation range,
rates, and levels you plan to test in the subjects.
o Describe how you will sample (the number of repetitions and analysis) the
subject’s visual performance to adequately characterize pre-operative
vision. This should be done at least three times total on three different days
preoperatively. Post-operatively, the protocol should also include repeated
measures to minimize variability in the assessments used to evaluate study
endpoints.
o All testing with the device should be done through a non-dilated pupil.

•

a schedule/time table of all clinical tests to be performed for pre- and post-operative
evaluation of the subjects. We recommend you evaluate subject’s visual performance
at intervals of at most three months for the first year and at intervals of at most six
months thereafter.

b. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects
Investigators must report all unanticipated adverse device effects 1 to the sponsor and to their
reviewing IRB’s, in accordance with 21 CFR 812.150(a)(1). Unanticipated adverse device
effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or
death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of
subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)). When devising a list of “anticipated” adverse device effects for
the protocol, the sponsor should consider that an event that would ordinarily be anticipated,
but at a very low degree of incidence, should be considered unanticipated if it exceeded the
expected degree of incidence. This is of particular concern in studies with a small number of

1

Although the term "adverse events" is commonly used instead of "adverse effects," the latter term is the
defined and used throughout the IDE regulations. See 21 CFR 812.3(s), 21 CFR 812.5(a), 21 CFR 812.38(c), 21
CFR 812.46(b), 21 CFR 812.140(a)(3), 21 CFR 812.140(b)(5), and 21 CFR 812.150(a)(1) & (b)(1).

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

subjects. Unanticipated adverse device effects could include, but are not limited to, the
following: migration or extrusion of prosthesis, endophthalmitis, and electric shock.
We recommend that sponsors describe in their protocol any use of a Clinical Events
Committee, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or a core laboratory. Sponsors must
immediately conduct an evaluation of any unanticipated adverse device effects in accordance
with 21 CFR 812.46(b). You must report the results of such evaluations to FDA and all
reviewing IRBs within 10 working days after first receiving notice of the adverse effect. 21
CFR 812.150(b)(1).

c. Safety Outcomes
Other than for initial feasibility studies of limited enrollment, which usually involve fewer
than 10 subjects, you should identify a primary safety endpoint in your protocol. You should
also capture rates of surgical complications and potential longer-term adverse events. The
choice of safety endpoint and list of potential adverse events will depend on the device design
and the patient population for which the device will be indicated. A risk analysis should
identify the most likely types of adverse events and also attempt to identify acceptable levels
for the most probable and the most serious adverse events. The acceptable level of risk will
depend upon the possible benefit and the level of visual function and health condition of the
enrolled eyes. The statistical plan should justify the sample size based upon these safety
considerations, in addition to providing justification based upon effectiveness.
One approach would be to base your primary safety endpoint in the protocol on adverse event
rates obtained from the medical literature for similar surgical procedures, such that all events
do not exceed a predetermined target rate. For certain small patient populations, such as those
that would qualify the device as a Humanitarian Use Device, in order to support safety and
probable benefit in a Humanitarian Device Exemption application, target rates may not need
to be identified in the protocol, but instead the risk/benefit analysis performed at the study
conclusion should characterize the expected rates for similar surgical procedures to provide
only a frame of reference to which the safety performance of your investigative device can be
compared.

d. Effectiveness Outcomes
Primary effectiveness endpoints of visual performance should provide quantitative
documentation of implanted subjects’ performance in support of device effectiveness.
Depending on the patient population and the nature of the underlying condition, the
effectiveness endpoints can be selected from the list of assessments below. Your IDE
submission should include a rationale for the effectiveness endpoint(s) selected.
We recommend that the following effectiveness assessments be performed as appropriate to
your device.

17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Assessments of Visual Function
Low Vision Letter Acuity
We recommend the study protocol evaluate visual acuity using validated letter chart
tests for low vision. Manual acuity levels such as “count fingers” do not provide an
adequate quantitative measure of visual performance. We recommend your tests place
limits on the subjects’ response time.
Grating Acuity
We recommend you test subjects for full-field grating acuity using a forced-choice
paradigm and fixed time interval of presentation. We also recommend you evaluate
subjects using stimuli projected in a darkened room. A staircase testing procedure
may be employed to aid in determining the grating resolution threshold. You should
include grating spatial frequencies that cover the entire acuity range specified by the
study inclusion criteria. In addition, we recommend you evaluate the subject’s ability
to detect grating contrast.
Spatial Mapping of Stimulated Visual Phosphene Fields
We recommend you conduct a careful assessment of the subject’s phosphene “visual
field” map when stimulating individual (or pairs) of stimulus array electrodes. This
should include two-point discrimination tests of the central electrodes in the stimulus
array. For retinal prostheses with intraocular photosensors, we recommend projecting
test spots directly onto the retinal implant. For a retinal prosthesis that relies on an
external head or eyeglass mounted camera for visual input, we recommend generating
a phosphene “visual field” map while simultaneously monitoring the subject’s
implant eye and head position to account for movements during stimulation of
individual electrodes. The protocol should include methods or devices to compensate
for eye and head movements in perimetric tests mapping the subject’s phosphene
fields.
Form Vision Assessment
To assess the ability of the prosthetic array to provide the implanted subject with
timely form or pattern vision, we recommend short-duration, timed single letter or
symbol recognition tests to avoid excessive use of compensatory head, eye, or camera
movements.
Assessments of Functional Vision and Patient Reported Outcomes
Assessments that evaluate the subject’s functional vision may provide a better
understanding of what users’ visual capabilities are in real-world situations.
Laboratory and contrived environments control the actual independent variables that
are the source of visual problems for the visually impaired population. These
independent variables include, but are not limited to glare, shadows, depth, variability
in ambient light, weather conditions, etc. While laboratory assessments and contrived
18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

environments may be acceptable for a non-pivotal study in which preliminary device
effectiveness is to be evaluated, real world assessments should be used in pivotal
studies. We recommend that you use the test procedures described below, as
appropriate to your device.
Orientation and Mobility
We recommend an orientation and mobility assessment of your subjects’ real-world
performance as measured by an independent, trained orientation and mobility
professional. An independent professional is not part of the company that
manufactures and investigates the device. The orientation and mobility professional
should evaluate the functional visual ability of each implanted subject by observing
the subject travel independently in real-world situations. This information cannot be
statistically analyzed because the individual needs of each subject vary tremendously.
The visual environments in which they exist and need to improve function will also
vary significantly. This information will be used to corroborate objective findings
such as visual acuity, visual fields, etc.
Activities of Daily Living
Your protocol should include an assessment of daily living measured by an
independent trained low-vision professional. The low-vision professional should
evaluate the functional visual ability of each implanted subject by observing the
subject perform daily self-care tasks such as dressing, grooming, cooking, and eating,
etc., as applicable.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)
A PRO questionnaire should be administered to all subjects to assess the overall
benefit of the retinal prosthesis when used in the home and other settings outside the
clinic. The questionnaire should include questions regarding symptoms applicable to
an implantable retinal prosthesis and its overall impact on health-related quality of life
in low vision subjects. It is also recommended that depression be assessed as
depression is often correlated to low-vision subjects. Subjects should be
appropriately referred for further assessment and management as per their outcome on
any measure of depression.
We recommend that a self-administered questionnaire be used to avoid bias.
The questionnaire items should have previously been referenced in the peer-reviewed
literature and their reliability and validity undergone some degree of evaluation.
FDA’s Guidance for Industry Patient-Reported Outcome Measures: Use in
Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims
(http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/
Guidances/UCM193282.pdf) should be consulted for further guidance, particularly
for evaluating the adequacy of a PRO instrument as a measure to support device
claims, if the manufacturer wishes to make such claims. Investigators should be aware

19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

that some devices will require the subjects to have vision rehabilitation training in
order to assist them in the use of the device and the potential new vision it may afford
them. In these instances, the PRO questionnaires will be an assessment of the training
program more so than the device itself. In order to be an assessment of the device
effectiveness, the questionnaire should be administered without rehabilitation
training.
Some examples of existing questionnaires that measure the parameters listed above
and can be used in combination are the short form of the National Eye Institute’s
Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25) (impact on quality of life), Massof’s
Activity Inventory, Turano’s Assessment of Mobility, The Melbourne Low Vision
Index, VA VFQ-48, and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (depression).
Other possible scales for assessing depression include the GDS-15 (Geriatric
Depression Scale) and Beck’s Depression Scale (short form). The questionnaires used
should be appropriately matched to the age range of subjects enrolled in the clinical
investigation and should match the population being studied. For example, the MMPI
(Minnesota MultiPhasic Personality Inventory) would not be suitable as a tool
because it was based on a psychiatric prison population.

e. Statistical Analysis Plan
The protocol for a pivotal clinical study should include a statistical analysis plan (SAP). The
SAP should describe how the study results will be analyzed and provide specific hypothesis
tests and/or confidence intervals for analyses of primary and secondary endpoints of device
safety and effectiveness. Effectiveness analyses should compare the outcomes for the active
experimental device to the control condition (e.g., inactive device) or sham procedure control
group. The SAP should include a sample size justification based upon the number of subjects
needed to evaluate all primary effectiveness and safety outcomes, and important secondary
outcomes. When testing multiple hypotheses, the plan should address how the overall Type I
error rate will be preserved. Based upon your best estimate of expected loss to follow-up, you
should adjust the number to be enrolled so that you have sufficient patient numbers at key
time points. Your trial should be sized to address the possibility of continued follow-up 5-10
years after implantation for your clinical trial cohort (i.e., studies that FDA may require under
21 CFR 814.82(a)(2) as a condition of the approval of your future marketing application). 2
For studies that include long-term follow-up, your IDE must include consent by all subjects
for such follow-up (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)).In addition, post-approval studies enrolling new
subjects may be required.

20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Your IDE application must include a copy all information to be provided to subjects to obtain
informed consent (21 CFR 812.20(b)(11)). In your application we recommend that you
explain your method of administering the informed consent documents (ICD), and how this
method will account for the functional visual limitations of subjects enrolling in the study.
Your ICD must contain the elements specified in 21 CFR 50.25.
Required elements include, but are not limited to:
•

a description of the procedures to be followed in the study (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1)),

•

the expected duration of the subject's participation in the study (21 CFR 50.25(a)(1));
this includes any long term follow-up,

•

a description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the patient (21
CFR 50.25(a)(2)); this includes surgical and postoperative risks and complications
and short- and long-term risks and discomforts resulting from implantation of the
prosthetic device and any associated electronics,

•

a description of any benefit to the subject or to others which may reasonably be
expected from the research (21 CFR 50.25(a)(3)), and

•

any additional costs to the subject that may result from participation in the research
(21 CFR 50.25(b)(3).

In addition, we recommend that an ICD for a retinal prosthesis describe:
•

the frequency of subject tests required for the study,

•

options for explantation should the subject be dissatisfied with the implanted device,
and

•

the need for periodic ocular health evaluations by an eye care professional beyond
completion of the study, for as long as the implant remains in the eye.

9. Patient Information and Labeling
Your investigational plan must include copies of all labeling for the device (21 CFR
812.25(f)). Labeling of investigational medical devices must comply with 21 CFR 812.5.
Among other requirements, the label must include the statement, "CAUTION-Investigational device. Limited by Federal (or United States) law to investigational use," and
the label or other labeling must describe all relevant contraindications, hazards, adverse
effects, interfering substances or devices, warnings, and precautions. See CDRH Device
Advice, IDE FAQs
(http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/HowtoMarketYourDev
ice/InvestigationalDeviceExemptionIDE/ucm051480.htm) for additional information about
IDE labeling.
What follows is information specific to the labeling of investigational retinal prostheses.

21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Indications for Use
The labeling should be consistent with the indications for use statement that identifies the
intended patient population. For these prosthetic devices, the target population should be a
visually impaired disease population that may benefit from using the device.
Contraindications
The labeling must include information on all relevant contraindications (21 CFR 812.5(a)).
Contraindications are conditions under which the device should not be used because the risk
of use clearly outweighs any possible benefit. Contraindications may include coexisting
retinal pathologies or prior damage to an element of the visual pathway, such as the optic
nerve.
Warnings and Precautions
The labeling must describe all relevant hazards, adverse effects, interfering substances or
devices, warnings, and precautions (21 CFR 812.5(a)). For example, your labeling must alert
users to potentially injurious outcomes associated with use or misuse of the device and must
describe actions users should take to avoid potentially injurious events. The precautions in
your labeling should alert users to exercise special care for the proper use of the device.
Depending on the device design or component composition, applicable warnings or
precautions may include information about the compatibility of the device with various
strength field MRI scanners, wireless devices, metal detectors, high voltage sources, and
devices emitting strong magnetic fields. This information should include possible interactions
with metal detectors, diathermy units, or cardiac defibrillators. Warnings or precautions about
device use during specific activities such as walking, running, and swimming in specific
environments may also be appropriate for some devices. These warnings should also be
reflected on the patient implant card.
General Directions for Use
We recommend you include directions for preparation and use of the device and information
about environmental conditions for storing the device, batteries, and any accessories.
Surgical Procedure
The labeling should describe steps to prepare or validate device functionality before
implantation. We recommend you include a clear description of all device components,
inserters, viewing devices, electronics, accessories, and surgical tools used for implantation.
Labeling should also describe the implantation procedure itself. It should indicate that the
procedure should be performed under sterile conditions in an operating room. It should
specify, for example, the routes of entry, the incisions, the sutures and dressing, all drugs, and
all devices (such as the types and/or sizes of vitrectomy cannulae) used in the surgical
procedure. It should also describe any adverse events that can be anticipated to occur during
the procedure, and how to prevent, manage, and/or mitigate them.

22

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

The labeling should further recommend use of a consistent medication regimen, including an
anesthesia regimen, during the procedure and throughout the course of the study, as
appropriate and feasible. Finally, it should describe the post-operative test procedures to
verify implant integrity and proper placement.
To the degree possible, we recommend that subjects’ medication remain unaltered both
before and during the clinical trial, other than those drugs prescribed in the clinical protocol
for the post-operative recovery period. Additional surgery or medication used to treat
unanticipated ocular conditions/complications should be recorded.
Accessory Devices
In addition, we recommend your labeling describe any accessory devices that are packaged
with your device when no separate labeling for such accessory devices is available. For
example, labeling should include a description of a surgical insertion or positioning device
packaged with your device.
Subject Materials
In the IDE application, as part of the investigational plan, you should include items such as
the subject user guide and implant card that will be provided to subjects.
