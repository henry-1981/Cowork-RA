FOREWORD

The Bureau of Radiological Health conducts a national program to limit man's
exposure to ionizing and nonionizing radiations. To this end, the Bureau (1) develops
criteria and recommends standards for safe limits of radiation exposure, (2) develops
methods and techniques for controlling radiation exposure, (3) plans and conducts
research to determine health effects of radiation exposure, (4) provides technical
assistance to agencies responsible for radiological health control programs, and (5)

conducts an electronic product radiation contro] program to protect the public health
and safety.

The Bureau publishes its findings in appropriate scientific journals and technical
report and note series prepared by Bureau divisions and offices. Under a memorandum
of agreement between the World Health Organization and the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, three WHO Collaborating Centers have been established within
the Bureau of Radiological Health, FDA:

WHO Collaborating Center for Standardization of Protection Against Nonionizing
Radiations (Office of the Bureau Director)

WHO Collaborating Center for Training and General Tasks in Radiation Medicine
(Division of Training and Medical Applications)

WHO Collaborating Center for Nuclear Medicine (Division of Radioactive
Materials and Nuclear Medicine)

As a WHO Collaborating Center, the Bureau makes available its technical reports and
notes to participating WHO members.

Bureau publications provide an effective mechanism for disseminating results of
intramural and contractor projects. The publications are distributed to State and local
radiological health personnel, Bureau technical staff, Bureau advisory committee
members, information services, industry, hospitals, laboratories, schools, the press,
and other concerned individuals. These publications are for sale by the Government
Printing Office and/or the National Technical Information Service.

Readers are encouraged to report errors or omissions to the Bureau. Your
comments or requests for further information are also solicited.

PREFACE

Testing programs for enforcement of the Food and Drug Administration's
performance standard for microwave ovens, promulgated under the Radiation Con-
trol for Health and Safety Act, are performed by Agency field personnel as well
as State and local radiation control personnel. These two groups test microwave
ovens located in homes, food preparation establishments, and in
dealer/distributor showrooms and warehouses for compfiance with the microwave
oven standard. This manual has been prepared in support of the field test
programs to provide a detailed reference document covering the major aspects of
field testing of microwave ovens. Substantial assistance was provided by the
Bureau of Radiological Health's Division of Electronic Products regarding use of
instruments and by personnel of the Executive Director of Regional Operations

regarding the scope of the manual.

ABSTRACT

This manual sets forth guidance and procedures for field testing microwave
ovens for compliance with the microwave emission and safety interlock operation
requirements of the Federal radiation safety performance standard. It presents
background material and complete instructions for carrying out the necessary
tests and also describes procedures for completing form FD 2536, "Microwave Oven
Field Test Record," which is used to report the data to the Bureau of Radiologi-
cal Health. It has been prepared to provide a detailed reference document that
will be particularly useful to FDA, State, and local radiation control personnel
responsible for the field testing of microwave ovens.

PROCEDURES FOR FIELD TESTING MICROWAVE OVENS

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This manual sets forth guidance and procedures for performing microwave
oven compliance tests under FDA Compliance Program 7333.01, Field Compliance
Testing of Microwave Ovens. The procedures will allow one to determine
compliance with the two major safety aspects of the performance standard for
microwave ovens: (1) microwave emission and (2) safety interlock operation.
The remaining requirements of the standard, with one exception, are met by fixed
design characteristics that are not subject to change after an oven is put into
use. Compliance with these requirements is determined by the Bureau in its
reports review program and by laboratory testing. The notable exception is the
interlock monitor requirement. This is not amenable to field testing because it

would, in most cases, require destructive testing, disassembly of the product,
or both.

Data provided to FDA on microwave oven field tests through submission of
completed form FD 2536 “Microwave Oven Field Test Record," is one of the
essential elements in the continuing compliance program of the Bureau of Radio-
logical Health. Testing in accordance with these procedures will provide the
data necessary to complete form FD 2536. Such data are also necessary to the
Bureau's continuing efforts to ensure that microwave ovens manufactured prior to

the effective date of the standard (prestandard ovens) comply with the voluntary
industry standard.

Although this manual contains complete instructions and background
material, it is recommended that the tests described herein be performed by per-
sonnel who have been specifically trained in the proper methods for carrying out
these tests. The manual is intended to supplement training courses that include
demonstrations of proper test methods. These courses are normally presented by
Regional Radiological Health Representatives of the Food and Drug Administra-
tion. Since the test procedures described in this manual include procedures to
determine the radiation safety status of microwave ovens that have been exposed
to worst-case conditions of use and misuse, it is essential that inspection per-
sonnel be well trained in proper inspection techniques in order that personnel
exposure to microwave energy may be minimized or prevented,

2.0 MICROWAVE OVEN STANDARD

The performance standard for microwave ovens, 21 CFR 1030.10, was published
as a final rule on October 6, 1970, and became applicable to all microwave ovens
manufactured after October 6, 1971. The principal requirements of the standard
are paraphrased as follows:

1. Microwave emission shall not exceed l milliwatt per square cent meter
(mW/cm2) at 5 cm or more from the external surface of the oven prior to

acquisition by the purchaser and shall not exceed 5 mW/cme at any time
thereafter.

2. Microwave ovens shall have at least two safety interlocks, one of which
must be concealed.

3. Failure of any single mechanical or electrical component shall not
cause all safety interlocks to become inoperative.

4. Service adjustments or service procedures shall not cause safety
interlocks to become inoperative or the microwave emission to exceed
allowable limits.

5. Insertion of objects into the oven cavity shall not result in microwave
emission in excess of the limits through reradiation.

A series of amendments to the standard has been promulgated bringing it to
its present form. The principal amendments and their effective dates are as
follows: °

1. A means will be provided to monitor one or both required inter locks
which shall cause the oven to become inoperable if the monitored
interlock(s) fail in an unsafe condition. (Effective for all ovens
manufacturered on or after August 7, 1974.)

2. One of the required interlocks (designated as primary) shall limit
emission to 1 mW/cm2 and another (designated as secondary) shall limit
emission to 5 mW/cm¢ upon opening the_oven door. (Effective for all ovens
manufactured on or after August /, 1974. )

3. User and service precaution labels and specific user and service safety
instructions in manuals and cookbooks are required with all ovens
manufactured on or after October 3, 1975.

4, Changes to clarify and strengthen requirements for interlock
concealment and prevention of intrusion of objects are effective for all
ovens manufactured on or after November 8, 1976.

5. An amendment to the regulations requires uncoded date of manuf acture
labels, i.e., a label with the month and year of manufacture, for all prod-

ucts for which there are standards, including microwave ovens manufactured
on or after January 1, 1975.

The standard also requires that microwave emission be measured with a
prescribed oven load through at least one stirrer cycle with the oven door
closed and with the door fixed in any position which allows the oven to operate.
Instruments for measuring microwave emission must meet certain response time,
detector dimension, and accuracy specifications (see Appendix I, A-4).

Related regulations also require that each microwave oven produced after
October 6, 1971, must bear a label certifying that it conforms to the standard
applicable at the time of manufacture. It must also bear a label with name and
address of the manufacturer (or the private label seller when sold under a brand
orner than the manufacturer's) and the place of manufacture (which may be
coded}.

3.0 MICROWAVE OVENS, DESCRIPTYON AND OPERATION

The microwave oven is basically a metal cavity provided with a source of
microwave energy and equipped with a door and door seal which, when closed,
effectively prevents microwave energy from escaping from the cavity. The micro-


wave source is invariably a magnetron tube. The door is usually equipped with a
viewing window that is covered by a metal screen which blocks microwave energy
transmission through the window. The oven is equipped with interlocks that
prevent generation of microwave energy when the door is opened. Most oven
cavities are ventilated to remove moisture and hot air. Ventilation into the
cavity is through perforations which are small enough to prevent the escape of

microwave energy. Ventilation through the cabinet is through screens or
louvers. On some ovens, some venting occurs through an air gap around the door
seal.

Most ovens sold in the U.S. are intended for use in the home. Some,

however, are intended for commercial use in restaurants, food vending
establishments, fast food outlets, etc. The standard makes no distinction
between those intended for either use. However, most commercial ovens are iden-
tifiable by their extensive use of Stainless steel, simple controls (dial or
pushbutton timers), heavy duty latches, and the lack of viewing screens. Most
home ovens are in the 650-watt Power range, whereas commercial ovens may range
from 600 to 2400 watts or higher. Most commercial ovens will have commercial
Underwriters Laboratories labels and National Sanitation Foundation labels.
Note that ovens intended for household use will frequently be found in commer-
cial use, particularly in smal] privately owned eating establishments.

3.1 OVEN CONTROLS

Microwave ovens have a variety of power and off/on controls that must be
understood to ensure that emission tests are performed under the proper
operating conditions. (Figs. 1 through 4.)

3.1.1 Power

While some ovens operate at constant power, others have provisions for
setting microwave power in the form of (a) a power selector switch, (b) a ste
or continuously variable power control, or (c) cook/defrost selectors. Type (a)
usually occurs in the higher power commercial ovens equipped with two magnetrons
and may allow for selection of either magnetron or both. Types (b) and 70) uSU-
ally control power by varying the magnetron duty cycle (ratio of off-time to on-
time of a repetitive off-on cycle) with an electronic or electromechanical con-
trol. Off-on cycles may be as short as 1 second or as long as 1 minute. A few
reduce power for defrosting or low power cooking by reducing the magnetron
supply valtage and hence its output power.

3.1.2 Off/On Controls, Timers

All microwave ovens are equipped with a timer to stop microwave generation
at the end of a predetermined period. These are usually rotary or linear dial
timers or rotary, digital, pushbutton, or digital touchpad timers. Pushbutton
timers are generally found only on commercial ovens and frequently are labeled
by type of food rather than time. Some commercial ovens have both pushbutton
and dial timers. Digital touchpad timers invariably use digital logic to con-
trol time and often provide programmability and digital power control.

On many ovens the timer is the only off/on control other than the safety
inter locks. On these ovens, an’ time the door is closed and the timer is on,
the oven will produce microwave energy. On such ovens the timer should always
be turned off ( i.e., set to zero) when closing the oven door except when
microwave generation is desired. This will help avoid accidental operation of

an oven without a load in place which might result in oven damage, e.g., due to
overheating of the magnetron (which can in some cases lead to burnout of the
magnetron).

In addition to a timer, some ovens are equipped with start/stop controls.
Frequently the start controls will be labeled "cook." Such ovens require
operation of the start control to turn on the magnetron, however, on some ovens
with “cook/defrost" controls, the "cook" control is simply an operational mode
selector and has no effect on starting the oven. On some ovens with "stop" con-
trols it may not be possible to open the door until the "stop" button has been
pressed or the timer turned off.

Because of these variations in operating procedures, it is necessary to
familiarize oneself with the operating controls and their functions before
attempting to test an oven.

«

3.2 INTERLOCKS AND MONITORS

Interlocks are normally actuated as a result of motion of a latching mecha-
nism or motion of the door. Those operated by door motion are usually actuated
either by a pin or other protrusion that enters a hole in the oven face when the
door closes or by a fixed or pivoted arm attached to the door. The arm may also
serve to limit door travel or control door closing.

Latch interlocks have the advantage of being able to terminate generation
of microwave energy with little or no door motion. These types of interlocks
can usually be identified by visual inspection. Absence of a latch, of course,
precludes a latch interlock. Virtually all ovens with a latch will have one or
more latch actuated interlocks. Latch release controls may be on the door or on
the oven control panel.

In some ovens the latch (but not necessarily the interlock) is electrically
actuated, preventing the door from being opened while microwave energy is being
generated. On some of these the door may be pulled out slightly against the

latch (typically 1 to 3 millimeters) while the oven is operat ing, On such ovens
it is appropriate to perform the “door opening" test (see 4.2.2} with the door

in the pulled out position.

The interlock monitor, a device to render the oven inoperable in the event
of interlock failure(s), is required on all ovens produced on or after August 7,
1974, The interlock failure sensing element is usually a smap-action switch
similar to the interlock switches, which is activated by door motion and is
timed to close after the interlock{s) have opened and to open before the
interlock(s) close. The oven is usually rendered inoperable by causing a fuse
or similar device to open the main power circuit within the oven after interlock

failure(s) have occurred and been detected. In some units the fuse may
interrupt power to the solenoid of a relay, and in others a latching relay may
be used. The relays in turn interrupt power to the magnetron. In all cases,

repairs must be made before operation can be restored.

3.3 DOOR SEALS

A microwave oven must have a door to allow insertion and removal of food.
This door must be designed to prevent the escape of the microwave energy with
which the oven cooks. By making the door of microwave reflective metal, it can
be made to contain the microwave energy with relative ease. The more difficult

job is in designing the door-to-oven seal to prevent the escape of microwave
energy.

A number of mechanisms have been developed for this purpose, which we refer
to generically as door seals. Some require a physically tight fit between oven
and door so that the cavity and door effectively become a closed metallic box
with no electrical discontinuity between door and oven cavity. On the other
hand, sealing mechanisims have been developed which can function with no contact
between door and oven and can, in fact, operate with an air gap between the two.
The various types are described briefly below. They may be used singly or in a
variety of combinations. It should be noted that the various door screens,
which are provided to allow the user to view the inside of the cavity, do not
allow microwave energy to pass through them but reflect it as though they were a
solid surface. This phenomena is a function of the size of the holes in the
screen and the wavelength of the microwave energy. The principal requirement is
that the holes be a small fraction of a wavelength in size. °

3.3.1 Metal-to-Metal Seals

The name of this seal is self descriptive. It requires an intimate elec-
trical contact between the metal of the cavity and the metal of the door, and it
effectively makes the door and oven cavity a closed metallic box. As long as an
adequate metal-to-metal contact is provided, microwave energy will be contained
within the cavity. However, due to the effects of wear and other use factors,
it is difficult to maintain an effective metal-to-metal seal over the life of a
product. Consequently, this is now the least used seal. Its most common form
is that of a resilient metal mesh gasket attached to the oven door that makes
conductive contact with the metal face of the cavity. In combination (microwave
and thermal energy) ovens, a metal mesh gasket may be the primary seal or may be
used with other types of seals and be present primarily to prevent heat
transfer. In the latter instance it may contact an insulated rather than a

conductive surface and form a secondary capacitive microwave seal. "Capacitive"
seals are described below.

3.3.2 “Capacitive” Seals

This is an improvement over the metal-to-metal contacting seal and evolved
from a type of contacting seal. This seal used a large flexible metal plate
which pressed against a wide border of metal around the front of the cavity,
generally referred to as the oven face. Unfortunately, arcing frequently oc-
curred Detween the seal plate on the door and the oven face wherever the seal
plate was not in intimate contact with the oven face. To eliminate the arcing,
the seal plate was covered with a thin layer of insulative coating. While this
breaks the metal-to-metal contact, it prevents arcing and continues to seal the
oven if the mating surfaces are wide enough and come into close enough contact.
This type of seal is known as a “capacitive" seal because the two metallic
surfaces with an insulator between them resemble a capacitor in construction.
Actually, the interface created by the “capacitive” seal effectively creates a
very low resistance path between the oven and the door for the microwave energy.

Consequently, the microwave energy behaves as though a metal-to-metal contact
exists between cavity and door.

While most manufacturers use the thin flexible metal seal plate, at least
one manufacturer has succeeded in using a rigid plate on the door as well as on
the cavity face. This type of seal is highly effective and overcomes many of
the problems of the metal-to-metal seal. The better “capacitive" seals (or
"capacitive" and choke seal combinations} can be expected to last the life of


the product with little or no degradation of performance. The "capacitive" seal
plate on the door of many ovens is surrounded by a choke seal to block
transmission of energy which escapes through the "capacitive" seal. Choke seals
are described below. Some “capacitive” seals operate effectively with a smal |
air gap between the door and cavity. Therefore, a test of tightness of fit is
not necessarily a valid check for indication of leakage with this type of seal.
The dielectric coatings may be formed by colorless anodizing of aluminum and may
not be visually apparent.

3.3.3 Choke Seals

Choke seals do not require either a metallic contact or an intimate contact
between insulated surfaces of the oven and door to function. The principle on
which choke seals function involves electromagnetic resonance of mechanical
structures whose dimensions are related to the wavelength of the microwave
frequencies involved, in this case the 2450 MHz of the magnetron. Physically,
the choke joint is made up of an air or plastic filled channel around the pe-
riphery of the cavity. The choke may be located in the oven face, the mating
face of the door, or in a portion of the door which is inserted into the cavity.
It may also be in the form of a channel in a shoulder around the periphery of
the inner surface of the door, such that the choke, when the door is closed,
will surround a mating shoulder built up around the cavity mouth.

The choke serves to reflect microwave energy, which attempts to pass between
the oven and door, back into the oven cavity. Chokes vary in design somewhat,
so that some are effective with substantial gaps between door and oven, while
others require a tighter fit. The combination of a choke surrounding a
"Capacitive" seal is very effective and allows effective sealing with larger
gaps between oven and door than can be tolerated in "capacitive" seals alone.
The presence of a choke is not always apparent because all or part of the door
surface, including the choke, may be covered by plastic. Variations of the
choke make up the majority of the seals in use today. This type of seal is
usually the least affected by wear and use of the product.

3.3.4 Absorbent Seals

There are two types of absorbent seals, resistive and magnetic; both are
generally a plastic.or synthetic rubber that is filled with carbon or a ferrous
material. They are usually used to absorb harmonic energy that may not be
blocked by capacitive or choke seals, but they may function equally well at the
fundamental frequency. In some instances absorbent seals are designed to per-
form a secondary sealing function at the magnetron frequency to minimize leakage
from a “capacitive” or choke seal. Some ovens use a "capacitive" seal, a choke
seal, and an absorbent seal.

4.0 MICROWAVE OVEN TESTING
4.1 GENERAL TEST INSTRUCTIONS
4.1.1 Prestandard Versus Poststandard Ovens
The performance standard for microwave ovens became effective October 6,
1971, and applies to all ovens manufactured on or after that date, i.e., post-

standard ovens. (This includes those manufactured before the effective date of
the standard but voluntarily certified by their manufacturers.) Prestandard

ovens, those produced prior to the effective date and not certified, are not

required to meet the standard. These are tested for proper interlock function
and for compliance with the so called “voluntary industry standard" of 10 mW /cme
for microwave emission. The prestandard ovens also present certain special

testing problems.

Most prestandard ovens were not equipped with latch-actuated interlocks,
nor was any limit applied to the emission that may occur upon door opening prior
to the point where the interlock turns off the magnetron. Many of these ovens
emit a high burst of microwave energy every time the door is opened. The magni-
tude of the burst is limited only by the rapidity with which the door is opened.
Consequent ly, special procedures and special care must be exercised when testing
such ovens for interlock function.

Poststandard ovens must have two safety interlocks. At least one safety
interlock must stop microwave generation upon door opening before the emission
limits of the standard are exceeded. As with closed door leakage, this is 1
mW/cm2 prior to purchase and 5 mW/cem2 thereafter. Consequently, most
poststandard ovens have one or two latch-actuated interlocks that actuate before
door motion begins. In later poststandard ovens (produced on or after August 7,
1974), the second required interlock must also stop microwave generation before
the 5 mW/cm@ limit is exceeded. As a result, interlock function tests on
poststandard ovens are simpler and inherently less hazardous to both personnel
and instrumentation. Determination of prestandard or poststandard status of an
oven can be made in several ways.

1. Presence or absence of certification label: Prestandard ovens will not
have a label certifying compliance with the standard, All poststandard
ovens are required to have a permanent label at the time of manufacture.
However, a smal] percentage of these may have lost the certification label
since being put into service,

2. Date of manufacture: This will appear in code either as part of the
serial number or model number on some prestandard and on all poststandard
ovens manufactured prior to January 1, 1975. The month and year of manu-
facture will be printed or written out in an uncoded form on all ovens
produced after January 1, 1975. Decoding information is available through
the Regional Radiological Health Representative (RRHR) in the FDA regional
offices. (See Appendix II for addresses of FDA regional offices and the
States that they cover.)

3. Date of purchase: The owner's statement of date of purchase, if prior
to October 1971, will identify prestandard ovens as such. (A small number
of ovens were certified prior to October 6, 1971. These will have certifi-
cation labels and are considered to be poststandard ovens.)

4. Oven Models: For most ovens it is possible to determine from the model
number whether it is a prestandard or poststandard oven. Microwave oven
model lists are available through the RRHR in the FDA regional offices.

If status cannot be determined, one should assume that the oven is
prestandard and test it accordingly.
4.1.2 Position of Test Probe

The microwave oven standard requires that measurements be made at not less

than 5 centimeters from the external surface of the oven. External surface, by
definition, includes door handies, latches, and control knobs. Therefore, the


test probe should always be positioned so that the center of the detector in the
probe is 5 cm from any external surface, j.e., as though the spacer cone were
spherical in shape rather than conical. (Some newer instruments may be equipped
with hemispherical or spherical spacers.) Examples of correct and incorrect
location of the probe are shown in figure 5. The probe should normally be
positioned so that it is perpendicular to the plane of the surface being
surveyed, e.g., to the front, top, sides, or bottom as illustrated in figures 6
through 9. In some instances the source of a leak may be a door seam formed by
surfaces which meet at an angle rather than in a plane, and the direction of
leakage may be suspected to be in a direction other than perpendicular to the
surface being scanned. In such cases the probe may be rotated around the corner
jin a plane which is perpendicular to the surfaces which form the corner. As
shown in the photographs, the probe should always be held only by the handle
when in use.

4.1.3 Oven Loads

In order to provide uniform test conditions, the standard requires that all
emission tests be performed with a specific load. This is to be 275 +15 milli-
liters of tap water, centered on the load carrying surface of the oven cavity.
The water should have an initial temperature of 20 +5 degrees Celsius. Its
container should be of nonconductive material, e.g., glass or plastic, and have
an inside diameter of approximately 8.5 centimeters, such as a low form beaker

(Fig. 10). Such a load must be used for all compliance measurements of micro-
wave emission from a microwave oven.

Figure 10

When testing for interlock function, particularly with prestandard ovens,
it is best to use larger amounts of water initially to reduce leakage and
thereby minimize the possibility of probe damage or personnel exposure. If
larger amounts are used for this test, be sure to change the load to 275
milliliters for subsequent emission tests.

When testing ovens that have more than one vertically spaced position for
the load bearing shelf, tests should be performed with the standard load
centered on the shelf and with the shelf located in each position that will
allow proper placement of the load. The shelf position that yields the highest
leakage is the appropriate position for the test. The variable position shelf
will generally only be found in so-called combination ovens, those designed to

utilize microwave energy and conventional heat simultaneously, or ovens equipped
with browning elements.

Ovens should never be operated without having a load in place. Some ovens,

particularly older models, may be damaged if operated without a load. Damage may
include magnetron burnout.

13


4.1.4 Power Settings

When performing emission tests, oven controls should be set to the highest
available power setting in order to produce the maximum possible emission. For
those ovens that provide defrost functions, reduced power, or variable power by
cycling the magnetron off and on, care must be taken to assure that all emission
tests are made with the controls in a continuous power mode in order to preclude
testing while the magnetron is in an off cycle. On such ovens, cook/defrost con-
trols should be set to cook and variable power controls should be set to full
power. However, when testing for interlock function, power should be set at the
lowest setting that provides continuous power (no off-on cycling of the
magnetron) in order to minimize the possibility of probe damage or self-exposure
to excessive levels of microwave energy. All prestandard ovens provide only
continuous power, so they should always be set at the lowest power setting
available during interlock testing.

Pa

4.2 SPECIFIC TEST PROCEDURES FOR MICROWAVE EMISSION (LEAKAGE) AND INTERLOCK
FUNCTION

The specific tests to be performed on microwave ovens are closed-door leak-
age, door-opening leakage, and failed interlock. The closed-door leakage test is
intended to determine the maximum leakage at any point 5 centimeters or more
from the closest surface of the microwave oven. Areas that should be tested in-
clude the door seal, viewing window, control panels, ventilation and other
openings in the oven's outer surface, and the line cord. The door-opening test
is intended to determine the maximum leakage that will occur 5 centimeters from
any surface at the door seal upon unlatching or opening the door. The failed-
interlock test is intended to detect “failure of an interlock or the interlock
system. However it should be noted that failure of Jess than the entire
inter lock system will usually not be detectable without disassembly of the oven
and detailed knowledge of the oven's circuitry.

On ovens without a latch interlock, the door-opening leakage levels will
typically be higher than closed-door leakage. On ovens with one or more latch

inter locks, closed-daor leakage and door-opening leakage will usually be identi-
cal. However, if the maximum closed-door leakage occurs through the viewing

screen or at a location other than the door seal area, closed-door leakage may
be higher than the level recorded for door-opening leakage.

Prior to operating the oven, operational procedures should be discussed with
the owner or user to ensure that the function of all controls are clearly under-
stood by the surveyor and to ensure that no peculiar characteristics of the
individual oven are overlooked that might affect its operation or safety.

IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONS

For prestandard ovens, it is important to establish whether or not exces-
Sive emission is present as soon as possible in order to prevent self-exposure.
Consequently, the test procedures contain unique precautionary steps in
appropriate places for use when testing prestandard ovens. There are two
additional precautions that should always be taken to prevent exposure to ex-
cessive microwave emission.

1. CAUTION: Whenever emission exceeds 5 mW/cm2, the probe must be held by

its handle grip only and at arms length from the body. This will maintain
the hand at a distance of 8 or more inches from the oven when the probe
Spacer is touching the oven. Consequently, the emission level at the hand

14

Will be approximately 1/16 of the level measured by the survey meter. If
at the same time the body is maintained at a distance of 20 inches or more
from the oven by holding the probe at arms Tength, the emission level at
the body will be approximately 1/100 of the level measured by the survey
meter. CAUTION: If leakage exceeds 100 ml/cm2, terminate the test.

2. When performing door opening tests, do not place any part of the hand
across the door seam where leakage might occur. If it is necessary to
place fingers or other parts of the hand near or across the door seam to
Properly control opening of the door, be certain that the oven does not
leak in excess of 5 mW/cm2 at the point where the hand will be placed.

4.2.1 Test Preparation

STEP 1. Examine the oven for evidence of damage to seals, latches and
hinges or looseness of the door. CAUTION: If any damage or looseness is

apparent, excercise the utmost care to avoid exposure to possible excess

leakage. Damage and looseness are most likely to be found on prestandard ovens,

particularly those in commercial use. Maximum leakage can be expected where
damage or Tooseness exists, and leakage testing should begin at these points.
Remember that a gap between the door and oven is normal with some door seals and
is not always an indication of wear or damage. However, such seals were not
used on any prestandard commercial ovens. A gap on such ovens should be
considered to indicate possible excess leakage.

STEP 2. Examine the oven controls and determine the correct procedure for
starting and stopping microwave generation.

STEP 3. Place a standard load, 275 ml of water, in the center of the load
bearing surface. During the test, change the water as necessary to prevent
boiling. CAUTION: Handle hot water carefully to avoid scalding from water or

steam,

STEP 4. Prepare the test instrument for operation in accordance with the
Procedures in Appendix I. Set it for fast response (Narda 8100 or Holaday 1500)
and use the 10 or 20 mW/cm2 range for poststandard ovens. When testing prestan-
dard ovens with the Narda 8100 or 8200, use the red or yellow probe respectively
on the 200 or 100 mW/cm2 range; if using a Holaday instrument, use the 100
mW/cm2 range. Place any unused probes as far from the oven as practical.
Anytime the full-scale reading is reached, switch to the next highest full-scale
range, rezeroing and changing probes if necessary.

STEP 5, With the oven door closed set the timer for approximately 1
minute of operation, or for uncalibrated pushbutton timers select one of the
buttons providing a longer operating period. If required as a separate step,
activate the microwave generator, é€.g., press the cook or start button.

4.2.2 Closed Door Leakage Tests

STEP 6. Scan the door seal area at a rate of about 1 inch per second,
looking for the point or points of maximum leakage. Whenever an upscale
deflection of the meter indicates increasing leakage, reduce the scanning speed
or stop the scan as necessary to determine the approximate magnitude of the

emission. There will usually be some variation in leakage as a function of
time. If this variation occurs at a very slow rate, it may be necessary to scan
at a slower rate to ensure finding the point of maximum leakage. Scan the

viewing screen when present, control panels, ventilation openings, line cord

15


(close to the oven), and any other openings in the outer wrap of the oven.
Determine whether or not any emission exists at levels higher than that measured
at the door seal area. Tf no measureable leakage was found during this proce-
dure, determine whether or not the oven is operating by checking to see if the
load is increasing in temperature. If the load is not heating, the oven is not
Operating and cannot be tested until repaired. Detection of microwave leakage
and heating of the load are the only reliable indicators of microwave
generation. Cook lights or similar indicators may operate whether or not micro-
Waves are being generated and, therefore, are not reliable indicators of oven
operation.

STEP 7a. Set the meter to slow response (unless it is a Narda 8200 or an
unmodified Narda 8100, see Appendix I for details) and to the lowest full-scale
range that is higher than the maximum emission already measured. Replace the
water load with water of the proper temperature. Place the probe at the point
where maximum emission was measured previously. | Locate the precise point of
maximum emission, and determine the maximum Steady state leakage. Record this
at item 30a on form FD 2536 unless Step 7b below is applicable. (See discussion
of correction factor in Appendix I). CAUTION: If the maximum leakage exceeds
100 mW/cm@, terminate the test, do not perform the door opening test, but go
directly to the failed interlock test by performing step 9.

STEP 7b. For ovens for which leakage is less than 100 mW/cm2 and in which
more than one vertical shelf position is provided, repeat steps 2 through 7 for
each vertical location of the shelf on which the standard test load can be prop-
erly positioned. Note in item 40 (Remarks) the position of the shelf that

resulted in the highest leakage and record the leakage from this shelf position
at item 30a.

4.2.3 Door Opening Test

This test will normally be preceded by the closed-door leakage test
described above. If for any reason this test must be performed first, perform
steps 1 through 5 (4.2.1) above and then proceed with step 8 below. When
following normal procedures, follow steps 6 and 7 above (4.2.2) with step 8
below.

STEP 8. Check the water load and replace with cool water if necessary.
Select a meter range of 10 or 20 mW/cm2 or higher as shown to be necessary by
the closed-door leakage reading made previously. Anytime the full-scale reading
is reached, switch to the next highest range, rezeroing and changing probes if
necessary. Locate the probe tip on the door seal at the point where maximum
leakage was noted in the preceding test or, if a maximum could not be located,
on the side of the door opposite the hinges.

a. Oven without latch interlocks: Activate the oven and slowly open the
oven door until the oven turns off or until an emission level of 100 mW /cme
is observed, whichever occurs first. CAUTION: If leakage exceeds 100

mW /cm2 , terminate the test and proceed to step 9. If leakage is less than
100 mW/cm¢, set the meter to the lowest full-scale range that is higher

than the maximum emission already measured. Open the door to a point just
prior to interlock cutoff and scan the door seal area to find the point of
maximum leakage. Switch to slow response time (except for the unmodified

Narda 8100, see Appendix I) and hold the probe at the point of maximum
leakage. Slowly open the door several times to determine the maximum leak-
age prior to interlock cutoff. Record this value at line 30b and record
"2" (no} at line 29 on form FD 2536.

16

(It is unlikely, on an operating oven, that the door opening will reach a
distance of 2 inches before cutoff due to interlock actuation or before
leakage exceeds 100 mW/cm@. If the door should open 2 inches before inter-
lock cutoff or before leakage exceeds 100 mW/cm2 in this step or step 8b,
record "1" (yes) on form FD 2536 and omit step 9 below.)

b. Ovens with latch interlocks: Slowly move the latch or latch release to
the released position (and, if necessary, slowly open the door) until the
oven turns off or until an emission level of 100 mW /cme is reached,
whichever occurs first. Most ovens will turn off before the door begins to
open; however, some detectable door motion (1 or 2 millimeters) may occur
with some latch interlocks that are properly adjusted. CAUTION: If leak-
age exceeds 100 mW/cm2, terminate the test and proceed to step 9. Tf the
oven shuts off before any perceptible door motion occurs or before any per-
ceptible increase in leakage occurs, leakage upon door opening will be the
Same as the maximum closed-door leakage measured at the door seal area. If
this has not been previously determined, repeat step 7 for the door seal
area only. Record the leakage at line 30b and record "2" (no) at line 29
of form FD 2536, If there is a perceptible increase in leakage as the
latch is released or as the door is opened, proceed as in step 8a to
determine the maximum steady-state leakage. Record this at line 30b and
record "2" (no) at line 29 of FD 2536.

c. Qvens with electrically controlled latches: (For description see 3.2.)
With the oven operating determine (1) whether or not the oven must be
turned off by the action of the timer or the stop button before the door
can be opened and (2) whether or not the oven door can be pulled out to the
limit allowed by the latch without shutting off. If the oven continues to
operate after the latch has released the door, note in line 40 of FD 2536
(Remarks) that the latch interlock has failed and proceed to step 9. If
the oven turns off normally, activate the oven and pull the door as far
open as it will go without shutting off {i.e., to the limit allowed by the
latch, or to the point just prior to interlock cutoff). Set the meter on
the same range used to determine closed door leakage (unless this value was
close to full scale, in which case go to the next higher range) and scan
the door seal area to determine the point of maximum leakage. Switch the
instrument to slow response (except for the Narda 8200 and the unmodified
Narda 8100, see Appendix I) and the lowest full-scale range that is higher
than the maximum emission already measured. Determine the maximum leakage
at the door seal and record this value at line 30b and record "2" (no) at
line 29 of form FD 2536,

4.2.4 Failed Interlock Test

CAUTION: This test is intended to detect complete failure of the interlock
system. This condition is most likely to be found in prestandard ovens. Follow
the instructions carefully. They are intended to minimize possible personal
Exposure to microwave leakage if the interlocks have failed. If in any of the
preceding tests it is determined that the interlocks are functioning properly
(“2" (no) has been recorded at line 29 of FD 2536), this test should be omitted.

STEP 9. Increase the load to the largest amount which is practical, i.e.,
fill the beaker with water or use a larger nonconductive container and fill it
with water, If selectable, set power to the lowest available continuous power
setting. Set the test instrument to the highest available range. If using the
Narda 8100 or 8200, use the red or yellow probes if they are available. Place
any unused probe as far from the oven as practical. Use the shortest avaitable

17


timer setting that will allow the magnetron to reach full power. {Some ovens
have a slight time delay between turn on and magnetron activation). With the
oven off, open the door approximately @ inches, blocking it open with a
nonconductive object if necessary. Position yourself out of direct line of pos-
sible emission through the door gap, and as far from the oven as possible such
that you are still able to reach the controls. Locate the probe in line with
the door gap but 1 to 2 feet from the oven (Fig. 11). Position the test meter
so that it can be read while activating the oven. Activate the oven. If the
instrument meter starts to deflect up scale, indicating that the oven is
generating microwave energy, turn the oven off immediately. If no up-scale
deflection occurs, the probe should be moved closer to the door gap to verify
that the oven is not operating.

CAUTION: If the oven generated microwave energy under the preceding test
discontinue all further testing with power on. Record "1" Cyes) on line 29 of
FD 2536. Provide all pertinent details in the remarks section, item 40 of FD

2536.

4.2.5 Procedure For Reporting Hazardous Microwave Ovens

If an oven is found to be leaking excessively {above 5 mW/come for
certified, i.e., post standard ovens, or above 10 mW/cm2 for prestandard ovens)
or to have failed interlocks, the FDA or the BRH should be notified as soon as
possible. FDA personnel should notify the BRH in accordance with procedures in
FDA compliance program 7333.01. Non-FDA personnel should notify the RRHR in the
FDA region covering their State. Regional coverage of States is shown in Appen-

dix Il.

resurveyed following repairs. An oven that was inoperative on the
first visit will not be recorded until it is operative. Then it will
be recorded as an initial survey, not as a followup survey.

3. Reinspection - A “reinspection" is a complete survey of an oven
that was previously surveyed and for which the data was recorded on an
FD 2536 test record.

4. Special - A “special" survey is a survey initiated by special
instructions from FDA headquarters, which instructions specify
"special."

Enter date of test. Use two digits each for month, day and year, e.g.,

MO. DA. YR.
[ol 4] {1 [6] [7] 5] (April 16, 1975). -

Enter the name of the manufacturer if known. The name of the actual
manufacturer may not be explicitly stated on the oven, especially for
so-called “private label" brands. If name is coded or not clearly

given, consult the Regional Radiological Health Representative for
correct information.

No entry; do not write in shaded areas.

Enter brand name. This is not always as straight forward as one might
hope. For example, the name “Amana Radarange" includes both the manu-
facturer's name and trademark. Amana is both manufacturer and brand
name. However, “Wards Signature" may appear together or separately.
Either or both may be recorded as the brand name. The same is true for
“Sears Kenmore." In both cases the manufacturer's name is coded in the
model number. If there is any doubt, too much information is prefera-

ble to not enough. Consult Regional Radiological Health Representative
for list of manufacturers and models.

Enter the model number. The model number is usually identified and
will consist of a series of numbers or letters. The information
supplying the date or year of manufacture is sometimes encoded in the
model number (Figs. 13 through 16). Write the model number to the left
of the boxes; leave shaded area boxes blank.

Enter the serial number. The serial number is usually a longer series
of numbers or letters. It too may have encoded within it the date of
manufacture (Figs. 13 through 16). If not present or visible, explain
in "Remarks." When entering serial number, start in left-most box. Do
not write in the remaining boxes to the right of the serial number.
For example:

18. Serial Number fifo] 3}s8]2{i sala]

Sometimes there are other identifying numbers or letters (such as a
vendor's number) on an oven which do not appear to pertain to either a
serial number or a model number. These extra numbers should be written
in the space called “other identification."

Enter date of manufacture using two digits each for month and year,

e.g.,
MO. YR.

If in code, use decoding information and enter actual date. If
manufacturer's date code decoding information is unavailable, leave the
blocks blank. For ovens manufactured after January 1, 1975, the month
and year of manufacture must be written out. It may appear on the
identification, certification or other label.

Enter the status of the HEW Certification Label. Ovens manufactured
after October 6, 1971, are required to bear a certification label
stating that the oven complies with Federal performance standards under
DHEW rules. Current models may cite 21 CFR 1030.10, 21 CFR Subchapter
J, or the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, but
older models may cite 42 CFR 78 or 21 CFR 278. This certification
statement may be on a separate label or it may be part of the oven
jdentification label. Do not confuse this certification label with an
FCC approval label which is also required on microwave ovens. (Fig. 13
through 16). If it can be determined, include the purchase date if "2"
(Not Certified) is checked.

Each oven must be labeled with the manufacturer's name and address and
date of manufacture (date may be encoded only if oven was manufactured
before January 1, 1975). (Figs. 13 through 16.) It is also required
that these labels be legible and securely attached to the oven. Any
exceptions should be noted under "Remarks."

Enter the location of oven at time of survey. Oven locations are
defined as follows:

1. Home: A private residence.
2. Retailer: A merchant who sells microwave ovens to the public.

3. Canteen: A commercial or vending machine location such as a food
store, snack bar, or self service cafeteria where the microwave oven is
intended for use by the vending machine customer.

4, Distributor: A distributor-owned warehouse or similar facility
from which ovens are normally sold to retailers rather than directly to
consumers.

5. Eating Establishment: An establishment, such as a restaurant,
hospital, or nursing home where the oven is intended for use by the
establishment staff.

6. Domestic Warehouse: A private or public storage warehouse.

7. Import Warehouse: A bonded warehouse or the bonded area of a
warehouse where imported products are held while in import status.

9. Other: If oven does not fall. into one of the above categories,
enter "9" and explain in remarks.

A demonstrator is an oven displayed and used to demonstrate its per-
formance to the customer and intended to be sold as used. If the deal-
er represents oven as a demonstrator but the investigator sees no
evidence of its being a demonstrator {i.e., it is still packed in a
box, appears to be unused, is displayed in an area with no electrical
outlet, or is intended to be sold as a new oven by the dealer), code as
"2" (no) but explain in “Remarks."

APPENDIX I

FIELD TEST INSTRUMENTS

A. General Considerations

1. Instrument error: The best instruments presently available have an
overall accuracy of about +1 dB. This is approximately equal to +25 percent
and -20 percent. That is to say that any given reading may be in error by as
much as +25 percent or -20 percent. Emission readings of 1 and 5 mW/cm2 could

result from emissions as low as 0.8 and 4 mW/cm¢ respectively, or from emissions
as high as 1.25 and 6.25 mW/cm2 respectively. This error must be taken into
account when making a determination of noncompliance. To minimize the possibili-
ty that a compliant oven is erroneously found to_be noncompliant, only ovens
measured to be leaking greater than 1.25 mW/cm@ and 6.25 mi fcm2 will, in
general, be considered noncompliant with the respective } mW/cm@ and 5 mW/cm2
limits of the standard.

2. Correction Factor: All microwave survey instruments that are
calibrated by the FDA are provided with a correction factor in order to correct
all readings to the calibration point of the field that is used by the Bureau to
calibrate the instruments. The correction factor will typically fall between
0.85 and 1.15, To convert the meter reading to a corrected reading, the meter
reading must be multiplied by the correction factor of the instrument. When
recording leakage levels on Form FD 2536, always record the uncorrected
instrument reading at item 30 a and b and record the instrument correction
factor under item 40, "Remarks."

3. Measurement Frequency: The frequency at which the instrument operates
or is set to operate must be the same as the operating frequency of the oven or
gross errors of measurement will occur. Virtually all microwave ovens operate
at 2450 MHz. The only known exceptions are the combination ranges manufactured
by the General Electric Co. under the General Electric and Hotpoint brand names.
They are commonly known as Versatronic or Cook Center ranges, operate at 915 MHz
and use both conventional electric heat and microwave energy simultaneously in
the same oven. Note that all General Electric and Hotpoint brand countertop
microwave ovens operate at 2450 MHz.

4. Instrument Acceptability: The Federal performance standard for micro-
wave ovens requires that compliance with the power density limits be determined
by measurements made with an instrument system which reaches 90 percent of its
steady-state reading in 3 seconds when subjected to a stepped input signal and
which has a radiation detector with an effective aperture of 25 square centime-
ters (as measured in a plane wave) with no dimension exceeding 10 centimeters.
(The aperture is determined at the fundamental frequency of the oven being
tested for compliance.) The instrument system shall be capable of measuring the
power density limits of the standard with an accuracy plus or minus l decibel.

Of the several instruments manufactured to measure microwave power
density, only a few are satisfactory for determining compliance with the micro-
wave oven. standard. The proper procedures for use of three of these are
described below. A fourth, the Holaday 1700, is satisfactory but its use is not
described because it is not commonly used as a portable or field instrument. A
fifth instrument, the Simpson 380 (Series M), has been evaluated and found to be
satisfactory for compliance measurements. However, the evaluation was not
completed in time to incorporate an operation procedure in this manual. Refer
to the manufacturer's instructions for proper operational procedures. Additional
instruments are being evaluated by the Bureau. If any are found to be adequate
for making compliance measurements, appropriate announcement of the fact will be

27


made. It is anticipated that procedures for their use will be similar to those
for the instruments described below. Instruments not known to have been

evaluated and found to comply with the requirements of the standard by the Bu-
reau, should not be used for compliance measurements.

5. Instrument Calibration: Instruments used for compliance measurements
should be recalibrated periodically. Information pertaining to periodicity of
calibration and procedure for having instruments calibrated is available from:
Chief, Electromagnetics Branch, Bureau of Radiological Health, 5600 Fishers
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.

6. Care of Probes and Spacers: Instrument probes may be damaged by expo-
sure to excessive radiation even though the instrument is turned off, or in the
case of removable probes, when the probe is not connnected to the meter. Before
preparing the instrument for use, make sure that any microwave ovens in the
ammediate vicinity are turned off. If this is not possible, e.g., in a restau-
rant with ovens that are in use continuously, prepare the instrument for use at
a point several feet distant from the operating ovens. When not in use, the
instrument should always be turned off.

Probes are provided with spacer cones, hemispheres, or spheres to
maintain the detector elements at a uniform 5-cm distance from the external
surface of the oven. These should be maintained in a clean and undamaged
condition to ensure proper measurement distance. Worn, damaged, or excessively
dirty spacers should be replaced.

B. Narda 8100 Systems (Fig. 17)

Description: This instrument covers the two frequency bands used for
microwave cooking, 915 and 2450 MHz. It utilizes interchangeable probes to pro-
vide four full-scale measurement ranges. The blue probe, model 8120A, covers 0.2
mu/com2 and 2.0 mW /cme , the white probe, model BlZ1A, covers 2 ma/cme and 20
mW /cm?, and the red probe, model 8122A, covers 20 mW /cm2 and 200 mt /eme . The
blue probe is not normally used for microwave oven field testing and is very
susceptible to burnout from exposure to stray electromagnetic radiation. It
should always be carefully shielded by wrapping in metal foil, and kept away
from microwave ovens whose leakage levels are unknown. Prepare the instrument
for use as follows:

1. Probe: Select the correct probe in accordance with the instructions in
the test procedure. Place the correct spacer cone or sphere, if available,
on the end of the probe and plug the probe into the receptacle in the lower
right corner of the instrument. (See item 4 below on the 915-2450 switch
for information on selecting the spacer).

2. Alarm Control: Set the alarm control to 100 percent. This control
presets the percentage of full scale at which an audible alarm will sound.
Use of the alarm is not a necessary part of the test procedure so it may be
set at 100 percent at all times or at a lower level at the user's
discretion. The alarm will sound if the meter is turned on without a probe
proper ly connected.

3. Fast-slow switch: Set this switch to fast prior to turning the
instrument on. It sets the response time of the instrument. As supplied
by the manufacturer, the slow response is slower than allowed by the micro-
wave oven standard. All measurements with such instruments must be made
with this switch in the "Fast" position.

The 8100 may be modified to change the response time in the "Slow"
position to the 3 seconds allowed by the standard. Most FOA-owned 8100's
have been so modified. These can be identified by the presence of an
adjusting screw just below the “Fast Slow" switch. This screw is normally
sealed with "Glyptol" and its adjustment should not be changed. When
testing with modified instruments, follow the instructions in the test
procedure for use of fast or slow response. Changing response should not
affect the zero setting but the zero control can be inadvertantly moved
when switching response, and care should be exercised to prevent such acci-
dental zero shift.

4. 915-2450 Switch: Set this switch to the operating frequency of the oven
to be tested and select the correct spacer for the test probe. The spacers
are labeled as to frequency. In addition, the 915-MHz spacers can be
identified by the presence of crossed antenna dipoles in its base. Unless
testing an oven known to operate at 915 MHz, this- frequency selector switch
should always be set to 2450 and the probe should always be fitted with a
2450-MHz spacer.

5. Range Switch: This switch selects one of the two ranges provided by
each probe. The range switch should be set to the higher range when
preparing the instrument for use. Subsequently, it should be set in ac-
cordance with the instructions in the test procedure. Changing ranges or
probes may alter the zero point. Be sure to check and, if required, reset
the instrument to zero while keeping the probe well away from any microwave
fields each time the range is changed.

6. Off-On Switch: Switch the instrument to on.

7. Zero: Set the meter pointer to zero by adjusting the zero control. The
zero control has a wide adjustment range on the lower ranges and
misadjustment can easily cause the pointer to go off scale in either
direction. If the meter is off scale in the up-scale direction and cannot
be brought on scale by adjusting the "zero" control, check that the probe
plug is seated properly. If it still remains off scale, the probe may be
defective. This can be checked by fitting the instrument with a second
probe and determining if it can be zeroed properly. When checking or
setting the meter to Zero, always be sure that it is in an area that is
free of microwave energy. If possible, turn off all ovens in the vicinity
where the test is being performed.

8. Test Switch: Turn to the "Battery" position. If the batteries are
adequately charged, the meter needle will deflect up scale above the line
marked “Test Min." If the meter reads below the "Test Min" line, the
batteries must be recharged in accordance with the instructions at the end
of this procedure. Turn the test switch to the "Probe" position. If the
probe is good, the needle will deflect up scale above the “Test Min" jine.
If it fails to do so, the probe is defective and must not be used for
testing until repaired. Probes which have been exposed to excessively high
microwave fields or roughly handled may sustain damage that will cause
significant measurement errors, but may still indicate above the "Test Min"
line, i.e., bad probes may under some conditions test “good." If there is
any doubt about a probe's condition, it should be checked by comparing it
against a known good probe or by returning it to the manufacturer or repair
facility. Probes which are FDA property should be returned to the Bureau
of Radiological Health if their condition is suspect. Iv the battery is
charged and the probe is determined to be good, the instrument is ready to
use.

30

9. Battery Charging: The battery may be recharged by removing the cover
labeled "A.C. Charge" and connecting the a.c. meter plug to a 110 VAC power
line, The battery should be charged approximately one-half hour for each
hour of meter operation, or 10 hours if fully discharged. Batteries should
be maintained at the fully charged condition whenever possible. If
necessary, the meter can be operated from the a.c. power line. The
charging rate will be reduced by a factor of about 2. However, such use
should be avoided because electromagnetic pickup by the power line can
introduce errors in the instruments readings. The "A.C. Charge" cover
should be fastened securely in place whenever the instrument is in use to
prevent error due to electromagnetic interference.

C. NARDA 8200 (Fig. 18)

This is a single frequency instrument usually covering the 2450-MHz band.
However, some 8200's have been produced that cover 915 MHz rather than 2450 MHz.
Be sure to determine that the instrument's operating frequency is the same as
that of the oven to be tested. Two probes are available with the 8200: The
white probe, model 8221, covers 2 and 20 mW/cm@ full scale and the yellow probe,
model 8223, covers 10 and 100 mW/cm@ full scale. Prepare the instrument for use
as follows:

1. Probe: Select the correct probe in accordance with the instructions
in the test procedure and firmly fasten it to the connector at the top of
the instrument, screwing the securing collar down firmly. Make sure that

the styrofoam spacer is in place on the probe.

2. Range Multiplier Switch: This switch selects the operating range of
the probe being used. The meter should be read directly in the X1
position, and its reading must be multiplied by 10 in the X10 position.
The scales of the meter are color coded to correspond to the color of the
probe being used. The range multiplier should be set to X10 when preparing
the instrument for use. Subsequently, it should be set in accordance with
the instructions in the test procedure.

3. Bat Test, Off, On Switch: Place the switch in the BAT TEST position.
If the battery is in good condition, the meter needle will deflect to the
right of the “Test Min" mark. If it does not, the battery is weak and must
be replaced before using the instrument. If the battery is good, place the
switch in the “On" position.

4, Zero: Set the pointer to zero by turning the zero control. The zero
control has a wide adjustment range on the lower ranges, and misadjustment
can easily cause the pointer to go off scale in either direction. If the

meter is off scale in the up-scale direction and cannot be brought on scale
by adjusting the “Zero" control, check that the probe connector plug is
secured properly. If it still remains off scale, the probe may be defec-
tive. This can be checked by fitting the instrument with a second probe
and determining if it can be zeroed properly. When checking or setting the
meter to zero, always be sure that the probe is in an area that is free of
microwave energy. If possible, turn off all ovens in the vicinity where
the test is being performed.

D. Holaday HI 1500 (Fig. 19)
The HI 1500 is a single frequency instrument operating at 2450 MHz. It has

a single, permanently attached probe operating at three switch selectable
ranges: 2, 10, and 100 mW /cm2 full scale. It has two switch selectable

response times. In the SLOW position, the response time is just under 3 seconds,

the maximum allowed by the standard. All other functions are controlled by a
single rotary selector switch. On this instrument the styrofoam spacer cone is
"permanently" affixed to the probe. No attempt should be made to remove it

unless it is necessary to replace it with a new one. For all instruments that
are periodically calibrated by the Bureau of Radiological Health, a spacer cone
inspection is performed at the time of calibration. if the cones are in need of
replacement, they will be replaced at this time. Prepare the instrument for use
as follows:

1. Slow-Fast Response Switch: Set this switch to the fast response posi-
tion when preparing the instrument for use. It will be used in this mode
except when the test procedure calls for using slow response.

2. Selector Switch:

a. Turn the Selector Switch to the “Battery Test" position. The needle
should move above the “Battery OK" Jine on the meter. If the needle does
not reach this mark, the two 9-volt batteries must be replaced before
attempting to use the instrument.

b. Turn the selector switch to the "Probe Test" position. Set the zero
adjust control to the center, or “twelve o'clock" position. If the probe
is good, the needle will come to rest between the green lines in the "Probe
Test OK" area. If it does not, the probe is defective and the instrument

must not be used for oven testing.

c. Set the selector switch to the range specified in the test procedures.
Note that the range indications on the selector switch are the full-scale
values for each range; they are not range multipliers. The 2-mW range uses
the 2 scale and the 10 mW- and 100 mW-ranges use the 10 scale. The
reading must be multiplied by 10 when using the 100 mW/cm2-range.

3. Zero Adj.: Set the pointer to zero by turning the zero control. When
checking or setting the meter to zero, always be sure that the probe is in
an area that is free of microwave energy. If possible, turn off all ovens
in the vicinity where the test is being performed. NOTE: The zero setting
of some Holaday 1500's exhibits a substantial positive temperature
coefficient. This will not affect measurement accuracy if properly zeroed.
Whenever possible, allow time for the instrument's temperature to stabilize
at. the ambient temperature of the area where the testing is to be
performed. If this cannot be done, be sure to rezero the instrument as
necessary and always before taking a final reading for record purposes.
