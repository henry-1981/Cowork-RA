Conventional Foley Catheters –
Performance Criteria for Safety and
Performance Based Pathway
______________________________________________________________________________

Guidance for Industry and
Food and Drug Administration Staff
This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or
Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on
FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the
applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA staff
or Office responsible for this guidance as listed on the title page.

I.

Introduction

This guidance provides performance criteria for conventional Foley catheters in support of the
Safety and Performance Based Pathway. 1 Under this framework, submitters planning to submit a
510(k) using the Safety and Performance Based Pathway for Foley catheters will have the option
to use the performance criteria proposed in this guidance to support substantial equivalence,
rather than a direct comparison of performance of the subject device to that of a predicate device.
For the current edition of the FDA-recognized standard(s) referenced in this document, see the
FDA Recognized Consensus Standards Database. 2 For more information regarding use of
consensus standards in regulatory submissions, please refer to the FDA guidance titled
Appropriate Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards in Premarket Submissions for Medical
Devices. 3
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency’s current thinking on a topic and should
be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are
cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidance means that something is suggested or
recommended, but not required.

II. Scope/Device Description
The Foley catheters that are the subject of this guidance are intended for the drainage and/or
irrigation of the urinary tract. These devices are Class II and are regulated under 21 CFR
876.5130 with the product code EZL (Catheter, Retention Type, Balloon).
Intended Use/Indications for Use:
Drainage is accomplished by inserting the catheter through the urethra into the bladder. The
catheter is retained by use of a balloon inflated in the bladder, which is attached to the distal end
of the catheter. The devices are single-use and indwelling time should be 30 days or less.
Device Design Characteristics:
The French sizes within the scope of this guidance include sizes 12 through 26 with a retention
balloon volume no greater than 30 cm3. Two lumen catheters are included within the scope of
this guidance. Three lumen catheters, catheters treated to enhance their lubricity, suprapubic
catheters, and antimicrobial catheters are outside the scope of this guidance.
General guidance that is beyond the scope of this safety and performance guidance document
(e.g., labeling recommendations) regarding submission of a 510(k) for Foley catheters can be
found in FDA’s guidance document Guidance for the Content of Premarket Notifications for
Conventional and Antimicrobial Foley Catheters. 4
FDA may determine, on a case-by-case basis, that additional data are necessary to evaluate
whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based Pathway. In situations
where you determine that additional testing outside of those identified in this guidance are
necessary to determine whether the device is appropriate for the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway, we would encourage sponsors to submit a Pre-Submission 5 to engage in discussion
with FDA prior to submission of the 510(k).

III. Testing Performance Criteria
If your device is appropriate for submission through the Safety and Performance Based Pathway,
and you choose to use that option, you do not need to provide direct comparison testing against a
legally marketed predicate device to demonstrate substantially equivalent performance
characteristics. To ensure that the performance criteria outlined in this guidance remain
contemporary and take into account relevant data from recent clearances, FDA recommends that
you provide a results summary for all tests evaluated in addition to the other submission
information (e.g. Declaration of Conformity (DoC)) identified for each test or evaluation below.
Unless otherwise identified in the submission information sections below, test information such
as results summary, test protocols, or complete test reports should be submitted as part of the

Sterilization (devices labeled as sterile) and Reprocessing (end-user sterilized) Validation
8.

Test name: Sterilization (devices labeled as sterile) and Reprocessing (end-user
sterilized)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized version of the following consensus standards
(as applicable):
• International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 17665-1 Sterilization of
health care products – Moist heat – Part 1: Requirements for the development,
validation, and routine control of a sterilization process for medical devices
• ISO 11135-1 Sterilization of health care products – Ethylene oxide- Part 1:
Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization
process for medical devices
• ISO 11137-1 Sterilization of health care products—Radiation—Part 1:
Requirements for development, validation, and routine control of a sterilization
process for medical devices
• ISO 20857 Sterilization of health care products — Dry heat — Requirements for
the development, validation and routine control of a sterilization process for
medical devices
• ISO 11607-1 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 1:
Requirements for materials, sterile barrier systems and packaging systems
• ISO 11607-2 Packaging for terminally sterilized medical devices – Part 2:
Validation requirements for forming, sealing and assembly processes
7

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Performance Criteria: Validation testing should demonstrate the cleanliness and
sterility of, or the ability to clean and sterilize to a sterility assurance level of 10-6, the
device and device-specific instruments. You should provide a description of the
packaging (sterile barrier system) and how it will maintain the device’s sterility, and a
description of the package test methods, but not package test data.
Performance Criteria Source: FDA’s guidance:
• Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification
(510(k)) Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile 8
• Reprocessing Medical Devices in Health Care Settings: Validation Methods and
Labeling 9
Submission Information: If using an Established Category A sterilization method, you
should provide the information described in Section V.A. of the FDA guidance
Submission and Review of Sterility Information in Premarket Notification (510(k))
Submissions for Devices Labeled as Sterile; the validation data itself is not needed to
demonstrate substantial equivalence.
Biocompatibility Evaluation
To identify the biocompatibility endpoints to include as part of your biocompatibility evaluation
you should use Attachment A of CDRH’s guidance Use of International Standard ISO 10993-1,
Biological evaluation of medical devices – Part 1: Evaluation and testing within a risk
management process, 10 referred to in the rest of this document as the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance for brevity. FDA considers the devices covered by this guidance to be categorized as
“External Communicating Devices” with a “prolonged” tissue contact duration of >24 hours to
30 days and you should assess the endpoints below per Attachment A of the CDRH
Biocompatibility Guidance.
• Cytotoxicity
• Sensitization
• Irritation or Intracutaneous Reactivity
• Acute Systemic Toxicity
• Material-Mediated Pyrogenicity (should be conducted to support devices labeled as
"non-pyrogenic")
• Sub-acute/Sub-chronic Toxicity
• Genotoxicity
• Implantation
Rationale in Lieu of Testing: If the subject device is manufactured from the identical raw
materials using identical manufacturing processes as a predicate device with the same type and
duration of tissue contact, and any changes in geometry are not expected to impact the biological
response, this is typically sufficient to establish substantially equivalent biocompatibility, if

documentation such as that outlined in Attachment F of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance is
also provided.
Testing: If you determined that testing is needed to address some or all of the identified
endpoints, FDA recommends that complete test reports be provided for all tests performed unless
a declaration of conformity without supplemental information can be appropriately provided, per
Attachment E of the CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance. Any test-specific positive, negative,
and/or reagent controls should perform as expected, and protocol deviations should be
thoroughly described and justified; however, note that certain protocol deviations may invalidate
comparison to the performance criteria listed below and require submission of a Traditional,
Special, or Abbreviated 510(k).
9.

Test name: Biocompatibility endpoints (identified from CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance)
Methodology: FDA currently-recognized versions of biocompatibility consensus
standards
Performance Criteria: All direct or indirect tissue contacting components of the device
and device-specific instruments should be determined to have an acceptable biological
response.
Performance Criteria Source: The CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
Additional Considerations: For any biocompatibility test samples with an adverse
biological response, the biocompatibility evaluation should explain why the level of
toxicity seen is acceptable. Some comparison testing against a legally marketed predicate
may be necessary (and is considered acceptable under the Safety and Performance Based
Pathway) to support such a rationale as explained in the CDRH Biocompatibility
Guidance. For standard biocompatibility test methods that include comparison device
control samples, the legally marketed comparison device control samples should perform
as expected, as specified above for the subject device samples.
Submission Information: Refer to CDRH Biocompatibility Guidance
