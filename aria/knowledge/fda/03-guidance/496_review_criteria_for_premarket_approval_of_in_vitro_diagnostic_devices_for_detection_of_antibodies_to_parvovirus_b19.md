REVIEW CRITERIA FOR PREMARKET APPROVAL OF IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC
DEVICES --FOR DETECTION
OF ANTIBODIES TO PARVOVTEKB~~
This is a flexible document representing the current major
concerns and suggestions regarding in
-vitro diagnostic devices
employing immunochemical or other methodologies for detection of
antibodies to Parvovirus B19 (B19) in human serum or plasma
specimens. It is based on 1) current basic science, 2) clinical
experience, and 3) the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (SMDA)
and FDA regulations in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).
As advances are made in science and medicine, these review
criteria will be re-evaluated and revised as necessary to
accommodate new knowledge.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on
information to present to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
before a device to detect antibodies to B19 in serum or plasma
specimens may be approved for marketing. This document is an
adjunct to the CFR and the FDA 87-4214 Premarket Approval (PMA)
Manual.
DEFINITION: This generic type device is intended for use in
clinical laboratories as an -in vitro diagnostic test for
qualitative or semi-quantitative measurement of antibodies to
B19 in human serum or plasma by immunochemical and other
methodologies. A PMA submission must show the device has
clinical utility and that there is reasonable assurance of its
safety and efficacy.
In addition to this guidance, refer to the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS), "Specifications for
Immunological Testing for Infectious DiseasesM1. The NCCLS
document may be used for definitions of terms used in this
guidance document.

3.

Assay Specificity
a.

Perform cross-reactivity studies with sera
containing relatively high titers against rubella,
rubeola (measles), mumps, influenza A, influenza B,
parainfluenza, HSV1, HSV2, CMV, EBV, VZV, and
Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Test sera from five ( 5 )
patients with each disease; the predominate
antibody class should be the class measured in the
device. Furnish the antibody "titer1'of the
potential cross-reactant samples and the method
used to determine the "titer".

b.

If the antigen utilized in the device is a
recombinant, test sera containing antibodies
against the organism in which the vectors were
induced for cross-reactivity with the organism.

c.

If the antisera utilized in the device were
produced by using a recombinant as the immunogen,
test sera containing antibodies against the
organism in which the vectors were induced for
cross-reactivity with the antisera.

d.

For immunoglobulin class-specific devices, test ten
sera positive in moderate to high levels for
specific antibody class other than what is detected
in the device for type specificity (i.e., if the
assay is for IgG antibody then test ten sera which
are positive for IgM antibody to show the device
will not detect specific IgM antibody). Retest
following removal of IgM or IgG.
NOTE: Serum samples may be artificially produced;
describe method of preparation.

e.

If an absorbent is used to remove interference of
RF, ANA, and specific IgG, document the amount of
IgG removed in mg/dL or mg/sample volume. State
this value in the LIMITATIONS section of the
package insert.

f.

If device is for the detection of IgM antibodies
the following studies are required:
(1). Test five sera containing high levels of RF
and ANA with virus-specific IgG. Provide
levels of RF and ANA tested.
(2). Describe the methods used to determine the
amounts of virus-specific IgG, RF, and ANA
present. Devices used should be legally
marketed devices.

4.

Interference Studies.

Original vers., May 15, 1992

DRAFT

Any potentially cross-reacting or interfering substances
potentially encountered in specific specimen types or
conditions should be tested using the assay system,
e.g., storage conditions, hemolysis, lipemia,
freeze-thawing, etc.
a.

Verify that recommended storage conditions are
compatible with the assay. State the optimal
conditions based on specimen storage stability
studies. Both false positivity and false
negativity should be evaluated.

b.

If the use of plasma is claimed, a study with each
anticoagulant must be performed to show the
anticoagulant does not interfere with the assay.
(1). For each anticoagulant, test 10 concurrent
serum and plasma specimens which have
reactivity near the CO. These specimens may
be artificially produced as long as the matrix
is maintained and it is noted in the
submission that the samples were artificially
created.
(2). For each anticoagulant, test 10 concurrent
non-reactive serum and plasma specimens.

c.

If heating of the specimen is claimed not to
interfere with the assay:
(1). Test 10 specimens with reactivity near the CO,
for each matrix type claimed, heated and not
heated. These specimens may be artificially
produced as long as the matrix is maintained
and it is noted in the submission that the
samples were artificially created.
(2). Test 10 specimens which are non-reactive for
each matrix claimed, heated and not heated.

5.

Reproducibility
The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards
(NCCLS) recommends an analysis of variance experiment
that permits estimatian of within-run and total standard
deviations (SD).2 See the NCCLS Guideline for
recommended data collection formats and calculations.
Perform separate calculations for each specimen tested
for within-run and total precision.
Test six to ten patient blinded sera with varying
degrees of reactivity plus controls supplied with device
in triplicate on three different days at three
laboratory sites (6-10 sera tested X 3 X 3 days X 3
sites). One testing site may be in-house.

Original vers., May 15, 1992

DRAFT

For calculated endpoint tests (e.g., ELISAs), present
coefficients of variation for each set of values for
with-in run and total precision, using absorbance values
and reporting units defined in the test procedure.
For single endpoint assays, provide percentage of
results that are negative, borderline/equivocal, or
positive for each set of tests.
If dedicated instrumentation is used in specimen
handling, or reading and interpreting results, use a
different instrument at each site. If non-dedicated
instruments are used, state specifications of
instrument(s) used at each site.

6.

Stability
Document stability from three different manufactured
lots that represent real time studies. Accelerated
stability studies are acceptable as interim data only.
Include testing to show that the reagents are stable
under variable shipping temperatures.

B.

Clinical Studies.
Clinical studies provide data on the ability of the system to
accurately detect antibodies to B19. It should be
demonstrated that the performance of the device is safe and
effective when used as an aid in the diagnosis of specific
B19 infections.
Provide the names and telephone numbers of principal
investigators and sites at which testing was performed.
Clinical testing should be performed by at least three
independent investigators at separate independent locations
not affiliated with the manufacturer. Identify the clinical
laboratory sites by institutional name and address; include
the name, title, and phone number of the responsible
investigators at each site.
The tests should be performed on an adequate number of
positive and negative clinical specimens (following
collection, storage, and testing instructions recommended in
the package insert) from a population consistent with the
intended use of the device.- The sensitivity and specificity
calculated from this population should be stated in the
PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS section of the package insert.
1.

Test samples submitted to the clinical laboratory for
the rule out of illness associated with rash or other
symptoms of B19 infection.

2.

Clinical confirmation of infection may be done by
clinical diagnosis, immune electron microscopy, or
other standard methods.

Original vers., May 15, 1992

DRAFT

a.

Clinical diagnosis may be based on the following
criteria:
(1). documented contact with infected individuals

during a community outbreak (usually April
through May).
(2). typical "slapped-cheek" rash which during
clearing may take on a lacelike appearance on
the trunk of the body.
(3). symmetric polyarthropathy.

(4). absence of increased markers to other
illnesses associated with rash (measles,
rubella, etc.).

(5). reticulocytopenia and a fall in hemoglobin
concentration
(6). bone marrow cytology.
For pediatric patients (1) and/or (2) is
considered diagnostic. For immunocompetent
adults, (I), (2) (with or without trunk rash), and
(3) is diagnostic. When the symptomatology is not
diagnostic, at least two of the criteria (1-6)
must be documented for establishing the diagnosis.
b.

If other standard testing methods are used, the
antigen should be different than the antigen
present in the device. This additional testing
may be performed at the manufacturervs or other
site(s). Note in the submission where this
testing was performed. Provide a description of
the antigen used! criteria for positivity and
negativity, and quality control performed.
Furnish copies of any pertinent scientific
references for the testing method with the
submission.

3.

As an option, results obtained from a well-documented
panel of sera such as the CDC panel or a panel
established by the manufacturer may be included with
the submission. If a manufacturerrs sera panel is
used, furnish the criteria for defining the diagnosis
and/or disease stage of the patients from whom samples
were obtained. This study may be conducted at the
manufacturer's facility or at a clinical laboratory
site.

4.
