I.  PREFACE
For a number of years there has been increasing interest in surface treating orthopedic devices in an attempt
to improve implant fixation.  The purpose of this document is to recommend to manufacturers of orthopedic
devices and sponsors of future premarket notifications (510k), Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE)
applicatons, Premarket Approval (PMA) applications, reclassification petitions, and master files, important
information that should be provided to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to evaluate the
substantial equivalence and/or safety and effectiveness of modified orthopedic implant surfaces that are in
contact with tissue or bone cement (e.g., porous coatings).
Based on currently available data, the Orthopedic Devices Branch (ORDB) proposes to now greatly
limit the scope of this document for the following three types of coatings:
a.
beaded, sintered cobalt-chrome coatings on a cobalt-chrome substrate;
b.
beaded, vacuum-sintered titanium coatings on a titanium substrate; and
c.
vacuum-sintered titanium fiber mesh pads on a titanium substrate.
Numerous test reports describing the physical characteristics and mechanical performance of the
above three coating types have been submitted to and reviewed by ORDB.  These reports indicate
that the integrity of these coatings can be determined with a limited description of the mechanical
properties when the materials of the coating and substrate are known, and, in the case of titanium
implants, when the manufacturing method is known.
For porous coated hips (the only cementless, porous coated, Class II devices), the properties of the
porous coating itself (e.g., average pore size) must be determined because they are indicators of the
ability of the coating to allow biologic fixation.
ORDB proposes that items 1-3 below now adequately characterize these types of porous coatings:
1.
the materials used and any standards to which they conform;
2.
the static shear strength of the coating to the substrate (ASTM F1044); and
3.
the average bead size; average pore size; overall pore volume; number of bead
layers; and thickness of the coating.
The remainder of this document pertains to modified surfaces different from the above three types of porous
coatings.  Note: this document does not address interfaces between prosthetic parts, articulating surfaces,
calcium phosphate coatings or biodegradable materials, which are described in separate documents.
Suggestions and recommendations presented in this document are not mandatory requirements, but reflect
data and methodologies which ORDB has determined to be acceptable.  In this context, several points
should be remembered:
• 
This document is primarily intended to be a scientific position paper.  Therefore, it suggests some important
evaluation criteria, test procedures and end points.  There may be circumstances where an alternative
method or additional information may be useful. If the same objectives can be accomplished by means
other than, or in addition to those included in this document, do not refrain from doing so.  Because the
scope of the remainder of this document does not specify a particular type of modified surface, some of the
following recommended test methods may have to be modified and/or additional methods may need to be
included in order to address the properties of a particular product.

• 
As scientific knowledge changes and scientific techniques are improved, FDA will periodically update
the document.  Nonetheless, it should be remembered that the basic objectives will probably remain
the same.
• 
The word "should" and "must" have been used frequently in this document to emphasize the relative
merit or importance of a specific aspect of a test or protocol.  However, this verbiage is not used in a
regulatory sense and should not be construed as such.
In this document, the term "modified surface" includes the surface layers and excludes the unmodified
substrate below the modified surface.
A device manufacturer or sponsor may include more than one model or type of prosthetic component in a
single submission if the modified surfaces on all the components have exactly the same unique set of
characteristics (as described later in this document) and each component is otherwise identical to one
previously approved in a PMA or found to be substantially equivalent in a 510(k).
II.  REQUIRED INFORMATION
Metallurgical Analysis of the Materials
The composition, trace elemental analysis and material microstructure (grain size, amounts of different
phases, etc.) of the substrate and modified surfaces of the final product must be expressed quantitatively. 
Microphotographs of the material microstructure should be included.
The corrosion over the entire surface of the final device and interfacing components must be equal to or less
than that measured in a legally marketed device if the implanted device assembly is made of material
combinations with limited or no history of successful use in orthopedic implant applications.
Microstructure of the Modified Surface
The total number of different modified surface layers and the following parameters concerning each
physically and/or chemically distinct layer of the modified surface must be provided:
• 
the surface thickness (average and range);
• 
either drawings or photographs of the product illustrating the position of the modified surface(s) and
any variation in modified surface thickness;
• 
the shape and size (average, standard deviation and range) of the particles or material between the
pores;
• 
the diameter or area of the welds (average and standard deviation) between surface coating particles
and substrate; and
• 
microphotographs at appropriate magnifications and locations within the modified surface so all
geometrical characteristics of the microstructure listed in this document will be recognizable (either the
precise magnification or a magnification bar must be included with each image).


April 28, 1994

The following parameters concerning the spaces within the modified surface (i.e., pores) must be provided:
• 
pore diameter (average and standard deviation) at the surface;
• 
the minimum void intercept length or minimum pore diameter of the interconnecting porosity (average,
standard deviation and range) for each physically distinct layer; and
• 
the mean volume percent of voids;
Physical Properties of the Untreated Substrate Surface
• 
Dimensioned engineering drawings of any nonrandom surface structure patterns (e.g., machined
structures) must be provided.
• 
The roughness of all surfaces must be reported in micrometers Ra.
Mechanical Properties - Modified Surface
Either finished devices or surface treated coupon samples that are processed identically as the final device
may be used in the tests below. 
• 
The shear fatigue strength of surface coatings must be tested out to at least 107 cycles (provide
justification for the test method used, e.g., Pilliar, 1975; Manley, 1987).
• 
The static shear strength of the surface/substrate interface shall exceed 20 MPa for porous surface
coatings as tested by ASTM F 1044 (Levine, 1985). 
• 
The static tensile strength of the surface/substrate interface shall exceed 20 MPa for porous surface
coatings (Levine, 1985; Ducheyne, 1986).  Tension may be applied to the modified surface using
either a polymeric adhesive with a minimum tensile strength of 24.1 MPa (ASTM C 633:  Adhesion or
Cohesive Strength of Flame-Sprayed Coatings) or another substrate sintered parallel to the first
(ASTM F 1147 Tension Testing of Porous Metal Coatings).  If an adhesive is used, its properties must
be reported.
• 
The abrasion of a coating due to the insertion of the implant into bone during surgery and due to
micromotion after surgery must be simulated in a test which allows comparisons between different
test labs.  One test method involves rubbing a block of hardened material against a flat test coupon
consisting of the substrate and the modified surface under study.  This test method is described in
detail below: 
The flat, surface treated test coupon must be at least 30 x 30 mm.  The portion of the hardened
block which contacts the modified surface must consist of a convex half-cylinder whose cross-
sectional radius is 0.5 mm and whose axial length is 25 mm.  The hardened block must have a
minimum hardness of 500 Brinell C (10 mm steel ball, 3000 Kg load) or 51 Rockwell C (R diamond
cone, 150 Kg load) or 64 Rockwell D (R diamond cone, 100 Kg load).  The half-cylinder is cycled
back and forth (in the direction normal to the axis of the half-cylinder) over the same 25 x 25 mm's
of modified surface for 10 cycles.  The abraded modified surface should face down so loose debris
may fall away from the surface.  A range of different normal loads must be tested.  The minimum
load is the lowest load that produces a detectable loss in the modified surface.  The maximum load
must be either high enough to remove at least 50% of the modified surface or the lowest load that
will cause significant plastic deformation/densification of the modified surface.  Plastic deformation
should be verified with micrographs.  If it is not possible to remove 50% of the modified surface in
10 cycles without deformation, the cyclic loading should be continued until half the modified surface
is removed.

Tests must be conducted for at least 5 other loads, equally spaced between the minimum and
maximum loads.  At least 3 undamaged specimens (i.e., not previously tested) must be tested at
each load.  At the end of each test, the test coupons are thoroughly cleaned and weighed and the
cumulative decrease in volume (calculated from the change in mass) of the coupon or volume of
wear debris is plotted versus applied load or number of cycles.  The modified surface must be
photographed at high enough magnification to detect the presence of cracking or plastic
deformation of the modified surface.  The thickness of the modified surface before and after the test
and the initial mass of the modified surface under the abraded area must also be reported.
• 
The amount of plastic deformation of the porosity (average, standard deviation and range) must be
reported for modified surfaces with low rigidity and limited or no history of successful use for
orthopedic implant application.  The device must be loaded by a flat surface under the worst case
loading which may occur during implantation and use by the patient.
Mechanical Properties - Substrate
Surface modified and non-modified substrates must be tested as described below.  The statistical
significance of any differences in the results must be reported.  The yield and ultimate strength must be
provided or addressed by an appropriate standard (any difference in the final product and the requirements in
the referenced standard must be itemized and explained).  The fatigue strength must be determined using
either ASTM F 1160 (i.e., axial, bending or rotating beam specimens with a fatigue strength greater than 130
MPa) or a test method specific to the final device. 
Biocompatability
Material combinations with limited or no history of successful use in orthopedic implants must be determined
to exhibit an acceptable biological response equal or better than approved or substantially equivalent devices
when tested by ASTM F 748, ASTM F 981, and an animal implant study in which the tissue response to the
modified surface is addressed by the following:  amount of tissue apposition, depth of tissue ingrowth, and
the strength of the junction between the bone or bone cement and implant surface in bending, shear, tension
or torsion.
Clinical Data
Any available clinical data on devices containing the modified surface characterized above should be
summarized in a table.  At a minimum, this data should include information regarding loosening, radiographic
evidence of bone or fibrous tissue ingrowth, surface coating particulate migration, surface coating failure or
other indications of success or failure.  Additional clinical data may be required if any test requirements listed
in this document are not met or if the modified surface or other device design features have limited or no
history of successful use in orthopedic implant applications.
III.  MANUFACTURING
The manufacturing process of the final product and test samples must be described in enough detail to
explain any significant differences between its properties and those of currently marketed devices.

IV.  REPORTING
To help FDA in its review and facilitate a determination of substantial equivalence and/or safety and
effectiveness, a very brief summary (values and their units) of all information sould be organized as
suggested in Section VI,  MODIFIED SURFACE DATA FORMS.  Any additional and important information
not specifically mentioned in this document should be inserted into this organization where appropriate.  All
the data summarized in one set of modified surface data forms must pertain to only one modified surface
design.  A separate set of modified surface data forms must be submitted for every modified surface having
a significant difference in any property, including those listed in this document.  Detailed test reports from
which the summarized data originated should be organized and included in the submission to FDA.  The
detailed reports should include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. The name and address of facility performing the test.
2. The name of the study director, investigators, and supervisors involved in the study.
3. The dates that testing was initiated and completed and the date the final report was completed.
4. The objectives, methods, materials, deviations from referenced protocols and standards, results and
conclusions of the test.  These sections must include:
a
a description of the test system used and a schematic or photograph of the test setup;
b.
a description of the samples tested including the differences, if any, in the composition,
material structure and processing methods between the test samples and the device to
be marketed;
c.
the assumptions of the test, including assumed physiological loading values and
environmental conditions;
d.
at least 5 identical samples for each type of test and control specimens or statistical
justification for the number of each;
e.
the load directions and magnitudes;
f.
the full experimental data, complete to the extent that an independent conclusion can be
made;
g.
statistical evaluation of the differences between the test results where appropriate;
h.
the clinical implications of the results; and
i.
