Minutes of Institutional Review Board (IRB) Meetings
Guidance for Institutions and IRBs
This guidance represents the Office for Human Research Protections’ (OHRP’s) and the Food
and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) current thinking on this topic. This guidance does not create
or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to bind OHRP, FDA, or the public.
You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the requirements of the applicable
statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative approach, contact the appropriate
OHRP or FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot identify the
appropriate OHRP or FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the second title page of
this guidance.
I.

INTRODUCTION

This guidance has been prepared jointly by the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), and is consistent with the goals of section 3023 of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures
Act) (Pub. L. 114-255). This guidance is intended for institutions and institutional review boards
(IRBs) responsible for oversight of human subject research under HHS and FDA regulations.
This guidance is intended to assist institutions and IRBs responsible for preparing and
maintaining minutes of IRB meetings (also referred to in this guidance as minutes). This
guidance document describes requirements for minutes and provides recommendations for
meeting the regulatory requirements for minutes.
OHRP’s and FDA’s guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally
enforceable responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe OHRP’s and FDA’s current thinking on
a topic and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word must in joint OHRP and FDA guidance means that
something is required under the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46 or the FDA regulations at 21
CFR parts 50 and 56. The use of the word should in joint OHRP and FDA guidance means that
something is recommended or suggested, but not required.
Note: References in this guidance to HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46 are to this part in effect
at the time this guidance is published, and not to the part as amended by a final rule published
January 19, 2017, that has not yet gone into effect (82 Fed. Reg. 7149).
II.

BACKGROUND

IRBs must comply with HHS and FDA regulations in 45 CFR part 46 and 21 CFR parts 50 and
56, respectively, when reviewing research subject to those regulations. Both the HHS
regulations at 45 CFR 46.115(a)(2) and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) specifically
require that an institution, or when appropriate, an IRB, prepare and maintain adequate
documentation of IRB activities, including minutes in sufficient detail to show:

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

1. Attendance at the meetings;
2. Actions taken by the IRB;
3. The vote on these actions, including the number of members voting for, against, and
abstaining;
4. The basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; and
5. A written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their resolution.
These five items must be documented in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR
56.115(a)(2)).
III.

DISCUSSION

IRBs have been cited in OHRP Determination Letters 1 and FDA Warning Letters 2 for failing to
prepare and maintain adequate minutes. For this reason, OHRP and FDA believe providing
recommendations on the type and amount of information to include in minutes will help IRBs
meet the regulatory requirements for minutes.
Examples of noncompliance related to minutes include:
•

Minutes are missing.

•

Minutes reflect an inaccurate account of meeting attendance.

•

Minutes lack sufficient detail to show the vote on actions taken by the IRB, including the
number of members voting for, against, and abstaining.

•

Minutes are incomplete and only describe voting actions as “passed unanimously.”

•

Minutes do not clearly indicate, or contain discrepancies about, what the IRB approved.

•

Minutes fail to include a summary of the discussion of controverted issues.

Minutes are intended to provide a summary of what occurred during a convened meeting and
provide information to persons not present at the meeting (e.g., investigators, institutional
officials, regulators, IRB members who could not attend) about what the IRB reviewed and the
actions taken by the IRB.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

When reviewing proposed research, the IRB must document the information required by 45 CFR
46.115(a)(2) and 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) in the minutes. However, there are other findings and
determinations the IRB must make to fulfill other regulatory requirements (e.g., the IRB must
review research involving children as subjects that is covered by 45 CFR part 46, subpart D
and/or 21 CFR part 50, subpart D, and approve such research only if it satisfies the conditions of
all applicable sections of those subparts). While we recommend that IRBs document these
additional findings and determinations in the minutes, these can be documented elsewhere in the
IRB records to avoid redundancy (e.g., IRB reviewer form/checklist, database entries, other
forms of physical or electronic records). Documentation should include relevant summary
information when such information contributes to an understanding of the IRB’s findings and
determinations (e.g., a brief rationale for the IRB’s pediatric risk determination).
The regulations for meeting minutes at 45 CFR 46.115(a)(2) and 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2) provide
institutions and IRBs with flexibility in choosing how to prepare minutes. Institutions and IRBs
should adopt written procedures for preparation and maintenance of minutes that best suit their
particular organization and allow the IRB to efficiently accomplish its tasks.
A. Attendance at the IRB Meeting
Minutes of IRB meetings must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the convened
meetings of the IRB (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). In addition, except when an
expedited review procedure is used, the IRB must review proposed research at convened
meetings at which a majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas (nonscientist). In order for the
research to be approved, it must receive the approval of a majority of those members present at
the meeting (45 CFR 46.108(b); 21 CFR 56.108(c)).
1. Members, Alternates, Consultants, and Guests
The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show attendance at the convened meeting (45 CFR
46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). For ease of review, OHRP and FDA recommend that
attendance information be listed at the beginning of the minutes and include the full name and
representative capacity (e.g., scientist, nonscientist, unaffiliated) of each IRB member present at
the convened meeting. Some IRBs may choose to append a current IRB membership roster to
the minutes to avoid having to repeat certain information (e.g., representative capacity for each
IRB member). However, the minutes must clearly document which IRB members were present
at any given convened meeting (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
IRB members may participate in a convened meeting of the IRB via telephone or video
conferencing when those members have received in advance of the meeting a copy of the
documents for research proposals that are to be reviewed at the meeting. The minutes should
make clear which members, if any, participated in the convened meeting via an alternative
mechanism, such as telephone or video conferencing.

3

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
An IRB may choose to appoint alternate members who may substitute for primary members for
an entire meeting (e.g., when the primary member is not able to attend the meeting), or at any
time during a meeting (e.g., when the primary member is not able to attend the whole meeting, or
when the primary member has a conflicting interest and is recused from review of a particular
study). When an alternate member replaces a primary member at a convened meeting, the
minutes must include the name of the alternate member in attendance (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21
CFR 56.115(a)(2)). When an alternate member substitutes for a primary member due to a
conflicting interest, the minutes should identify the name of the primary member for whom the
alternate member is substituting, and state that this is the reason for the substitution.
IRBs may invite consultants to assist in the review of a particular study when expertise is
required beyond or in addition to that available on the IRB (45 CFR 46.107(f); 21 CFR
56.107(f)). If the IRB uses a consultant and the consultant is present at the convened meeting,
the minutes must include the name of the consultant (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR
56.115(a)(2)), and should include a brief description of the consultant’s expertise. In accordance
with 45 CFR 46.107(f) and 21 CFR 56.107(f), the consultant may not vote with the IRB on the
study.
If the IRB permits non-members and guests to attend a convened meeting (e.g., IRB support
staff, the investigator whose study is being reviewed, study coordinator), then the minutes must
record the name(s) of all such attendees (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
The institution and the IRB may establish written procedures covering the use of alternate
members, the use of consultants, and attendance of non-members and guests at a convened
meeting. Such written procedures may help to ensure that those who attend an IRB meeting
understand their role, and to promote respect for the IRB’s advice and counsel in safeguarding
the rights and welfare of human subjects.
2. Quorum
A quorum is the minimum number and type of IRB members that must be present at a convened
meeting. In order to review proposed research at a convened meeting, a majority of the members
of the IRB must be present, including at least one member whose primary concerns are in
nonscientific areas (45 CFR 46.108(b); 21 CFR 56.108(c)). If a majority of the IRB membership
is not present, or if a nonscientist is not present, then quorum has not been met.
The attendance information in the minutes assists in determining whether enough IRB members
were present to constitute a quorum, whether the nonscientist was present, and whether proposed
research received enough votes (i.e., a majority of those present) to be approved.
IRBs often calculate majority by using the “half-plus-one” technique. This technique works well
for IRBs with an even number of IRB members. For example, if the total IRB membership is 10,
then the majority is 6 (half of 10 is 5, plus 1 equals 6). However, if the IRB has an odd number
of members, then the majority should be calculated by taking half of the total number of IRB

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
members, and rounding up to the next whole number. For example, if the IRB membership is
15, then majority is 8 (half of 15 is 7.5, and rounding up to the next whole number is 8). 3
A quorum must be maintained throughout the meeting. If quorum is lost during a meeting, then
the IRB may not vote on proposed research (45 CFR 46.108(b); 21 CFR 56.108(c)). Because
IRB members may occasionally enter or leave the room at various times during a convened
meeting (e.g., arrive late, depart early, or leave the meeting temporarily), we recommend that the
minutes provide sufficient information to indicate that a quorum is maintained.
B. Actions Taken by the IRB
The minutes of IRB meetings must be in sufficient detail to show the actions taken by the IRB at
the convened meeting (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). OHRP and FDA interpret
“actions taken by the IRB” (also called “IRB actions”) to refer to any vote taken by the IRB
related to a proposed research activity. Accordingly, to be in sufficient detail to show actions
taken by the IRB, the minutes must provide sufficient information to identify the research
activities being reviewed and voted on by the IRB at that meeting (e.g., initial review of protocol
title/protocol number). The minutes should serve as a central repository for IRB actions on
proposed research activities.
1. Approve, Require Modifications to Secure Approval, Disapprove
OHRP and FDA regulations require that an IRB review and have the authority to approve,
require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all proposed research activities
covered by the regulations (45 CFR 46.109(a); 21 CFR 56.109(a)). Any IRB action to approve,
require modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove proposed research activities that
occurs at a convened meeting must be documented in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR
56.115(a)(2)). Additionally, the IRB or institution may develop a range of other allowable
actions the IRB may take when reviewing proposed research activities (e.g., approve with
conditions 4, defer a decision until additional information can be obtained). The IRB’s written
procedures should describe the range of possible actions the IRB can take.
The minutes must be in sufficient detail to show the actions taken by the IRB at the convened
meeting (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). In order to approve research covered by
the regulations in 45 CFR part 46 and/or 21 CFR part 56, the IRB must determine that all of the
criteria for IRB approval of research are satisfied (45 CFR 46.111; 21 CFR 56.111). We
recommend that the minutes, or other IRB record (e.g., correspondence with the investigator),
identify the effective date of approval and the approval period (continuing review interval) for
any research approved by the IRB. IRBs must determine which projects require review more
often than annually (45 CFR 46.103(b)(4)(ii); 21 CFR 56.108(a)(2)). Both OHRP and FDA have

Note that the regulations do not prohibit IRBs from having more stringent requirements for quorum.

issued guidance on continuing review of research to assist the IRB in determining the effective
date of the initial approval and the subsequent date of continuing review. 5
If the IRB takes an action to require modifications in the proposed research to secure approval,
or disapproves the proposed research, the minutes must be in sufficient detail to show the action
taken by the IRB, and the basis for requiring changes in, or for disapproving the proposed
research (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
2. Suspension or Termination of IRB Approval
Both OHRP and FDA regulations authorize an IRB to suspend or terminate approval of research
that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or that has been
associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects (45 CFR 46.113; 21 CFR 56.113). Any IRB
action to suspend or terminate IRB approval that occurs at a convened meeting must be
documented in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). Any suspension or
termination of approval must include a statement of the reasons for the IRB’s action (45 CFR
46.113; 21 CFR 56.113). Any decision to suspend or terminate the study that occurs outside of a
convened IRB meeting (e.g., as determined by the IRB Chair or Institutional Official for subject
safety reasons) should be reported to the convened IRB and the discussion summarized in the
minutes. Any subsequent action taken by the convened IRB (e.g., to lift the suspension or to
terminate the study) must be documented in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR
56.115(a)(2)).
3. Other IRB Regulatory Determinations and Review Responsibilities
As previously mentioned, in addition to the findings and determinations the IRB must make and
document in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)), there are other findings
and determinations the IRB must make to fulfill other regulatory requirements. While we
recommend that IRBs document these additional findings and determinations in the minutes,
these can be documented elsewhere in the IRB records to avoid redundancy (e.g., IRB reviewer
form/checklist, database entries, other forms of physical or electronic records). Again, we
recommend that documentation include relevant summary information when such information
contributes to an understanding of the IRB’s findings and determinations.
•

Criteria for IRB Approval of Research
In order to approve research, the IRB must determine that all of the criteria for IRB
approval of research are satisfied (45 CFR 46.111; 21 CFR 56.111). The process the IRB
follows for considering the approval criteria should be addressed in the IRB’s written
procedures. The IRB’s consideration of these criteria applies to both initial review and
continuing review of research and provides the framework for the IRB’s evaluation of

research. The minutes must document actions taken by the IRB (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2);
21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
•

Informed Consent
In order to approve a study, the IRB must determine that informed consent will be sought
from each prospective subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative (LAR) in
accordance with the regulations (45 CFR 46.111(a)(4); 21 CFR 56.111(a)(4)). The IRB
must also determine that informed consent will be appropriately documented in
accordance with the regulations (45 CFR 46.111(a)(5); 21 CFR 56.111(a)(5)). The
minutes should indicate that, as part of its review and approval of a study, the IRB
reviewed the informed consent form(s) and determined that the form(s) meet the
applicable regulatory requirements. 6
The IRB may require changes to the informed consent form(s). The minutes of IRB
meetings must be in sufficient detail to show the basis for requiring changes in (to secure
approval) or disapproving research (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). The
IRB may summarize any changes to the informed consent form(s) required by the IRB in
the minutes, or other IRB record (e.g., an annotated informed consent form that includes
IRB-required changes that gets appended to the minutes).
Both OHRP and FDA regulations permit an IRB to waive the requirement that the subject
or the subject’s LAR sign a written consent form if the IRB determines that certain
criteria are met (45 CFR 46.117(c); 21 CFR 56.109(c) and (d)). We recommend that any
such waiver of documentation of informed consent be documented in the minutes or
other IRB record.
In addition, for HHS-conducted or -supported research, the regulations at 45 CFR
46.116(c) and (d) permit an IRB to approve a consent procedure that does not include, or
which alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent, or waive the requirement
to obtain informed consent provided the IRB finds and documents that certain criteria are
met. 7 When an IRB approves a waiver or alteration of consent for research reviewed by
the convened IRB, these findings must be documented (45 CFR 46.116(c) and (d)).
OHRP recommends that IRB decisions for waiver or alteration of consent be documented
in the minutes or other IRB record.

On December 13, 2016, the President signed the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) into law. Title III, section
3024 of the 21st Century Cures Act amended sections 520(g)(3) and 505(i)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) to provide FDA with the authority to permit an exception from informed consent when
the proposed clinical testing poses no more than minimal risk to the human subject and includes appropriate
safeguards to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human subjects. FDA intends to promulgate regulations
to permit this exception and to specify appropriate human subject protection safeguards. FDA issued guidance in
July 2017 for sponsors, investigators, and IRBs on enforcement of FDA regulations governing informed consent
requirements for clinical investigations that involve no more than minimal risk to human subjects – see
https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm566474.htm.

•

Studies Involving Children
Each IRB that reviews studies involving children as subjects covered by 45 CFR part 46
subpart D and/or 21 CFR part 50 subpart D may approve only those studies that satisfy
the conditions of all applicable sections of those subparts (45 CFR 46.403; 21 CFR
50.50).
In its review of proposed research involving children, the IRB must find that the research
meets the conditions of 45 CFR 46.404 and/or 21 CFR 50.51 (research/clinical
investigations not involving greater than minimal risk); 45 CFR 46.405 and/or 21 CFR
50.52 (research/clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk but presenting
the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects); or 45 CFR 46.406 and/or 21 CFR
50.53 (research/clinical investigations involving greater than minimal risk and no
prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable
knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition). If the IRB determines that the
proposed research cannot be approved under these categories, then additional regulatory
requirements under 45 CFR 46.407 and/or 21 CFR 50.54 (research/clinical investigations
not otherwise approvable that present an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a
serious problem affecting the health or welfare of children) must be met. Both OHRP
and FDA have issued guidance to assist IRBs with handling clinical investigations that
include children as subjects and that have been referred under 45 CFR 46.407 or 21 CFR
50.54. 8
In addition to the findings and determinations described above, the IRB must also
determine that requirements for permission by parents or guardians and for assent by
children are met (45 CFR 46.408; 21 CFR 50.55). If the proposed research involves
children who are wards of the State or other agency, institution or entity, then the IRB
must ensure that additional requirements are met (45 CFR 46.409; 21 CFR 50.56).
OHRP and FDA recommend that the IRB’s findings and determinations for studies
involving children be documented in the minutes.

•

Emergency Research
If the IRB reviews a proposal for research involving an exception from informed consent
requirements for emergency research, the IRB must find and document that the proposed
research satisfies the criteria found in OHRP’s Secretarial Waiver 9 and/or FDA’s
regulations at 21 CFR 50.24.

8

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

FDA has issued guidance on the exception from informed consent requirements for
emergency research. 10 As outlined in FDA’s guidance, FDA anticipates that an
emergency research study in which informed consent is not obtained for all subjects is,
by its very nature, controversial. Therefore, IRBs must summarize their discussions and
decisions about the required elements for these studies in the minutes (45 CFR
46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
•

FDA-Regulated Medical Device Studies
Unless FDA has already made a risk determination for a device study (e.g., significant
risk (SR), or nonsignificant risk (NSR)), or the study is exempt in accordance with 21
CFR 812.2(c), sponsors are responsible for making the initial risk determination and
presenting it to the IRB. In that case, the IRB must then make its own SR/NSR
determination about the study, and either agree or disagree with the sponsor’s
determination by reviewing relevant information provided by the sponsor at a convened
meeting (21 CFR 56.108(a)(1); 21 CFR 812.66). FDA considers this determination to be
part of the IRB’s responsibilities for conducting its initial review of a study. FDA
recommends that the IRB document each SR/NSR determination, along with the reason
for the determination, in the minutes.

•

Studies Involving Pregnant Women, Human Fetuses, and Neonates
The regulations for research conducted or supported by HHS require specific findings for
research involving pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates as subjects (45 CFR
part 46, subpart B). OHRP recommends that when such research is approved by the
convened IRB, all required findings should be documented in the minutes or other IRB
record.
IRBs should be aware that FDA regulations do not require specific findings for research
involving pregnant women, human fetuses, and neonates as subjects. If an IRB reviews
an FDA-regulated study that is not HHS-conducted or -supported research, and the study
is expected to involve pregnant women, fetuses, or neonates as subjects, IRBs may find
45 CFR part 46, subpart B to be helpful.

•

Studies Involving Prisoners
The regulations for research conducted or supported by HHS require specific findings for
research involving prisoners as subjects (45 CFR part 46, subpart C). OHRP
recommends that when such research is approved by the convened IRB, all required
findings should be documented in the minutes or other IRB record.

subjects, IRBs may find 45 CFR part 46, subpart C, and OHRP’s guidance on prisoners
in research 11 to be helpful.
•

Reporting of Expedited Review Activities
Each IRB that uses an expedited review procedure must adopt a method for keeping all
members advised of research proposals which have been approved under the expedited
review procedure (45 CFR 46.110(c); 21 CFR 56.110(c)). There are various methods
IRBs can use to keep the IRB members apprised of expedited actions. One method that
may be used is to present a report of expedited actions during a convened meeting. If this
method is used and the IRB reviews a report summarizing expedited review actions at a
convened meeting, the minutes should describe what was presented to the IRB, indicate
that the IRB members had an opportunity to ask questions or raise concerns, and
summarize questions or concerns, if any, raised by the IRB members. The report of
expedited actions may also be appended to the minutes for reference.

Unanticipated Problems, Serious or Continuing Noncompliance, Suspension or
Termination of IRB Approval
If at a convened meeting, the IRB reviews an issue that requires prompt reporting to the
IRB under 45 CFR 46.103(b)(5) or 21 CFR 56.108(b) (e.g., an unanticipated problem
involving risk to human subjects or others), the minutes should summarize the report and
must document the IRB’s action, if any, resulting from that review (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2);
21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). Any review of such information and any decisions made outside
of a convened meeting (e.g., as determined by the IRB Chair or Institutional Official for
subject safety reasons) should be reported to the convened IRB and the discussion
summarized in the minutes. Any subsequent action taken by the convened IRB (e.g., to
lift suspension or to terminate the study) must be documented in the minutes (45 CFR
46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).

C. The Vote on IRB Actions
The minutes of IRB meetings must be in sufficient detail to show the vote on IRB actions as
determined during the convened meeting, including the number of members voting for, against,
and abstaining (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)). Individual voting records by name
are not required. The following are examples of acceptable formats for documenting the votes
on actions taken by the IRB in the minutes. Each example assumes that 15 members are
attending the meeting:

Against = 1, Abstained = 1.

OR

The minutes should identify any member who has a conflicting interest in a research study, and
as such, is excluded (recused) from participation in the IRB’s review of that particular research
including the reason for the recusal. As shown in the examples above, the minutes of the
meeting must reflect a vote count (i.e., for, against, and abstaining) that is consistent with the
number of non-conflicted IRB members present (45 CFR 46.107(e); 21 CFR 56.107(e); 45 CFR
46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
Members who are recused from voting on a specific study because of conflicting interests may
not be counted toward the quorum. That is, their recusal may not be recorded as an abstention.
IRB members who participate in a convened meeting via telephone or video conferencing may
vote and be counted towards the quorum. The IRB must ensure that the votes of such members
are recorded in the minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
IRB members may not vote on proposed research outside of the convened meeting (e.g., via
email prior to the convened meeting). IRB members who cannot attend a convened meeting may
not send someone (e.g., from their department or office) to vote in their place. Opinions of
absent members that are transmitted prior to the convened meeting by mail, telephone, telefax, or
email may be considered by the attending IRB members but must not be counted as votes or
towards the quorum for convened meetings (45 CFR 46.108(b); 21 CFR 56.108(c)).
D. Requiring Changes or Disapproving Research
The minutes of IRB meetings must be in sufficient detail to show the basis for requiring changes
in (to secure approval) or disapproving research (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
If the IRB requires that the investigator make specified changes to the research protocol or
informed consent document(s) and resubmit such documents to the convened IRB for subsequent
review, the IRB’s action, along with the basis for requiring changes must be documented in the
minutes (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
If the IRB disapproves a research activity, the IRB must include a statement of the reasons for its
decision in the written notification to the investigator and the institution, and provide the
investigator an opportunity to respond in person or in writing (45 CFR 46.109(d); 21 CFR
56.109(e)). The minutes must document the IRB’s action along with the basis for disapproving
the research (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).

E. Controverted Issues and Their Resolution
The minutes of IRB meetings must be in sufficient detail to show a written summary of the
discussion of controverted issues and their resolution (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR
56.115(a)(2)). Many IRBs struggle with the amount of detail that is necessary to satisfy this
regulatory requirement.
Controverted issues are those that cause controversy and dispute among the IRB membership
during a convened meeting. Controverted issues that arise during the convened meeting usually
are the result of opposition to some aspect of the proposed research. During the review of
proposed research, IRB members may express a difference of opinion, or raise issues, questions
or concerns that cause debate among the IRB members, or even result in disagreement. Some
research, by its very nature, is considered to be controversial (e.g., emergency research where
informed consent may not be obtained for all subjects or some research involving vulnerable
populations).
IRB members may resolve controverted issues and concerns with continued discussion and
deliberation, decide to seek further clarification from the investigator or sponsor of the proposed
research, or decide to settle the issue by vote. The minutes must summarize the IRB’s discussion
and resolution of any controverted issues (45 CFR 46.115(a)(2); 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2)).
IV.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

We recommend that institutions and IRBs decide who is responsible for preparing and
maintaining minutes at their institutions and outline the process in the IRB’s written procedures.
While there is no regulatory requirement for IRBs to approve or accept minutes of IRB meetings,
if the institution and IRB choose to adopt a process for review and approval/acceptance of
minutes, this process should be covered in the IRB’s written procedures. Institutions and IRBs
may consider creating a standard template to assist in the preparation of their minutes.
OHRP and FDA recognize that in addition to documenting the IRB’s findings and
determinations in the minutes, or elsewhere in the IRB records, IRBs may also choose to
document other activities that occur during the meeting. For example, some IRBs provide
continuing education and training to the IRB members at a convened meeting and document such
training in the minutes. IRBs may also communicate announcements or other information to the
IRB members and attendees at the meeting and document this in the minutes (e.g., upcoming
meeting schedule, staff or membership changes). This practice is acceptable to OHRP and FDA.
IRBs may choose to record IRB meetings (e.g., video, audio tape) and use the recording as a tool
to assist in the preparation of written minutes. 12 However, retention of complete recordings of
meetings is not required nor does it relieve an IRB of its obligation to keep written minutes in
accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR 46.115(a)(2) and 21 CFR 56.115(a)(2). We do not
12

Institutions and IRBs should ensure recording is permitted by institutional policy and, if applicable, state law. All
members, and any others attending the meeting, should be informed that the meeting is being recorded and how the
recording(s) will be used.

expect the minutes to include a verbatim transcription of what each member said during the
course of the meeting.
IRB records required by the regulations, including meeting minutes, must be retained for at least
3 years after completion of the research that is the subject of the review and must be accessible
for inspection and copying by authorized representatives from OHRP and/or FDA at reasonable
times and in a reasonable manner (45 CFR 46.115(b); 21 CFR 56.115(b)). Many sets of minutes
will have records of review of multiple studies. Relevant portions of the minutes must be
retained until the regulatory retention period for each study is satisfied. Institutions and IRBs
can expect that representatives of OHRP conducting a compliance oversight assessment, or
representatives of FDA conducting a Bioresearch Monitoring inspection, will review minutes
and other appropriate IRB records to assess compliance with the regulations.
