Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff
Non-Clinical Engineering Tests and
Recommended Labeling for Intravascular
Stents and Associated Delivery Systems
This guidance represents the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) current thinking on
this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does not operate to
bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies the
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative
approach, contact the FDA staff responsible for implementing this guidance. If you cannot
identify the appropriate FDA staff, call the appropriate number listed on the title page of this
guidance.

I. Introduction
This guidance provides FDA’s current thinking on non-clinical engineering tests that are
submitted in investigational device exemption applications (IDEs) and premarket approval
applications (PMAs) to support the safety and effectiveness of intravascular stents and their
associated delivery systems. This guidance also provides recommendations for labeling for
these devices.
FDA's guidance documents, including this guidance, do not establish legally enforceable
responsibilities. Instead, guidances describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic and
should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory
requirements are cited. The use of the word should in Agency guidances means that something
is suggested or recommended, but not required.

Definition of Terms Used in this Guidance
Intravascular Stent
Intravascular stents are also known as endovascular stents or vascular stents. This
document uses the term “intravascular stent” to refer to intravascular, endovascular, and
vascular stents.
An intravascular stent is a synthetic tubular structure intended for permanent implant in
native or graft vasculature. The stent is designed to provide mechanical radial support
after deployment; this support is meant to enhance vessel patency over the life of the
device. Once the stent reaches the intended location, it is expanded by a balloon or selfexpanding mechanisms defined below.
1

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Balloon Expandable Stent
A balloon expandable stent is expanded by a balloon catheter. The diameter of the stent
increases as the balloon diameter increases. The stent remains expanded after deflation
of the balloon.
Self-expanding Stent
A self-expanding stent’s diameter increases from its pre-deployed size to its postdeployed size in the absence of balloon inflation or other mechanical assistance. The selfexpanding quality can result from material properties or geometry or both.
Stent Delivery System
A stent delivery system delivers a stent to a target site and then deploys the stent.
A stent delivery system for a balloon expandable stent consists of a balloon catheter.
Self-expanding stent delivery systems may or may not include a balloon.

II. Scope
This guidance document addresses self-expanding and balloon expandable extracranial
intravascular stents and their associated delivery systems. The scope includes extracranial
intravascular stents placed in coronary or peripheral arteries and saphenous vein grafts but is not
limited to stents used in these locations; other vascular indications outside of the intracranial
vasculature are also included.
Intravascular stents, including balloon expandable and self-expanding stents, are class III devices
whose product codes are given in the table below.

These devices require a premarket approval (PMA) application before marketing. See sections
513(a) and 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and 21 CFR Part 814.
Clinical studies conducted in the United States in support of a PMA approval must be conducted
under the Investigational Device Exemptions (IDE) regulation, 21 CFR Part 812. FDA believes
that the intravascular stents addressed by this guidance document are significant risk devices as
defined in 21 CFR 812.3(m), 1 and as such, are not exempt from the requirement to submit an
1

Refer to http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/devices.html#risk.

2

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
investigational device exemption (IDE) application (21 CFR 812.2(b), 812.20(a)(1). When an
IDE application is required, a sponsor must not begin a clinical trial in humans in the United
States until FDA has approved the application (21 CFR 812.20(a)(2), 812.42). Sponsors of such
studies must comply with the following:
•
•
•

IDE regulations (21 CFR 812)
Regulations governing institutional review boards (IRB) (21 CFR 56)
Informed consent (21 CFR 50). 2

After FDA has approved a device, clinical studies conducted in accordance with the indications
in the approved PMA, including clinical design validation studies conducted in accordance with
the quality systems regulation, are exempt from the investigational device exemptions (IDE)
requirements. However, such studies must be performed in conformance with the regulations
governing institutional review boards (21 CFR Part 56) and informed consent (21 CFR Part 50).
Non-vascular stents meant for use outside the vasculature are not included in the scope of this
document. This document also does not include stents used in the intracranial vasculature. You
should contact the Division of Reproductive, Abdominal, and Radiological Devices for
information about biliary stents, the Division of Anesthesiology, General Hospital, and Infection
Control Devices for information about non-vascular stents, or the Division of Ophthalmic,
Neurological, and Ear, Nose, and Throat Devices for information about stents used in the
intracranial vasculature.
Some of the tests (and labeling recommendations) in this guidance are relevant to covered (NIV),
drug-eluting (NIQ), and biodegradable stents, and stents used to treat aneurysms or dissections.
However, FDA recommends additional testing to fully characterize these devices. For drugeluting stents, please refer to the draft document Coronary Drug-Eluting Stents— Nonclinical
and Clinical Studies. 3 For other coated stents, FDA recommends that you assess the need for
additional testing to address coating characterization, coating integrity, and coating durability.
The Interventional Cardiology Devices Branch and the Peripheral Vascular Devices Branch are
available to discuss additional testing details for these stents and indications.
This guidance document supplements other FDA publications on PMA, PDP, and IDE
applications and should not be construed as a replacement for those documents. For general
information about these applications, see the CDRH Device Advice web site given below:

III. Content and Format of Test Data
A. Summary Reports
We recommend that you present test data in a summary that includes the elements described
below.
Table of Contents
You should place a table of contents at the front of the document. Each line listing in the table of
contents should refer to major section titles and the page numbers where each section can be
found.
Test Summaries
You should briefly describe all tests performed.
Test Data Summaries
You should include test data summaries for all tests. The summaries should contain:
•

minimum measured value (min)

•

maximum measured value (max)

•

mean

•

standard deviation of the test data (std. dev.).

Summary of Conclusions
You should summarize your conclusions regarding whether the results support the safety and
effectiveness of your device for each test.

4

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
B. Test Reports
You should include full test reports for all tests performed. Your test reports should include the
sections described below.
Test Specimen Information
Your test specimen description should include:
•

number of test specimens

•

size (diameter, length, or other relevant dimensions) of all test specimens

•

rationale for the number of test specimens and sizes tested

•

whether the specimens represent the finished product

•

sterilization parameters and number of sterilization cycles applied to the test specimens.

Test Protocol
You should submit your test method or protocol. It should contain enough detail that an
individual familiar with intravascular stent testing will be able to interpret the test results.
Protocol Deviations
You should describe any protocol deviations and their effect on the ability of the test data to
support the safety and effectiveness of the device.
Test Parameters and Acceptance Criteria
You should report the test parameters and acceptance criteria that you use, including:
•

an explanation of and rationale for critical test parameters

•

specifications or acceptance and rejection criteria

•

a rationale for the specification or acceptance and rejection criteria based on the
clinical requirements of the device.

Raw Data
We recommend that you include all raw data in appendices or on a CD-ROM, or make the
raw data available for our review upon request.
Test Results
You should summarize your test results and include statistical analysis when it is appropriate.
Data Analysis
You should analyze the data, including any outlying points and anomalous results, and
explain whether the data meet the given acceptance criteria.
Conclusions
We recommend that you describe the conclusions drawn from the test results, and the clinical
significance of the conclusions.
5

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

C. Test Protocols
You should establish protocols for all experiments or computational analyses, including
acceptance criteria when applicable, before you perform the tests. Established test protocols help
to ensure consistent repetition of tests and allow comparison of data between test runs.
We are willing to informally review and provide comments on test protocols prior to conduct of
a test, if there are aspects of a particular test that you feel might benefit from FDA input. While
FDA does not approve test protocols, our input before testing may improve your ability to
demonstrate the performance characteristics of your device.
Your test protocols should assess device performance when exposed to the most extreme clinical
conditions that your device is likely to experience. Both device configuration and physiologic
conditions affect the performance of devices in the human body. We recommend that you
evaluate extreme device dimensions, tolerances, sizes, and any other important device
parameters in your testing program. We also recommend that you examine the outer limits of
physiologic variables such as blood pressure, vascular compliance, and anatomic types. You
should clearly state all test conditions in the test protocol and support them with references to
applicable literature, standards, or both.
Occasionally, the worst performing combination of device configuration and physiologic
conditions occurs in the mid-range of the relevant variables. You should check for this situation
when developing your protocols to ensure that you test the worst performing combination.
Several of the tests listed in this guidance do not apply to all intravascular stents and delivery
systems. The designs or clinical indications to which these tests do apply are noted in their
descriptions. We believe that each test helps to support the safety and effectiveness of
intravascular stents for their stated indication. Each test’s clinical or engineering significance is
described in Section V.
If you believe a test recommended in this guidance does not apply to your device, you should
include a heading for the test in your test summary, followed by an explanation of why the test is
not applicable. We will then be aware that you did not inadvertently omit it from your
application.
Your explanation should include a rationale for why you do not think the test should be
performed in order to support the safety and effectiveness of your device. Your rationale should
clearly demonstrate, by reference to a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or other risk
analysis method, that the particular test or data set is not necessary or appropriate to support the
safety and effectiveness of your device. Alternatively, you may identify measures you have
taken to mitigate the risks associated with the device in the failure mode that would usually be
evaluated using the test that you have not performed.
Intravascular stents have been in clinical use for over a decade and some designs are in their
fourth or fifth generation. Some attributes may not be modified when changes are made in the
design of a next-generation device. For a particular attribute, rather than providing original data
for a next-generation design, it may be appropriate to reference previously tested stents in the
6

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
same device family. However, a reference to previous generic device experience, for example,
“alloy X has been used in stents,” generally is not adequate. If you choose to reference testing
previously performed on already marketed stents, you should explain why the previous testing is
relevant. If a particular attribute of the next-generation device is re-evaluated, a comparison of
the results to those of the previous generation may be helpful.
Sample Selection
You should use a statistically significant sample size whenever possible. When using a
statistically significant number of samples is not possible, you should provide a scientific
rationale to support the number of samples tested in your test summary and test protocols, and
provide reasonable assurance that the test results support the safety and effectiveness of the
device.
All test samples should represent the finished product. Your devices should be sterilized by the
final production process, including repeat sterilization cycles. You should note any tests that use
samples that are not finished, sterilized product in the test summary and test protocols, and
explain why doing so does not affect the applicability of the test results to the evaluation of
safety and effectiveness of the device.
You should test the full range of sizes that you intend to commercially distribute. The
recommended default paradigm is a 2 x 2 factorial of the largest and smallest diameters and
lengths, also known as the “four corners” paradigm for each different stent design. We
recommend a different set of sizes for some of the tests in Section V. Table 2 illustrates the four
corners concept for a typical coronary stent. If you do not test a device using the four corners
paradigm or the recommended sizes for a particular test, you should provide a scientific rationale
to support the sizes that you do test in the test summary and test protocols. For some tests, we
may recommend that you perform an analysis to identify the size or sizes that represent the worst
case.

IV.

Non-Clinical Engineering Tests

A. Material Characterization
1. Material Composition
Significance
Material composition testing documents a baseline for evaluation of the effects of
future changes in materials.
Recommendation
We recommend that you specify the device characteristics described below. If your
stent material is identical to your previously marketed stents, we recommend that you
identify the stent(s) and material(s) to which it is identical.
Stent and Delivery System Materials
We recommend that you list materials by trade or common name, for example,
316L stainless steel.
Generic Chemical Formulation
We recommend that you list formulations of all materials by generic name, for
example, 18 Cr-14 Ni-2.5 Mo stainless steel. We recommend that you reference
any applicable standard designations such as ASTM F138. 4
Chemical Composition and Formulation
We recommend that you provide detailed specifications for the chemical
composition or formulation of materials (or both) for any new materials, alloys, or
formulations with no history of use in intravascular stents or PTCA catheters.
Surface finish is known to affect other material properties for nitinol (e.g.
corrosion, nickel ion release). Therefore, for stents containing nitinol, we
recommend that you characterize the material surface of your finished product in
terms of passivation layer microstructure vs. depth. Special attention should be
paid to surfaces which might include heat-affected zones (e.g., from laser cutting),
or to geometric areas which may be affected differently by finishing (e.g., internal
angles).
Material Certification
We recommend that you provide documentation to certify that incoming raw
material conforms to specifications. We recommend that you submit supplier
certification, incoming quality control test results, or equivalent documentation.

Wire for Surgical Implants

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
2. Shape Memory and Superelasticity of Intravascular Stents
Significance
The transition temperature of nitinol or other shape memory and superelastic
materials determines specific shape memory and superelastic properties.
Recommendation
We recommend that you document the following properties for any shape memory or
superelastic materials present in your stent.
Austenite Finish Transition Temperature (Af)
We recommend using the methods described in ASTM F2004, 5 ASTM F2082, 6
or equivalent methods.
Mode of Action
We recommend that you describe the mode of action (e.g., thermal shape memory
or superelasticity) by which the stent transitions to the specified size and shape.
3. Stent Corrosion Resistance
Significance
Stent corrosion can cause or contribute to premature stent failure. In addition,
corrosion byproducts may be toxic or cause other adverse biological and tissue
responses.
Recommendation
We recommend that you address the corrosion properties of your device described
below. If some of these characteristics do not apply to your device, we recommend
that you explain this in your application.
Fretting Corrosion
We recommend that you address the potential for fretting corrosion between two
stents since there is a reasonable expectation of stent overlap during clinical use
for most indications. We recommend that the examination of samples for fretting
corrosion be incorporated as part of fatigue/durability testing (see Section B.11.
Accelerated Durability Testing). You should ensure that overlapping stents are
in contact with one another and that the setup does not preclude micromotion
between strut elements. For coronary stents, because tortuosity of a target
deployment site could result in increased micromotion between components or
multiple stents, the mock deployment site should be bent to a worst-case clinically
relevant radius of curvature, which should be smaller than most anatomical

situations encountered in clinical use. For example, for most coronary
indications, FDA recommends a 15mm radius of curvature as this represents
worst case for 90% of the population based on published angiographic
measurements. 7 For other indications such as use in coronary bifurcations, please
provide a similarly robust clinical rationale for the radius of curvature selected.
We recommend conducting a visual (e.g., SEM) inspection of samples after
fatigue/durability testing for evidence of corrosion.
Results from testing through one year time equivalent should be provided in
support of an IDE application. Results from testing through ten years time
equivalent should be provided when they are available, but not later than at the
time of PMA submission. A scientific rationale for the number of samples
evaluated for fretting corrosion should be provided.
Pitting and Crevice Corrosion Potential
We recommend that you characterize the corrosion potential of your stent with
any potential surface damage that may result from fatigue. We recommend
testing the same samples used in the fretting corrosion evaluation described above
according to the method in ASTM F2129. 8 Specifically, one stent from each
overlapping pair subjected to fatigue cycling should be evaluated for pitting and
crevice corrosion potential while the other stent from each pair is evaluated for
fretting corrosion as described above. Test reports for pitting and crevice
corrosion potential testing should include the recorded potentials as well as the
polarization curves.
Results from testing through one year time equivalent should be provided in
support of an IDE application. Results from testing through ten years time
equivalent should be provided when they are available, but not later than at the
time of PMA submission.
If results do not indicate an acceptable pitting and crevice corrosion potential, you
should consider characterizing the corrosion potential of the finished, as
manufactured stent to determine if the corrosion potential of your stent is affected
by fatigue.
You may use literature citations or previous experience with stents to address this
issue; however, the materials, design, and fabrication processes specific to your
stent may reduce or eliminate the applicability of generic literature. For example,
the pitting corrosion resistance of nitinol is sensitive to processing variables such
as heat treatment and electropolishing; therefore, for a nitinol stent, you should
characterize the corrosion potential of the finished stent.

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

Galvanic Corrosion
If your stent contains more than one type of metal, such as a base stent material
with added marker bands, we recommend that you demonstrate the design’s
resistance to galvanic corrosion. If you expect that your stents will be overlapped
during clinical procedures, and the contacting or overlapping stents may be made
of different materials, we recommend that you address the potential for galvanic
corrosion between stents. In this case, we recommend that you use the marketed
stent with the highest galvanic coupling with your stent material in your
evaluation. We recommend the methods described in ASTM G71 9 or their
equivalents. These methods may be modified to provide for testing of finished
stents, for example, by incorporating the experimental setup described in
Appendix X3 of ASTM F2129.
Testing should be conducted even if an alloy conforms to a specific standard
because manufacturing processes can affect the galvanic corrosion potential of the
finished product.

B. Stent Dimensional and Functional Attributes
1. Dimensional Verification
Significance
Accurate stent dimensions help the physician to achieve proper stent sizing and
accurate placement in the body. They also affect the functional behavior of the stent.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you provide the information described below that applies to
your stent. We recommend the methods used in ASTM F2081 10 or their equivalents.
At a minimum, you should take measurements at each end and in the middle of the
stent and at two circumferential points 90˚ apart (for a total of six measurements).
You should take additional measurements as appropriate based on device design.
Un-expanded Stents
We recommend that you provide dimensional specifications and tolerances for
un-expanded stents.
Balloon Expandable Stents
We recommend that you measure and report the expanded diameter of balloon
expandable stents. You may do this as part of the process of creating a
compliance chart. See Section C. Delivery System Dimensional and
Functional Attributes, 5. Balloon Compliance.

Stents

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Self-Expanding Stents
We recommend that you verify the unconstrained expanded diameter of selfexpanding stents with measurement data.
2. Percent Surface Area
Significance
The area over which a stent contacts a vessel may affect the biologic response of the
vessel. The amount of open, non-contact area may influence tissue prolapse or
ingrowth.
Recommendation
We recommend that you report the percent surface area of the stent for both the
smallest and largest nominal expanded diameters for each stent design. We
recommend that you evaluate different lengths only if you expect that the percent
surface area varies significantly with stent length. We recommend that you measure
or calculate the contact area of the stent structure, and express the final value as a
percentage of the reference area, as shown below:
Percent Surface Area = 100 x (Area in Contact with Vessel ÷ Full Cylindrical Surface
Area)
(The reference area is defined as the full cylindrical surface area at the expanded stent
diameter.) We recommend that you apply the methods described in ASTM F2081 or
their equivalents.
3. Foreshortening
Significance
Foreshortening, i.e., dimensional changes that may occur when deploying a stent,
influences final stent length. Knowledge of the foreshortening characteristics aids in
proper stent length selection and proper placement in the body.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you report the decrease in length of the stent between the
catheter-loaded condition and the deployed diameters up to the maximum labeled
diameter.
We recommend that the reported value reflect the maximum nominal diameter. We
recommend that you report the results in terms of a percentage of the loaded length as
shown below:
Percent Foreshortening = 100 x (Change in Length ÷ Loaded Length).
We recommend that you apply the methods described in ASTM F2081 or their
equivalents.
12

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
See Section VIII. Labeling for recommendations on data presentation of the percent
foreshortening of self-expanding stents.
4. Recoil for Balloon Expandable Stents
Significance
The recoil behavior of balloon expandable stents influences proper device selection,
sizing, acute post-implant results, and long-term clinical outcomes. Recoil is a
function of stent design and material selection; therefore, knowledge of stent recoil
helps to characterize the behavior of a particular stent design.
Recommendation
We recommend that you report the measured change in diameter of your stent
between post-balloon expansion and after balloon deflation.
We recommend that you measure and report values for each labeled stent diameter.
If you expect that the percent recoil varies significantly with length, we recommend
that you evaluate recoil for different stent lengths at various points along the length of
the stent, including the ends. The number of locations along the length of the stent at
which recoil is measured should be determined by initial assessment of the stent
geometry.
We recommend that you present the results as a percentage of the expanded diameter.
We recommend the methods described in ASTM F2079 11 or their equivalents.
5. Stent Integrity
Significance
Stent defects, whether a result of manufacturing flaws or subsequent damage, can
contribute to clinical complications. Laser cutting or other manufacturing processes
may induce flaws that are not completely removed by polishing. Plastic deformation
during loading or balloon expansion may cause cracks or other damage. Selfexpanding stents that are stored loaded in a delivery system may exhibit permanent
set or changes in expansion characteristics as a result of time or sterilization or both.
Recommendation
We recommend that you examine your deployed stent and report any evidence of
stent defects such as, but not limited to:
• cracks
• scratches
• permanent set
• coating delamination.

11

ASTM F2079 Standard Test Method for Measuring Intrinsic Elastic Recoil of Balloon expandable Stents

13

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend that you use optical or electron microscopy, or both to look for
defects. We recommend that you support the level of magnification that you use on
the basis of the size of the defect that your inspection attempts to detect.
When you are looking for post-deployment damage, we recommend that you examine
or inspect:
• balloon expandable stents, after expansion to the largest diameter listed in
your labeling
• self-expanding stents, after expansion to the unconstrained diameter.
6. Radial Stiffness and Radial Strength
Significance
Radial stiffness and stent recoil determine the diameter of balloon expandable stents
deployed in compliant vessels. Radial stiffness and radial strength characterize the
ability of the stent to resist collapse under short-term or long-term external loads.
Recommendation
We recommend that you report a value for the following:
•

radial stiffness, i.e., the change in stent diameter as a function of uniformly
applied external radial pressure; and

•

radial strength, i.e., the pressure at which your stent experiences irrecoverable
deformation.

FDA recommends that you measure and report values for each labeled stent diameter.
If you expect that the radial stiffness varies significantly with length, we recommend
that you also evaluate different stent lengths.
We recommend that you support the diameter or pressure range used in your tests for
radial stiffness. The diameter and pressure range will probably vary depending on
your stent’s intended target site.
7. Radial Outward Force
Significance
It is important to characterize the radial outward force of self-expanding stents.
Excessive radial force could injure the surrounding tissue, while a radial force that is
too low can result in incomplete apposition of the stent to the vessel wall.
Recommendation
We recommend that you measure the radial force exerted by self-expanding stents
against the vessel wall after deployment. If a particular stent size or model is
indicated for use in a range of vessel sizes, your assessment should cover the range of
possible vessel sizes, or should include a rationale for not assessing the entire size
range to be marketed. We recommend that you evaluate different stent lengths if you
expect that the radial force varies as a function of the total stent length. In addition, if
14

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
you expect that the radial force of your stent is not axially uniform (for example, if
your stent has a tapered length), we recommend that you measure the radial force at
multiple locations along the length of the stent. The specifications for radial outward
force should include both minimum and maximum values.
8. Mechanical Properties
Significance
Raw material properties determine incoming material quality and uniformity, and
predict subsequent thermomechanical effects. Thermomechanical properties of the
implanted stent affect clinical performance, as well as stress and fatigue behavior.
Recommendation
We recommend that you specify the mechanical properties listed below for the stent
raw material(s).
Mechanical Properties of the Raw Material(s)
•
•
•
•
•

ultimate tensile strength (UTS)
yield strength (YS)
elongation
plateau stresses, for nitinol
elastic strain limits, for nitinol.

Post-Processing Mechanical Properties
FDA also recommends that you report the stress-strain response of the stent after
deployment. We recommend that you present the stress-strain behavior in a plot
or graph that shows both loading and unloading. We recommend that you report
the following post-processing mechanical properties of your stent:
• UTS
• YS
• elongation
• elastic modulus
• Poisson ratio
• endurance limit
• plateau stresses, for nitinol
• elastic strain limits, for nitinol.
In addition, reporting other mechanical properties at previous stages of manufacture,
may allow characterization of your material for use in your stress/strain analysis. See
Section 9. Stress/strain Analysis. We recommend that you determine the stressstrain response, endurance limit, and post-processing mechanical properties through
physical experiments or computational models that simulate stent material properties,
manufacturing, and deployment processes. If you cite any quoted literature or
15

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
handbook values, we recommend that you explain how they are relevant to your
device. Since the material properties of nitinol are widely variable depending on
processing, we recommend for nitinol devices that you perform physical experiments
on actual post-processing samples to determine the mechanical properties of your
stent. We also recommend that you use and reference standard test methods
whenever possible, and describe any nonstandard test methods in detail.
9. Stress /Strain Analysis
Significance
Failure of a loaded stent may result in loss of radial support of the stented vessel or in
perforation of the vessel by the stent struts. Stress/strain analysis, combined with
fatigue analysis and accelerated durability testing, provides an indication of device
durability.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you include the following elements in your stress/strain
analysis and test report for each stent design.
Computational Model and Inputs
We recommend that you clearly identify and explain the sources and values of all
inputs and assumptions used to create the stress/strain analysis model. You
should identify any software used for analysis. We recommend that finite
element analysis reports include the element types used to model the stent,
loading surfaces, and boundary conditions. We also recommend that you indicate
if mesh refinement analysis was performed and clearly describe how you model
the surrounding vessel/tissue and the type of contact elements used. Specifically,
we recommend that you consider the following:
•

Model Geometry
We recommend that you clearly describe the stent and vessel geometry
used. If symmetry is used, we recommend that you explain why this is
appropriate for your model.
If you do not model all of your stent sizes, we recommend that you
explain why the modeled stent size is the worst case with respect to
critical stresses. We recommend that you address the effect of
dimensional variation within allowable tolerances on the results of the
stress/strain analysis (i.e., maximum critical stress).
We recommend that you provide a justification for the physiological
relevance of your vessel model parameters (e.g., vessel compliance).

16

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

Type of Element & Mesh Refinement Analysis
We recommend that you specify the number and type of elements used in
your mesh, including any mesh refinement in transition regions or regions
of complex geometry.
We recommend that you perform a mesh refinement analysis to ensure
that the solution is independent of element size. If you do not believe
mesh refinement analysis is necessary for your model, we recommend that
you provide a justification for not conducting such an analysis.

•

Contact Elements
We recommend that you specify the type of contact defined between any 2
contacting bodies modeled in your analysis; e.g., the vessel and outer
surface of your stent.

•

Material Properties (Constitutive Model)
We recommend that you clearly describe the material stress/strain
behavior of your stent in graphical and equation form. This discussion
should include, but is not limited to the following considerations:
o Linear vs. non-linear
o Isotropic vs. anisotropic
o Temperature-dependent behavior
o Raw vs. processed material.

•

Finite Element Analysis (FEA) Validation
We recommend that you validate your FEA (material properties,
geometry, and boundary conditions) with experimental bench testing. For
example, you could perform radial loading of your device and compare the
force-displacement results with FEA of a simulated radial loading
experiment.

Stress/Strain History
FDA recommends that you include the entire stress history of the device in each
loading step in order to incorporate the effects of residual stresses. The entire
stress history may include, but is not limited to:
• manufacturing (fabrication, annealing, electropolishing, heat-setting, etc.)
• loading onto the delivery system and/or crimping
• expansion/deployment (including over- or underexpansion into an elastic
vessel, if applicable)
• stent recoil
• physiologic loading conditions.
If you believe that you do not need to model the entire stress history, we
recommend that you use material properties that are consistent with the starting
point of your analysis. We recommend that the material properties accurately
17

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
reflect the processing history of the stent as described in Section 8. Mechanical
Properties. We also recommend that you explain why the omitted loading steps
either do not affect the stent fatigue life or are accounted for in your model.
Physiologic Loading Conditions
The modeled physiologic loading mode will depend on the implantation site and
may include, but is not limited to the following:
• radial dilation
• torsion
• bending
• axial tension
• axial compression
• crushing, including focal, non-focal, or uniform radial compression.
We recommend that you address the list above as well as any other relevant
loading conditions when you develop the model for your stent.
If you expect that your stents will be overlapped during clinical procedures, then
we recommend that you address the possibility of the additional stress
concentrations caused by overlapping stents.
We believe that most coronary stents indicated for use in non-bifurcated vessels
should be modeled using radial dilation in a static bend to represent potential
tortuosity of the target lesion. We recommend that you perform your stress/strain
analysis such that the stent is in a mock deployment site bent to a clinically
relevant radius of curvature as described in Section IV. Non-Clinical
Engineering Tests A. Material Characterization 3. Stent Corrosion
Resistance – Fretting Corrosion. You may also wish to consider dynamic
bending to better evaluate the performance of your stent in clinical use conditions.
For non-coronary stents, long stents, and coronary stents used in other vessel
configurations such as bifurcation lesions, we recommend that you determine the
relevant loading conditions.
Results: Stress or Strain Critical Locations and Magnitude
We recommend that you identify the critical locations of stress or strain on the
stent using finite element analysis and address the effect of dimensional variation
within allowable tolerances on the results. We recommend that you report the
location and magnitude of all maximum tensile and compressive stresses or
strains as well as the stress-strain distribution using graphics. The stress or strain
measure used should be clearly defined (e.g., principal stresses, Von Mises
stresses, etc.). We recommend that you explain why the measure used is
reasonable considering your constitutive model. Additionally, we recommend
that you explain what safety issues may arise if the stent fails in the region of
maximum stress or strain.
18

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

If you choose to perform a strain-based analysis instead of a stress-based
analysis, we recommend that you explain why the strain-based analysis is
more appropriate for your device.
10. Fatigue Analysis
Significance
Failure of a stent due to fatigue may result in loss of radial support of the stented
vessel, thrombus formation or focal restenosis, or in perforation of the vessel by the
stent struts. Fatigue analysis, combined with stress/strain analysis and accelerated
durability testing, provides an indication of device durability.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you determine the fatigue resistance of the stent to physiologic
loading using a Goodman analysis or another fatigue life analysis method. We
recommend that your test report include the following elements.
Modeled Stent Sizes
If you do not analyze all stent sizes, we recommend that you explain why the
modeled stent size is the worst case for fatigue life.
Inputs and Assumptions
FDA recommends that you use the mean and alternating stresses/strains obtained
from the stress/strain analysis as input for the fatigue life determination. We
recommend that you clearly identify and support all inputs and assumptions used
in your analysis. If you use literature values for any material properties, we
recommend that you identify the source of the data and support that your values
correspond to the as-implanted condition of the material.
If you expect that your stents will be overlapped during clinical procedures, we
recommend that you address the possibility of the additional stress concentrations
caused by overlapping stents.
We believe that most coronary stents indicated for use in non-bifurcated vessels
should be modeled using radial dilation in a static bend to represent potential
tortuosity of the target lesion. We recommend that you perform your stress/strain
analysis such that the stent is in a mock deployment site bent to a clinically
relevant radius of curvature as described in Section IV. Non-Clinical
Engineering Tests A. Material Characterization 3. Stent Corrosion
Resistance – Fretting Corrosion.
Since the material properties of nitinol are widely variable depending on
processing, we recommend for nitinol devices that you perform physical
experiments on actual post-processed samples to determine the mechanical
properties of your stent, and use these values in your analysis.
19

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Results
We recommend that you provide a Goodman diagram or other graphic that
compares the stresses at critical locations in the stent to the mechanical properties
of the stent material. We recommend that you report fatigue safety factors in a
table and explain how the safety factors were calculated.
If you choose to perform a strain-based analysis instead of a stress-based
analysis, we recommend that you explain why the strain-based analysis is
more appropriate for your device.
11. Accelerated Durability Testing
Significance
Accelerated durability testing validates fatigue analysis. It evaluates failure modes
such as fretting, abrasion, wear, and fracture. Durability testing can help in the
identification of device conditions, such as manufacturing anomalies, that were not
modeled using analytical or computational methods.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that accelerated durability testing of your stent address the
following issues.
Sample Size
We recommend that you determine sample size based on your fatigue analysis,
including boundary conditions, loading conditions, safety factors, and any other
relevant factors.
We recommend that you consider a stent as one test specimen when you report
reliability calculations and results. We recommend that you consider the stent as
one test specimen regardless of the symmetries present in apices, repeat units, or
struts of the stent.
Sizes Tested
We recommend that you select and support the stent size or sizes tested based on
the stress and fatigue analyses or other factors. We recommend that the sizes
tested represent the worst case fatigue life of your device.
Test Duration
We recommend that you test the durability of your stent to the equivalent of ten
years of real-time use under pulsatile flow and physiologic loading that simulates
blood pressure conditions in the human body. We believe that ten years of
durability data provides sufficient proof of safety of the device for most patients.
If you perform a rigorous and conservative fatigue analysis that indicates an
acceptable analytical safety factor, you may propose to complete long-term
durability testing concurrent with clinical trials and to submit the final results
20

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
when they are available, but not later than at the time of PMA submission. In this
case, results from testing through a minimum of one year time equivalent should
be provided in support of an IDE application.
Loading and Boundary Conditions
FDA recommends that you perform long-term durability testing that models the
physiological loads and boundary conditions that your stent is likely to experience
under its intended use.
We recommend that you address any other types of cyclic loading, such as
bending, that you anticipate your stent will experience when used as intended, and
incorporate these types of loading into your testing where possible. We
recommend that you explain the clinical relevance of the loading conditions used
for the accelerated durability testing. If the conditions you choose differ from the
loading conditions that you modeled in the stress and fatigue analyses, we
recommend that you report and explain the differences.
Stent systems should be tracked through a clinically relevant test fixture prior to
deployment.
Overlapping Stents
If you expect that your stents will be overlapped during clinical procedures, we
recommend that you address the possibility of the additional risk of stent failure
caused by wear or other factors. Therefore, you should test overlapping stents as
part of the durability experiment.
Deployment Site
The testing should be relevant for your intended clinical use and condition. For
example, we believe that most coronary stents indicated for use in non-bifurcation
vessels should be deployed in a mock vessel bent to a clinically relevant radius of
curvature as described in Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering Tests A.
Material Characterization 3. Stent Corrosion Resistance – Fretting
Corrosion.
Results
We recommend that you relate the outcome of your test to the stress and fatigue
analysis results.
12. Particulate Evaluation
Significance
Particulate matter can be generated by the manufacturing process or from the
breakdown of any coating (e.g., hydrophilic coating) or from the stent platform, stent
delivery system, or product packaging. If particles are introduced in the bloodstream
during stent delivery or deployment, they may present an embolic risk to the patient.
21

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Measurement of the total quantity and size of particulates a device system may
generate is an indication of embolic risk. Therefore, evaluation of particulate
generation, size, and its potential impact on the end organ served by the stented
vessels is critical.
Recommendation
We recommend that you measure the total number of particulates and size of the
particulates generated during the simulated delivery and deployment of all coronary
stents and any other stents that are determined to be high particulate risk based on a
risk analysis that takes into account the clinical setting and susceptibility of the end
organ to damage from emboli.
Test Samples
You should conduct all testing on the finished product subject to all
manufacturing processes including sterilization. You should evaluate a robust
number of stents from multiple stent lots (minimum of 3 batches) and specify the
number of samples (we recommend that a sample equals one stent, not a strut or
portion of a stent) used, the stent size(s), and the number of stent lots for each test.
We recommend that you implement a sampling plan to examine multiple lots of
product to assess both inter- and intra- lot variability. You should perform testing
on sizes that represent four corners of the stent design (see Table 2 above) as well
as an intermediate size. You should provide a scientific or statistical justification
for the selection of samples.
It may be possible to combine the Particulate Evaluation with Delivery,
Deployment and Retraction testing (see Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering
Tests C. Delivery System Dimensional and Functional Attributes 2. Delivery
Deployment and Retraction) and/or with Coating Integrity testing (see Section
IV. Non-Clinical Engineering Tests C. Delivery System Dimensional and
Functional Attributes 11. Coating Integrity) but you should take care to ensure
that only minimal additional handling of the test samples is required for the
coating integrity evaluation such that particulates are neither lost nor generated.
Test Methods
We recommend using an in vitro model intended to mimic in vivo physiologic and
anatomic worst-case conditions (e.g., tortuous path, aqueous environment) to
evaluate particulates. For coronary indications, FDA recommends the tortuous
path described by Figure X2.4 of ASTM F2394 12 . If you expect your stents may
be deployed in an overlapped configuration during clinical procedures, we
recommend that you measure particulates generated during deployment of two
overlapping stents in a mock vessel. For coronary stents, the mock vessel should
be bent to a clinically relevant radius of curvature as described in Section IV.

Delivery System

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Corrosion Resistance – Fretting Corrosion. The stent should be in direct
contact with the simulated vessel without the use of other coatings, lubricants,
sheaths, or protective wraps between the stent and the simulated vessel. To
ensure measurement of the total number of particles that could be potentially
introduced into the bloodstream, the stent delivery system should be inserted into
the text fixture to the extent which it would be inserted in clinical use and
expanded to rated burst pressure (for balloon-expandable stents) or the maximum
labeled diameter (for self-expanding stents). Additionally, any accessory devices
required for the placement of the product should be used in this evaluation. The
total number of particulates including those from the stent, delivery system, and
accessory devices should be reported in each of three size ranges: ≥10µm,
≥25µm, and at the largest size for which validation yields ≥75% recovery. At a
minimum, the largest size should be ≥50µm. Appropriate precautions should be
implemented to ensure that the particles are suspended during sampling for
particle counting and sizing to minimize artifacts from the test system.
Validation
You should describe and validate particle counting and sizing methods. We
recommend that a known amount of various particle sizes be introduced into the
test setup and the amount of particles recovered quantified. The number of
particles recovered should closely approximate the number artificially introduced
into the system. For a system to be considered validated, ≥90% recovery should
be demonstrated for the ≥10µm and ≥25µm size ranges.
13. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Safety and Compatibility
Significance
MRI of patients with stents poses the following potential hazards:
• movement of the implant, resulting in tissue damage or misplacement
• heating of the implant and subsequent tissue damage
• image artifacts that may render the MR images uninterpretable or misleading.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you address the issues affecting safety and compatibility of
your stent in the MRI environment as described in the Guidance for Industry and
FDA Staff: Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the
MR (Magnetic Resonance) Environment. 13
Test Environment
We recommend that you report details of the test environment, such as, but not
limited to:
• magnetic field strength in Tesla (T)
• maximum spatial gradient

We recommend that the magnetically induced deflection force for a stent composed
of ferromagnetic material be determined at the location where the spatial gradient of
the magnetic field is a maximum. The magnetically induced deflection force for a
stent composed of paramagnetic material should be determined at the location where
the product of the magnitudes of the magnetic field and the spatial gradient of the
magnetic field ( B ∇B ) is a maximum. (It is possible that this location is off the
central axis of the bore of the scanner.) The magnetically induced torque is a function
of the field strength, and so should be measured where the static magnetic field is the
greatest, within the bore of the magnet. Note that the physical locations of the
maximum torque and displacement force will almost certainly be different. You
should perform all testing on finished devices.
Please note that for radiofrequency (RF) heating testing using the phantom described
in ASTM F2182 or equivalent, anatomical positioning of the stent in the phantom
does not reliably predict the implant heating in the patient. Therefore, you should
provide calorimetry data to demonstrate that your test conditions are applicable to
reasonable worst-case clinical conditions for heating.
Because the potential for device heating is impacted by the relationship between the
conductive length of the device and the wavelength of the RF, higher magnetic field
strengths do not necessarily result in worst-case test conditions for a particular device.
Therefore, we recommend that you test your device at all field strengths for which
you are seeking MR Conditional labeling. Given the prevalence of 1.5 T and 3.0T
MR systems, we recommend that, at a minimum, you test your device using both of
these systems unless you are able to provide compelling evidence that a particular
system represents a worst-case situation for your device. If you anticipate that your
stents will be overlapped during clinical procedures, we recommend that you consider
the total length of overlapping stents in your determination of worst case test
conditions and test accordingly.
24

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
There is a large variability across available MR scanners of the actual specific
absorption rate (SAR) delivered. In general, the actual SAR delivered is much lower
than the value displayed on the scanner console. Therefore, we recommend that you
determine the actual SAR delivered to your stent during testing by calorimetry and
report this in the labeling.
We recommend that your labeling contain information for the patient and medical
personnel about any potential hazards associated with MRI as a result of the presence
of the implanted stent. See Section VIII. Labeling for examples of language
describing the MRI compatibility of stents in labeling.
14. Radiopacity
Significance
Stent visibility using angiographic or radiographic imaging or both generally assures
proper stent placement and allows follow-up and secondary treatment.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you evaluate the radiopacity of your stent at the smallest
diameter and the shortest length during the following stages in the life of the stent:
• delivery
• deployment, if separate from delivery
• after implantation.
We recommend that you provide a qualitative or quantitative indication of the
visibility of the stent on real-time and plane film x-ray. It is acceptable to use data
from images of animal implants, in vitro phantoms, or equivalent models.
15. Crush Resistance (Peripheral Indications Only)
Significance
Peripheral stents in some anatomic locations may experience external, non-cardiac,
focal, or distributed loads. These loads could cause stent deformation and, possibly,
adverse clinical consequences.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you demonstrate the ability of your stent to recover its desired
size and shape after application and removal of external loads, deformations, or both.
We recommend that you support the nature, location, and extent of all external loads
and deformations based on the intended implantation site, for example, the carotid or
femoral arteries. Testing may include the application of focal loads, axially
distributed loads, or both, depending on the target vasculature.
We recommend that you report the change in unloaded stent dimensions after the
application and removal of all of the specified loads and displacements.
25

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations

16. Kink Resistance (Peripheral Indications Only)
Significance
Peripheral stents used in some anatomic locations will bend during normal body
motion, such as knee flexion. Such bends could cause stent deformation and possible
adverse clinical consequences.
Recommendation
We recommend that you determine the smallest radius of curvature that your stent
can withstand without kinking, and demonstrate that the stent recovers its original
size and shape after testing. We recommend that you support the nature, location,
and extent of all external loads and deformations based on the intended implantation
site, for example, the carotid or femoral arteries.
17. Additional Tests for Stents Intended for In-Stent Restenosis
Significance
Deployment of stents within previously implanted stents to treat in-stent restenosis
could result in increased corrosion potential, stress, fatigue, wear, coating damage,
and particulate generation due to stent to stent interactions.
Recommendation
If you intend to label your stent for in-stent restenosis, we recommend you repeat the
following tests within an expanded stent (i.e., with 100% overlapped stent pairs):
• Fretting Corrosion (refer to Section A.3)
• Stress/Strain Analysis (refer to Section B.9)
• Fatigue Analysis (refer to Section B.10)
• Accelerated Durability Testing (refer to Section B.11)
• Particulate Evaluation, if appropriate for the indications for use (refer to
Section B.12).
18. Additional Tests for Stents Intended for Coronary Bifurcation Lesions
Significance
Stents designed for placement in coronary bifurcation lesions may be subjected to
different loading conditions which could result in different corrosion potential, stress,
fatigue, wear, coating damage, and particulate generation due to anatomical
constraints and stent to stent interactions.
Recommendation
If you intend to label your stent for use in bifurcation lesions, we recommend that you
simulate the target deployment site with a mock vessel which includes the following
features:
• parent vessel bend at a clinically relevant radius of curvature (as described in
Section A. 3),
26

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•
•

a bifurcation angle representative of the most challenging anatomical situation
likely to be encountered in clinical use, and
additional treatment of parent and/or side-branch vessels per expected clinical
use, with simulated angioplasty and/or stenting if the bifurcation stent allows
side-branch access.

The selection of the radius of curvature of the mock vessel and of the bifurcation
angle should be supported by an analysis of clinical images from representative target
vessels or referenced literature.
The following test methods should be updated to include the alternative target
deployment site described above:
• Fretting Corrosion (refer to Section A.3)
• Stress/Strain Analysis (refer to Section B.9)
• Fatigue Analysis (refer to Section B.10)
• Accelerated Durability Testing (refer to Section B.11)
• Particulate Evaluation (refer to Section B.12)
• Delivery, Deployment, and Retraction (refer to Section C.2).
Additionally, if the bifurcation stent allows for side-branch access, compatibility
testing should be performed to ensure the stent does not cause balloon rupture of a
PTCA catheter. We recommend you evaluate the Balloon Rated Burst Pressure and
Balloon Fatigue of PTCA catheters within your expanded stent. For more
information, please refer to Section IX.C. Additional Tests for Catheters Intended
for In-Stent Restenosis or for Stent Expansion following Stent Deployment from
the Class II Special Controls Guidance Document for Certain Percutaneous
Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Catheters. 14

C. Delivery System Dimensional and Functional Attributes
1. Dimensional Verification
Significance
Stent delivery system dimensions influence the ability of the device to track to and
across lesions.
Recommendation
We recommend that you provide dimensional specifications and tolerances for your
device as manufactured. At a minimum, we recommend that you report effective
length, shaft inner and outer diameter, and crossing profile.
The crossing profile is defined as the maximum diameter found between the proximal
end of the mounted stent and the distal tip of the delivery system. Testing should
address potential differences in crossing profile that may exist in the circumferential

direction. For these situations, we recommend that you evaluate the crossing profile
of your delivery system along different longitudinal paths (e.g., rotating test sample
90 degrees for measurements). We recommend that you report the crossing profile in
the instructions for use, the outside package labeling, or both. We recommend the
methods described in ASTM F2081 or their equivalents.
2. Delivery, Deployment, and Retraction
Significance
The delivery catheter should safely and reliably deliver the stent to the intended
location according to the instructions for use, without damage to the stent.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you conduct testing to demonstrate that the delivery catheter
can safely and reliably deliver the stent to the intended location and that the stent is
not adversely affected by the delivery catheter, both during deployment and
withdrawal.
We recommend that this simulated use testing be performed by tracking the device
through an in vitro fixture that mimics challenging in vivo physiologic and anatomic
conditions (e.g., a tortuous path, aqueous environment), to the extent that the device
would enter a patient in clinical use. For coronary indications, FDA recommends the
tortuous path described by Figure X2.4 of ASTM F2394. For peripheral indications,
please provide an appropriate justification for your final model, including schematics
of the fixture and a clinically-based discussion of why it provides a sufficiently
challenging model for device tracking. We recommend that you conduct all testing
on complete sterilized assemblies with mounted stents and any accessory devices that
would be used in a typical clinical procedure (e.g., introducer or guiding catheter),
using worst-case sizes (e.g., smallest guiding catheter ID). We also recommend that
you thermally equilibrate all test samples in a 37°C saline bath. You should report
any abnormality or difficulty observed during the simulated procedure, as well as any
damage observed on the stent, delivery system, or any of the accessory devices. We
recommend that you measure and report the diameter and axial location of the largest
deflated balloon profile (including the inner member or wire). This information can
be used to determine the extreme dimensions of compatible accessory devices (i.e.,
minimum internal diameter), which should be identified in the labeling.
It may be possible to combine Delivery, Deployment and Retraction testing with
Particulate Evaluation (see Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering Tests B. Stent
Dimensional and Functional Attributes 12. Particulate Evaluation) and/or with
Coating Integrity (see Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering Tests C. Delivery
System Dimensional and Functional Attributes 11. Coating Integrity), but you
should take care to ensure that only minimal additional handling of the test samples is
required for the coating integrity evaluation such that particulates are neither lost nor
generated.

3. Balloon Rated Burst Pressure (Balloon Expandable Stents Only)
Significance
The rated burst pressure (RBP) is the pressure at which 99.9% of balloons can survive
with 95% confidence. Failure of a balloon to survive at the RBP could result in
device failure or vessel damage.
Recommendation
We recommend that you test balloons with mounted stents that are not constrained by
any test fixture, such as tubing. If the entire range of device sizes will have a single
labeled RBP; we recommend that you conduct testing on the longest length of every
balloon diameter, plus the smallest diameter at the shortest length and the largest
diameter at the shortest length. Table 3 illustrates the recommended test matrix for a
stent design that ranges in diameter from 2.5 to 4.0 mm and ranges in length from 8 to
24 mm.

We recommend that you test according to the example in Table 3 for each balloon
size with a different labeled RBP. We recommend that you test balloons that are not
constrained by any test fixture such as tubing, and that you inflate the balloons
incrementally until failure.
We recommend that you record as test failures any loss of:
• integrity of the balloon, such as a rupture or leak
• pressure due to failure of the balloon, shaft, or seals.
We recommend that you record the pressure at which the device failed and the failure
mode. We also recommend that you calculate RBP as the pressure at which 99.9% of
the balloons will survive with 95% confidence based on statistical analysis of the test
data. We recommend that you specify RBP in the device labeling.
4. Balloon Fatigue (Repeat Balloon Inflations; Balloon Expandable Stents Only)
Significance
Balloons on stent delivery systems are often inflated multiple times during clinical
use. Failure of the balloon to withstand multiple inflations could lead to device
failure or vessel damage.

29

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you determine the repeatability, to 10 inflations, of successful
balloon inflation to the RBP. We recommend that your sample dimensions follow the
four corners paradigm:
• largest diameter/longest length
• largest diameter/shortest length
• smallest diameter/longest length
• smallest diameter/shortest length.
We recommend that you test balloons with mounted stents that are not constrained by
any test fixture such as tubing and that you inflate the balloons in increments until
they reach the RBP. For each sample we recommend that you hold the RBP for 30
seconds (or the time specified in the instructions for use), deflate the balloon, and
inflate it again to the RBP, for a total of 10 cycles. Note that the number of cycles
recommended for this testing is different from our recommendations for balloon
catheters indicated for angioplasty (PTCA catheters). This difference is intentional
and reflects the likely number of inflations that would occur with use of a stent
delivery system versus a stand-alone PTCA catheter. We recommend that you report
any loss of pressure, whether due to failure of the balloon, shaft, or proximal or distal
seals, as a test failure. We recommend that you record all failure modes, and that
your results demonstrate that 90% of the balloons will survive the test with 95%
confidence.
5. Balloon Compliance (Stent Diameter vs. Balloon Pressure; Balloon Expandable
Stents Only)
Significance
The diameter of a deployed balloon expandable stent varies with the balloon inflation
pressure. A compliance chart in the labeling that relates stent diameter to balloon
pressure guides selection of stent size to fit the target lesion. Incorrect selection of
stent size may lead to device failure or vessel damage.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you test balloon sizes as illustrated in Table 3, and that you
test multiple product lots. We recommend that you explain why you chose the test
sample size. We recommend that you include data showing inflation pressure versus
balloon diameter over the full range of recommended inflation diameters, and report
the final results in the instructions for use, the outside package labeling, or both. A
graphical or tabular presentation (i.e., a compliance chart) is desirable.
We recommend that you identify the nominal inflation pressure and RBP, as shown in
the example below. The compliance chart may include pressures up to (but not
exceeding) 25% above the RBP, if you provide data and statistics demonstrating that
99% of the balloons will not fail at the listed pressure with 95% confidence. We also
recommend that you describe how you performed any data rounding and show all
instances. Table 4 below shows an example of a compliance chart for a stent with
30

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, and 4.0 mm diameters, with a RBP of 16 atmospheres (atm). The
nominal diameter occurs at 9.0 atm.

6. Balloon Inflation and Deflation Time (Balloon Expandable Stents Only)
Significance
Balloons occlude the target vessel and obstruct blood flow while inflated. Inflation
and deflation times affect occlusion time. Excessively slow inflation or deflation of a
balloon could lead to prolonged ischemia and damage to the end organ.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you demonstrate, using techniques recommended in your
instruction manual (e.g., pre-dilation), that the balloon inflates and deflates within
acceptable times, and provide the clinical basis for your acceptance criteria. We
recommend that you test the largest diameter at the longest balloon length, and
evaluate which other sizes to test. We also recommend you specify the balloon
deflation times in your labeling. Please observe and describe any interference with
balloon deflation or delivery system extraction from the deployed stent.
7. Catheter Bond Strength
Significance
Failure of bonds in the delivery catheter could lead to device failure or vessel
damage.
Recommendation
We recommend that you test the bond strength at locations where adhesives, thermal
fusion, or other joining methods are used for bonding components of the delivery
system. Prior to evaluating tensile strength, we recommend you precondition
catheters by tracking through a tortuous path fixture, as described above in Section 2.
Delivery, Deployment and Retraction). We recommend that testing demonstrate
31

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
that all bonds can withstand tensile forces greater than those that may be experienced
during clinical use. We also recommend you provide the clinical basis for your
acceptance criteria.
8. Tip Pull Test
Significance
Failure of bonds in the distal tip could lead to device failure or vessel damage.
Recommendation
For devices with one or more joints in the distal tip (e.g., spring or nose-cone tips),
FDA recommends that you determine the tensile force that will separate the distal tip
from the catheter. We recommend that you precondition catheters prior to tip pull
testing by tracking through a tortuous path fixture, as described above in Section 2.
Delivery, Deployment and Retraction.
9. Flexibility and Kink Test
Significance
Stent delivery systems may be subjected to tight angulations in tortuous vasculature
during use. Inability to withstand flexural forces that are typical of clinical use could
lead to device failure or vessel damage.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you conduct testing which demonstrates that the stent delivery
system will not kink at a bend radius that is appropriate for the intended anatomy.
We recommend that you consider wrapping the catheter around a series of mandrels
with successively smaller radii until the catheter kinks or the lumen collapses. We
also recommend you provide the clinical basis for your acceptance criteria.
10. Torque Strength
Significance
Stent delivery systems may be subjected to torsional forces during use. Even nonfixed wire delivery systems could be subject to torsional forces if the tip is
inadvertently caught on a previously deployed stent, calcified lesion, etc. Inability to
withstand torsional forces that are typical of clinical use could lead to device failure
or vessel damage.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you measure the torque strength of the stent delivery system
when the distal tip is not free to rotate, by rotating the proximal end of the catheter
until failure. We recommend that you precondition delivery systems prior to
evaluating torque strength by tracking through a tortuous path fixture, as described
above in Section 2. Delivery, Deployment and Retraction. We recommend that
you report the number of rotations to failure and the failure mode for each sample
tested. Additionally, we recommend that you test the delivery system in a fixture that
32

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
simulates the anatomy of the aortic arch and coronary arteries. We also recommend
you provide the clinical basis for your acceptance criteria.
11. Coating Integrity
Significance
Unintended delamination or degradation of a coating may lessen its benefit or
otherwise negatively impact its clinical performance.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you address the aspects described below for any coatings
applied to the surfaces of your product.
Coating Description
We recommend that you describe the clinical purpose and intended function of
the coating, such as enhanced radiopacity, thromboresistance, or lubricity.
We also recommend that you describe the physical structure of the coating, such
as coating thickness, and indicate its chemical identity.
Test Samples
You should conduct all testing on the finished product subject to all
manufacturing processes including sterilization. You should provide a scientific
or statistical justification for the sample size for each test. We recommend that
you implement a sampling plan to examine multiple lots of product (≥3) to assess
both inter- and intra-lot variability. You should perform testing on sizes that
represent four corners of the stent design (see Table 2 above) as well as an
intermediate size.
It may be possible to combine the Coating Integrity Evaluation with Delivery,
Deployment and Retraction testing (see Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering
Tests C. Delivery System Dimensional and Functional Attributes 2. Delivery
Deployment and Retraction) and/or with Particulate Evaluation (see Section IV.
Non-Clinical Engineering Tests B. Stent Dimensional and Functional
Attributes 12. Particulate Evaluation) but you should take care to ensure that
only minimal additional handling of the test samples is required for the coating
integrity evaluation such that particulates are neither lost nor generated.
Interpretation of Data
Coating integrity is considered a characterization test. Acceptance criteria are not
required; however, you should provide an interpretation of the data.
In your coating integrity test reports you should include a detailed discussion of
the surfaces using any practical methods to quantify defects. This may include
counting the number of total defects per unit area, measuring representative defect
areas, and measuring worst-case defect areas. You should support your
33

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
discussion with representative images (including worst-case) at a sufficient
magnification to characterize the defects. Multiple magnifications may be needed
to visualize and adequately characterize the product. The discussion of acceptable
coating integrity should include a justification that the number and size of defects
observed will not impact clinical performance.
We recommend that you address the aspects described below for any coatings
applied to the surfaces of your product.
Baseline Coating Integrity
We recommend that you conduct a visual assessment of the coating integrity on
all appropriate surfaces of the delivery system before stent deployment to
establish a baseline for comparison to coating characteristics after testing
performed under other conditions. We recommend that you appropriately
quantify characteristics such as continuity and voids in the coating, as described
above.
Simulated Use Coating Integrity
We also recommend that you evaluate the coating integrity after simulated use,
via visual assessment. Devices should be tracked through a tortuous path fixture
(as described above in Section 2. Delivery, Deployment and Retraction) and
then expanded in air or an aqueous medium to the maximum labeled diameter
described in the Instructions for Use prior to visual inspection. You should also
assess the impact of simulated use on the functional aspects of the coating.
12. Stent Securement for Unsheathed Stents
Significance
Dislodgment of the stent prior to deployment can result in stent embolization. Stents
without sheaths may dislodge if they catch on tortuous anatomy, guide catheters, or
other devices.
Recommendation
FDA recommends that you measure the force that will dislodge the stent from the
delivery system under clinically relevant conditions. We recommend that the test
simulate the intended use, including insertion through a tortuous path that simulates
the vasculature proximal to and including the lesion site. We recommend that the
tortuous path be sized appropriately for the stent size being tested. We recommend
that you submit a photo, diagram, or description of the tortuous path, including
dimensions. For coronary indications, FDA recommends the tortuous path described
by Figure X2.4 of ASTM F2394. For peripheral indications, please provide the
clinical basis for your final model. We recommend that the stent sizes tested
represent the worst case stent securement for your design. We recommend that you
explain why your results are applicable to all sizes of your stent, including those not
tested for stent securement.

34

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
FDA recommends that you address the modes of dislodgement as described below:
Dislodgement by Forward Motion
Advancing a stent delivery system across a tight lesion could result in stent
dislodgement. We recommend testing the stent by passing it through a simulated
tight lesion in the tortuous path.
Dislodgement by Reverse Motion
Withdrawing a stent delivery system into a guiding catheter, arterial sheath, or
hemostasis valve could result in stent dislodgement. We recommend testing the
stent by attempting to withdraw the un-deployed stent into a guide catheter or
other opening of the smallest size for an accessory device recommended in the
instructions for use.

D. Shelf Life
Significance
Aging can potentially affect the performance of the materials of construction for the
stent and delivery system.
Recommendation
We recommend that shelf life testing address package integrity to ensure sterility, as
well as stable device functionality over the expected life cycle.
To evaluate device functionality, we recommend that you repeat the following bench
tests on aged devices:
• Stent Dimensional Verification (refer to Section B.1)
• Stent Foreshortening* (refer to Section B.3)
• Radial Outward Force* (refer to Section B.7)
• Particulate Evaluation (refer to Section B.12)
• Delivery System Dimensional Verification (refer to Section C.1)
• Delivery, Deployment, and Retraction (refer to Section C.2)
• Balloon Rated Burst Pressure (refer to Section C.3)
• Balloon Fatigue (refer to Section C.4)
• Balloon Compliance (refer to Section C.5)
• Balloon Inflation and Deflation Time (refer to Section C.6)
• Catheter Bond Strength (refer to Section C.7)
• Tip Pull Test (refer to Section C.8)
• Flexibility and Kink Test (refer to Section C.9)
• Torque Strength (refer to Section C.10)
• Coating Integrity (refer to Section C.11)

35

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

Stent Securement for Unsheathed Stents (refer to Section C.12)
*only repeat testing on aged stents if self-expanding

Additional tests may be recommended for certain devices, depending on their design,
materials (alloys), or manufacturing processes.
We recommend that you provide the protocol used for your shelf life testing, the
results of the testing, and the conclusions drawn from your results. If you use devices
subjected to accelerated aging for shelf life testing, we recommend that you specify
the way in which the device was aged. Since stent delivery systems contain
polymeric materials, you should plan to conduct testing on real-time aged samples to
confirm that accelerated aging is reflective of real-time aging. This testing should be
conducted in parallel with PMA review and approval, with results submitted in a
post-approval annual report.

E. Biocompatibility
Significance
Stents and delivery systems contain patient-contacting materials, which when used
for their intended purpose, i.e., contact type and duration, may induce a harmful
biological response.
Recommendation
We recommend that you determine the biocompatibility of all patient-contacting
materials present in your device. If your materials are identical in composition and
processing methods to materials with a history of successful use in cardiovascular
product applications, you may reference the appropriate literature or previous testing
experience. We recommend that you test novel materials, i.e., those with no history
of successful prior use according to the methods in the FDA-recognized version of
relevant ASTM, USP, and ISO standards. In addition, we recommend that you
follow the guidance Use of International Standard ISO-10993, 'Biological
Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing 15 to identify the
types of tests that should be considered.
Differences in formulation, processing or sterilization that could affect
biocompatibility of the final product may warrant additional biocompatibility testing.
Sample Preparation
It is important to understand how the test samples compare to the final sterilized
product. For biocompatibility testing conducted using extraction samples, we
recommend that you:
•

15

determine the appropriate amount of test material as outlined in ISO 10993-12
or an equivalent method, using surface area to extractant volume ratios (mass

https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/deviceregulationandguidance/guidancedocuments/ucm348890.pdf

36

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
to extractant volume ratios should only be used if surface area cannot be
calculated)
•

use both polar and nonpolar extractants

•

describe the condition of the extraction vehicle (e.g., color, presence of any
particles)

•

explain any changes in the post-extraction vehicle (compared to preextraction)

•

describe the details of storage conditions, if applicable.

If extraction samples are not used immediately, we recommend that you follow the
storage conditions described in ISO 10993-12 or an equivalent method. We also
recommend that you explain how storage does not affect your test results.
Stents
Because stents are implanted products in contact with cardiovascular tissue and
circulating blood, with a permanent duration of contact (>30 days), we recommend
the following tests be considered:
• cytotoxicity
• sensitization (guinea pig maximization with both polar and non-polar extracts)
• irritation (or intracutaneous reactivity)
• acute systemic toxicity
• material-mediated pyrogenicity
• hemocompatibility [hemolysis, in vivo thrombogenicity, and direct contact
complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9)]
• sub-chronic toxicity
• genotoxicity (bacterial reverse mutation assay, mammalian cell in vitro assay,
and in vivo cytogenetics assay in rodents)
• chronic toxicity
• implantation
• carcinogenicity.
Delivery Systems
Because delivery catheters are externally communicating products in contact with
cardiovascular tissue and circulating blood, with a temporary duration of contact (<24
hrs), we recommend the following tests be considered:
• cytotoxicity
• sensitization (guinea pig maximization with both polar and non-polar extracts)
• irritation (or intracutaneous reactivity)
• acute systemic toxicity
• material-mediated pyrogenicity
37

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

hemocompatibility [hemolysis, in vivo thrombogenicity, and direct contact
complement activation (C3a and SC5b-9))
• genotoxicity (bacterial reverse mutation assay, mammalian cell in vitro assay,
and in vivo cytogenetics assay in rodents).
Additional testing may be requested to fully characterize the toxicology profile,
depending on the materials of use.
Additional Considerations
• Cytotoxicity
We recommend that extractions be conducted at 37°C for 24 hours using a vehicle
with both mammalian cell culture media (MEM) and 5% serum, as these
materials will allow for extraction of both polar and nonpolar constituents from
the test sample.
•

Sensitization (Guinea Pig Maximization Method)
We recommend that test reports confirm that all female animals used in the
testing are not pregnant, as pregnancy can reduce the ability of a female animal to
detect a sensitization response.
We recommend either that you run concurrent controls, or that the test laboratory
run controls within 3 months of the test samples. We also recommend you
provide protocols and results from positive control testing to confirm that you
used the same methods for both the positive control testing and the test samples.
•

Hemocompatibility
For blood-contacting devices (regardless of contact duration), we recommend that
you consider hemolysis, immunology (complement activation), and in vivo
thromboresistance.
Immunology testing should appropriately address the various complement
activation pathways. We recommend that you assess in vitro C3a and SC5b-9
fragment activation using standard testing methods, such as those outlined in
ASTM F2065-00e1 16 and ASTM F1984-99 (2003) 17 , or an equivalent method.
Alternatively, you may provide a rationale for omitting this testing, if all the
materials used in the formulation and processing of the device have a history of
previous use in blood-contacting devices with similar contact duration.
In addition, you may assess in vivo thrombogenicity during preclinical animal
testing in lieu of a separate canine in vivo thrombogenicity test. If a 4 hour canine
in vivo thrombogenicity study is needed (e.g., due to the use of novel materials
never before used in a medical devices or questionable findings from the vascular

ASTM F1984-99 (2003) Whole Complement Activation in Serum by Solid Materials.

38

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
animal studies), we recommend the study be conducted in a venous,
unheparinized model.
•

Material-mediated Pyrogenicity
We recommend that you assess pyrogenic responses to chemical leachants over
the duration of device contact with the patient. We recommend that you assess
material-mediated pyrogenicity using traditional biocompatibility extraction
methods, such as those outlined in the USP 28 <151> Rabbit Pyrogen Test (e.g.,
50°C for 72 hours; 70°C for 24 hours; or 120°C for 2 hours) or an equivalent
method. You should consider that temperatures above 37°C may result in
toxicities not representative of the final product.
•

Nickel ion release
For devices containing nitinol, we recommend that you consider the potential for
nickel ion release from your device. Specifically, if you cannot demonstrate that
your nitinol device exhibits sufficient corrosion resistance as well as an adequate
passivation layer, we recommend that you quantify nickel ion release from your
device over time. Testing can be performed by measuring concentrations of
nickel leached from the device into a fluid with physiologic temperature and pH.

V. Labeling
General labeling requirements for medical devices are described in 21 CFR Part 801.
Additional information may be obtained from Device Advice. 18 You must submit all
proposed labeling in your PMA [21 CFR 814.20(b)(10)].
FDA recommends that labeling for extracranial intravascular stents include the sections
described below. Some of these recommendations may also be relevant to covered, drugeluting, and biodegradable stents; however, FDA recommends additional labeling, not
described in this document, for those devices. The Interventional Cardiology Devices
Branch and the Peripheral Vascular Devices Branch are available to discuss labeling for
those stents and indications.

A. Device Description
We recommend that you describe the stent and delivery catheter, including the stent
material, whether the stent is balloon expandable or self-expanding, etc. You should
consider including a table with the following attributes, as appropriate:
• available stent diameters and lengths
• guiding catheter/sheath compatibility
• deployment and RBPs
• percent stent free area.

18

http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/default.htm

39

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
We recommend that you describe any ancillary or accessory devices that are packaged
with your stent system when no separate labeling is available. An example would be a
description of an embolic protection system that is packaged with your stent delivery
system. You may add additional information where appropriate.

B. Indications for Use
We recommend that proposed labeling reflect the precise indications for use statement
that is the subject of the application. The general statement of the “Indications for Use”
identifies the target population in which sufficient valid scientific evidence has demonstrated
that the device as labeled will provide clinically significant results and at the same time does
not present an unreasonable risk of illness or injury associated with the use of the device.

C. Contraindications
We recommend that you include contraindications to the use of the device.
Contraindications describe situations in which the device should not be used because the
risk of use clearly outweighs any possible benefit.

D. Warnings
We recommend that you include an appropriate warning if there is reasonable evidence
of an association of a serious hazard with the use of the device. A causal relationship
need not have been proved.
We believe a warning is also appropriate when the device is commonly used for a disease
or condition for which there is a lack of valid scientific evidence of effectiveness for that
disease or condition or use of the device is associated with a serious risk or hazard.
We also recommend that you include warnings to address the:
•
•
•

need for appropriate anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy or both
recommendation that when multiple stents are used, they should be of similar
composition
fact that long-term outcomes following repeat dilatation of endothelialized stents are
unknown.

E. Precautions
You should include as precautions information regarding any special care physicians or
others should exercise for the safe and effective use of the device. Additionally, you should
include any limitations on the use of a device for reasons including, but not limited to:
•
•
•
•

lack of long-term safety and effectiveness data
lack of safety and effectiveness data for special patient populations
need for appropriate physician training
anatomical or physiological limitations on the effectiveness of the device.

40

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
Stent handling, stent placement, stent system removal, and any post-implant precautions
are appropriate for inclusion in this section. Additionally, you should address length of
follow-up or use in special patient populations, for example:
The safety and effectiveness of the ABC (coronary or peripheral) stent system has not
been established in patients beyond x (months/years) of follow-up.
or
The safety and effectiveness of the XYZ coronary stent system has not been
established in patients with recent acute myocardial infarction.

F. MR Environment
We recommend you follow the labeling guidelines given in Guidance for Industry
and FDA Staff: Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in
the MR (Magnetic Resonance) Environment 19
Overlapping Stents or Stents with Fractured Struts
In addition to the labeling recommendations in the Guidance for Industry and FDA
Staff: Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive Implants in the MR
(Magnetic Resonance) Environment, FDA recommends that your labeling also
describe whether you determined the effect of heating in the MRI environment for
overlapping stents or stents with fractured struts. If you have not determined what
those effects are, we recommend that your labeling reflect this, for example:
The effect of heating in the MRI environment for overlapping stents or stents with
fractured struts is not known.

G. Overview of Clinical Studies
You should provide a narrative description of the pivotal study or studies and any
supporting or feasibility studies relevant to the stent. The narrative should be brief, and
should include the following information for each study:

19

•

whether the study was a pivotal, supporting, or feasibility study

•

the design of the study, including any randomization, blinding, and the control or
controls used

•

the number of patients enrolled

•

the number of investigational sites both inside the United States (US) and outside
the United States (OUS)

•

the primary study endpoint or endpoints

•

the amount of available follow-up

•

the total planned follow-up.

H. Adverse Events
Observed Adverse Events
You should provide a brief narrative statement about the source or sources of the
adverse event experience followed by results in a tabular format. In the table, we
recommend that you present adverse events using a “per protocol” (also known as an
“evaluable”) approach.
In this approach, the numerator consists of the number of patients presenting with the
adverse event during or before the analysis window. For each adverse event, the
denominator consists of:
The number of
patients evaluated
during the analysis
window

+

Any patients not evaluated during the analysis
window, but that had the specified adverse
event between treatment and the analysis
window

The numerator consists of the number of patients presenting with the adverse event
during or before the analysis window.
You may also use an alternative approach known as “intent-to-treat” analysis, in
which any patients not evaluated during the analysis window are assumed to have had
an adverse event. If your trial involves substantial numbers of crossover patients, an
intent-to-treat analysis may be more appropriate. In this analysis, adverse events
would be assigned to the original treatment group regardless of actual treatment
received or time at which the adverse event occurred.
You should include an adverse events table that captures data through the longest
available follow-up for the study. You should also provide protocol definitions for
adverse events as footnotes, or a reference to definitions included with the Principal
Safety and Effectiveness Table.
We have provided a list of suggested elements for inclusion, below. Additional
elements may be appropriate given the specific vessel or vessels to be stented.
Coronary Indications
You should separate in-hospital events from out-of-hospital events (through X
days or months), for categories such as:
•

major adverse cardiac events (MACE), which includes:
o death
o Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI)
o non-Q-wave MI

I. Clinical Studies
You should include additional specifics about the clinical studies described in the section
titled “Overview of Clinical Studies,” above. We suggest the following format:
Purpose/Objective
You should state the intent of the study, including the primary endpoint or endpoints.
Conclusions
You should briefly state the study outcome or outcomes.
Design
You should describe your study design. The following is a partial list of elements
that may be appropriate to your design:
•

whether the design is randomized or non-randomized

•

whether the study is controlled

•

which type of controls were used

•

if the study results were compared to a performance goal

•

how any performance goals were derived.

You should also describe the success criteria for the trial (i.e., superiority or noninferiority when compared to the control).
You should include a brief description of patient entry criteria, such as:
•

vessel location

•

vessel size

•

vessel type, (i.e., de novo or restenotic)

•

type of evaluations (clinical, telephone, angiographic/intravascular ultrasound
follow-up).

Demographics
You should describe characteristics of your patient populations that could affect the
results of the study, including:
•

age

•

race

•

sex

•

percentage of smokers

•

incidence of hyperlipidemia

•

previous MI

•

diabetes

44

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
•

any other important covariates.

Methods
You should describe any use of a Clinical Events Committee, a Data and Safety
Monitoring Board, and/or a core laboratory for adverse event adjudication, as
appropriate.
Results
You should briefly describe the results of the study, including whether the primary
endpoint or endpoints were met, for example:
The X stent demonstrated a lower rate of TVF as compared to the control group
(X% vs. Y%, P<0.001).
You should refer to the Principal Safety and Effectiveness Table, which is described
in the next section of this guidance.

J. Principal Safety and Effectiveness Table
We recommend that you present the clinical outcomes in a tabular format as
“effectiveness measures” and “safety measures,” separately or combined. Your data
presentation should follow the same approach used for adverse event reporting (for
example, per protocol or intent-to-treat). You should include protocol definitions for
terms used in the table.
You should provide Kaplan-Meier estimates for relevant endpoints in your safety and
effectiveness table, which may include, but are not limited to:
• MACE-free survival
• MAE-free survival
• TVF-free survival
• TVR-free survival
• TLR-free survival
• primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency survival.
In some instances, it may be appropriate to provide a graphical presentation of the most
appropriate Kaplan-Meier survival endpoints (see examples of these endpoints below)
and accompanying life tables. We believe that statistical comparisons between groups, as
presented in a Kaplan-Meier presentation, are only appropriate for randomized trials.
The review branches are available to advise you on this issue.
Examples of Kaplan-Meier survival endpoints
• “Freedom from MACE” for coronary and peripheral stenting studies
• “Patency survival” for peripheral stenting studies

45

Contains Nonbinding Recommendations
If you provide a survival graph, it should include error bars representing a standard error
(SE) of ± 1.5. The scale should either begin on the y-axis at a value greater than zero –
we recommend using a value around 50 - 60% – or indicating a break in the scale to
illustrate the differences in survival curves, if applicable.
Updates to Principal Safety and Effectiveness Table
For some devices, updates to the Principal Safety and Effectiveness Table to reflect
additional clinical follow-up beyond the primary follow-up interval are identified as a
condition of PMA approval. In this case, the updated labeling should be submitted as
a PMA supplement.
If such an update is not listed as a condition of approval, you may provide the
updated labeling in your annual report, as long as the updated information is based on
the endpoints and follow-up schedule prospectively defined in your clinical study
protocol. For updates that relate to new indications, see 21 CFR 814.39. The
labeling should indicate which data were added or updated after the initial device
approval.
If clinical results in the updates raise a safety or effectiveness concern when
compared to the initial results of your study, we recommend that you update the
labeling to reflect this new information.

K. Patient Selection and Treatment
We recommend that this section provide information related to individualization of
treatment.

L. Directions for Use
You should include directions for proper preparation and use of the device in this section
of the labeling. If multiple delivery systems are available, you should clearly indicate
differences specific to the delivery system. An example would be to indicate the
difference between an over-the-wire (OTW) and a rapid exchange (RX) delivery system.
Compliance Chart (Balloon Expandable Stents Only)
Pre-mounted Balloon Expandable Stents
You should include a compliance chart that provides the average stent inner
diameter following deployment at various pressures derived from bench testing.
You should display the data as determined from testing. However, if you round
the data, you should footnote the chart to indicate that the data is rounded. We
recommend the format presented in Table 4 (see Section IV. Non-Clinical
Engineering Tests, B. Stent Dimensional And Functional Attributes, 4.
Recoil For Balloon Expandable Stents).

Percent Foreshortening (Self-Expanding Stents Only)
You should provide a table that shows:
• vessel lumen diameter
• unconstrained stent diameter
• percent foreshortening.
If you base your values on mathematical calculations, you should indicate this in a
footnote to the table. See Section IV. Non-Clinical Engineering Tests, B. Stent
Dimensional And Functional Attributes, 3. Foreshortening, for information on
testing stent percent foreshortening.

M. Patient Materials
You should provide all patient materials, such as the patient guide and implant card, that you
will make available. See also Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling, 20
For MR Conditional stents, we recommend you include the bulleted points from the
Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Establishing Safety and Compatibility of Passive
Implants in the MR (Magnetic Resonance) Environment. In addition, we recommend
you include the following:
•
the appropriate MR safety icon and term from ASTM F2503 21
if applicable, a statement similar to the following: Patients with the device may
•
safely undergo MRI for (insert appropriate term: "Normal Operating Mode" or
"First Level Controlled Operating Mode") of the MR System as defined in IEC
60601-2-33 22
a statement about the image artifact
•
•
a recommendation that patients register the conditions under which the implant can
be scanned safely with the MedicAlert Foundation (www.medicalert.org) or
equivalent organization.
