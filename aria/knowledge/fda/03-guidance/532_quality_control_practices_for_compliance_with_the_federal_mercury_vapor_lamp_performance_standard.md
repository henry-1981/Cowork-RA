1.0 
FDA Compliance Policy 
The performance standard for high-intensity mercury vapor discharge 
lamps issued by the Food and Drug Administration t o  becane effective- 
March 7 , 1980, requires mamf acturer certification of mercury vapor and 
metal halide lamps. 
That certification is the manufacturer's assurance 
t o  the custan4rs that each lamp canplies with a l l  of the applicable 
requirements of the standard during its useful l i f e .  
Certification of self -extinguishing rn-cury 
vapor or metal halide lamps 
w i l l  clearly r e w i r e  destructive testing of sane lamps. 
The FDA w i l l  
be testing samples of such lamps a t  its Winchester Engineering acd 
Analytical Center laboratory i n  Winchester, Massachusetts (draft t e s t  
procedures in Appendix B). 
Controlled t e s t s  w i l l  be performed there t o  
determine if lamps which are certified a s  self-extinguishing do in 
f a c t  self -extinguish within the required time, 15 minutes, under the 
appropriate breakage conditions, 
Lamps manufactured a f t e r  the standard becanes effective and prior t o  
Septanber 8, 1981, w i l l  be tested t o  determine i f  they self-extinguish 
with canplete breakage of the outer envelope. 
A f t e r  t h a t  date they w i l l  
be tested with only partial breakage a s  specified in the standard. 
,, 
Sane l a p s  w i l l  undergo life testing tc assure t h a t  t h e i r  self-extinguish- 
. . 
ing mechanism w i l l  operate over the useful l i f e  of the lamp. 
Also, a t  
the same time these lamps are tested for &rfomance, t h e i r  labels w i l l  
be examined t o  assure that they ccmply with the requirements and w i l l  
-+ 
rgnain attached and legible through the useful l i f e  of the lamp. 
Destructive t e s t s  conducted by FDA and manufacturers w i l l  involve only 
small smples of the production lamps. 
The actual number of lamps which 
need t o  be tested in t h i s  manner w i l l  depend on many factors, 
These 
factors include the results of the tests (e.g., how close the cutoff 
times are t o  the l i m i t s ) ,  the specific type of extinguishing d w i c e ,  and 
any other t e s t s  t h a t  manufacturers can perform an& document which w u l d  
provide assurance directly or indirectly t h a t  the lamps w i l l  meet the 
standard throughcut thelir useful l i f e  . 
- 
- 
Failure of a single lamp t o  meet the t e s t  for ccmpliance w i l l  not neces- 
s a r i l y  r e s u l t  in a r e c a l l  by the manufacturer hlt may require additional 
analysis and testing. 
If a lamp £ a i l s  t o  ccmply with the reqirements 
for self -extinguishing lamps, . the FDA w i l l  attanpt t o  determine the 
cause of t h a t  failure. 
The manufacturer w i l l  probably be contacted and 
additional lamps £ran that batch obtained and tested before deciding if 
a r e c a l l  of that batch of lamps is needed. 
If the additions1 testing. 
- 
indicates other lamps probably do not canply with the s t d a r d - t h e  FDA 
may require the manufacturer t o  r e c a l l  them. 


' 
b s  The =tent of any recall w i l l  depend on the manufacturer ' s a b i l i t y  t o  
determine which lamps may be subject t o  a particular failure. 
Clearly. 
it is i n  the manufacturer's best interest t o  keep canplete and accurate 
records of quality control testing a-.rd design a workable lamp tracing 
system. 
Manufacturers should also note that t h e i r  quality control prograns are 
subject t o  review by FDA. If a program is found t o  be inadequate t o  
assure canpliance with the standard t h e  FDA may disapprove the manufacturer ' s 
testing program (21 CFR 1010.2 (c)). Under Section 360B of the Radiation 
Control for Health and Safety A c t  of 1968, it is unlawful for a manu- 
facturer t o  continue t o  introduce into canmerce lamps certified on the 
basis of a disapproved testing program. 
In t h a t  case a new or modified 
testing program would then have t o  be developed and suhnitted t o  the FDA 
for review. 
If it is acceptable the disapproval could be rescinded t o  
allow the manufacturer t o  resume manufacture and certification of lamps. 
Disapproval of a testing program does not require t h a t  noncanpliant 
products be found f i r s t  and thus does not autanatically require a r e c a l l  
of products. 
Likewise the finding of a nonccmpliant lamp by FDA does 
not autanatically mean disapprwal of t h a t  manufacturer ' s testing 
program. 
Both situations would require further analysis t o  deternine 
appropriate action. 


2 -0 Quality Assurance Progrm 
2.1 
Elenents of a Quality Assurance Prcgr?m 
The adequacy of a specific quality control and testing program must be 
judged on its own m e r i t s  and applicability t o '  the product. 
However, 
a viable quality control program, i n  general, should ensure the continued 
satisfactory performance of a product throughout its useful l i f e .  
The 
essential elements of such a prcgr2-m should include the following: 
a. 
Proper organization and administrative procedures t o  ensure 
objectivity, 
b, 
preproduction evaluation and testing of the product including 
the testing of canponents and materials obtained frcmother manu- 
f acturers . 
c . Evaluation of the product during arid a f t e r  production. 
d. 
Valid measuranent techniques, analysis of data and treatment of 
uncertainties. 
.- r 
e. 
Establishnent of confidence limits and rejecticn c r i t e r i a  and 
the procedures for retesting the rejected .units if they are re- 
cycled back i n t o  the production sequence. 
f . 
An audit procedure t o  randanly select u n i t s  f o r  r e t e s t  a s  a 
check on the effectiveness of the instituted quality control and 
testing program. 
g . Life and r e l i a b i l i t y  testing procqures which determine whether 
the product w i l l  continue t o  meet its design specEications during 
its useful l i f e  . 
h. 
A review procedure t o  assure that any problans discovered in 
- 
a product during 
propriate design 
u n i t s  produced. 
its production l i f e  are corrected and t h a t  ap- 
changes are made t o  eliminate- then £ran subsequent 
2.2 
Objectivity 
Any quality assurance 
'istered t o  ensure the 
progr~m should be carefully structured and admin- . 
objectivity of the program. 
Certain safegu=ds 
against personal prejudice and conflicting interests have t o  be-built. i n t o  
- 
. t h e  systan t o  avoid biased decisions. 
For example, a person responsible 
for maintaining production schedules should not simultaneously be responsible 
f o r  quality control, because he may be less inclined t o  reject large 
numbers 02 unaccepta@le units. 


c 
2-3 Uniform procedures 
A quality assurance progrzm must be base2 on standardized methods for 
the examination or testing of the prcducts. 
Specific written procedures 
should be developed and faithfully followed. 
Data should be recorded 
in a consistent manner using standardized f oms' (21 CFR 1002.30) . The 
forms should prwide for recording a l l  information relevant t o  the 
product such a s  the i d e n t s i c a t i o n  number of the product, date of t e s t  
o r  examination, date of manufacture, sample l o t ,  r e s u l t s  of t e s t ,  names 
of personnel performing and reviewing the t e s t ,  identic ication of t e s t  
instruments, etc. 
Records are t o  be kept for a period of f i v e  ( 5 )  
>-ears ( 2 1  CFX 1002.31 (a) 1. 
2.4 
Validity of Measuraents 
A valid program of measuraents involves a thorough evaluation and error 
analysis of the t e s t  methods and insAcruments. 
A pa-iodic recalibration 
of measuring instruments against a' standard is an important ~ . o c e d u r e  for 
maintaining a consistent measuring cepability. 
2 - 5  Documentat ion 
.-- A cmplete written documentation of the quality assurance program should 
be mahtained (21 CFR 1002.30 (a) (1)). This should include description 
of t e s t s  and the& sequence,description and evaluation of the measure- 
ment instrumentation and techniques (including kstrument calibration 
records), the rejection c r i t e r i a  or confidence l i m i t s  used and the 
justification for the-particular choice of such limits, methods of data 
analysis, sampling plans, etc. 
If a sampling technique must be used, 
it must be documented and rigorously followed. 
2.6 
W d i t  Procedures 
Pdeqyate audit procedures should be implemented to' a c t  a s  a further 
check on the continued v a l i d i t y  and effectiveness of the quality control 
- 
program. 
Randm sampling is the only acceptable met$& 
i n  selecting 
u n i t s  for audit testing. 
The audit should be independent of the quality 
assurance tests. 


' . 
3 .0 PRE-PRODUCTION EVALUATION 
I 
The preproduction evaluation and testing should be constructed t o  
include (1) a review of the design t o  ensure t h a t  the design w i l l  yield 
a ~ 1 - d u c t  
i n  ccmpliance with the performance standard, (2) evaluation of 
c r i t i c a l  canponents and material obtained £ran other manufacturers for 
use i n  the lamp and (3) engiceering and prototype testing and 
evaluation t o  confirm t h a t  the lamp can be manufactured in canpliance 
with the standard. 
3 -1 Design Review 
Before the manufacture of the lamp begins, its design m u s t  be analyzed 
t o  ensure that the finished product w i l l  canply with the Federal Per- 
formance Standard. 
The requirenents of the mercury vapor lamp standard 
that must be considered i n  design review include: 
a. 
The lamp must be permanently labeled or marked in such a manner 
t h a t  the manufacturer and month and year of manufacture ( a l l  of which 
may be expressed i n  code) can be determined on an intact lamp and 
after the outer envelope of the lamp is broken o r  renwed (21 CFR 
1040.30 (c) (1) (ii)). If the dates appear on both the lamp envelope 
and an internal part of the lamp, be sure t h a t  both dates a r e  the 
._ . 
same. 
Labels o r  marks shall be sufficiently durable t o  be legihle 
f 
throughout the useful l i f e  of the lamp. 
. 
b. 
The outer envelope of the lamp must be clearly marked with the 
l e t t e r  "T" o r  "R" 
a s  appropriate (21 CFR 1040,30(d) (2) and 
e 
1 ) . This mark must also appear on another part of the lamp in 
such a manner t h a t  it is v i s i b l e  a f t e r  the outer envelope is hroken 
o r  removed, 
Be sure t h a t  the "T" o r  "Rn, 
marks a r e  clearly.distin- 
guishable f r m  and w i l l  not be confused k i t h  other information t h a t  
may appear on the lamp; e,g,, they shauld not be a part of or be 
confused with any part of the lamp designatiou code, 
c . The lamp packagir?g uniquely associated with -the lamp (i.

the f u l l  name and -address of the manufacturer, place of manufacture 
and month and year of manufacture if such a label o r  tag is not 
affixed or inscribed on the lamp i t s e l f  (21 CFR 1040.30(-c) (2) and 
21 CFR 1010.3(a)). Where the lamp is sold under a name other 'than 
the manufacturer,-the f u l l  name and address of the canpany under 
whose name the lamp is sold may be s e t  f o r t h  prwided sufficient 
infomation is provided t o  the Bureau of Radiolgical Health t o

However, no specific place 
*Note : This has been modified by the Bureau ' s policy s t a t A e n t  'of 
A p r i l  25, 1980, wh.ich allows the date of manufacture t o  appear

facture is same a s  the'address of the manufacturer stated on the 
label or i f  the manufacturer has only one place of manufacture for 
high-intensity mercury vapor discharge lamps and has identified 
that place of manufacture t o  the Wlreau.

I n  
lieu of providing t h e  f u l l  date of manufacture on the lamp packgag, 
howwer, the manufacturer may prwide on the lamp packaging the key 
t o  the lamp date of manufacture code (see BRH policy statanent 
dated February 25, 1980). 
d. 
The lamp packaging uniqlely associated with the lamp must 
also bear a label or tag which contains a statanent by the manu- 
facturer certifying t h a t  the lamp conforms t o  the requirements of 
the Federal performance standard f o r  high-intensity mercury vapor 
discharge lamps i f  the certification label or tag is not affixed or 
inscribed on the lamp i t s e l f  (21 CFR 1040.30 (c) (2) and 21 CFR 1010.2 
(b)). The certification statanent can be in any of the following 
acceptable forms: 
"Canplies with DFEW radiation performance standards, 21 CFR 
Chapter 1, Subchapter J" 
"Product canplies with applicable DHEM standards under the 
Radiation Control f o r  Health and Safety Act of 1368. " 
Other certification st-atanents may be used as long as they a r e  clear

and Evaluation 
Engiqeering models and prototypes should be tested thoroughly and 
exhaustively t o  assure t h a t  the lamp can be manufactured i? canpliance 
with the performance standard, and t h a t  it w i l l  ranai? in canpliance 
under a l l  forseeable conditions during its useful l i f e .  
This would include 
adequate transportation t e s t s ,  t e s t s  of performance under expected and 
adverse enviromentzl conditions, use and a h s e  testing, and accelerated 
l i f e  tests. 
Any design changes should be properly documented, tested 
and evaluated in relation t o  &prduct canpliance. 
Sections 4 and 5 of t h i s  document should Ix consilted f o r  more detailed 
guidance on type of t e s t s ,  t e s t  parameters, t e s t  conditions, and testing

4.0 PRODUCTION TESTING 
4.1 
Design of the Production Quality Control and Testing Program 
- 
After a manufacturer has verified through design rev5 e w  and prototype 
testing that a product can be manufactured i n  canpliance with the per- 
formance standard, he must design and implaaent a production quality 
control and testing program t h a t  w i l l  ensure that each individual lamp 
manufactured canplies with the standard. 
In designing the production 
cpality control and testing program, it is first necessary to identify 
the parmeters t h a t  need t o  be checked or tested in order t o  determine 
ccmpliance with the Federal performance standard. 
This w i l l  depend on 
whether the lamp is intended t o  be self-extinguishing (T Type) or non- 
self-e-tinguishing (R Type) . Both types of lamps r e q i r e  marking and 
labeling a s  previously indicated (Part 4.1). 
I n  addition, self- 
extinguishing 1-ps 
must ccmply with the requirement that the lamp extinguish 
i n  15 minutes following canplete hreakage or r a a w a l  of the outer envelope 
and, a f t e r  Septanber 7 ,  1981, foll.owing breakage or r a n w a l  of not l e s s  
than 3 square centimeters of contiguous surface of the outer envelope. 
A l l  of the above requirements must be checked or tested. 
In the case of 
labels or markings .such checks or t e s t s  consist of merely determining 
. 
t h a t  the correct labels or marks are present and properly affixed t o  or 
. , 
inscribe3 on the lamp andfor lamp packaging. 
Checks and t e s t s  f o r  
c - 
canpliance with the self-extinguishing requirements can be of two 
different types: 
destructive t e s t s  and non-destructive tests. 
g 
Destructive t e s t s  are t e s t s  of the self-extinguishing mechanism re- 
quiring breakage of the outer envelope. 
Non-destructive t e s t s  are t e s t s  
conducted on canponents and during the manufacturing process which are 
intended,to assure that the self-extinguishing mechanism would operate 
properly and cause the lamp t o  extinguish if 
the outer envelope were 
broken a s  prescribed i n  the standard. 
Properly designed non4estructive 
. 
(or indirect) t e s t s  can increase canpliance confidence levels by im- 
prwing product quality and help reduce the level of destructive (direct) 
testing. 
- 
.4.2 
Checks for Labels and Markings 
Checks should be made of the fol.lowing labels and markings:- 
4 -2.1 
Name of manufacturer on lamp (check marks o r  labels both 
inside of the lamp and on the outer envelope). 
4.2.2 
Month and year of manufacture on lamp (check marks or 
labels both inside the l b p  and on the outer envelope). - 
4.2.3 
The l e t t e r  "T" o r  nR'*, as appropriate, on the outer en- 
vezope and on another part of the lamp. 


4.2.4 
The f u l l  name and address of the manufacturer, place of 
manufacture and month and year of manufacture (or the key t o  
the date code, if it is coded on the lamp) on the innermost lamp 
pac kag i n ?  . 
4 . 2 . 5  
The l e t t e r  "T" or "R", a s  appropriate, on lamp packaging. 
4 . 2 . 6  
.The warning statanent for "T" type lamps or the warning 
statenent for "R" type lamps, a s  appropriate, on lamp packagiq . 
4 -3 Can~cnent and In-Process Tests 
The following types of cmponent and in-&process t e s t s  should be consiciered 
in establishing t ~ s t h - g

The manufacturer 
should evalnatc and adopt other or additional canporient o r  in-process t e s t s  
which might be useful. 
Such .tests may be conducted on a 10G% basis or; 
when appropriate, on a sampling basis. 


4.4 
Final Product (3estructive) Tests 
Tests must be conducted on self -extinguishing lamps after manufacture using 
s t a t i s t i c a l l y  valid sampling techniques. 
Lamps are t o  be hroken a s  required 
by 21 CFR 1040.30 (dl (1) while being operated under t e s t  conditions pre- 
scribed in the standard (21 CFR 1040.3 0 (f) ) . 
4 -4.1 
. Lamp Breakage Conditions 
I. 
"Each self -extingu i shing lamp manufactured a f t &  March' 7, 1980 
shall cease operation within a cumulative operating time not t o  
exceed 15 minutes following cmplete breakage or removal of 
the outer emelope (with the exception of fragments extended 
SO millimeters or l e s s  fran the base shell" (21 CFR 1040.30(d) (1) ( i l l .  
The manufacturer must design, fabricate and i n s t a l l  apparatus 
t h a t  w i l l  efficiently, reliably, and canpletely break the lamp 
outer envelope (see 4.4.2). 
Generally, t h i s  can be acccanplished 
by striking the lamp a t  one o r  more preselected points with a 
solid object while the lamp is being operated. 
2. 
"Each self -tinguishing 
lsmp manufactured a f t e r  September 7, 
1981 shall cease operation within a cumulative operating t h e  
not t o  exceed 15 minutes following breakage or ranoval of a t  
l e a s t  3 square centimeters of contigu-s 
surface of the outer 
envelope" (21 CFR 1040.30 (d) (l)'(ii)). 
It is assumed that a f t e r  
Septenber 7, 1981, the worst case breakage condition w i l l  be a 
single hole exactly. 3 square centimeters in area. The manufacturer 
w i l l  have t o  design, fabricate, and i n s t a l l  an apparatus (or 
develop a method) for efficiently and reliably creating the 
required hole while the lamp is operating (see 4-4-21.. A hole 
o£ the required size could be made in; the lamp using a d r i l l  
. . 
with a diamond d r i l l  bit. 
A hole could also be prodyed by 
heating a = a l l  area of the lamp surface and then creating the 
hole using a ganch.

Lamps should be tested i n  an enclosure having a volume of 
not l e s s  than 0.227 cubic meters (8 cubic f e e t ) .  The use of an 
enclosure is desirable to. provide for operator safety and a con- 
trolled t e s t  environment. 
2.

3 .  
The lamp shall be oriented in the t e s t  chamber t o  the 
orientation indicated or recanmended by the manufacturer. 
If the manufacturer does not reccmmend a particular orientation 
or recamends more than one orientation the I m p  shall be mounted 
i n  the worst case orientation for canplianance.with the standard.

i.e., 
the &ir tanperature and a i r  movement inside the t e s t  
chamber shall not be a r t i f i c i a l l y  controlled or influenced by 
fans, coolers, heaters, etc. 
5 .  
The lamp shall be operated on a reference ballast, which is 
defined a s  an "inductive reactor d e s i g n 4  t o  have- the operating 
- 
characteristics a s  l i s t e d  in Section 7 in the American National 
Standards Specifications for High-Intensity Discharge T a p

6 .  
The voltage applied t o  the reference ballast shall be t h a t  
recommended or specified f o r  operation of the lamp. 
A f t e r  the 
lamp starts up and its operation stabilizes, the measured current 
should be within the acceptable current range for the lams. 
A s  long a s  the current is within the acceptable range, it need 
. 
not be adjusted, either before or after lamp breakage (even 
if the lamp current changes significantly a f t e r  breakage of the 
outer envelope)'. 
If manufacturers wish t o  maintain a constant 
lamp current following lzmp breakage in order t o  simulate 
worst case conditions, the Bureau w i l l  not object as long as it 
can be established t h a t  the lamp extinguishing time would never 
be l e s s  than that which would result'frcm testing a s  indicated

4 -5 Sampling Plans 
- 
4.5.1 
Sampling Plans f o r  Canponent and In-process Testing 
Cmponent and in-process testing should be conducted on a 100% basis 
when possible t o  do so. 
However, when sampling ~ r o c ~ d u r e  
must be 
used a s t a t i s t i c a l l y  valid sampling scheme based on MIL-STD-1OSD 
for a t t r i h t e s  sampling or MIL-STD414 for variables sampling O r  
equivalent should be anployed. 
Acceptable quality levels (AQL) and 
rejection l i m i t s  should be chosen t h a t  are appropriate f o r  the 
cunponents and processes being controlled. 
4.5.2 
Sampling Plans for Final Product Testing 
Two types of designs f o r  mercury vapor lamp self-extingui shing 
mechanisms have been developed for canpliance with the performance 
standard for such lamps. 
One design is a mechanical switch held in t h e  
on (closed) position by the outer glass envelope of the lamp. 
If 
the entire glass is shattered, the circuit is immediately broken 
and the lamp goes out. 
This design w i l l  not meet the more stringent 
standard t o  go into effect after Septenber 7 ,  1981, which require 
the lamp t o  extinguish in the event t h a t  the glass envelope is 
punctured. 
The other design is a tungsten filament fuse that 
should be capable of meeting the more stringent standard because it 
is based on axidation and destruction &f the tungsten filament 
t h a t  canpletes the cFrcuit t o  the light source. 
In the presence 
of a*, 
axidation should occur causing an interruption of the 
circuit. 
There .is a trade-off with t h i s  design, however. 
The 
l i f e  of the bulb is l i k e l y  t o  be related t o  the length of time it 
takes the filament to burn out. Thus, if the arc-extingui shing 
design t h e  is  to^ short the lamp may suffer unacceptable' l i f e  
shortening-. 
. 
The sampling plans contained i n  t h i s  documen_t are intended only 
a s  a convenience for manufacturers. 
Any plan which provides 
equivalent protection may be used. 
Manufacturers are encouraged 
t o  adopt equivalent plans which result i n  reduced sample sizes. . 
- 
4.5.2.1 
sampling by ~ t t r i h t e s  
Since all lamps, especially. those using mechanical switches, 
can be classified a s  being defective or not defective, de- 
pending upon whether the lamp stays on o r  goes out when the 
outer envelope is hroken, they conform t o  the process moni- 
toring- procedures of sampling by a t t r i h t e s  described i n  MIL- 
STD-105D. 
The tungsten filament fuse lamps, however, can 
take advantage of the smaller sample sizes associated with 
variables sampling described in the next section. 
It is the 


intent of the Bureau of Radiological Health that the attributes 
inspection procedures conform t o  the procedures given in MIL- 
STD-1OSD 
or their equivalent and include additional restrictions 
specific t o  t h i s  problan. 
While it is an ideal that no lamps 
produced should f a i l  t o  caaply with the standard, the Bureacu 
of Radiological Health believes that a testing progrm is 
adequate if it ensures that, on the average, not more than 1 
lamp per 1,000 produced w i l l  f a i l  t o  canply. 
Under the 
guidance of the referenced sampling pl-ans, the Bureau recog- 
nizes that such an acceptable quality level (AQL) w i l l  result 
in the destruction for testing plrposes of a large fraction of 
the lamps produced f o r  any reasonable l o t  size. 
It is clear 
that large sampling fractions would constitute an unacceptable 
laxden on the manufacturer and the p b l i c  because of the 
prohibitive per unit costs of testing, 
Therefore, the Bureau of Radiological Health proposes that the 
lot-by-lot 
AQL not exceed 1% 
for product sampling and that the 
l o t s  not be accepted if one reject is found i n  any sample. 
This w i l l  have the effect of decreasing the AQL a s  l o t  sizes 
(and, therefore, sample sizes) are increased. 
Lower l o t  
q a l f t y  protection can be tolerated i n  m a l l  l o t s  kt not in 
larger lots. 
However, the long term average ,-cent 
defective 
must not exceed 0.1%- Sampling plans based on MIL-STD-1OSD 
and t h i s  guidance are included in Appendix A. 
4.5.2.2 
Sampling by Variables for Turqsten Filament !?uses 
Since tungsten filament fuses w i l l  always oxidize and interrupt 
lamp operation in a f i n i t e  time, lamps using such fuses can be 
tested by variables sampling inspection. 
The variable that 
'would be measured is self-extinguishing time. 
Variables 
sampling- has the advantage that sample sizes can be signifi- 
cantly reduced. 
Variables sampling plans 'set forth 'in MIL- 
STD414 or later volume a s  modified by t h i s  guidance are 
included in Appendix A. 
A l l  restrictions s e t  forth in MIL- 
STD414 .should be followed in addition t o  those modifications 
stated here. 
The variables sampling plari contained i n  Appendix 
A is based on the assumption that the measured parameter is 
normally distrituted. 
Should the normality assumption not be 
satisfied, it is possible t o  base an inspection by variables 
plan on any well-behaved probability distribution. 
such' sampling 
plans w i l l  be considered on a case-by-case 
basis. 
In any case, the 
sampling plan should assure that, on the average, not more than 
one lamp per 1,000 produced w i l l  f a i l  t o  canply. 


RELIABILITY TESTS 
Product r e l i a b i l i t y  is the probability of a product performing its 
intended function over its intended life and under the operating conditions 
encountered. 
The primary product r e l i a b i l i t y  concern of mercury vapor lamp 
manufacturers has been lamp useful life. 
The mercury vapor lamp performance 
standard adds a new concern, t h e  a b i l i t y  of self-extinguishing devices t o  
function reliably during the useful l i f e  of the lamp. 
Reliability of the 
self -extingu i 
shing mechanisn must ke carefully considered i n  lamp design 
and must be proven through engineering evaluation and prototype and production 
testing. 
For mechanical switches, processes t h a t  may decrease r e l i a b i l i t y  include 
tho.se t h a t  cause switch contact welding, n e t a l  fatigue, and decreased 
t e n s i l e  strength. 
Although lamps with filament fuses are expected t o  self- 
extinguish without f a i l ,  there'may be aging processes t h a t  'could lengthen 
' 
t h e  self -ext ingu ishing t i m e ;  e.g . , the current may not increase a s  much when 
the lamp is broken a f t e r  lamp aging an it wuld if hoken when new. 
Life and r e l i a b i l i t y  testing is routinely conducted by mercury vapor lamp 
manufacturers t o  assure t h a t  lamps w i l l  meet rated l i f e  specifications. 
Tests of the self-extinguish- 
mechanisn can readily be added t o  the l i f e  
t e s t  protocols. 
The conditions under which lamps are operated -should 
.. 
, 
simulate, t o  t h e  degree possible, actual use and envirornnental conditions. 
Each l i f e  t e s t  s b u l d  be conducted f o r  a period of lamp operation equal t o  
t h e  rated l i f e  of the lamp and, preferably long&. 
A t  the end of the t e s t ,  lamps t h a t  are still operating should ke ranoved 
fran the& l i f k  test fixtures and the self-extinguishing mechanism tested 
under the conditions described in i t a n  5.4.2 of t h i s  guide. 
The possibility of using accelerated l i f e  t e q i n g  mothods should be investi- 
gat&. 
Valid accelerated l i f e  t e s t s  can shorten considerably +he lerqth 
of time t h a t  each lamp must be operated, thereby making t e s t  r e s u l t s  a ~ a i l a b l ~
much sooner. 
However, manufacturers are cautioned-to ensure t h a t  accelerated 
l i f e  t e s t s ,  when used, w i l l  not give f a l s e  o r  misleading results.

6.0 
QUALITY AUDITS 
A quality control program can be on11 a s  good a s  the people who are 
conducting that program. 
Even the most carefully planned and technically 
and s t a t i s t i c a l l y  valid quality control procedures w i l l  not assure ccmpliance 
with the mercruy vapor lamp performance standard i f  those procedures are 
not properly implanented and followed faithfully. 
To ensure the effective- 
ness of the -quality control program it should be monitored using accepted 
quality audit techniques. 
The three elenents of a quality audit are procedures audits, product audits, 
and organizational and personnel evaluations, 
6.1 
Procedures Audits 
Frequent audits should be conducted t o  verify that the q a l i t y  contra1 
plan is followed. 
This includes ensuring that (1) a l l  required 
checks and t e s t s  a r e  performed, (2) there is no deviation fran 
estabilished t e s t  procedures, (3) samples are taken in accordance with 
the sampling plan, ( 4 )  a l l  required s t a t i s t i c a l  calculations are 
properly made ar?d correctly used in determining smpling levels, 
(5) l o t  rejection l i m i t s  and reaction plans are rigorously canplied 
with, and ( 6 )  f u l l  and cauplete quality control and testing records 
a r e  generated and maintained. 
. 
The results of procedure audits a r e  a measure of managerial control and 
can indicate areas requiring better instruction and closer supervision. 
6 . 2  
Product Audits 
A product audit is an independent evaluation of a relatively m a l l  
nGber of products. 
Its p r p o s e  is not t o  control q a l i t y  ht t o  
determine the effectiveness of the quality control system. 
Canpleted lamps that a r e  audited may be taken a t  the end of the pro- 
duction l i n e  or frau warehoused stock. 
In-process audits could also 
be made of canponents and sub-assemblies when relavant cpality charac- 
- 
t e r i s t i c s  can be evaluated during the production process. 
However, a 
particular characteristic should only be audited following the 
canpletion of the quality control procedure related t o  control of 
t h a t  characteristic. 
For rixample, i f  a date code tag hside the 
lamp is checked by quality control during lamp assenbly, the 
presence of that tag could be audited a t  sane point i n  prcduction 
a f t e r  t h a t  quality control check is made. 


Audits should cover a l l  applicable r e q i r a a e n t s  of the performance 
standard including - m a r k s  and labels a s  w e l l  a s  proper functioning of 
the self-extinguishing mechanisn . Audit r e s u l t s  should be analyzed 
t o  identify specific areas t h a t  c a l l  for further investigation of 
design, processing, control methods, procedures, o r  personnel 
performance. 
Corrective actions shall be applied where the r e s u l t s  
of the analysis dictate. 
6.3 
Organizational and Personnel Evaluations 
The results of the w a l i t y  audit should be used t o  access the adecpacy 
and performance of organizational u n i t s  and personnel. 
Audit r e s u l t s  
may uncover underlying weaknesses in o r g a ~ i z a t i o n  or managerial 
structure or they may indicate need f o r  additional training o r  
instruction f o r  personnel or even need f o r  disciplinary action. 


APPENDIX A 
SAMPLING PLANS 
A.1 
Sampling by Attributes 
The manufacturer w i l l  determine the l o t  size and choose the ap- 
propriate l e t t e r  code fran Appendix A, Table I. Then the appro- 
priate sample size and rejection l i m i t  w i l l  be read fran Appendix 
A, Table I1 (normal inspection) and the sample results w i l l  be 
obtained. 
The l o t  w i l l  be rejected if the number of tested lamps 
that f a i l  t o  extinguish equal or exceed the rejection l i m i t .  
If 
a l o t  is rejected tightened inspection shall be instituted fol- 
lowing the sampling plan specified in Table I11 and shall ranain in 
effect u n t i l  five (5) consecutive l o t s  have been considered ac- 
ceptable, a t  which time normal inspection may be reinstituted. 
When normal inspection is in effect, reduced inspection may be 
instituted following the sample 'plan specified in Table IV pravided 
the preceding 10 'lots have been on nornial inspection and the process 
average has not exceeded one (1) defective lamp per 1000. 
If l e s s  
than 1000 samples have been taken and none have been rejected, it 
can be assumed that the process average has not exceeded 1 defective 
per 1000, When reduced inspection is i n  effect, tightened inspection 
s h a l l  be instituted following l o t  rejection if the process average 
exceeds one defect per 1000 lamps. If the process average does not 
exceed one defective per 1000, normal ins+ction shall be instituted 
following l o t  rejection when reduced inspection is in effect. 
There should be no canpranise of the process average percent de- 
fectives being.less than 1 per 1000. 
The method of allowing a l o t  
rejection rule based on a larger AQL is merely a convenient instrument 
t o  allow an inspection process that does, not impose a prohibitive 
burden on the manufacturer, These requir'aaents, which exceed those 
given i n  MIL-STD-lOSD, 
are imposed t o  ensure that the Bureau ac- 
ceptance level is not ccmpranised. 


A, 2 Sampling by Variables 
The Bureau requires t h a t  the percent defectives shall be l e s s  than 
1 in 1,000 which implies t h a t  the percent of self-extinguishing 
times that exceed the standard value of 15 minutes s h a l l  be l e s s  
than 0.1%. If we let "p" be the theoretical but unknown mean self- 
extinguishing time and "s" be the sample standard deviation of the 
self -extinguishing times, then we require 
where k is the standard normal value corresponding t n  a probability 
of 1 i n  1,000 (0.001) . The manufacturer should furnish data t o  
support the use of the normal d i s t r i k t i o n  function for testing 
prposes. 
If t h i s  normality assumption is acceptable, then k = 3.1 
and we can solve for p , the mean self-extinguishing time. 
The manufacturer may use one of a number of procedures t o  ensure 
t h a t  the percent defectives is l e s s  than 1 in 1000, 
For suf- 
f i c i e n t l y  large l o t  sizes the manufacturer may use the 15 minutes 
f o r  the upper specification l i m i t  (U) and an AQL of 0.1%. 
This is 
t h e  most d i r e c t  method t o  ensure the desired quality, 
Alternatively, a 
lower in-factory rejection l i m i t  can be established based on a higher 
AQL. 
This methcd allows sane f l e x i b i l i t y  of stmple size partic&rly 
for the smaller l o t  sizes. 
The main objective under either method 
is t o  maintain the process average a t  a lwel t o  ensure the percent 
defectives being less than 1 in 1000, 
For example if 
an AQL of 1% 
is chosen, then the upper specification l i m i t  should be set such 
t h a t  the self-extinguishing times of not more than 1 in +00 h l b s  
(0.01) would exceed t h a t  specification, therefore 
where "Urn is the upper specification l i m i t  and I'mm" is the standard 
normal value corresponding tn a probability of 0.01. 
Thus . 
m = 2-32 and 
Therefore , 
U = p + 2.32s = 15 -'3.ls 
+ 2.32s 
U = 15 - 0.78s 
(5 1 


Therefore, if the theoretical mean (p) of the self-extingulshing 
times and the standard deviation (s) of the self-extinguishing 
times of the samples is such t h a t  p + 3 -1s < 15 and the self- 
extinguishing time specification limit (U) is equal t o  or l e s s  than 
15- 0.78s, l o t s  should be accepted and not rejected, since the 
process average of lamps t h a t  exceed a self-extinguishing time of 
15 minutes would not be greater than 1 in 1,000, 
The sampling plan discussed below is based on the preceding 
technique and use of an AQL of 1% 
with variability unknown. 
MIL- 
STD414 should be consulted for plans using other AQL's. 
The 
manufacturer w i l l  determine the l o t  size and choose the appropriate 
sample l e t t e r  code fran Appendix A, Table V. 
Then the appropriate 
sample size w i l l  be read fran Appendix A, Table V I  (AQL 1%) 
and the 
sample results w i l l  be obtained, 
To determine lot. acceptance or 
r e  j ection the tollowing quantity is calculated : 
where x is the sample mean self -extinguishing time, 
That value 
is canpared with the value of K for normal inspection taken fran 
Appendix A, Table V I .  
If Q, is equal t o  or greater than K, the 
l o t  is accepted, 
The standard deviation should be estimated by 
the following 
calculation : 
where n is the sample size and x is the individual lamp 
extinguishing time- 
Tightened inspection shall be instituted when the estimated prpcess average 
canplted £ran the preceding t e n  (10) l o t s  is greater than the AQL (1.00 
percent). 
Tightened inspection is also required when the number of l o t s  
with estimates of, percent defective abwe the AQL £ran the preceding 5, 10 
or 15 l o t s  is greater than the given value of "T" i n  Appendix A, Table V I I I ,  
and the process average £ran these l o t s  exceeds the AQL. 
~ o & a l  hspection 
may be reinstated if the estimated process average of l o t s  under tightened 
inspection is equal t o  or l e s s  than the AQL, 
- 
Reduced inspection may be instituted provided (1) the preceding ten l o t s  
- 
(or other designated number of l o t s )  have been under normal inspection and 
- 
none have been rejected; ( 2 )  the estimated percent defective for each of 
the preceding 5, 10 o r  15 l o t s  is l e s s  than the applicable lower l i m i t  show; 
i n  Appendix A, Table IX or, for certain sampling plans, the estimated l o t  
percent defective is equal t o  zero for a specified number of consecutive 
l o t s  (see Table M); 
and (3) production is a t  a steady rate. 
However, normal 
inspection shall be reinstated if a l o t  is rejected, the estimated process 
- 
C - 
average is greater 'than the AQL, or production becanes irregular or 
delayed. 
T 
- 


- The estimated process average referenced above is the aritl-xnetic mean 
c- 
of the estimated l o t  percexit defectives canptted fran the appropriate number 
of l o t s .  
The estimated l o t  percent defective is t o  be detezinined £ran 
Appendix A, Table X for any particular value of Q, (quantity in the extraae

APPEND1 X B 
. . NEAC H I  D LNlP TESTIPIG STAND 
The H!G I m p  brea!:er was fabricated by the Facility Maintc.nance Section of the 
Winches tei- Engineering and Analytical Center (b!EAC). 
The lamp envelope brecker 
test stand providcs a means to hold a11 lanip sizes, except the 119F3, T-9'5, 
55 inch 
tub? type. 
The test s t a n d  consists of a steel rod structure wi t11 lamina teri pfienol i c 
beard c ~ d  
panels, as show in Figure I .  
The stand ~neasures 24 inches by 13 inches. 
Ot~e end of the stand has a 12 inch diameter hole in tile center to allox the broken 
glass cnvelope to fall into a catch container housed in a table t h a t  the stand i s  
posi t i m e d  on, as shorn i n  Figure 11. 
The stand consists of three pairs of '," steel 
rods, 24 inches long. 
Each pair of rod; i s  used as rails on Fdli~h an adjustable ' 
c l e t ~ l  bracket ridc.s. 
The bracket, as shown in Figures I I I a ,  b ,  c, measures 4 by 
5 inches. 
Two slots allovi the a i r  c;~linder, which i s  n:ounted on the bracket, to be 
positioned so t h a t  the a i r  cylinders rod penetrates the lantp's outer envelope by ' 
3/16". 
The bracket further adjusts so t h a t  the angle t h z t  the penetrating cyliadsr 
rod strikes the lanip's envelope can be preset 
to the 1 anip 
enve 1 cp? ' s surface 
. This a d j u s t ~ e n t  allows for  onf figurations which n-tinimize 
defic.ctions t h a t  would result in failure of the cylindzr rods to succcssfu?ly rupture 
the evcnlope. 
Thrce steel rods are located i n  bettrec!? the rod pairs. 
These three rods are used 
t o  t!old steel stops that keep large lsinps from being -pushed aside rather t h a n  
penetrated by the cylinder rods. 
'+.& 
The thrce a i r  cylinders are operated by a compressed a i r  supply. 
The conipl-essed 
a i r  supply supulies a i r  a t  125 psi. 
The a i r  i s  held by s solenoid valve. 
1Jhm 
the switch i s  closed the solenoid opens allowing the cofipressed a i r  to flax through 
a manifold which supplies the a i r  to each of the three cylinders simultaneously. 
The a i r  prcssui-c delivery system i s  shown in Figure IV. 
Each of the cylinders 
respond by projecting i t s  rod the full 1" throw. 
the a i r  pressure i n  the cylinders 
- i s  then relieved when the f i r s t  solenoid closes and a second solenoid o,.?ns. Thc 
- 
loss of a i r  pressure causes the cylinder rods to retracl by means of internal 
springs. 
Thus, instantaneous breakage of the outer envelope i s  achieved. 
The 
closing of tlie switch that opens the f i r s t  solenoid also starts tlie electronic 
tinier. . 
A tnp-100 photodiode i s  located i n  back of the 'observation wSndov~. \.lhcn 
the lamp extinguishcs, the photodiode circuit closes, allowing 5 volts to be supplied 
to thc timer. 
This signal tenuinates the timer and the interval T-or which the lanip 
was opzrating after the outer envelope iqas removed i s  displayed. 
Fi gurc. V shows the universal' lamp socket ttia t a1 lows for the 1 amp' to be removed fran 
thc test stznd after breakage. 
By loosening the socket's clamp the lamp base i s  
,freed fl-ol!~ the socket. 
Thus. the problem of unscrewi'ng a lamp t h a t  has had i t s  .: 
outer envelope rmiaved i s  eliminated. 
Two such sockets have been fabricated. 
Orle 
for nieai urn and adwedi u111 bases and a second for nlogal bases. 
The test stand i 
tsel f 
can be positioricd on the test stand table such that lamps can be operated in either 
base up, b ~ s e  down ,' o r  horizontal , as shov:n i n Figures VI and VI I .
