This version of the guidance replaces the one made available in February 2019.  This revision 
of the guidance includes changes to reflect existing FDA policies concerning the issuance of 
export certifications, including with respect to the issuance of certain export certifications for 
food for humans or animals pursuant to section 801(e)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.

This guidance represents the current thinking of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the 
Agency) on this topic.  It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the 
public.  You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and 
regulations.  To discuss an alternative approach, contact the FDA office responsible for this guidance as 
listed on the title page.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This guidance document is intended to provide a general description of Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA or the Agency) export certification to industry and foreign 
governments.  Firms exporting products from the United States are often asked by foreign 
customers or foreign governments to supply a certification relating to products subject to the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and other statutes FDA administers.

This guidance supersedes the document issued under this title in July 2004, as corrected in 
April 2005 and February 2019. 
 
The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to 
bind the public in any way, unless specifically incorporated into a contract.  This document is 
intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law.  
FDA guidance documents, including this guidance, should be viewed only as 
recommendations, unless specific regulatory or statutory requirements are cited.  The use of 
the word should in Agency guidances means that something is suggested or recommended, 
but not required.

II. 
WHAT IS FDA EXPORT CERTIFICATION?  
141 
FDA export certification provides information concerning a product and/or establishment’s 
regulatory or marketing status, based on available information at the time FDA issues the 
certification (including, as appropriate, attestations provided by the person seeking the export 
certification).  For some Centers, if a product has received approval or clearance from FDA, it 
will be indicated on the export certification and/or a copy of approved labeling will be 
appended, as appropriate.  Upon the request of external stakeholders, FDA might issue an 
export certification to facilitate export of FDA-regulated products from the United States.   
The exporter is responsible for ensuring that the export of the product(s) to the intended 
destination(s) is in compliance with all other applicable U.S. statutes and regulations at the 
time of certification, such as provisions administered by the Department of Commerce’s 
Bureau of Industry and Security and the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets 
Control.  The fact that FDA has issued an export certification does not preclude FDA from 
taking appropriate regulatory action against an establishment or product covered by the 
certification.  For example, FDA might take regulatory action against an establishment or 
product covered by export certification if additional information about the regulatory or 
marketing status of the product becomes available. 
 
Submitting false or misleading information in a request for certification, substituting a product 
under a certification, counterfeiting or altering a certificate, or fraudulently using a certification 
may violate federal law and subject those responsible to civil and/or criminal liability.

III. 
WHY DO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS WANT FDA EXPORT 
CERTIFICATION?  
In many cases, foreign governments are seeking official assurance that products exported 
from the United States to their countries can be marketed in the United States or meet specific 
U.S. regulations, for example, as applicable, current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) 
regulations.  A foreign government may also require export certification as part of the process 
to register or import a product into that country.  
IV. 
WHAT TYPES OF EXPORT CERTIFICATES DOES FDA ISSUE?  
FDA may provide export certification in various forms as we determine to be appropriate, 
and export certificates are one means by which we provide export certification.  At present,

FDA issues several types of export certificates, although not all certificate types are issued 
172 
for every FDA-regulated product.  Most of these certificates are issued under section 
801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act.  Section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act provides that FDA shall, 
upon request, issue a written export certification for a human drug (including a biological 
product), animal drug, device, or food (including animal food and food for human 
consumption) that says the product either (1) meets the applicable requirements of the FD&C 
Act (see Sections V and VII of this guidance), or (2) meets the requirements of section 
801(e)(1) or 802 of the FD&C Act2 and may be legally exported from the United States (see 
Sections VI and VII of this guidance).  As discussed in Section VIII of this guidance, export 
certification issued under section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act is subject to a fee. 
 
The FD&C Act does not require FDA to issue export certification for cosmetics.  However, 
because foreign governments may require certificates for cosmetic products, FDA intends to 
continue to provide this service as resources permit.   
 
The following are examples of export certificates FDA issues:

• The “Certificate of Free Sale” as issued by CFSAN has historically been available for 
all foods for human consumption that are regulated by FDA and may be legally 
marketed in the United States or, if they cannot be legally marketed in the United 
States, meet the requirements of section 801(e) of the FD&C Act and may be legally 
exported.  These certificates are not issued under section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act.3  
CFSAN intends to continue issuing Certificates of Free Sale for medical foods, foods 
for special dietary use, dietary ingredients, and dietary supplements.  For other foods, 
CFSAN intends to phase out the use of Certificates of Free Sale.   
 
• The “Certificate of Free Sale” as issued by CVM is for the export of animal food, 
animal drugs, or medicated animal feed that meet the applicable requirements of the 
FD&C Act for marketing in the United States.  FDA issues these certificates under 
section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act.  
 
• The “Certificate for Cosmetics” is issued by CFSAN for products that meet the 
definition of a cosmetic under section 201(i) of the FD&C Act.  We do not issue these 
certificates for products marketed with drug claims, such as cleansers with acne 
treatment claims.  These certificates are not issued under section 801(e)(4) of the 
FD&C Act.   
 
• Health Certificates might be requested by other governments for human foods 
containing animal-derived ingredients; these requesters often seek FDA statements 
 
2 The text of sections 801(e) and 802 of the FD&C Act is available at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-
information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act. 
3 FDA understands that some countries may have regulations that specifically require a document designated as a 
“Certificate of Free Sale” for human food product registration or acceptance of shipments.  CFSAN will, if 
requested by industry, add a subtitle of “Certificate of Free Sale” to a “Certificate to a Foreign Government.” 
When CFSAN does so, the Agency continues to consider the certificate to be a “Certificate to a Foreign 
Government” issued under section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act, and the certificate will include the same content as 
other “Certificates to a Foreign Government” and also be subject to the same fees as other “Certificates to a 
Foreign Government.”

with respect to “compliance” of the particular product with foreign regulations.  As a 
211 
matter of policy, FDA generally does not issue certificates that attest to compliance 
with another country’s requirements.  Rather, FDA may work with other governments 
to develop mutually acceptable language for the health certificate.  The CFSAN-issued 
health certificates for collagen or gelatin products exported to the European Union are 
examples of these types of certificates.  FDA will consider requests for new health 
certificates on a case-by-case basis, as substantial time and resource commitments are 
required in negotiating the certificate language with a foreign government.  Depending 
on the certificate language, such a certificate may or may not be issued under section 
801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act.  These certificates are issued by CFSAN.      
 
• The “Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product” is issued for human drugs (including  
biological products) and animal drugs.  The certificate conforms to the format 
established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and is usually used by the 
importing country when considering whether to authorize the drug (including a 
biological product) in question for sale in that country.  These certificates are issued 
under section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act by CBER, CDER, and CVM.  
 
• The “Non-Clinical Research Use Only Certificate” is for the export of a product, 
material, or component for non-clinical research use only that is not intended for human 
use and which may be marketed in, and legally exported from, the United States under 
the FD&C Act.  These non-clinical research use only products, materials, or 
components must be labeled as authorized in the United States in accordance with 
21 CFR 312.160 or 809.10(c)(2).  These certificates are issued under section 801(e)(4) 
of the FD&C Act by CBER and CDRH.  
 
• The “Certificate to Foreign Government” is for the export of human food, human 
drugs (including biological products), animal drugs, animal food, medicated animal 
feed, and devices for humans or animals that meet the applicable requirements of the 
FD&C Act for marketing in the United States.  These certificates are issued under 
section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act by CBER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM.

• The “Certificate of Exportability” is for the export of food, human drugs (including 
biological products), animal drugs, animal food, medicated animal feed, and devices for 
humans that cannot be legally marketed in the United States, but meet the requirements 
of section 801(e) or 802 of the FD&C Act and may be legally exported.  These 
certificates are issued under section 801(e)(4) by CBER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM.    
V. 
WHAT DOES FDA MEAN WHEN IT STATES IN AN EXPORT 
CERTIFICATION THAT AN ESTABLISHMENT IS IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING 
PRACTICE (CGMP) REGULATIONS OR OTHER APPLICABLE 
REQUIREMENTS?  
When FDA states in an export certification that an establishment is in compliance with 
CGMP regulations or other applicable requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA 
regulations, FDA bases this certification on the Agency’s most recent inspection, if any, 
243

7 
 
of the relevant establishment(s) and other relevant information that is available to the 
Agency.  There are some situations in which FDA cannot issue a certification stating 
that an establishment is in compliance with CGMP regulations or other applicable 
requirements.  These include when an inspection is in progress or information from the 
inspection is under FDA review, in which case we might delay issuing a certification.  
Please refer to the appropriate FDA Center based on product jurisdiction for more 
information on applicable requirements for specific products.

259 
260 
261 
262 
VI. 
DOES FDA ISSUE EXPORT CERTIFICATION FOR PRODUCTS 
THAT MAY NOT BE LEGALLY MARKETED IN THE UNITED 
STATES? 
Section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act provides for export certification of products that cannot 
be legally marketed in the United States, including unapproved products, if they meet the 
requirements of section 801(e)(1) or 802 of the FD&C Act and may be legally exported from 
the United States.  Such certification includes Certificates of Exportability.   
 
For unapproved new human drug products, CDER does not issue a Certificate of 
Exportability; instead, CDER issues a Certificate of a Pharmaceutical Product that includes a 
statement that the product is unapproved and meets the requirements of sections 801(e)(1) or 
802 of the FD&C Act.  For unapproved new animal drugs that meet the requirements of 
section 801(e)(1) of the FD&C Act, CVM may issue either a Certificate of Exportability or 
Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product. 
 
Sections 801(e) and 802 of the FD&C Act contain numerous requirements for exporting 
unapproved products and other products that do not comply with the applicable requirements 
of the FD&C Act.  For further information on these export mechanisms, refer to the Guidance 
for Industry:  Exports Under the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996, available 
at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-
industry-exports-under-fda-export-reform-and-enhancement-act-1996.

VII. WHAT CONDITIONS PREVENT ISSUANCE OF EXPORT 
CERTIFICATION?  
When determining whether to issue export certification, FDA reviews records for relevant 
establishments and products and considers information and attestations provided by the 
person requesting the export certification.  FDA does not intend to issue export certification 
if it determines that the establishments or products are not eligible for the requested 
certification or if the Agency does not have adequate information to make the required 
determination.  
Some examples of circumstances that may prevent the issuance of export certification 
include:   
 
• FDA has determined that the manufacturing establishment(s) and/or product(s) are not 
in compliance with applicable CGMP regulations or other applicable requirements.  
 
284

• FDA has determined that the manufacturing establishment(s) and/or product(s) lack the 
required FDA registration and/or listing.  
 
• FDA has initiated an enforcement action (e.g., a seizure or injunction) relevant to the 
establishment(s) and/or product(s). 
 
When FDA does not issue an export certification, we generally will provide the reason(s) to the 
person requesting the export certification.4   
VIII. DOES FDA CHARGE A FEE FOR EXPORT CERTIFICATION?  
For export certifications for human food, human drugs (including biological products), animal 
food, animal drugs, medicated animal feed, and devices for humans or animals that FDA issues 
under section 801(e)(4) of the FD&C Act, we may charge a fee if we issue a certification 
within 20 days of receipt of a complete request for such a certification.  This fee may vary 
depending on the product type, but it will not exceed the statutory maximum.  FDA interprets 
the 20-day period to mean 20 government working days.
