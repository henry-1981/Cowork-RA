## Escalation Path

### Borderline Cases (YELLOW Traffic Light)

**Wellness vs Medical Device**:
- Product claims general wellness benefits but borders on medical claims
- Action: Regulatory affairs specialist review + FDA guidance consultation

**Combination Products**:
- Product combines device and drug/biologic components
- Action: Combination product classification determination (separate process)

**Novel Device Types**:
- New technology without clear regulatory precedent
- Action: Pre-submission meeting with regulatory agency recommended

### High-Risk Scenarios (Mandatory Escalation)

- Conflicting determinations across regions
- Ambiguous intended use statements
- Products with both medical and non-medical claims
