# EU MDR Article 2(1) Classification

## Definition

Medical device means any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, implant, reagent, material or other article intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for one or more specific medical purposes.

## Medical Purpose Criteria

- Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, prediction, prognosis, treatment or alleviation of disease
- Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation or compensation for an injury or disability
- Investigation, replacement or modification of anatomy or physiological/pathological process or state
- Providing information by means of in vitro examination of specimens from human body

## Borderline Products

- Products with ancillary medical purpose may still qualify
- Combination products require case-by-case evaluation
- Annex XVI products: non-medical purpose devices (aesthetic, cleaning, brain stimulation)

## Decision Workflow

1. Check intended use against medical purpose criteria
2. Evaluate if ancillary medical purpose applies
3. Assess borderline product scenarios
4. Consider combination product rules
5. Determine device status: YES/NO/CONDITIONAL

## EU-Specific Considerations

- Manufacturer's intended purpose is decisive (not actual use)
- Software qualifies independently as a medical device (SaMD)
- Accessories to medical devices are also regulated under MDR
