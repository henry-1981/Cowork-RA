## Definitions (Art. 3)

### FAQ #1: Non-reimbursable devices as regulation target
**Q**: Are non-reimbursable medical devices subject to the Fair Competition Code?
**A**: Yes. Per Art. 3-1, the Code covers all medical devices as defined in the Medical Devices Act Art. 2-1, regardless of reimbursement status. All registered medical devices are subject to the Code.

### FAQ #2: Non-HCP university professors
**Q**: Does the Code apply when commissioning basic research or clinical trials to university professors who are NOT healthcare professionals?
**A**: Case-by-case review. Per Art. 3-5 and Art. 5-1, the Code applies in relationships with medical institutions or HCPs. Whether the professor qualifies depends on their individual status.

### FAQ #3: Foreign nationals as HCPs
**Q**: Are foreign-national healthcare professionals subject to the Code?
**A**: Yes, if they obtained qualifications under Korean healthcare laws OR are affiliated with a domestic medical institution. Foreign HCPs not meeting these criteria are NOT covered (Art. 3-7).

### FAQ #4: "5 countries" in international conference definition
**Q**: Does the "5 countries" requirement for domestic international conferences include Korea?
**A**: No. "Arrival in Korea (내한)" means coming from abroad, so Korea is NOT included in the 5-country count.

### FAQ #5: Provision to non-HCP staff (coordinators, purchasing dept.)
**Q**: Can samples be provided to non-HCP hospital staff? Can F&B be provided at product presentations for them? Can they be hired as lecturers?
**A**:
1. Samples: NOT permitted to non-HCP individuals; only to the medical institution as a whole if qualifying
2. Product presentation F&B: NOT permitted (Art. 10 requires HCP attendees)
3. Lectures: Possible if genuine need exists and qualifications are met, but NOT as a pretext for sales promotion

---

## Gifts/Benefits Restriction (Art. 5)

### FAQ #6: Volume discounts
**Q**: Can product prices be discounted based on order volume?
**A**: Case-by-case review. Fair Trade Commission permits volume discounts reflecting marginal cost differences per individual order quantity. However, cumulative volume-based discounts (total purchases over a period) require individual review to determine whether they constitute sales promotion benefits. Reimbursed products must also comply with actual transaction price rules.

---

## Samples (Art. 6)

### FAQ #7: Definition of "minimum quantity"
**Q**: What does "minimum quantity" mean for samples?
**A**: 1-2 units per minimum packaging unit per department (where evaluation is deemed necessary). If 1-2 units are insufficient for evaluation, the minimum quantity necessary for evaluation applies. Companies must establish objective criteria. "Minimum packaging unit" refers to the smallest packaging unit among the product's registered packaging units.

### FAQ #9: Samples to unaffiliated HCPs
**Q**: Can samples be provided to HCPs not affiliated with a medical institution?
**A**: No legal basis for providing samples to individual HCPs not affiliated with a medical institution. However, individual clinics qualify as medical institutions, so providing samples to clinic-operating doctors is provision to the institution.

### FAQ #10: Samples to coding/registration staff
**Q**: Can samples be provided to medical device coding staff (non-HCP) for device registration?
**A**: Not permitted to non-HCP individuals. If physical inspection is necessary for registration, the device must be provided with a written return obligation upon completion.

### FAQ #11: Sticker labeling on regular products
**Q**: Can regular products be labeled as samples with stickers instead of separate packaging?
**A**: Yes. Separate packaging is not required. Sticker labeling on regular products is acceptable.

### FAQ #12: Cross-department sample provision
**Q**: After providing samples to Department A, can additional samples be provided to Department B of the same institution?
**A**: Case-by-case. Permitted for different clinical departments with genuine evaluation needs. However, sequential provision to multiple departments that effectively constitutes free lending (e.g., shared use of equipment across departments) may be deemed improper.

---

## Donations (Art. 7)

### FAQ #13: Providing medical journals to HCPs
**Q**: Can medical journals be provided to healthcare professionals?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Per Art. 5, economic benefits not otherwise permitted by the Code cannot be provided to HCPs. Providing medical journals would need to follow the donation procedure under Art. 7 (donation to the medical/research institution, not directly to individual HCPs).

### FAQ #14: Cap on charitable device donations
**Q**: Is there a maximum amount for charitable medical device donations?
**A**: No explicit cap in the Code, provided Art. 7-1-1 principles are followed and the donation serves the institution's charitable activities. However, large amounts or equipment require careful review of purpose and appropriateness. Return conditions after charitable use are recommended.

### FAQ #15: Donations to social welfare organizations
**Q**: Can devices be donated to non-profit organizations (사단법인, etc.) for social welfare?
**A**: If the organization has a special relationship with HCPs or medical institutions (e.g., representative is HCP-qualified, or 1/3+ of executives are HCPs), the Code applies and KMDIA procedures must be followed. If NOT in such a relationship, the Code does not apply, but Medical Devices Act handling requirements still apply.

### FAQ #16: Donation for medical research purposes
**Q**: Does donating devices for medical research qualify as "charitable purpose"?
**A**: **NOT included.** Medical research purposes do NOT qualify as charitable purpose donations under the Code.

### FAQ #17: Verification obligation for donated funds
**Q**: Must the donating company verify proper use of donated funds?
**A**: KMDIA has this verification obligation, not the donating company.

### FAQ #18: Company name/brand exposure on donation-funded events
**Q**: Can a company's name or brand be displayed on events funded through donations (disease campaigns, awards)?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Neither company name nor brand may be exposed, to prevent use for promotional purposes.

### FAQ #19: Company name on academic awards
**Q**: Can the supporting company's name appear on academic awards?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Same rationale as above.

### FAQ #20: Company-produced award promotion templates
**Q**: Can a company directly produce and distribute promotional templates for awards it sponsors?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Award promotion is the academic society's responsibility; company involvement constitutes additional labor/benefit provision beyond the approved donation.

### FAQ #21: Supporting education/training at academic organizations
**Q**: Can a company support medical device/equipment donations for HCP/medical student training at academic organizations?
**A**: Case-by-case. May fall under designated donation (Art. 7-1) or conference support (Art. 8) depending on the specific arrangement.

---

## Conference Hosting (Art. 8)

### FAQ #22: Product presentation at separate venue after conference
**Q**: Can a product presentation be held at a separate venue after a conference?
**A**: Case-by-case review required. Holding a presentation temporally and spatially adjacent to a conference may undermine the purpose of product presentations and create conflicts of interest. Legal review of individual circumstances is required (temporal/spatial separation).

### FAQ #23: Satellite/Luncheon Symposium speaker payments
**Q**: If the conference organizer runs a satellite/luncheon symposium and the company only pays the initial hosting cost, can the company directly pay speakers/chairs?
**A**: NOT permitted for domestic conferences. Satellite/luncheon symposiums are considered part of the conference, so speaker/chair payments must come from the conference organizer. For overseas conferences, payments by foreign affiliates may not violate the Code, but Korean company funding is outside permitted scope.

### FAQ #24: Sample provision at conference sessions
**Q**: Can samples be provided at conference session venues (not booths) for product demonstrations?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Product demonstrations at session venues effectively constitute company involvement in the session. Samples may only be provided to medical institutions, not to individual HCPs at conferences.

---

## Conference Attendance (Art. 9)

### FAQ #25: Korean company funding for overseas parent-sponsored training
**Q**: Can a Korean company fund Korean HCPs to attend overseas training sponsored by the parent company?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED** under current regulations.

### FAQ #26: Overseas society with mostly Korean executives
**Q**: Can a Korean company support an overseas academic society whose key executives are mostly Korean HCPs?
**A**: This falls under the Code's scope. Support must comply with Art. 9 requirements for conference attendance. Overseas societies with mostly Korean members giving delegation authority back to Korea is not permitted per Code intent.

### FAQ #27: Non-HCP attendance support
**Q**: Can conference attendance support be provided to non-HCPs?
**A**: Support must be for HCPs as defined in the Code. Support for non-HCPs is not permitted if it constitutes sales promotion or violates the Anti-Graft Act.

---

## Product Presentations (Art. 10)

### FAQ #28: Including non-product topics
**Q**: Can tax, legal (compliance), or management education be included in product presentations?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Product presentations must be about the company's own medical devices. Tax, legal, or management topics do not qualify.

### FAQ #29: Product presentations for non-physician HCPs
**Q**: Can product presentations be held for clinical technicians, nurses, sonographers, etc.?
**A**: Yes, if they are HCPs as defined in the Code. These professionals qualify as HCPs, so presentations and F&B provision are permitted.

### FAQ #30: Presentations for events with HCP credit points
**Q**: Do events that award HCP education credits qualify as product presentations?
**A**: Evaluated individually based on Art. 10 requirements. Credit-awarding events during conferences fall under Art. 8 (conference support), not Art. 10.

### FAQ #31: Refreshments at product presentations
**Q**: Can refreshments (다과) be provided in addition to meals?
**A**: Yes, total F&B must be within 100,000 KRW per person per meal including refreshments. For multi-institution events, up to 3 meals/day and 150,000 KRW/day total.

### FAQ #32: Driver service (대리운전) as transportation
**Q**: Can driver service fees be covered as transportation costs?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Driver service implies intoxication, which is not an essential cost for scientific information delivery. Not covered even with receipts.

### FAQ #33: Taxi fare as transportation
**Q**: Can taxi fares be covered?
**A**: Exceptionally, up to 30,000 KRW with documented justification when public transportation is genuinely unavailable. Taxis are not generally considered public transportation.

### FAQ #34: Accommodation for early-morning events
**Q**: Can accommodation be provided the night before an early-morning multi-institution presentation?
**A**: Possible with KMDIA prior approval if geographic/time constraints justify it, within operating standard limits.

### FAQ #35: Presentation changes after approval
**Q**: Is re-review needed for changes to approved presentations?
**A**: Simple changes (minor details) require only pre-notification. Significant changes to agenda, venue, budget, benefits amount, or participant size require re-review.

### FAQ #36: Venue selection guidelines
**Q**: Can presentations be held at locations distant from most attendees?
**A**: Venue must be reasonably justified for the purpose. Selecting Busan for mostly Jeolla-region attendees without justification is not appropriate. Jeju, luxury resorts, etc. require additional documentation.

### FAQ #37: Overseas product presentations
**Q**: Can F&B-providing product presentations be held overseas?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Product presentations with F&B are limited to domestic venues.

### FAQ #38: Partial accommodation approval
**Q**: Is prior approval needed when accommodation is provided only to some (distant) attendees?
**A**: Yes, still subject to prior approval. However, individual institution presentations may NOT provide accommodation.

### FAQ #39: Monthly F&B frequency limit
**Q**: Is the 4x/month frequency limit per company or per product?
**A**: Per company (not per product).

### FAQ #40: Clinical trial meetings as product presentations
**Q**: Do clinical trial discussion meetings with HCPs count as product presentations?
**A**: If the meeting is purely for clinical trial discussion (no product promotion or training), it does NOT count as a product presentation and is not subject to frequency limits. Documented under clinical trial support in spending reports.

### FAQ #43: Third-party F&B provision counting
**Q**: If a contracted third party provides F&B during promotional activities, does it count toward the company's limit?
**A**: Yes. Under Art. 5-3, activities by marketing agencies/distributors on behalf of the company are treated as the company's activities regardless of whether the company gave specific F&B instructions.

### FAQ #44: Coupon-based F&B at hotels/resorts
**Q**: Can F&B be provided via coupons at product presentations in hotels?
**A**: Meal-only coupons for the event venue's restaurant on the event day are permitted. Coupons usable for other purposes (hotel gift shop, etc.) are NOT permitted as they constitute provision of securities.

### FAQ #45: Academic journal as promotional item
**Q**: Can academic journals be provided as small promotional items during individual institution visits?
**A**: Generally not permitted, as bulk-purchasing journals from academic societies effectively subsidizes their costs. Exceptionally, within the 10,000 KRW promotional item limit, if genuinely for scientific information purposes and not as a conduit for providing benefits to societies/HCPs, case-by-case permission may be possible.

### FAQ #46: Temporal proximity of F&B to presentation
**Q**: Can dinner be provided at 7 PM after a 2 PM product presentation?
**A**: F&B should be temporally adjacent to the presentation. A separate meal far removed in time does NOT fall within permitted F&B provision.

---

## Education/Training (Art. 11)

### FAQ #48: Eligible lecture topics
**Q**: Which topics qualify for education/training?
**A**:
- Permitted: Product features, usage instructions, related disease/anatomy education, clinical research results using company devices
- NOT permitted: Health insurance reimbursement criteria alone (permitted only as supplementary to product information), KMDIA regulation explanation
- Each case must be evaluated based on direct relevance to the medical device

### FAQ #49: Single-institution external training with accommodation
**Q**: Can single-institution training be held at an external venue with 1-night/2-day accommodation?
**A**: **NOT PERMITTED.** Art. 11-2 only allows accommodation support for multi-institution training.

### FAQ #50: Single-institution overseas training
**Q**: Can single-institution training for new devices include airfare/accommodation support for overseas training?
**A**: Possible per Art. 11, with KMDIA prior review. For devices not yet imported to Korea, airfare and accommodation support is permitted without requiring multi-institution participants. 1st-class devices require strict justification.

### FAQ #51: Co-hosting workshops with hospitals
**Q**: Can a company co-host (co-hosting) workshops or industry-academia events with a hospital?
**A**: In principle, NOT permitted. Product presentations and education/training must be company-organized events (Art. 3-11, 3-12). However, if the company is the substantive organizer and the hospital merely provides facilities, with no economic benefit flowing to the institution, it may be acceptable.

---

## Lectures/Consulting (Art. 12)

### FAQ #54: Proving non-promotional lecture purpose
**Q**: How should a company demonstrate that a lecture/consulting engagement is not for sales promotion?
**A**: Comprehensive internal control standards required:
1. Objective selection criteria
2. Minimum necessary number of persons
3. Purpose of obtaining medical/professional information
4. No repeated engagement for same topic
5. No repeated engagement of same HCP
6. Detailed contract with work scope and evidence

### FAQ #55: Chair fees
**Q**: Can chair fees be paid at product presentations/education events?
**A**: Yes, based on substantive contribution. Classification as lecture or consulting depends on format (panel discussion with audience = lecture; committee meeting = consulting). Documentation of chair's role is required.

### FAQ #56: Additional travel expenses for lecturers
**Q**: Can actual travel expenses be provided in addition to lecture/consulting fees?
**A**: Yes. Accommodation, transportation, F&B at actual cost within product presentation limits. For public officials, must follow government travel expense regulations.

### FAQ #57: Accommodation for lecturers at non-accommodation events
**Q**: If a non-accommodation presentation ends late at night, can accommodation be provided to the lecturer?
**A**: Case-by-case. If objectively justified (late finish time, geographic constraints), accommodation may be provided.

### FAQ #58: Anti-Graft Act conflict with Code limits
**Q**: When the Anti-Graft Act, Code, and institution rules have different caps, which applies?
**A**: Apply the strictest (lowest amount) among all applicable regulations.

### FAQ #59: 40-minute lecture with 1-hour fee
**Q**: Can a 1-hour fee cap (500,000 KRW) be paid for a 40-minute lecture?
**A**: Persuasive argument exists that this is permissible if the professional purpose was fully served, given the original 40-minute standard. However, fees should generally be proportional to actual time.

### FAQ #60: Sub-40-minute lecture fees
**Q**: If a lecture is under 40 minutes (e.g., 10 minutes), can the fee be proportionally calculated?
**A**: Yes, proportional calculation is required. Must document justification separately.

### FAQ #61: Multiple lecturers in one session
**Q**: If multiple lecturers jointly deliver a 40+ minute lecture, what fee applies?
**A**: Total fee should be adjusted considering the division of labor. Each lecturer's fee should be proportionally reduced from what a single lecturer would receive.

### FAQ #62: Repeated engagement of same lecturer
**Q**: Can the same lecturer be hired repeatedly for different audience groups?
**A**: Not permitted without justification per Art. 9-2. If lecturer scarcity is objectively demonstrated and within annual fee cap, repeated engagement with different audiences may be acceptable.

### FAQ #63: Two-day event with both chairing and lecturing
**Q**: Can separate chair and lecture fees be paid when one person chairs Day 1 and lectures Day 2?
**A**: Yes, if both roles are clearly documented with substantive contributions.

### FAQ #65: COVID-19 related lectures
**Q**: Can HCPs be hired to lecture on COVID-19 and receive lecture fees?
**A**: Yes, if medical/professional information purpose is met and requirements are satisfied. However, non-medical topics (trends, investment) do not qualify.

### FAQ #66: Parent company and subsidiary combined annual fees
**Q**: If a Korean subsidiary pays 3M KRW and the parent company pays 2M KRW to the same HCP, what is the annual total?
**A**: 5M KRW total. The annual cap is 3M KRW, so this exceeds the limit.

---

## Clinical Device Provision (Art. 13)

### FAQ #67: Required documentation
**Q**: What documents are needed for clinical device provision?
**A**: Must comply with IRB approval, clinical trial regulations, and Medical Devices Act documentation requirements.

---

## Market Research (Art. 14)

### FAQ #70: Must market research use research agencies?
**Q**: Must market research be conducted by professional research organizations?
**A**: Not necessarily, but if conducted in-house, documented internal standards and procedures are required.

### FAQ #71: Patient surveys
**Q**: Can market research target patients?
**A**: Case-by-case. Patient surveys are possible, but compensation should reflect the effort required and not involve HCPs as intermediaries. Complexity and respondent expertise should be considered for appropriate compensation.

### FAQ #72: Survey response time standard
**Q**: How is the 30-minute threshold for survey compensation determined?
**A**: Based on reasonable estimation of actual response time, considering number of questions, complexity, and required expertise.

### FAQ #73: Medical Devices Act and market research
**Q**: If market research is not explicitly permitted under the Medical Devices Act, is the company liable for conducting it under the Code?
**A**: Case-by-case review needed regarding the intersection of the Medical Devices Act and the Fair Competition Code.

---

## Post-Market Surveillance (Art. 15)

### FAQ #74: Case report fee when MFDS provides template
**Q**: Can the 50,000 KRW case report fee be paid when MFDS provides the survey form?
**A**: The case report fee is based on completion of required case reports per Medical Devices Act regulations, regardless of who provides the form.

---

## Other Clinical Activities (Art. 16)

Covers clinical activities beyond post-market surveillance, including investigator-initiated studies and registries. Must have clear scientific/educational purpose with KMDIA prior review.

---

## Violation Cases and Precedents

Real warning actions taken by the KMDIA Fair Competition Code Review Committee, focused on product presentations and education/training events. Source: 공정경쟁규약 주요 위반유형 및 사례 (2023.05.02)

### Warning Statistics

| Year | Total | Deadline | Impermissible Items | Different Execution | Attendee Excess | Amount Exceeded |
|------|-------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2023 | 16 | 2 | 9 | 3 | 2 | - |
| 2022 | 6 | - | 3 | 3 | - | - |
| 2021 | 6 | - | 2 | 3 | 1 | - |
| 2020 | 4 | - | 1 | 3 | - | - |

### Case A: Application Deadline Violation (40-day rule)
- **Case**: Submitted application only 16 days and 30 days before event (required: 40 days for accommodation events)
- **Rule**: Art. 10(2) - accommodation events require 40-day advance submission
- **Related**: FAQ #35 (presentation changes after approval)

### Case B-1: Vehicle Fuel and Toll Reimbursement
- **Case**: Reimbursed HCPs' personal vehicle fuel costs and toll fees, averaging 87,000 KRW per person
- **Rule**: Transportation limited to economy class airfare, KTX, express bus, or equivalent public transport only. Personal vehicle costs are NOT covered
- **Note**: This is a separate violation from taxi fare issues (FAQ #33)

### Case C-1: Unreported Gifts and Registration Fee
- **Case**: Provided appreciation plaques (~30,000 KRW each) and registration fee support that were NOT in the pre-approved application
- **Rule**: Any increase in economic benefits to HCPs requires re-review

### Case C-2: Format and Date Change Without Reporting
- **Case**: Changed event format (offline to online) AND event date without reporting to Committee
- **Rule**: Even "simple" date changes must be pre-reported. Format changes require re-review

### Case C-3: Supporting Companions of HCPs
- **Case**: Provided economic benefits (travel, accommodation, F&B, souvenirs) to companions/accompanying persons of HCPs
- **Rule**: Support strictly limited to HCPs and directly related procedure/diagnostic personnel. Companion support is NOT permitted

### Case D-1: Attendee Increase Over 10% Without Re-review
- **Case**: Pre-approved attendees (60, 50) increased to actual (74, 70) - exceeding 10% threshold - without reporting
- **Rule**: 10%+ attendee increase from approved numbers requires re-review. Decreases are exempt

### Case D-2: Walk-in Registrants Without Reporting
- **Case**: Pre-approved 25 attendees, walk-in HCPs increased actual count to 34, no reporting
- **Rule**: Same 10% threshold applies regardless of whether increase is planned or walk-in

### Case E-1: Accommodation Amount Exceeded
- **Case**: Exceeded accommodation limit of 200,000 KRW (VAT included) by 5,700 KRW
- **Rule**: Domestic accommodation max 200,000 KRW; overseas max 350,000 KRW (both VAT included). Even small overages trigger warnings

### Case E-2: Taxi Fare Exceeded with Invalid Reason
- **Case**: Submitted reason statement claiming "late event end" for taxi use, but receipts showed 18:00-19:00 usage (public transport still operating). Paid 54,000 KRW per person to 11 HCPs, exceeding the 30,000 KRW internal guideline
- **Rule**: Taxi reason statements are verified against receipt timestamps. 18:00-19:00 is NOT accepted as unavoidable since public transport operates during those hours
- **Related**: FAQ #33 (taxi fare rules)

### Key Enforcement Lessons
1. **Deadline compliance is absolute**: No flexibility on the 40-day advance rule for accommodation events
2. **Transportation rules are narrow**: Only documented public transport. No personal vehicle, business class, or general taxi
3. **Jeju/resort venues get extra scrutiny**: Actual attendee composition must match stated purpose
4. **All changes require reporting**: Even date changes need pre-reporting. Format, gift, and 10%+ attendee changes need re-review
5. **No companion support**: Economic benefits strictly for HCPs and related personnel only
6. **Amount limits are absolute**: Even 5,700 KRW over triggers a warning
7. **Reason statements are fact-checked**: Committee verifies claims against receipt timestamps and other evidence
