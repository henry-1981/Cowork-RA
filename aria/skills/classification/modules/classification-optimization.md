# Classification Optimization Logic

**Purpose**: Analyze key decision factors to identify potential pathways for class reduction through design modifications.

## 1. Invasiveness Factor
**Optimization Guidance**:
- If implantable: Consider alternative non-implantable designs
- If invasive: Evaluate minimally invasive or non-invasive approaches
- If non-invasive: Already optimal for this factor

## 2. Duration Factor
**Optimization Guidance**:
- If long-term: Explore short-term or transient use designs
- If short-term: Consider transient use if clinically feasible
- If transient: Already optimal for this factor

## 3. Active vs Passive Factor
**Optimization Guidance**:
- If active: Assess feasibility of passive design alternatives
- If passive: Already optimal for this factor

## 4. Anatomical Location Factor
**Optimization Guidance**:
- If CNS/cardiovascular: Explore designs avoiding direct contact with these systems
- If other high-risk locations: Consider alternative placement
- If low-risk location: Already optimal for this factor

## Optimization Disclaimer
Classification optimization analysis requires:
- R&D feasibility assessment
- Clinical performance validation
- Regulatory strategy alignment
- Potential additional clinical data requirements
