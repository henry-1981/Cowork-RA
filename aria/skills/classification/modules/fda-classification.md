# FDA Classification Logic

## Class I (Low Risk)
- Minimal potential for harm
- Simple design and functionality
- Examples: Manual surgical instruments, tongue depressors, arm slings

**Decision Factors**:
- Non-invasive or minimally invasive
- Short contact duration
- Passive device
- Well-established technology

## Class II (Moderate Risk)
- Moderate potential for harm if controls insufficient
- Requires special controls (performance standards, post-market surveillance)
- Examples: Powered wheelchairs, infusion pumps, surgical drapes

**Decision Factors**:
- Invasive or sustained contact
- Active device with power source
- Requires performance validation
- More complex than Class I but not life-sustaining

## Class III (High Risk)
- High risk of illness or injury
- Usually supports or sustains human life
- Implanted devices or long-term contact
- Examples: Heart valves, pacemakers, breast implants

**Decision Factors**:
- Implantable
- Life-sustaining or life-supporting
- Long-term body contact
- High risk to health if failure occurs
